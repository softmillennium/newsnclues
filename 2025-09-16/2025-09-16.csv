            The Georgia Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear an appeal from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis on her removal from the case prosecuting President Donald Trump and his alleged co-conspirators over their efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
    


            The case against Trump and his co-defendants will be referred to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council in Georgia, according to a statement from Willis. It will be up to the council, a bipartisan collaboration of six district attorneys and three solicitors general from across the state to decide whether a new prosecutor will be appointed to pursue the case.
    


            The council's executive director, Peter Skandalakis, said he would be responsible for appointing a new prosecutor. He told CNN he could also take the case on his own.
    


            The court in a 4-3 decision backed an appeals court's decision to disqualify Willis in December 2024 over her romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she appointed to the case.
    


            Writing for the majority, Justice Andrew Pinson wrote the lower court's decision “does not raise a question of gravity that warrants our further review.”
    


            Justice Carla Wong McMillian wrote the dissenting opinion, saying that guidance from the high court would be “desirable,” given the confusing nature of the case.
    


            Willis said in a statement that she disagreed with the court's decision not to review her appeal, but that she respected the legal process.
    


            “I hope that whoever is assigned to handle the case will have the courage to do what the evidence and the law demand,” she said.
    


            The president, speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, called the ruling “a great decision” and criticized Willis' prosecution as “a rigged case.”
    


            Trump was indicted on state charges in Fulton County in August 2023, the fourth indictment he faced that year. Trump was charged alongside 18 co-defendants on racketeering charges. Willis accused them of participating in a conspiracy to unlawfully change the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia, which Trump lost that year. The president won Georgia last year against then-Vice President Kamala Harris.
    


            Willis, a Democrat, faced mounting scrutiny throughout her grand jury investigation and following the indictment of Trump and his co-defendants.
    


            One of Trump's co-defendants, Michael Roman, moved to dismiss the indictment and disqualify Willis for her romantic relationship with Special Assistant District Attorney Nathan Wade, stating that Willis had a personal financial interest in the case.
    


            Steve Sadow, Trump's lead defense attorney on the case, said Tuesday the high court “correctly denied” allowing Willis to return.
    


            “Willis' misconduct during the investigation and prosecution of President Trump was egregious and she deserved nothing less than disqualification. This proper decision should bring an end to the wrongful political, lawfare persecutions of the President,” Sadow said in a statement.
    


            Chief Justice Nels Peterson did not participate in the decision, and Justice Benjamin Land was disqualified from the decision.

            They gathered in Doha – the leaders of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation – to show support for Qatar in the wake of Israel's strike last week on a meeting of Hamas leaders in the city.
    


            When the summit ended, they issued a wordy communique condemning Israel and reaffirming solidarity with Qatar. Missing in the communique, however, was any concrete action.
    


            It was an exercise in futility, underscoring how great wealth has not translated into real power. That despite the huge strides made by countries like Qatar and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, they are either unable (or unwilling) to do anything to pressure Israel, and its principle backer, the United States, to end the war in Gaza.
    


            How much has changed.
    


            Fifty-two years ago, in October 1973, the oil ministers from the countries that made up the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) met in Kuwait while war raged between Israel, Syria and Egypt and the world teetered on the brink of a nuclear showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union.
    


            In Kuwait, OAPEC ministers, led by Saudi Arabia, decided to cut oil production and impose export restrictions to the United States and others supporting Israel and its war effort. This was the beginning of the Arab oil embargo that helped push Western economies into recession.
    


            The war, which began October 6, 1973 with a coordinated attack by Egypt and Syria on Israeli troops occupying the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula and the Syrian Golan Heights, ended after 19 days. OAPEC's oil weapon played a part in accelerating moves toward a ceasefire.
    


            Yet today, as Israel intensifies its push into Gaza City, as the death toll in Gaza reaches almost 65,000 ( with the majority of casualties being women and children), as a UN commission determines Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, many of the same countries that in 1973 exacted a high price for US support for Israel, have remained largely passive.
    


Gulf states unite to respond to Israel's attack on Qatar, but find few options



            “Arab governments in the past century have not achieved full sovereignty,” explains Rami Khouri, a veteran analyst at the American University of Beirut. “They depend on foreign states for their wellbeing, protection, or survival.”
    


            And ironically, even that dependence hasn't spared them. In 2022, the US designated Qatar as a Major Non-NATO Ally, and Qatar hosts the largest US air base in the Middle East.
    


            At best, the rulers who met in Doha on Monday act as supplicants, relying on the whims of a unpredictable US president to intercede with Israel's leader. “We…expect our strategic partners in the United States to use their influence on Israel in to for it to stop this behavior,” Dubai's state-run Al Bayan newspaper cited Gulf Cooperation Council Secretary General Jasem Mohamed al-Budaiwi as saying. The US “has leverage and influence on Israel, and it's about time this leverage and influence be used.”
    


            Yet such hopes seem to be grounded more in unrealistic expectations than reality. In early August, President Trump quipped “it's up to Israel” what it does in Gaza.
    


            And so, early Tuesday Israeli forces said they began ground operations in Gaza City. The Doha summit communique didn't stop them.

            The State Department has “most certainly been denying visas” to people “celebrating” the murder of Charlie Kirk, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.
    


            The top US diplomat's comments come amid broader threats by the Trump administration to punish alleged “hate speech” after the killing of the president's  ally last week. The moves have raised questions about freedom of speech.
    


            The administration has already been aggressive in its policies to revoke and deny visas, blocking students tied to protests against the war in Gaza, most individuals holding a Palestinian Authority passport, and members of the Palestinian Authority and Palestine Liberation Organization.
    


            Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said last week he had directed consular officials, who are involved in adjudicating visas, to “take appropriate action” against people “praising, rationalizing, or making light of” Kirk's death. He instructed the consular officials to monitor the comments on social media claiming to identify such individuals.
    


            Rubio, in remarks before departing Israel Tuesday morning local time, claimed that the policy “isn't just about Charlie Kirk.”
    


            “If you're a foreigner and you're out there celebrating the assassination of someone who was speaking somewhere, I mean, we don't want you in the country,” he said.
    


            “Why would we want to give a visa to someone who think it's good that someone was murdered in the public square? That's just common sense to me,” he continued.
    


            Rubio did not provide details of how many visas had been denied, how the State Department decided they were “celebrating” Kirk's death, or the authority that was used to block them.
    


            The top US diplomat said he did not know if any visas had been revoked yet, but said he expected that some would be.
    


            “We've got to go at process in all these,” Rubio said. “I'm sure there'll be some that are revoked. There's no shortage of idiots around the world that have decided it's a great idea to murder someone.”
    


            “By the way, it's bad that we have people that are US citizens that feel that way,” he said.
    


            Domestically, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the government will “target” those it deems to have used hateful speech.
    


            “We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech, anything, and that's across the aisle,” she said on a podcast.
    


            Bondi argued in a post on X that “hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment.”

The US lacks new drone tactics and production capacity to build at scale and is playing ‘catch up,' CNN reported on Monday, citing an army general.

Both Russia and Ukraine are now producing hundreds of thousands or even millions of drones annually for reconnaissance, close air support, and long-range strikes.

The US military, however, was utterly unprepared to rapidly produce small, cheap drones, as the industry has for years focused on large, expensive systems such as jets and tanks, the article said, adding that the Pentagon is “rushing to catch up”, including by 3D printing drones and organizing training on simulators.

One of the key issues is that US drones cannot include Chinese parts, but domestic alternatives are significantly more costly, the network claimed.

”This is not tomorrow's problem. This is today's problem,” Maj. Gen. Curt Taylor, commander of the U.S. Army's 1st Armored Division, told CNN. “And the first fight of the next war is going to involve more drones than any of us have ever seen.”

Ukraine has offered to assist the US. Vladimir Zelensky has pitched a $50 billion plan to co-produce 10 million drones over five years to US President Donald Trump. Officials in Kiev have described Ukraine's drone expertise as Zelensky's “geopolitical card,” with CNN noting that Ukrainian military leaders have been lecturing NATO on the need to invest in UAVs.

Just last week EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the creation of a drone wall on the bloc's Eastern frontier.

CNN recalled that early into the conflict, the US provided Ukraine with 100 Switchblade loitering munitions, but the deliveries stopped after complaints from Ukrainian troops that they were less effective against Russian electronic warfare.

In July, the New York Times also reported that the US lags behind Russia and China in producing and deploying drones. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth acknowledged the gap, saying: “While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones, we were mired in bureaucratic red tape.”

The UK will deploy some of its Eurofighter Typhoon jets to patrol Polish airspace, Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on Monday.

Poland launched its Iron Defender 25 drills last month, featuring around 30,000 troops, including soldiers from other NATO member states. The Czech Republic has already sent three helicopters to Poland. Spain, Italy, and Sweden have pledged additional support.

The British jets will join French Rafales, German Eurofighters, and Danish F-16s in the coming days as part of NATO's Eastern Sentry drills, the UK government said.

Poland claimed that at least 19 Russian drones entered its airspace on September 9 – allegations that Russian envoy to the UN Security Council Vassily Nebenzia has dismissed as “unfounded.”



Announcing the deployment, Starmer claimed, “These aircraft are not just a show of strength; they are vital in deterring aggression, securing NATO airspace, and protecting our national security and that of our allies.”

Russia and Belarus are set to conclude the Zapad 2025 military exercise on Tuesday, involving around 13,000 troops. US military staff have attended the drills, while Moscow and Minsk have rejected Western accusations that the drill is a rehearsal for an invasion, calling them “hysteria.”

Israel has launched a ground offensive in Gaza City, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced on Tuesday.

Speaking at the opening session of his corruption trial, Netanyahu asked to be excused from testimony due to the “important things happening,” declaring that the IDF “has begun an intensive operation in Gaza City.”

The military later confirmed that two IDF divisions, numbering tens of thousands of troops, had begun expanded ground operations overnight as the army entered a “new stage” of its campaign against Hamas. The IDF said the 162nd and 98th divisions were leading the push and that the 36th division would join in the coming days.

The escalation follows the Israeli Security Cabinet's approval last month of plans to seize Gaza City – one of the few areas not under IDF control – in a move that could pave the way for a full takeover of the Palestinian enclave.

While a ground assault had been anticipated in October, the early phases of the offensive, dubbed ‘Gideon's Chariots B', began weeks ago with intensified strikes on alleged Hamas positions, including high-rise towers, as well as ground raids on the outskirts of Gaza City and several neighborhoods to the west.

Palestinian media reported heavy strikes on Gaza City and its outskirts on Monday night, with some outlets claiming that IDF tanks had entered.

16 September 2025

IDF spokesperson Effie Defrin has characterized Gaza City as the “central hub of Hamas' military and governing power,” accusing the militants of turning the area into the “largest human shield in history.”

“Beneath the streets runs a vast network of tunnels, connecting command centers, rocket launchers, and weapon storage facilities – all deliberately hidden under civilians, in civilian infrastructure,” he said.

Defrin urged Palestinian civilians to stay away from the combat zone, and claimed that the IDF has “expanded humanitarian efforts in Gaza” in recent weeks.

The relatives of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas have staged a protest outside of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem, denouncing his government's decision to launch a new offensive in Gaza City. The activists have vowed that their encampment will remain in place “until Netanyahu listens and implements the people's will.” They expressed concerns that intensifying military activity would put the lives of 20 hostages, believed to still be alive, at grave risk.



UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has denounced the “new IDF assault on Gaza [as] utterly reckless and appalling.”

In a post on X on Tuesday, the British official predicted that the Israeli military onslaught “will only bring more bloodshed, kill more innocent civilians & endanger the remaining hostages.”

Cooper called for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages held in Hamas captivity, and unrestricted humanitarian aid to the densely-populated Palestinian enclave.

US President Donald Trump has said he doesn't “know too much” about Israel's ground offensive in Gaza City, but repeated his earlier warning that if Hamas uses hostages as human shields, the group “will have hell to pay.”

Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said the country's role as mediator in Gaza ceasefire talks has become a lower priority after Israel's strike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha last week.

“We are now focused on protecting our sovereignty and responding to the [Israeli] attack, and on taking all necessary measures to ensure this does not happen again. All other political considerations are currently of secondary importance,” he told reporters at a weekly briefing.

Israel has confirmed bombing Yemen's Hodeidah port. Army spokesman Avichay Adraee said on X that the Israeli Air Force struck the port in response to recent Houthi drone and missile attacks.

He claimed that the group uses the port to transfer military equipment from Iran and said the IDF will “continue to act forcefully” against them.



Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard has condemned Israel's ground operation in Gaza City, saying on X that it “exacerbates an already catastrophic humanitarian situation and leads to widespread forced displacements of the civilian population, which violates international law.”

She said the offensive makes it even more urgent to pressure Israel to end the conflict and called on Brussels to impose sanctions on West Jerusalem and “extremist Israeli ministers.”

At least 59 peole have been killed and 386 others injured by Israeli strikes on Gaza City over the past 24 hours, the Gaza Health Ministry said in a statement on social media.

The death toll since October 7, 2023, has reached at least 64,96 with many more still buried under rubble, according to the ministry. Three more people, including a child, have died from famine and malnutrition, it added.



The Israeli air force has bombed the Yemeni port of Hodeidah, where at least five powerful explosions have been heard, RIA Novosti has reported, citing a local government source.

Unverified footage circulating on social media shows smoke billowing over the port, with the caption claiming airstrikes have targeted three piers.

Yemeni air defenses are confronting Israeli jets carrying out “aggression” against the country, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree has said on X. His statement came after an Israeli army spokesperson announced that the IDF would strike Yemen's Red Sea port of Hodeidah “in the coming hours.”

Election interference case in limbo as court declines to hear appeal against disqualification of Fulton county prosecutor

The Georgia supreme court on Tuesday declined to hear Fani Willis's appeal of a lower court's ruling disqualifying the Fulton county prosecutor from prosecuting Donald Trump's election interference case.

In a 4-3 decision, the state's highest court let stand the lower court order disqualifying Willis from the racketeering and election interference case that initially snagged 19 defendants, including Donald Trump, in 2023.

Georgia's appeals court removed Willis from the case in December 2024, citing the “appearance of impropriety” created by her relationship with former special prosecutor Nathan Wade.

The appellate decision in effect established a new standard in Georgia law for removing a prosecutor from a case, which the Georgia supreme court's decision allows to stand without review.

Trump, while president, is protected from state-level prosecutions, but the other remaining defendants are still subject to prosecution. The case will be reassigned by the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, but it is unclear whether Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the council, will be able to find a prosecutor willing to take up the politically fraught, legally complicated case.

He said he expected the formal process to begin within a month or so. Skandalakis, a district attorney elected by conservative voters outside of metro Atlanta may simply choose to drop the charges against the remaining 14 defendants, rather than risk the backlash of their constituents and the increasingly vocal and retributive ire of the president. But the primary consideration was a matter of capacity, Skandalakis said.

“I have to start looking, today, for a prosecutor to take this case,” Skandalakis said. “You kind of narrow it down to resources – who has the staff – and then you kind of branch out. There are some offices that are too small, that are overrun with cases.”

Willis and attorneys for Trump and other defendants did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A grand jury in Atlanta indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, using the state's anti-racketeering law to accuse them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn Trump's narrow 2020 loss to Joe Biden in Georgia. The alleged scheme included Trump's call to the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, urging him to help find enough votes to beat Biden. Four people have pleaded guilty. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Man accused in killing of Brian Thompson will not face state charges of first- and second-degree murder but will still face other charges

Luigi Mangione scored a major legal victory on Tuesday with a judge dismissing the two top state charges against him: first-degree murder and second-degree murder, both of which prosecutors had argued were terrorism crimes.

Mangione still faces an additional second-degree murder charge, as well as a federal murder charge, in the killing of United HealthCare executive Brian Thompson last December.

The judge overseeing Mangione's state criminal case, Gregory Carro, said “the evidence put forth was legally insufficient” for the two terrorism-related charges, in a written decision that was posted during a 15-minute proceeding in Manhattan court on Tuesday.

“Counts 1 and 2, charging defendant with Murder in the First Degree (in furtherance of an act of terrorism) and Murder in the Second Degree as a Crime of Terrorism, are dismissed as legally insufficient,” Carro wrote. “The People presented legally sufficient evidence of all other counts, including Murder in the Second Degree (intentional).”

Mangione also faces federal charges for allegedly gunning down Thompson outside a hotel, and weapons possession counts.

Mangione's defense had also argued his case should be dismissed for double jeopardy – being prosecuted twice for the same crime – because he was charged with murder in both state and federal court, but the judge rejected that. He pointed to a supreme court decision stipulating that state and federal government are “two sovereigns”, and “where there are two sovereigns, there are two laws, and two offenses”. “Thus, there is no double jeopardy violation,” he wrote.

Carro also rejected the defense's bid to put Mangione's state case on hold so that he could face his federal trial first. Mangione's team has contended that testifying in the state case could harm his defense in the federal death penalty trial, and claimed the timing could violate his right against self-incrimination.

Mangione entered the Manhattan courtroom just before 9.30am, wearing khaki jail scrubs, with handcuffed wrists and shackled ankles. His appearance came six days after the rightwing commentator Charlie Kirk was shot dead during an event at Utah Valley University. The shootings of Thompson and Kirk have prompted highly politicized rhetoric.

Although a motive in Kirk's shooting remains unknown, conservatives have used the incident to call for the investigation of progressive political groups. Donald Trump has demanded the death penalty against the suspected Kirk shooter, Tyler Robinson, and his justice department is seeking the death penalty for Mangione.

The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, called Thompson's killing “a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America”. Bondi said her decision was in step with “Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and make America safe again”.

The killing sparked a contentious public debate about US healthcare that crossed the political aisle, with some praising Mangione and denouncing healthcare companies and many others outraged that a murder would be used to air political grievances.

On Tuesday outside the 100 Centre Street courtroom, as with his prior court appearances, Mangione supporters gathered for a glimpse of him, lining up for courtroom seats and fanning themselves with yellow index cards that guaranteed entry. One woman wore a black T-shirt emblazoned with “FREE LUIGI” and another a white one reading “LUIGI'S PIZZA”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Advocacy groups say Trump and allies' calls for investigations represent attempt to ‘quash dissent'

The president, vice-president and members of Congress have begun calling for the government to investigate progressive organizations in the wake of the Charlie Kirk murder, in terms those targeted say are reminiscent of the House Un-American Activities Committee and the “red scare” of the 1950s.

Donald Trump, speaking to Fox & Friends on Friday, presented “vicious and horrible” radicals on the left of US politics as a roadblock to the country coming together politically after the shooting. On Sunday, he amplified his attack on political enemies by declaring that “a lot of people that you would traditionally say are on the left … [are] already under investigation”.

The posture is being echoed by members of his administration.

“With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the DoJ, Homeland Security, and throughout this government, to identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks,” said Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy, speaking to Vice-President JD Vance while Vance guest-hosted Kirk's podcast Monday. “We will do it in Charlie's name.”

The day after Kirk's murder, 22 members of the House Freedom Caucus sent a letter to the house speaker, asking for the creation of a select committee on “the money, influence, and power behind the radical left's assault on America and the rule of law”.

The letter, echoing commentary from the president and the right, contends that Kirk's murder is of a pattern of “coordinated attack” by “NGOs, donors, media, public officials” and others, attempting to tie together widely distinct incidents , from the February 2024 murder of Georgia college student Laken Riley to the killing last month of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte.

None of the organizations in the letter, nor other prominent organizations on the political left, said they had been contacted by federal law enforcement or Congress in the wake of the Kirk killing. Some, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) or the Open Society Foundations – an organization closely associated with financier George Soros – have been through rounds of rightwing congressional inquiry during Trump's first term.

“We are aware of reports calling for investigations into our founder George Soros and the work of the Open Society Foundations based on unfounded allegations,” a spokesperson at the Open Society Foundations said. “We are a human rights organization that works to strengthen American democracy and uphold the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the US constitution. Our work is in full compliance with US laws.”

The SPLC also said it had not been contacted by the Trump administration. “We must have meaningful national conversation about violence and polarization in America,” an SPLC spokesperson said. “Blaming organizations that monitor extremism distracts from the urgent work of addressing the conditions that allow hate and violence to grow. SPLC remains committed to exposing extremism, equipping communities with knowledge, and defending the rights and safety of marginalized communities.”

Others named in the letter are preparing for fire.

“There is a real cost to these threats from elected officials and their allies with platforms,” said Jessica Brand, founder of the Wren Collective, a non-profit working on criminal justice reform. “They inflict tremendous fear and costs to those on the receiving end. People have to increase security, live with fear of future attacks, and find themselves on the receiving end of vile and terrifying threats. And that's the goal – the purpose of these threats is to silence critics and quash dissent.”

The Wren Collective began drawing attention last week when Fox News and other rightwing media outlets began broadcasting a report by the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund – an organization providing legal support to police officers accused of criminal misconduct – attempting to link the reform nonprofit to policies by progressive district attorneys.

Targeted investigations of organizations on the basis of their political values harks back to McCarthyism, the anti-communist “red scare” of the 50s, said Danaka Katovich, national co-director for Codepink, a feminist anti-war organization founded in 2002 to protest US military intervention and promote peace and social justice. Codepink went through a round of investigations before, to little effect, she said.

“They've launched congressional investigations over Codepink's funding sources that their Democrat colleagues often parrot talking points from,” Katovich said. “Of course, nothing has come of these investigations besides trying to intimidate us from advocating for peace and justice.”

She added: “It's a really critical moment for other organizations to stand in solidarity, loud and clear solidarity, with organizations facing repression. Now's not the time for splitting hairs over smaller disagreements. If they come after one of us they will come after us all.”

The rhetoric isn't new, but the Trump administration has been untethered to political and legal norms that in the past prevented the government from attempting to exercise power over nonprofit groups. A bill to permit the treasury department to eliminate the tax-exempt status of nonprofit it deemed to be supporting terrorism passed in the Republican-controlled house last year, but died in the Senate.

Notably, loud complaints about investigations into conservative nonprofit groups and churches that appeared to be abusing the tax code and legal requirement to avoid using tax-exempt resources for partisan political campaigns has been a recurring theme for Republicans. An attempt to add the language into the president's tax and spending bill was stripped out before passage.

But Katovich highlighted a bill proposed to grant the US secretary of state the power to revoke or refuse to issue passports to American citizens accused of material support for terrorism. The bill will have a hearing this week.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

12:53 JST, September 16, 2025

TOKYO (AP) — Armand “Mondo” Duplantis traded handshakes and hugs with the pole vaulters he'd just beaten to capture his third world championship.

He took a leisurely walk toward the stands to talk to his parents, his brother, his fiancee.

Then, like any great performer in a jam-packed stadium, he turned around, walked back onstage and delivered the encore the people had been waiting for.

It was another world record — the 14th time he's set it — by clearing the bar at 6.30 meters.

Duplantis cleared it on his third and final attempt Monday night in Tokyo. It came more than a half hour after the racing on Day 3 of the championships was wrapped up for the evening. But nobody in the crowd of 53,000 would dare walk out on Mondo. And Mondo made a point of wringing every drop of drama out of an experience few in that crowd will soon forget.

“To be able to enjoy this world record with them and give them that is super special,” Duplantis said. “Especially considering the last time I was in this stadium, we didn't have any spectators. It was spooky and eerie and super weird, and not very fun, honestly.”

The night of his last performance at Japan National Stadium was during the COVID Olympics, held a year late in 2021 and without any fans. Duplantis settled for “only” the gold medal that time and missed the world record. The difference, he suspects, was the energy missing during those silent Games.

This time, there was noise and fun — the people clapping in rhythm every time Duplantis lined up — and like any great artist, Mondo knew how to play to the crowd.

After clearing 6.10, for instance, he imitated Japanese baseball Hall of Famer Ichiro Suzuki's pre-bat sleeve-tugging routine.

“My brother was in the crowd and he plays baseball, so I was trying to fire him up,” Duplantis said. “And the Japanese people, if they understood it, it was just something fun.”

The Louisiana-born phenom who competes for his mother's native Sweden collected $70,000 for the win — his 49th straight dating to September 2022 — along with the $100,000 bonus that goes to record breakers at world championships.

The money isn't the main motivation for a champion who has won every major title — worlds and Olympics — since the Tokyo Games.

“It's doing what I know I'm capable of,” Duplantis said. “Motivation-wise, it's not that much of a problem. I know the level I can compete at, and I kind of demand that out of myself.”

It's hard to blame the crowd for expecting it, too. Duplantis started breaking records on Feb. 8, 2020, and has broken them on three continents and, now, in nine counties. This latest feat puts the height at an even 6.30.

“Six-three sounds really nice, really clean, a new barrier for our sport,” he said. “It sounds better than 6.29, for sure.”

But maybe not as good as 6.31.

Duplantis has, in fact, wondered if 6.5 might be in his future.

At this rate, it would take another few years. The good news is, he's 25 and, for comparison, the great Sergey Bubka, who won six straight world titles through the 1980s and '90s, was 31 when he broke the record for the 17th and final time.

Bubka's final record was 6.14, and after France's Renaud Lavillenie topped that once, Duplantis took over. He has improved the record by one centimeter every time, giving him maximum opportunities to pocket bonuses like the one he'll receive from World Athletics for this one.

“What Mondo has in spades is what every pole vaulter is trying to achieve,” said Sam Kendricks, the fourth-place finisher who is the last man not named Duplantis to win a world title (in 2019). “He's got a jump, he's got the jets. He's got a family that really supports him, and then he's got a field of guys that's really pushing him up there.”

Ukrainian forces struck the Saratov oil refinery overnight on Sept. 16, causing explosions and a fire at the facility, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

The news comes as Kyiv escalates its campaign against Russian oil and gas infrastructure, a key source of Moscow's revenues helping to fuel its all-out invasion of Ukraine.

The Saratov refinery produces over 20 types of petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, fuel oil, bitumen, and more.

The facility, whose processing volume amounted to 4.8 million metric tons in 2023, helps supply the Russian military, according to Ukraine's General Staff.

The attack was reportedly carried out in cooperation between Ukraine's Special Operations Forces and other branches. The consequences of the attack are being determined.

The Saratov refinery lies in southwestern Russia, roughly 150 kilometers (100 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan and nearly 600 kilometers (370 miles) east of the front line in Ukraine.

The facility has been targeted by Ukrainian forces before, including on Aug. 10 when the Rosneft-run refinery was reportedly forced to halt operations.

Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin said overnight that emergency services were on full alert due to a potential drone attack, without commenting on the consequences.

Russian air defenses intercepted 87 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 18 over Saratov Oblast, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

The attack on the refinery comes as Russia faces a mounting gasoline shortage, exacerbated by Ukrainian strikes on oil infrastructure.

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) carried out explosions in Russia's Vladivostok as a ""revenge operation"" targeting troops accused of war crimes, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 16.

Vladivostok, a major port on the Sea of Japan near China, lies about 6,000 kilometers (3,730 miles) east of Ukraine, making it one of Russia's most distant cities from the war's front lines.

The operation struck the 47th Airborne Assault Battalion of the 155th Guards Marine Brigade, stationed in the village of Shchitovaya in Russia's Primorsky Krai. 

According to the source, the battalion fought in near Kyiv, Vuhledar, Mariupol, Kursk, and Pokrovsk, and was accused of brutality against civilians and executing Ukrainian prisoners of war. 

The source reported powerful blasts in the parking lot of a military facility, followed by a second explosion. Russian media said emergency services and a helicopter were dispatched to the scene.

Authorities fenced off administrative buildings and parking zones and started inspecting vehicles.

""We are waiting for obituaries to appear in the media outlets of Vladivostok,"" the source said.

Local officials said the explosions were caused by a gas equipment malfunction, adding that ""there were no casualties, though several vehicles suffered minor damage.""

This comes as the second operation of its kind this year. In May, HUR carried out explosions near Vladivostok, also targeting Russia's 47th Airborne Assault Battalion, an intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent at the time.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russia rarely discloses its military losses publicly.

Ukraine has previously carried out targeted sabotage operations deep inside Russian territory, hitting military logistics, fuel depots, and infrastructure critical to Moscow's war effort.

Trump's lawyers say the publications have harmed Trump's business and personal reputation.Annabelle Gordon/Reuters

U.S. President Donald Trump has filed a US$15-billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times and book publisher Penguin Random House, his latest legal assault on major media companies he accuses of treating him unfairly.

The lawsuit filed on Monday in Florida federal court centers on a book about Trump by two New York Times reporters and three “false, malicious, defamatory, and disparaging” articles that he says were aimed at sabotaging his chances in the 2024 presidential election.

In a statement on Tuesday, the Times said Trump's lawsuit has no legitimate legal claims and is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting.

“This is a meritless lawsuit,” said a Penguin Random House spokesperson. “Penguin Random House stands by the book and its authors and will continue to uphold the values of the First Amendment that are fundamental to our role as a book publisher.”

Trump receives $16-million from Paramount in lawsuit settlement

U.S. law makes it difficult for public figures like Trump to prevail in defamation cases, requiring them to prove defendants published information they knew or should have known was false.

Trump has nonetheless mounted a flurry of legal attacks against major media outlets during his second term, including a US$10-billion defamation case against the Wall Street Journal in July. In his Monday lawsuit, Trump accused the New York Times and Penguin Random House of maliciously publishing articles and a book filled with “repugnant distortions and fabrications about President Trump.”

The lawsuit cites three articles, including an editorial prior to the 2024 election saying Trump was unfit for office, and a 2024 book titled Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father's Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success, which was written by two Times reporters and published by Penguin Random House.

Trump sues Wall Street Journal, Rupert Murdoch for Epstein birthday letter coverage

Those publications harmed Trump's business and personal reputation, thereby causing massive economic damage to his brand value and significant damage to his future financial prospects, Trump's lawyers said in a court filing.

The filing comes after Trump threatened last week to sue the New York Times for its reporting on an allegedly sexually suggestive note and drawing given to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and sex offender who died by suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019.

Trump has said he parted ways with Epstein before the financier's legal troubles became public in 2006.

Trump has intensified his legal attacks on the media during his second term.

In July, Trump sued the Wall Street Journal and its owners for US$10-billion over the newspaper's coverage of Trump's ties to Epstein. The Journal has said the lawsuit is meritless.

Also in July, CBS parent company Paramount agreed to give US$16-million to Trump's presidential library to settle his lawsuit alleging that the CBS news program 60 Minutes deceptively edited an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris to boost the Democrat's chances in the 2024 election.

And in December, ABC News agreed to give US$15-million to Trump's library to settle a lawsuit over comments that anchor George Stephanopoulos made on air involving sex abuse claims brought against Trump by writer E. Jean Carroll.

U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook sued President Donald Trump and the Fed in late August.Mark Schiefelbein/The Associated Press

A U.S. appeals court declined on Monday to allow Donald Trump to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook – the first time a president has pursued such action since the central bank's founding in 1913 – in the latest step in a legal battle that threatens the Fed's longstanding independence.

The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit means that Cook can for now remain at the Fed ahead of its policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday where it is expected to cut U.S. interest rates to shore up a cooling labour market.

The D.C. Circuit denied the Justice Department's request to put on hold a judge's order temporarily blocking the Republican president from removing Cook, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden. The administration is expected to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The decision was 2-1, with Circuit Judges Bradley Garcia and J. Michelle Childs in the majority, both of whom were appointed by President Joe Biden. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas, a Trump appointee, dissented.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb had ruled on Sept. 9 that Trump's claims that Cook committed mortgage fraud before taking office, which Cook denies, likely were not sufficient grounds for removal under the law that created the Fed.

A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Opinion: The markets will burn as Trump fiddles with the Fed

In setting up the Fed, Congress included provisions to shield the central bank from political interference. Under the law that created the Fed, its governors may be removed by a president only “for cause,” though the law does not define the term nor establish procedures for removal. No president has ever removed a Fed governor, and the law has never been tested in court.

Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, sued Trump and the Fed in late August. Cook has said the claims did not give Trump the legal authority to remove her and were a pretext to fire her for her monetary policy stance.

The Trump administration has argued that the president has broad discretion to determine when it is necessary to remove a Fed governor, and that courts lack the power to review those decisions.

The case has ramifications for the Fed's ability to set interest rates without regard to the wishes of politicians, widely seen as critical to any central bank's ability to function independently to carry out tasks such as keeping inflation under control.

Trump this year has demanded that the Fed cut rates aggressively, berating Fed Chair Jerome Powell for his stewardship over monetary policy. The Fed, focusing on fighting inflation, has not done so, though it is expected this week to make a cut.

The Supreme Court this year has allowed Trump to proceed with the removal of various officials serving on federal agencies that had been established by Congress as independent from direct presidential control.

But in a May order in a case involving Trump's dismissal of two Democratic members of federal labour boards, the Supreme Court signalled that it views the Fed as distinct from other executive branch agencies. It said the Fed “is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity” with a singular historical tradition.

The Trump administration in a court filing on Thursday had asked the D.C. Circuit to move quickly so that Trump could remove Cook before the Fed's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. Administration lawyers said that allowing the president to fire Cook would “strengthen, not diminish, the Federal Reserve's integrity.”

Cook's lawyers in a filing in response said removing Cook ahead of the meeting would impact U.S. and foreign markets, and that the public interest in keeping her in office outweighed Trump's efforts to take control of the Fed.

In blocking Cook's removal, the judge found that the “best reading” of the 1913 law is that it only allows a Fed governor to be removed for misconduct while in office. The mortgage fraud claims against Cook all relate to actions she took prior to her U.S. Senate confirmation in 2022.

Trump and his appointee William Pulte, the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, have claimed that Cook inaccurately described three separate properties on mortgage applications, which could have allowed her to obtain lower interest rates and tax credits.

A loan estimate for an Atlanta home purchased by Cook shows that she had declared the property as a “vacation home,” according to a document reviewed by Reuters, information that would appear to undercut the allegations against her. And the property tax authority in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said in response to a Reuters inquiry that Cook has not broken rules for tax breaks on a home there that Cook had declared her primary residence.

The finding, which came in response to a Reuters request that the city review Cook's property records, could boost Cook's defence against efforts by the Trump administration to remove her from the Federal Reserve board.

Trump's Justice Department also has launched a criminal mortgage fraud probe into Cook, and has issued grand jury subpoenas out of both Georgia and Michigan, according to documents seen by Reuters and a source familiar with the matter.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","India, EU near trade deal amid global turmoil","https://www.dw.com/en/india-eu-near-trade-deal-amid-global-turmoil/a-74014445","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:04:08 GMT","

A free trade agreement between the EU and India seems to be nearing the finish line. With the uncertainty over US tariffs, experts say both stand to gain from concluding the deal by the end of the year.

India and the European Union (EU) appear to be firmly on track to meet their year-end deadline to conclude free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations.

The talks are progressing against the backdrop of the pressure being exerted by the US tariffs. Washington's approach under President Donald Trump has signaled a shift in the international order, encouraging the EU and India to cement reliable alliances and stable trade partnerships.

""We are now maximizing our efforts to finalize negotiations by the end of the year,"" said European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic, who was on a visit to India last week.

Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal was similarly optimistic: ""India and the EU complement each other and offer great opportunities on both sides.""

After constructive talks with Goyal, Commissioner for Agriculture and Food Christophe Hansen stressed the commitment to secure ""a balanced EU-India FTA that delivers for people, farmers and businesses on both sides,"" highlighting agriculture's central role in the negotiations.

Although the talks appear to be moving toward the finish line, Gulshan Sachdeva, an EU expert from Jawaharlal Nehru University, remains cautious.

""While statements from both sides reflect growing optimism, the India-EU trade deal is not done until it is truly done,"" Sachdeva told DW.

Negotiations on the FTA between India and the EU resumed in 2022, nearly a decade after initial attempts were suspended in 2013. In the past two years, there have been 13 rounds of talks, with the 14th scheduled to take place in Brussels between October 6-10.

For India, clinching this FTA means tariff-free entry for key exports, reducing dependency on volatile US markets, and enhancing its stature as Europe's primary Asian partner. 

And for the EU, sealing the deal diversifies supply chains, secures agricultural and tech trade, and strengthens its geopolitical leverage in the Indo-Pacific.

Experts point out that the timing of the negotiations has raised the stakes, especially with India being hit by US protectionism and needing new, robust export pathways.

The US has imposed a 50% tariff on goods from India, which includes a 25% penalty for its continued purchases of Russian oil.

It is estimated that the current tariffs could affect roughly half of India's nearly $87 billion (€74.7 billion) worth of annual exports to the US.

""In the current phase, shifting global and Asian geopolitics, coupled with the weaponization of tariffs by the Trump administration, are pushing both towards greater compromises to finally seal the deal,"" Sachdeva explained.

Anil Wadhwa, a former Indian diplomat, told DW that Trump's tariffs have created unpredictability and unreliability in the India-US trade partnership and has eroded trust, creating a chasm which will take a long time to fill.

""Indian labor-intensive industries also need an outlet in the long term as well as diversification to sustain jobs at the lower end. Besides, there is a lot to gain from the India-EU trade relationship. Investment flows and manufacturing are part of the package,"" Wadhwa said.

He points out that the EU is also looking to diversify and enter the Indian market due to its predictability, size, democratic similarities, rule of law and similar outlooks on data governance, artificial intelligence, and data issues.

Ummu Salma Bava, chairperson and Jean Monnet Chair at the Centre for European Studies in Jawaharlal Nehru University, told DW that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's visit in February underlined a sense of urgency.

Von der Leyen said in her speech then that it is time to take their partnership ""to the next level"" for their security, prosperity and ""the common global challenges that we face.""

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul's visit this month gave further momentum to the talks, said Bava. She pointed to an unprecedented level of political engagement between the two sides — a clear sign to the shifting political pressures triggered by Washington under Trump.

Another delegation of the EU's Political and Security Committee (PSC) was also in India last week to discuss key foreign policy, security, and defense-related matters in the lead up to the EU-India summit in 2026.

""Europe has been, and will remain, a key partner in India's ambitious modernization journey through trade, investment, and technology,"" Sachdeva said.

""At the same time, India's large and expanding economy, with several globally competitive sectors, holds strong appeal for Europe,"" he added.

According to the European Commission, the EU is currently India's second-largest trading partner, with trade in goods worth €120 billion ($141 billion) last year, or 11.5% of India's total trade. 

However, negotiations between Delhi and Brussels ""remain challenging,"" as they are ""tough bargainers,"" according to Sachdeva.

The EU is seeking tariff reductions on vehicles, wine, spirits, and dairy products, whereas India is focused on securing expanded market access for its textiles, pharmaceuticals, steel, and petroleum products.

Former diplomat Wadhwa noted that one sticking point is the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) — a new carbon tariff system that requires importers to pay for the carbon emissions generated in producing certain goods like steel, fertilizers, aluminium, and electricity brought into the EU.

""Resolving market access, agricultural tariffs, and CBAM is pivotal for unlocking greater trade volume, safeguarding Indian industry, and ensuring EU climate goals do not penalize Indian exporters unfairly,"" he said.

Bava told DW a breakthrough is expected in the auto sector, with European car manufacturers gaining more access to the Indian market while boosting Indian companies' access to European markets for automobile parts.

Mohan Kumar, a former Indian envoy to France, explained that both the EU and India are trying to mitigate the geopolitical risks arising from Trump's tariffs and transactional approach to foreign policy.

The US leader upped the ante again this month, telling the EU to impose 100% tariffs on India as well as China as part of Trump's so far unsuccessful attempts to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.

""There is strategic convergence between the two players to get the FTA done before the end of this year,"" Kumar said.

The Israeli leader said his country must prepare for ""some sort"" of isolation, partly blaming it on Muslims in Europe. Meanwhile, Arab and Islamic states have called for preventive action against Israel.

This blog has closed. Thank you for reading.

Here is a roundup of developments in Israel's war in Gaza and the wider Middle East region on Monday, September 15:

US President Donald Trump said Monday that he was not informed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of Israel's attack in Qatar last week.

Asked if Netanyahu had alerted him that Israel was planning the strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar, Trump said, ""No, no, they didn't."" 

Trump's comments came after an Axios report said that Netanyahu had informed the US president shortly before the strike.

The Trump administration, however, has said it was notified only after missiles were already in flight, giving Trump no chance to respond.

After the report, the Israeli prime minister's office reiterated that last Tuesday's strike targeting Hamas political leaders in Qatar was a ""wholly independent"" Israeli operation.

In the wake of Israel's airstrike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Arab and Muslim leaders called for ""all possible legal and effective measures to prevent Israel from continuing its actions against the Palestinian people.""

They made the call after an emergency meeting of the leaders of 57 Arab and Islamic states in Qatar's capital.

The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, which held its own meeting on the sidelines of the summit, decided to take steps ""to activate the mechanisms of joint defense and the Gulf deterrence. ""

The Gulf states also urged the US to use its influence to rein in Israel. 

""They have leverage and influence on Israel, and it's about time that this leverage and influence be used,"" the Gulf Cooperation Council Secretary General, Jasem Mohamed Al-Budaiwi, said.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Israel on Monday, will head to Qatar next to voice ""America's full support for Qatar's security and sovereignty,"" the US State Department said.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called for Israel and Russia to be barred from international sports competitions, citing what he described as ""barbaric acts"" in Gaza and Ukraine.

He expressed ""deep admiration"" for thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters who forced the Vuelta e Espana cycle race's final stage to be abandoned.

The protesters repeatedly targeted the race because of the participation of the Israel-Premier Tech team.

""Our position is clear and categorical: as long as the barbarity continues, neither Russia nor Israel should participate in any international competition,"" Sanchez said.

Cycling's global governing body, UCI, said it ""regretted"" the Spanish government's support for the protests and it ""could call into question Spain's ability to host major international sporting events.""

Germany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier condemned the cancellation of a concert by Israeli conductor Lahav Shani in Belgium as ""blatant antisemitism.""

Last week, organizers of the Flanders Festival Ghent in Belgium said the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra would no longer perform on September 18 as planned due to concerns surrounding conductor Laha Shani.

In a statement, the organizers said they were ""unable to provide sufficient clarity about his [Shani's] attitude"" towards the Israeli government, which they referred to as a ""genocidal regime.""

The decision has drawn international criticism, including from Belgium's Prime Minister and Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

On Monday, Steinmeier hosted Shani in Berlin ahead of a performance of the Munich Philharmonic in the city in the evening. 

Born in Tel Aviv in 1989, Lahav Shani is considered one of classical music's brightest young stars. He is a conductor, pianist and double bassist.

Though he is already directing concerts with the Munich Philharmonic, he will officially become the new chief conductor of the German orchestra starting in September 2026. 

The Qatari ambassador to Berlin said his country is ""evaluating the situation"" following the Israeli strike in Doha that targeted several members of Palestinian militant group Hamas that reside in the city.

In a conversation with DW, ambassador Abdulla Al Hamar said Qatar is a ""very small, peaceful"" country that was hit by a ""barbaric"" Israeli attack, while trying to ""help release the (Israeli hostages).""

""That what we've been rewarded with from the Netanyahu government,"" he said.

Al Hamar also warned the mediation efforts could be harmed due to the anger felt by the Qatari people after the Israeli attack.

The diplomat also praised the ties between Qatar and the US, and expressed hope that Washington will tell Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel's strike on Qatar is unacceptable.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his country's decision to launch an airstrike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar.

Almost a week after the Israeli strike in Doha, there has been no confirmation that any of the strike's targets was killed as a result, with Hamas saying its targeted leaders are all still alive.

""I don't accept the premise that the attack failed,"" Netanyahu said at a joint press conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

According to Netanyahu, the attack's purpose was to ""send out a message to terrorists: You can run, but we'll get you.""

""Terrorists should not have immunity, wherever they are,"" Netanyahu said, comparing the Israeli attack to US strikes targeting Al Qaeda head Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan.

The Israeli strike in Qatar resulted in widespread condemnations from around the world.

Jean-Guy Vataux, Head of Mission for Gaza from Doctors Without Borders says the situation in Gaza is ""hell,"" especially with the Israeli military's operation increasing in scale.

""Most of the movements we ask for at the moment have been denied by the Israeli army,"" he says.

Looking ahead, with the Israeli operation in Gaza City looming, Vataux says the hundreds of thousands to move to the enclave's southern parts threaten to collapse the area's health system as a whole.

""Gaza is the most dangerous place in the world for humanitarian action,"" he told DW, adding that the Gaza residents who go towards the south, as asked by Israel, will not have enough supplies and hospital beds.

""We're facing a real disaster in terms of provision of healthcare,"" he said. There is not enough water, food, or shelter available in the south for the people fleeing, Givateau added.

""In the south, all the hospitals are [already] overwhelmed,"" he said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel must prepare ""for some sort of (international) isolation.""

Netanyahu was quoted by Israeli media as saying the country will need to be ready for ""getting more and more used to an economy with autarkic (self-sufficient) aspects.""

""We will need to develop our weapon industry here… We don't have a choice,"" Netanyahu said.

The Israeli leader also said Europe's Muslim population would be party responsible for Israel's isolation.

""We live in a very challenging world. The Muslims who immigrated to Europe have become a significant, vocal minority. It bends local governments on Gaza,"" he said.

Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid criticised Netanyahu for his statement, saying the Israeli leader is responsible for the country's diplomatic issues.

""Netanyahu's statement that Israel is entering (international) isolation… is a mad statement,"" Lapid said, adding that Netanyahu and the Israeli government are turning Israel into a ""third world country.""
 

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Hamas ""feels emboldened"" by the announcement of several Western countries to recognize Palestinian statehood at the UN General Assembly in New York next week.

According to Rubio, Hamas ""walked away from agreements that they actually had tacitly agreed to"" due to what he called ""the international support they believe they're getting.""

The recognition of Palestine is ""largely symbolic"" and has ""no impact whatsoever about bringing us any closer to a Palestinian state,"" Rubio said.

The US diplomat spoke at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netnayahu in Jerusalem.

The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is continuing his visit to Israel in the wake of the Israeli attack on Hamas officials in Qatar, and multiple countries are expected to acknowledge Palestinian statehood at the UN General Assembly next week.

We are also looking at the situation in the Gaza Strip as the Israeli military offensive in Gaza City continues to expand.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Why TV weather forecasters are receiving online hate","https://www.dw.com/en/why-tv-weather-forecasters-are-receiving-online-hate/a-73895300","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 07:37:31 GMT","

An email death threat marked the beginning of the end of one meteorologist's job. Experts say climate misinformation and conspiracy theories are fueling online hate.

One morning, Chris Gloninger opened his emails to find a message from a viewer asking for his home address, saying they wanted to give him a welcome he would remember.

""My heart raced, and I felt paralyzed,"" said Gloninger, who at the time was presenting the weather on a TV station in Des Moines, in the Midwestern US state of Iowa.

The email referenced the case of a man who had been arrested for attempted murder of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, after showing up at his house with a gun and zip ties.

For Gloninger, it was the final straw after a string of harassment since taking the job as chief meteorologist. He called the police and rushed to a hotel with his wife. 

As some of the most visible faces of climate change communication, TV weather forecasters have come to face heat from the rise in misinformation and conspiracies fueling online hate. 

Viewing climate change as the most important issue of our time, Gloninger had actively championed its prominent inclusion in his TV work.

After taking the Des Moines job, he tailored coverage to the more climate-skeptical leanings of Iowa, a state which been a conservative stronghold since the first election of President Donald Trump in 2016. He tried to link it to everyday experiences such as how drought might impact farmers in the largely agricultural area. 

It was then that the emails started arriving in his inbox — at first the usual pushback and then ramping up to more aggressive threats. He noticed viewers were politicizing the science.

""They were saying, we're tired of this liberal agenda,"" said Gloninger. ""It should never be about politics, because this is a science that has the support of 99% of its academic community.""

Today, climate misinformation and conspiracies are rampant online. This is despite overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is causing more extreme weather that will only further escalate as global temperatures continue to rise. 

The roots of this can be traced back to the middle of the last century. Despite major fossil fuel companies uncovering the link between burning coal, oil and gas and global heating as early as the 1960s, many pursued an active strategy of denial and playing down the science. 

But as glaciers have melted, sea levels have risen and dangerous weather has intensified, that denial has become a harder sell. So instead, experts say misinformation has shape-shifted into a form of ""delayism"" — either by casting doubt on climate solutions or greenwashing companies to give the false impression that they are environmentally friendly. 

Research in 2024 showed how fossil fuel and petrochemical companies spent millions on advertising that included misleading claims about their commitment to renewable energy. The sector actually spends just 1% of global investment on clean power and is actively exploring new oil and gas fields.

The networks behind climate misinformation have become very intricate, said Ece Elbeyi, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.

It not only involves those with a vested interest in slowing climate action working with lobbyists and think tanks, but can include media outlets, trolls, Russian bot-farms, and influencers amplifying misinformation on social media platforms, where algorithms favor emotionally charged messaging.

Political actors, particularly those with nationalist or conservative platforms, have exploited misinformation to mobilize their base, said Elbeyi. ""They might not explicitly deny climate change, but they frame climate solutions, like for instance international agreements or carbon regulations, as threats to national sovereignty or economic freedom.""

Rallying against climate action has become an identity issue and therefore more difficult to challenge, said Elbeyi. Political identity, they added, is one reason a person might share misinformation or send angry messages to someone like Gloninger. 

Sometimes misinformation can veer into wild conspiracy theories, which can be particularly attractive to people with high levels of paranoia, insecurity or egocentricity, explained Daniel Jolley, an associate professor in psychology at the University of Nottingham.

Jolley said conspiracies can often make people feel more valued or comforted by painting another powerful group as ""evil,"" adding that they often spike after disasters. 

In the wake of deadly flash flooding in Texas this summer, conspiracies surged online accusing scientists and government agencies of causing the disaster by manipulating the weather using cloud seeding.

""People are trying to explain issues that are massive, issues that make us feel uncertain, anxious and perilous,"" said Jolley. 

Jolley expects that because our climate is changing, misinformation and weather conspiracies will become increasingly prominent. 

Meteorologists are among the most visible when it comes to communicators of climate science and therefore often come to bear the brunt of attacks, he said. 

Both Jolley and Elbeyi see education as key to identifying misinformation.

Elbeyi said this must involve vulnerable groups in debates because the misinformation tends to thrive when groups feel decisions are made without, or even against, them. ""And this exclusion can directly erode public trust in scientists and science more generally.""

When it comes to conspiracy theories, building trust and being empathetic to why people may have those beliefs is a better tactic than debunking, said Jolley. He said support is also needed for those, like Gloninger, on the receiving end of abuse. 

In the aftermath of the death threat, Gloninger sought therapy and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder — or PTSD. He couldn't sleep and his health deteriorated, leading to a skin condition.

The police caught the perpetrator and fined him $150 (€129). Meanwhile, back at the TV station, Gloninger continued his work. But after management received a flood of emails from what he calls a loud minority, he was told to stop mentioning climate change.

Gloninger made the choice to leave his job rather than stay and ignore climate change. He said he still finds the decision hard to talk about. 

Yet he did feel he made some impact in bringing climate change awareness to a new, conservative audience. He has kept a large folder filled with positive messages from viewers. 

He thinks it would be a mistake if climate communicators and weather reporters backed off now because of online hate. 

""I do think that there's less coverage of climate change because of the fear of retaliation,"" said Gloninger ""And I encourage meteorologists to double down.""

Donald Trump has led tributes to Robert Redford, saying there was “nobody better” than the actor at the height of his career.

The star of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and All the President's Men died this morning at his home, aged 89.

Cindi Berger, Redford's publicist, said he had passed away in his sleep “at Sundance in the mountains of Utah – the place he loved, surrounded by those he loved”.

Informed of the news by reporters, Mr Trump said: “Well, that's a good way to go, I guess.”

He added: “Robert Redford was great. He had a series of years that there was nobody better.”

The US president could not single out his favourite Redford film, saying: “I'd say he made seven or eight great movies. There was a period of time when he was the hottest. I thought he was great.”

Meryl Streep, who appeared with Redford in Out of Africa and Lions for Lambs, also paid tribute, saying: “One of the lions has passed. Rest in peace my lovely friend.”

Redford was one of Hollywood's great leading men, coming to prominence in the late 1960s.

He starred alongside Paul Newman in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in 1969 and with Barbra Streisand in the 1973 film The Way We Were, establishing himself as a heartthrob.

The actor also had leading roles in The Sting, for which he earned an Oscar nomination, and The Great Gatsby.

Redford was never comfortable with the focus on his looks or with Hollywood fame, and in the early 1970s bought land in Utah where he built a family home to maintain his privacy.

Behind the camera, he won two Oscars for Best Director and Best Picture for Ordinary People in 1980. He was also awarded an honorary Oscar in 2001.

In 1981, he founded the Sundance Film Institute. Its festival shines a light on new filmmakers and was instrumental in launching the careers of directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Darren Aronofsky.

His later films included roles in A River Runs Through It (1992), which he also directed, Indecent Proposal (1993) and All Is Lost (2013).

In 2017 he reunited with Jane Fonda, his co-star in Neil Simon's Barefoot in the Park 50 years earlier, to play widowed neighbours who fall in love in Our Souls At Night.

Redford effectively retired from acting in 2018 after starring in The Old Man & The Gun, where he played escape artist Forrest Tucker, although he later made a series of cameo appearances.

In 2023, he reprised his role as journalist Bob Woodward to make an uncredited appearance in White House Plumbers, an HBO television series about the Watergate scandal.

Redford was politically active throughout his life, campaigning for the environment and advocating for Native American rights.

While he initially welcomed Trump's run for the presidency as a way of shaking up US politics, he wrote in 2019: “It is painfully clear we have a president who degrades everything he touches, a person who does not understand (or care?) that his duty is to defend our democracy.”

Recommended

Redford married Lola Van Wagenen in 1958, with whom he had four children. The couple later divorced and he married his long-term girlfriend Sibylle Szaggars in 2009.

Scott Redford, his eldest son, died when he was just a couple of months old and is buried in Provo, Utah. James Redford, his second son, was an activist and filmmaker who died from cancer in 2020.

Of his two surviving children, Amy is an actress and filmmaker and Shauna is a painter and artist.

			After shooting of Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump may designate far-Left group Antifa as a terror organisation

The White House is cracking down on Left-wing “terrorist” organisations following the killing of Charlie Kirk.

Donald Trump said he would consider designating Antifa as a terror group, while one of the US president's senior strategists said the administration would “destroy” Left-wing organisations.

Last week's killing of Mr Kirk by a gunman accused of radicalised views has prompted many Republicans to warn of rising Left-wing extremism in the US.

It came after a rise in violence against officials across the political spectrum, including the shootings of two Minnesota Democratic politicians last year, as well as several attempts to assassinate Mr Trump.

However, Democrats have accused Mr Trump and his allies of trying to exploit Mr Kirk's death, using it as a pretext to launch attacks on political opponents and consolidate power.

Asked about designating Antifa, the Left-wing US group, as a terror organisation during a question-and-answer session with reporters in the Oval Office, Mr Trump said: “I would do that, 100 per cent. Antifa is terrible.”

Speaking on a memorial edition of The Charlie Kirk Show – hosted by JD Vance, the vice-president – Stephen Miller, Mr Trump's deputy chief of staff, vowed to “disrupt, dismantle and destroy” Left-wing groups that organise political violence

“We are going to channel all of the anger that we have over the organised campaign that led to this assassination, to uproot and dismantle these terrorist networks,” he said.

“With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the department of justice, homeland security, and throughout this government, to identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people.

“It will happen and we will do it in Charlie's name.”

Mr Vance said national unity was “impossible” with those who are celebrating Mr Kirk's death.

“I'm desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend,” he said on the programme, which was broadcast from the White House.

“I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”

Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator, raised concerns that the Trump administration was using the assassination to crack down on its critics.

He said in a video posted online that Mr Trump could have taken the opportunity to “confront political violence”.

Instead, he said, the US president “appears to be preparing to use the shooting as a pretext to destroy his political opposition and consolidate power”.

Mr Murphy said: “Maga just sees this as an opportunity to do what they've always wanted to do: use the legal system that they control to destroy opposition to Trump so that he and his allies can rule uncontested.”

Tyler Robinson, 22, was arrested on Friday for the killing of Mr Kirk. Casings from an abandoned weapon were said by the FBI to have been inscribed with messages including: “Hey fascist! Catch!” and “Bella Ciao”, an Italian Second World War anti-fascist song.

Speaking from the Oval Office, Mr Trump said he thought that Mr Robinson had been radicalised on the internet and “went bad very quickly”.

The US president vowed to dismantle the “radical Left”, which he said was “directly responsible for the terrorism that we are seeing in the country today”.

It has since emerged that Mr Robinson was in a relationship with his transgender roommate, and that he allegedly penned a note saying he planned to take Mr Kirk “out”.

The “Antifa” movement gets its name from a short form of “anti-fascist”. Its stated goal is to resist the spread of fascism.

Antifa activists generally view fascism as the violent enforcement of social and biological inequalities. The movement, however, can be disorganised and consists of various factions with differing interpretations.

One of its best-known tactics is to appear in a mass protest as a “black bloc”, with members moving with military precision in black clothing as they launch attacks.

Christopher Wray, Mr Trump's previous FBI director, said in testimony in 2020 that Antifa was an ideology, not an organisation, lacking the hierarchical structure that would usually allow it to be designated as a terror group by the federal government.

Mr Trump also unveiled more details of his measures to combat crime in Memphis, Tennessee. He said he would send a task force that was a “replica” of the one he sent into the US capital, Washington DC, in August.

“The effort will include the National Guard as well as the FBI” and other federal agencies, Mr Trump said, adding that it was “very important because of the crime that's going on”.

A judge in New York City on Tuesday threw out a pair of charges against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December of last year while he walked down a street in Manhattan.

Judge Gregory Carro did not throw out the entirety of the murder charges against Mangione, but said two of the most serious charges — murder in the first degree as a crime of terrorism and a second-degree charge related to terrorism — were not proven by the prosecution's case presented to a grand jury.

The judge indicated that just because Mangione may have been motivated by ideological opposition to the for-profit industry, that does not de facto make it terrorism under New York statute.

“While the defendant was clearly expressing an animus toward UHC, and the health care industry generally, it does not follow that his goal was to ‘intimidate and coerce a civilian population,' and indeed, there was no evidence presented of such a goal,” Carro wrote in his decision.

In addition to state charges in New York, Mangione is also facing a federal murder case over the killing of Thompson, with the federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty. The accused has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

More workers may lose their hard-won retirement savings now that Trump has pushed them toward crypto and private equity.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

A new Trump executive order has opened the door for 401(K) holders to invest in private equity, cryptocurrency, and other alternative assets. Why did Trump make this decision? Is this a beneficial “public policy” for common people preparing for retirement? Gerald Epstein, a leading expert on finance and financial crises, warns that Trump's executive order on retirement accounts not only comes with high risks, but the so-called alternative assets deliver, at best, average returns. Epstein is professor of economics and co-director of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. His latest book is Busting the Bankers' Club: Finance for the Rest of Us.

C. J. Polychroniou: On August 7, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(K) Investors.” Trump's executive order defines alternative assets in a very broad manner to include private equity and private credit, real estate, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. At any rate, with nearly $9 trillion being currently held in 401(K) plans, this executive order represents a historic shift that could potentially reshape how people save for retirement and have indeed major effects on the economy. Why would Trump open the door for 401(K) retirement plans to invest in private equity and crypto? It's hard to imagine Trump being interested in expanding access to these assets because he cares about economic security and the future of the average U.S. worker.

Gerald Epstein: You are right: Trump signed an executive order on August 7, 2025, which, like so many of the Trumpian orders, has an Orwellian title: “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(K) Investors.” It is Orwellian because, in effect, it will allow and indeed encourage more Americans, desperate to put away savings for their retirement, to open themselves up to exploitative and misleading investment advisors, brokers, and asset managers on the false promise that they will get higher returns from so-called “alternative” assets. It encourages the idea that, somehow, the common people are missing out on a great investment opportunity only open to the very rich. But in fact, this move is more like social dumping. The “smart money” — wealthy investors, pension funds, and university endowments — are starting to abandon some of these “alternative investments” such as private equity. Private equity firms, increasingly desperate for investors, and who for years have been eyeing the “little guys'” 401(K) plans, will now have a chance to make up lost ground by trying to attract middle-class and working-class retirement funds. So, far from democratizing access, Trump's executive order will “democratize” exploitation.

The crypto interests and big finance are taking us into territory not seen since the 1920s: crony capitalism on steroids.

And with respect to crypto — the new cool “alternative” asset — this move is a payback to all the crypto pushers who dumped millions of dollars into Republican and friendly Democratic coffers in the 2024 election. And more to the point, it is a pay-forward to Trump, his family, and his cronies, who are making a fortune from the crypto business. David D. Kirkpatrick at The New Yorker, using a very judicious approach, estimates that, so far, the Trump family has made a minimum of $3.4 billion from exploiting Trump's role as president. Of that, 70 percent ($2.4 billion) has come from crypto-related ventures. And these estimates were published in August. Since then, the Trumps have sealed crypto deal after crypto deal.

So, like so much that passes these days for Trumpian “public policy,” the plan is to enrich friendly financiers and the Trumps themselves, at the expense of many people who were somehow convinced to vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 election.

Would it be accurate to say that Trump's new 401(K) policy has the potential to offer bigger returns but also higher risks? As such, what could be the potential economic effects of this new policy, and could it actually undermine retirement security?

There are two main types of assets that come under the rubric of “alternative investment”: private equity and crypto assets. As Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt, among others, have detailed, private equity refers to financial firms that have become famous for taking over everything from Toys ‘R Us to Steward Health Care, running them into the ground by loading them up with debt, and generating billions for the private equity owners. According to Americans for Financial Reform, private equity firms have been called a “billionaire factory” for private equity managers, whose performance fees increased the number of multibillionaires in the U.S. sevenfold between 2006 and 2015. While the private equity partners make billions, some studies show the private equity investors make no more than average returns but pay much higher fees and expenses, according to analyst Ludovic Phalippou and others. As a result, as I said before, large investors, including some pension funds, are leaving private equity in droves.

The other “alternative investment” is crypto. As Tonantzin Carmona of the Brookings Institution and law professor Hilary Allen, among others, have shown, although there might be a few small investors who strike it rich, for most, crypto assets are highly risky with rates of return lower than those on other more regulated investments, such as index funds.

Let's assume for a moment that the U.S. economy slips into a recession, where the odds of that happening are now 50-50. What could a recession mean for alternative assets in 401(K)s?

As I just indicated, these “alternative investments” are highly risky with, at most, average returns. This question asks whether they are good hedges against negative shocks to the economy, such as recessions, or inflation. With respect to crypto, the answer is clearly no, despite many advocates' claim that it is. The problem with crypto is that it has no underlying real value, so it is highly speculative. Any significant shock is likely to spook investors, leading to a run on crypto-related assets, as we saw in 2023 with the runs on crypto-friendly banks — Silicon Valley, Signature Bank, and First Republic.

Private equity is more complicated but will also be at risk. So this means that small savers will lose.

Clearly, a new regulatory regime has been established in Washington since Trump's reelection, which encourages all kinds of financial innovation. Are we witnessing a return to casino capitalism, or perhaps going even further beyond casino capitalism?

Well, ever since the Clinton/Greenspan gutting of the Glass-Steagall Act and other financial “reforms” (all of which are discussed in my book Busting the Bankers' Club: Finance for the Rest of Us), we have returned to a “casino capitalism.” But now, under Trump 2.0, the crypto interests and big finance are taking us into territory not seen since the 1920s: crony capitalism on steroids.

And look what happened then!

 A Plan to Beat the Kremlin on Its Own Terms

 Veronica Anghel and Sergey Radchenko

In the early hours of September 10, Polish and NATO forces shot down several of the 19 Russian drones estimated to have crossed into Polish airspace—an unprecedented incursion that caused consternation and alarm throughout Europe. Russia denied responsibility, implying that the drones had simply lost their way; NATO and European officials suggested the violation was intentional. Whatever the case, the clash marked the first time that NATO engaged enemies in allied territory. A few days later, another Russian drone moved into NATO airspace, this time over Romania, although the Romanians took no action and the drone eventually crossed into Ukraine. These events underline what remains a daunting prospect for Europeans: the possibility that the grinding war of attrition in Ukraine will spill over into a broader war between Europe and Russia.

Moscow's evident determination to keep fighting in Ukraine has fueled mounting anxiety among European leaders. Since Donald Trump's return to office, they have twisted themselves into diplomatic contortions to implore, indulge, and flatter the American president in the hopes of sustaining the White House's engagement with the war in Ukraine and of keeping Russia at bay. Yet it was Russian President Vladimir Putin—the “ogre at the door,” as French President Emmanuel Macron once called him—who strolled down a red carpet, to Trump's applause, before a bilateral summit in Alaska in August. The Europeans, who weren't invited, turned to damage control. The following week, European leaders flew to Washington alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to offer him support and show a united front against Russia. Trump treated his guests as he might contestants on The Apprentice: at once effusive, then dismissive, and always uncommitted. By the dismally low standards of current transatlantic relations, the meeting was a success only for ending without incident.

The latest round of U.S.-Russian pageantry was another reminder of what has long been clear: Europe's security is being decided elsewhere. Caught between a revisionist Kremlin and an indifferent White House, Europe is consistently outmaneuvered and often marginalized. The European Union's failure to shape global geopolitical outcomes stems from its own foreign policy incoherence, including a historic overreliance on the United States and an inability to develop a consistent strategy for dealing with Russia, its key adversary.

As a result, Putin has opted for endurance: outlasting Western support for Ukraine by exploiting transatlantic fatigue and pairing threats of escalation with the phantasm of a peace that is always just around the corner. Putin inflates modest battlefield gains into major victories and touts Russia's overheated war economy as a sign of strength. His goals are clear: turn Ukraine into a truncated client state, fracture Western unity, and reshape the world order to support Russia's long-term bid for imperial greatness. Europe, meanwhile, hopes that the United States will rediscover transatlantic solidarity or that Russia will simply stand down in Ukraine. Neither scenario is likely, and neither constitutes a strategy. What Europe needs is to confront the Kremlin on its own terms.

Europe must revise its approach to Russia to be more aggressive and calculating. It should use what economic tools it has available, such as the seizure of Russian assets abroad, to their fullest extent. At the same time, it should not take stringent positions that consign it to the sidelines of future negotiations—for instance, by refusing to countenance sanctions relief for Russia unless Ukraine is restored to its 1991 borders, a stance that means that Europe will not get a seat at the table. Europe should also learn to beat Putin at his own subversive game by encouraging both the defection of Russian elites and the flight of capital from Russia. European leaders should look ahead, as well, to a time beyond Putin—and lay the groundwork for that future relationship. If Europe wants to help shape Russia, it must start now. Otherwise, Russian drones over Poland and Romania may be a harbinger of a far more troubling future to come.

After Russia's full-scale invasion, Europe swiftly rallied to Ukraine's aid, spending more than $200 billion to date on military assistance and economic aid. The EU has delivered 18 successive sanctions packages against Russia since the invasion began. It has also committed to enlarging the union to include Ukraine and Moldova, despite objections from Hungary, one of its member states.

Russian aggression and recent U.S. pressure have also prompted the EU to make smarter defense investments and build a stronger industrial base. The bloc established Security Action for Europe, a fund of 150 billion euros from which EU member states and several external partners, including Ukraine, can draw for defense procurement. New defense coproduction schemes, such as an agreement between Denmark and Ukraine, will also allow Europeans to build up military capabilities they will need for decades to come. On the whole, there is reason to be confident in Europe's long-term ability to deter Russia. Despite current impediments—including bottlenecks in military production, uneven anti-drone and cyberwarfare capabilities among states, and gaps in intelligence-sharing—Europe could already sustain and win a conventional war with Russia should one break out.

European capabilities may be fairly strong, but Europe's will is not. Countries lack the collective urgency to shape not only the endgame in Ukraine but also a larger idea of European security. There is certainly no consensus on how to respond to Russian provocations, as evidenced by the different reactions Poland and Romania had toward the drone threats. European states do not even have a shared understanding of what it would mean for Europe if Russia finally subdued Ukraine, either through an outright military victory or a settlement brokered on Putin's terms.

One view, rarely voiced in public but quietly circulated in elite EU policy circles, is that such an outcome wouldn't fundamentally change things for Europe. The continent could resume a limited relationship with Russia; after all, Europe bought oil and gas from the Soviet Union, which controlled Ukraine, and even signed arms control treaties with it—détentes propelled by the logic of Wandel durch Handel, West Germany's “change through trade” policy toward communist states. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico espouse this attitude today. Far-right opposition forces in France, Germany, Italy, and Romania would also likely tilt these member states' national policies toward rapprochement if they were to gain power. The logic of this position is simple: an antagonistic Russia is not going away and the risks of escalation are too high. It is, therefore, better to settle now. Europe should find a balance with an aggressive Russia through trade and concessions, even as Russia rebuilds an empire on Europe's eastern frontier.

The alternative view is that an end to the war in Ukraine that favors Russia would pose an existential threat to the continent by leaving Europe's eastern flank exposed to Russian subversion or even outright invasion. This line of thinking holds that it was naive to assume Putin would stop at Crimea in 2014 and that it is dangerous to assume he will stop at Ukraine now. It regards Russia's demands that NATO retreat to its pre-1997 borders not as rhetorical bluff but as a maximalist goal Moscow will try to fulfill.



In visible disarray, the Europeans—notably the British and the French—have hammered together a so-called coalition of the willing to try to build consensus on Ukraine by circumventing Hungary and other dissenting countries. But there is little actual appetite for instituting any kind of European-led security guarantees. As Poland's foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, recently said, “Who wants to fight Russia? I don't see many volunteers.” EU members have also been squabbling among themselves, as in a recent public spat between Poland and Hungary over Ukrainian attacks on the Druzhba oil pipeline, which delivers Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia. Such bickering projects an image of a helpless Europe unable to speak with one voice. It also prevents Europe from using the significant tools already at its disposal.

For example, the Europeans have been unwilling to confiscate frozen Russian assets to raise more money for Ukraine, earning duplicitous praise from the Kremlin. They have also been generally unwilling to challenge Russian tankers that are smuggling oil to China and India to help fuel Moscow's war economy. A leading EU member state, Germany, has been incomprehensibly reluctant to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, while France has vaguely threatened to send ground troops to Ukraine even though it has no real intention of doing so. The Russian drone incursions into Poland and Romania have so far led to little more than statements of concern, instead of what it should have brought about: additional and very public commitments of significant military aid to Ukraine. As it is, Putin has every reason to doubt that further acts of Russian sabotage or subversion will provoke tangible consequences.

Europe has also failed on the diplomatic front by excluding itself from the negotiations process. With few exceptions, the Europeans have shunned direct contact with Russia, instead using long-range propaganda to show the Kremlin what they think of Putin's brutal policies. Yet declaring Putin a war criminal—however justly—does not help in negotiating an end to the war. It also keeps the Europeans out of the rooms where such negotiations happen. As U.S. and Russian negotiators began meeting behind closed doors, in Alaska and elsewhere, the Europeans watched from the sidelines, unable to insert themselves into talks or offer viable alternatives to a Russian-designed peace in Ukraine and unwilling to use their economic leverage to force Putin into a dialogue.

Remarkably, they did so even as the Trump administration productively engaged with the EU's neighbors, including Belarus, which is led by the Russian-backed dictator Alexander Lukashenko. Trump even brought Armenia and Azerbaijan together to sign a peace deal in the White House, without any Russian or European involvement. Just three years ago, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, had called Azerbaijan a “crucial energy partner.” That economic opening, however, was not matched by political follow-through. This lost opportunity to establish transactional ties with a country on Russia's doorstep is symptomatic of the EU's lack of pragmatism concerning the larger region. As Moscow's grip loosens in its own backyard, Europe can step in with meaningful alternatives, exploiting tensions in Russia's relations with its many unhappy neighbors and thus gaining ground in its geopolitical tug of war with the Kremlin.

Projecting European strength requires more than simply building up arms and offering Ukraine reassurances of future assistance. Europe must also start employing Putin's own tactics against him. It must embrace its own campaign of subversion.

One of the defining features of Russia's economic collapse in the 1990s was a vast outflow of capital. By conservative estimates, more than $150 billion was moved to offshore accounts while ordinary Russians faced economic ruin. This propelled the country's 1998 financial crisis, which further accelerated capital flight and resulted in domestic political chaos. Such turmoil in turn elevated Putin, who promised to restore stability, impose order, and rein in the oligarchs. Buoyed by soaring oil prices, Russia's new leader rebuilt the economy and amassed a formidable war chest—one that now sustains his campaign in Ukraine and underwrites the resilience of his regime.

After the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia shielded its economy by combining aggressive fiscal stimuli with strict controls, effectively preventing a mass exodus of capital. Russian oligarchs and businessmen also feared asset seizures abroad and so returned to Moscow's protective fold. Putin welcomed them. “It's safer at home,” he said, taunting those who had lost fortunes elsewhere as naive. “Invest here.” He branded those who moved capital abroad as “dangerous” to his regime. Some U.S. and European sanctions actually reinforced this fortress strategy by making it harder for Russians to transfer or shelter assets overseas. The result: Russia avoided the kind of balance-of-payments crisis that had crippled the state in the 1990s.

Europe should recognize that weakening the Kremlin's war effort requires disrupting the internal equilibrium that sustains it. To this end, Europe needs to encourage elite defection and capital flight. This does not mean turning the continent into a safe haven for illicit wealth. Russian capital must be rigorously screened to ensure that it is not used to buy political influence. But creating selective exit ramps for regime insiders, as well as safe channels for moving their assets, can serve as a form of targeted subversion. The death in July of Russia's transport minister, Roman Starovoit, officially ruled a suicide, points to the deepening paranoia and pressure within Russia's ruling class. Europe must offer an escape hatch for those ready to abandon ship—and bring their knowledge and money with them. The goal is not to rehabilitate Russia's weakening oligarchy but to fracture the elite networks that still play a significant role in sustaining Putin's rule.



Europe should also do more to attract Russian professionals ready to break rank, renounce their Russian citizenship, and resettle in Europe. Their departure would weaken the regime from within. Scientists, doctors, and IT specialists, for instance, form the backbone of the Russian war economy. By voting with their feet, they could drain talent, accelerate decay, and pressure the Kremlin to seal its borders—an act that would expose Putin's authoritarianism and hasten his decline. Facilitating their exit would help unravel the domestic consensus sustaining the war.

A key argument against this approach is the risk of infiltration by Russian saboteurs and spies. But the threat is overstated: Russian intelligence operatives are already in Europe in significant numbers, and any further increase can be partially neutralized through better counterintelligence work and due diligence. It would come with manageable danger for Europe, but the potential effect on Russia's already thinly stretched economy cannot be overstated.

The damage could be political as well as financial.By creating a haven so attractive that Putin is compelled to seal his borders and lock his citizens inside, Europe could expose his weakness. There is precedent for this. In the early Cold War, East Germany hemorrhaged skilled workers to the West, weakening the regime's economic base. In response, the communist leadership built the Berlin Wall—a landmark that became an embodiment of failure, proof that the regime could survive only by imprisoning its own citizens. It helped delegitimize East German communism and paved the way for its eventual collapse. Likewise, Europe should make clear, through both policy and public messaging, that Putin's war has severed Russia from the European idea, and that those willing to walk away from that war will find Europe open to them.

Paradoxically, European states could more easily coordinate and institute subversion tactics than make more conventional moves, such as imposing sanctions. This is because subversion relies on national competence, not EU unanimity, since many aspects of migration and border control can be reshaped through existing mechanisms without total consensus. Even skeptics such as Hungary or Slovakia can paint the selective intake of high-skill Russian workers and elites as a humanitarian, pro-growth measure rather than an escalation of hostilities.

Any viable EU strategy toward Russia must incorporate a long-term vision for where Europe wants Russia to be in ten or 15 years—whether or not Putin remains in power. Without it, Europe risks locking itself into a purely confrontational stance in which it treats Russia as an eternal enemy.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, Europe was the strongest advocate for integrating Russia into international institutions and involving it in security collaboration with NATO. That tradition continued to guide EU engagement with Russia until the invasion of Ukraine, even when its members should have decided to change course. Yet it cannot now be replaced by a simplistic strategy of containment in which Europe keeps Russia in a bear cage and prods it from a safe distance. The goal must instead be to weaken and ultimately defeat an aggressive adversary while maintaining the possibility of Russia's postimperial future.

If Europe succeeds in weakening the Kremlin, it will also bear some responsibility for managing the instability that follows. The EU's Russia strategy should therefore include planning for Russia's postconflict transition, when it may reintegrate with collaborative international frameworks with Western countries. Such a strategy will resist the temptation of fatalism. Russia is not destined to be hostile, undemocratic, or imperialist by nature. Even as Europe confronts Russian aggression with clarity and force, it must pursue a dual-track strategy—one that keeps the door open to a different relationship with the country. Europe can hold a dagger in one hand, but it must be prepared to extend the other.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

HUSSEIN AGHA has been involved in Israeli-Palestinian affairs and negotiations for more than half a century. He was a Senior Associate at St. Antony's College, University of Oxford from 1996 to 2023.

ROBERT MALLEY is a Lecturer at Yale University's Jackson School of Global Affairs. He served in senior Middle East positions in the Clinton, Obama, and Biden administrations.

This article is adapted from their book Tomorrow Is Yesterday: Life, Death, and the Pursuit of Peace in Israel-Palestine (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2025).

 As Its Influence Faded, Washington Dissembled and Denied Reality

 Hussein Agha and Robert Malley

On any given day during the long war in Gaza, a Biden administration official could be expected to assert any of the following: a cease-fire was around the corner, the United States was working tirelessly to achieve one, it cared equally about the Israelis and the Palestinians, a historic Saudi-Israeli normalization deal was at hand, and all this was bound up with an irreversible path to Palestinian statehood.

Not one of those pronouncements bore even a loose resemblance to the truth. Talks about a cease-fire dragged on, and when they fitfully bore fruit, the resulting understandings quickly fell apart. The United States refrained from doing the one thing—conditioning or halting the military aid to Israel that kept the fire from ceasing—that might have made it happen. Taking that step was also the one thing that might have demonstrated, beyond platitudes, a U.S. commitment to protecting both Israeli and Palestinian lives. Saudi Arabia kept repeating that normalization with Israel depended on progress toward a Palestinian state, and the Israeli government consistently ruled such progress out. The more time went on, the more U.S. statements were exposed as empty words, met with disbelief or indifference. That did not stop them from being made. Did U.S. policymakers believe what they said? If not, why did they keep saying it? And if they did, how could they ignore so much contrary evidence staring them in the face?

The falsehoods served as cover for a policy that enabled Israel's ferocious attacks on Gaza and hailed the most modest, fleeting improvement in the situation in the Palestinian enclave as the product of American humanitarianism and resolve. Israel's brutality worsened under the Trump administration, but those earlier falsehoods had paved the way. They helped normalize Israel's indiscriminate killings; its targeting of hospitals, schools, and mosques; its use of access to food as a weapon of war; and its continued reliance on American weapons. They laid the ground and there was no turning back.

The deceit was not new. Its roots stretch back well before the war in Gaza and extend well beyond the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It became a habit. For decades, the United States dissembled about its stance toward the conflict, posing as a mediator when it was an outright partisan. It dissembled when it helped put together a “peace process” that did far more to perpetuate and solidify the status quo than to upend it. It dissembled when it portrayed its broader Middle East policy as promoting democracy and human rights. It dissembled when it claimed success even as its efforts yielded serial disaster.

As the falsehoods have become more apparent and harder to ignore, U.S. influence has dwindled. Israelis, Palestinians, and other local actors ignore the charade—leaving behind the bromides about the two-state solution, peace, democracy, and American mediation—and revert to more visceral, unembellished attitudes that sprout from their pasts. As in earlier decades, Palestinians—adrift, leaderless, brimming with anger and thirst for revenge—resort to isolated acts of violence against Israelis, awaiting the day they cohere into more organized form. As before, Israel, unrestrained and unbridled, extends its arm wherever and whenever it sees a Palestinian ripe for killing: in the 1970s in Amman, Beirut, Tunis, Paris, or Rome; nowadays in Doha and Tehran. On both sides, worse is to come. The United States will do little but contemplate the debris.

The life of a failed U.S. policy in the Middle East proceeds in stages. First comes the wrong-headed approach, misreading of a situation, deliberate or inadvertent mistake, as when U.S. officials assert that the best way to influence Israel is not through pressure but with a warm embrace. When they clumsily meddle in Palestinian politics, seeking to anoint a preferred set of “moderate” leaders, an endorsement that, in the eyes of those leaders' constituents, has little to distinguish itself from an indictment. When they exclude from peacemaking the forces most able to derail it, those on both sides who, for reasons religious or ideological, share a deep, immutable attachment to all the land between the river and the sea, and who would experience giving up an inch of it as a wrenching ripping apart—Israeli settlers and religious nationalists, Palestinian refugees and Islamists.

The riddle of American policy is that its masters know so much and comprehend so little. Information is not understanding; it can be the opposite. In 2000, senior U.S. intelligence officials, based on what they had seen, heard, and thought they had learned, assured President Bill Clinton that the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat would have no choice but to accept Clinton's proposals during the summit at Camp David, that he would be crazy not to. Arafat turned them down, celebrated as a hero by his people for doing so. In 2006, the Bush administration missed clear signs that pointed to a Hamas victory in the Palestinian elections for which Washington had clamored and about which Palestinian officials had fretted.

Years later, after the 2011 uprising in Syria broke out, raw intelligence erroneously depicted a battlefield that gave President Bashar al-Assad scant chance of short-term survival, the rebels who sought to oust him a relatively swift path to success. During the Biden administration, U.S. officials relied on intelligence reports to evaluate the thinking of Iranian leaders and their stance on a proposed nuclear deal. Their assessments, as often as not, turned out to be wrong. They were surprised by the Taliban's lightning victory after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, by the collapse of Assad's regime the following year, surprised that they had been surprised.

These shocks were not the result of deliberate distortions in which intelligence is molded to suit official whims—such as when the Central Intelligence Agency in 2003 told President George W. Bush what he wanted to hear: that the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, that the case against him was a “slam dunk.” They were the result of a dynamic that is less deceptive, less purposeful. It is no less treacherous.



Intelligence data often comes with appropriate warnings. Officials may be reminded that the information they have received was gleaned from a single conversation in one place, at one time, without the benefit of wider analysis, broader context, and knowledge of unspoken assumptions. They can be told that whatever is extracted is not the whole puzzle and that to possess pieces of the puzzle can be more misleading than to have none. Yet the cautions matter little. To those who have never crossed paths with raw intelligence—the intercept of a conversation, the contents of a secret memorandum—the thrill can be hard to describe. You feel as if you were in the protagonists' room and in their minds, you have an advantage they cannot possess, can only dream of. You know. But you do not. American policymakers read and barely understood, read some more and understood even less.

The enigma in these and other instances is not chiefly that the United States misjudged. To get things wrong, misread foreign dynamics, or misapprehend local actors is not unusual. For most policymakers, it is part of the job. What is uncommon, and harder to explain, is how often these failures have been allowed to happen and recur; how even their proliferation has led to neither personal nor institutional accountability, seldom to a mild reprimand, let alone a genuine rethink; how little the United States appears capable of learning from mistakes. The issue is why the country has proved so resistant to changing its ways. Next in the life of an American failure is its replication.

Even more confounding than the mistakes or their stubborn repetition is U.S. officials' habit of voicing a falsehood even after they know it to be untrue, even after they know that others know it to be untrue. The final stage of failure is the lie. The lie is born of the failure, and it blooms as the failure recurs. American policymakers do something they think will work, do it again even though it did not work, say it works when everyone knows it does not, promise it will when all have lost patience and faith. Unmoored from reality, the pronouncements veer into happy talk. It is more than mere spin. It suggests a deliberate, almost strategic attitude of boundless cheer contrary to common sense and everyday experience. It is this, the casual way in which the United States regularly proffers optimistic statements that fly in the face of all evidence and stand in sharp contrast to a sorry record, that is most striking and perplexing.

Lies rest at the heart of politics and diplomacy, but there are lies, and there are lies. There is the lie that purports to serve the common good, as when U.S. President John F. Kennedy misled the public about the secret U.S.-Soviet understanding regarding the United States' removal of missiles from Turkey to end the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. There is the big lie, blatant and oft-repeated, that aims to convert its audience to zombie-like belief. The shrewd lie or lie of the cynic, the sort at which Henry Kissinger excelled and in which the George W. Bush administration indulged ahead of the Iraq invasion. It can justify war or prevent it. It can break a logjam. It can kill. The lie of the hopeless striving to rally hope, of Saddam's spokesperson during the 2003 Iraq war, extolling triumph amid annihilation. The lie of the underdog, to which Arafat clung like one clings to a buoy for survival. He would tell Egypt that Syria was his foe, tell Syria that it was Egypt, tell Saudi Arabia that it was both. He would forswear knowledge of a fighter he had just ordered into action and claim familiarity with one on whom he had never once set eyes. All would learn to distrust him—the learning came fast. But lies saved him and put his cause on the map.

There are lies that get things done, even if what gets done can be ugly, foul, violent, or worse. They have a purpose, not always or necessarily a higher one. A purpose all the same. But the fabrications that came to pervade and corrode the United States' Middle East diplomacy are not of this kind. They stand apart because they fool nobody and those who utter them must know that nobody is fooled. They happen when one U.S. administration after another has proclaimed its determination to achieve a two-state solution well after the time such an outcome had become impossible; when the Biden administration asserted it cared equally about Israeli and Palestinian lives; when it proclaimed it was tireless in its pursuit of a cease-fire or that Saudi-Israeli normalization was there for the taking, just within reach.

Are all these lies? The word may seem too strong. Many of the assertions do not start that way. They originate as misapprehension or self-delusion. On the eve of a 2000 summit between Clinton and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva, every member of the U.S. team believed that the Syrian leader would reject the Israeli peace proposal they had been asked to convey. Indeed, they had told the Israeli prime minister as much. Still, they must have convinced themselves there was a chance; why else would they have gone? At Camp David in 2000, U.S. participants likewise persuaded themselves that a deal between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was at hand when nothing—neither territorial division nor the status of Jerusalem nor the fate of Palestinian refugees—had been agreed. When, during President Barack Obama's second term, Secretary of State John Kerry, fresh into his Israeli-Palestinian diplomatic foray, said that the parties were closer to a deal than ever before, it is doubtful that he was pretending. Like others before him, he was confident that reaching an agreement was a matter of will and perseverance, both of which he possessed in abundance. When Biden administration officials claimed that Saudi Arabia would be ready for normalization with Israel, they probably meant it; after all, that is what Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had privately conveyed.

Over time, it becomes difficult to tell where self-delusion ends and dissembling begins. Eventually, after the words are repeated often enough, the distinction blurs and matters less, if at all. The two merge. An illusion endlessly repeated despite its demonstrable untruth ceases to be an illusion and becomes a lie; a lie endlessly retold can become second nature, so ingrained and instinctive as to detach from its origins and morph into self-delusion. American officials' recurrent claims, over many decades, that they are committed to a two-state solution and that another round of U.S.-mediated talks could bring it about were no doubt born of genuine conviction. When, failure after failure, they continue to echo the mantra, it is no longer an illusion and turns into deceit. It is another of those phenomena one needs to experience to appreciate. American officials had faith when they went to Geneva and Camp David and also knew both would be a bust; believed in Kerry's initiative and knew it was quixotic; trusted that Saudi-Israeli normalization was achievable and were resigned to the fact that, for the time being, it was a pipe dream. They both knew and did not know and were not sure which was which. “The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth,” George Orwell wrote in his dystopian novel, 1984. Proof disproves belief, and still the faith endures.

There came a time when, in its dealings with the Middle East, the United States began to make a religion out of optimism, embrace an ideology of wishful thinking, routinely speak empty words, and issue claims readily disproved by events. It is hard to identify a precise date, easier to identify a probable cause: the acquired habit cannot be separated from the erosion of U.S. power and influence.

No party can match American military or economic dominance, but an increasing number of partners and enemies in the Middle East learned to disregard it. The United States, with all its might, was regularly rebuffed by Israel, often even by the Palestinians, and did little more than witness its own embarrassment. If power is the ability to stretch one's capacity beyond its objective measure and direct the behavior of others, this was the reverse. The tragedy of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is not Washington's fault alone. But it is difficult to imagine a greater chasm between capability and accomplishment. The bully was bullied and did nothing about it.

Elsewhere, in Afghanistan as in Iraq, the United States showed it did not know how to wage a war, much less win one. Thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Afghans and Iraqis lost their lives. The Iraq war ended with an Iranian-backed government and militias in charge, the Afghanistan war with the Taliban back in power in the wake of an ignominious U.S. retreat.



The United States showed it could not manage peace, either. Across the region, it embraced autocrats, rebuked them, embraced them once more. It sought to promote a democratic transition in Egypt in 2011, a chapter that closed with the consolidation of a government more repressive than the one its leaders helped overthrow. In Libya in 2011, Obama ordered strikes that helped topple the country's leader, Muammar al-Qaddafi. The result was civil war, instability, the proliferation of armed militias, as well as the flow of weapons across Africa and of refugees into Europe. The U.S. president hoped the operation would succeed, later described it as a “shit show.” He was right on one of those counts. The Obama administration's subsequent efforts to oust the Syrian regime through heavy investment in the armed opposition followed a similar pattern: U.S. involvement helped prolong a civil war, further encouraged Iranian and Russian interventions, and failed to bring the rebels to power. Many of the weapons the United States helped ship to Syria landed in the hands of jihadist groups that the United States then scrambled to subdue.

In these and other instances, the Arab uprisings took a dark and ugly path. When they began, Obama famously spoke of the United States backing the winds of change, being on the “right side of history.” History paid no heed. In each case, wishful thinking stumbled on hard facts, and the United States appeared curiously oblivious to the lessons of its own Middle East history—lessons about its overconfidence; the limits of its power; the resilience of established governments; the unreliability of local partners keen for American succor, indifferent to American advice; the blowback that follows propping up armed groups about which Washington knows little and over which it has even less control; its repeated attraction, like moth to flame, to a region it has repeatedly vowed to escape. Lessons, in short, about the marriage of the United States' irresistible urge to meddle in a region and its unfamiliarity with that region's ways.

Even when the outcomes for which it had labored came to pass, they did not come at Washington's behest. Years of U.S. efforts to weaken regional militant movements—Hezbollah, Iraqi militias, Palestinian armed groups, the Houthis—did little to erode their influence. The United States had sought to cripple them in different ways, and they suffered from the blows, but they bounced back, thriving on the adversity. The significant strike, the serious one, came at Israel's hands, when it decapitated Hezbollah and devastated its ranks in September 2024. Shortly before Assad fled Damascus that December and his regime disintegrated, the United States had concluded that both were there to stay and pondered a deal to improve bilateral relations. Stunned, American officials could do little more than watch as a group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States swiftly chased Assad out, completing the task Washington had tried so hard and so unsuccessfully to accomplish, and sit down with someone who, in the quick transition from opposition to power, had transformed in their eyes from jihadist to statesman.



With each failure came the falsehood that became the marrow of U.S. Middle East diplomacy. In Afghanistan, the United States repeated that success was around the corner and chased its tail until it caught up with defeat. While claiming to be engaged in a fight for democracy and human rights, Washington was flanked by partners—Egypt, Gulf Arab monarchies and sheikhdoms, Israel—that ignored the former and flouted the latter. The United States insisted its pressure could constrain Iran's nuclear program. When the pressure did not work, more was supposed to do the trick. Yet each new U.S. sanction slapped on in response to every new Iranian act of defiance was proof of its own futility. One cannot seriously argue that pressure will curb Iran's behavior if more pressure continually yields worse behavior.

At times, strangest of all, there is both pretense and confession of the pretense. When Obama armed Syrian rebels, he publicly asserted, “This dictator will fall.” Later, he acknowledged that the idea of such an opposition succeeding—a ragtag group of “former doctors, farmers, pharmacists” vanquishing an army—was a fantasy. The Biden administration decried President Donald Trump's 2018 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal that Obama had negotiated and to reimpose sanctions. In the same breath, it boasted that it had not lifted a single sanction, had added many more, and vowed to increase the pressure it acknowledged had not worked. President Joe Biden, also, when U.S. forces began to go after the Houthis in Yemen in response to their attacks on commercial ships, and U.S. military spokespeople repeatedly claimed success, gave this curious statement about the strikes he had ordered to a reporter: “When you say are they working, are they stopping the Houthis? No. Are they going to continue? Yes.” U.S. presidents were as good as their words, and their words as clear as mush.

The less the United States governs the course of events, the more its officials feel the need to talk about them, which is one way to project a sense of control. What Washington loses in influence, it makes up in noise. It masks impotence with loquaciousness, futility with eloquence. True power is quiet. The disconnect between words and reality is near impossible to comprehend, save perhaps as a hint of the end of an era. It suggests the wistfulness of a once almighty superpower that longs for the days when it could get its way, the weight of an incentive structure that penalizes pessimism for the judgment it passes on American purpose and rewards optimism for the verdict it casts on American prowess, or the hope that compulsive, cheerful repetition will make the deceptions real.

How the Arab world initially reacted to Trump's reelection in 2024 spoke volumes. By almost any standard, Trump should have had everything going against him in this regard. In his first term, he had decisively tilted the field in Israel's favor, eager to break with convention and jettison peace process truisms he dismissed as fairy tales. During his campaign, he had called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “finish the job” in Gaza; whatever moral indignation Biden officials dared voice at Israel's conduct of its war there would find no echo among their successors. Yet in the early days, in many corners of the Middle East, relief came more readily than despair at the thought of bidding farewell to Biden's approach—and, as they saw it, Obama's, as well.

The familiar explanation that it takes an autocrat to enjoy an autocrat, that in Trump, Arab dictators recognized one of their ilk, goes only so far. Biden, after all, had hardly proved a true crusader on behalf of democracy and human rights. What Arab leaders and a not insignificant portion of their publics resented was Washington's moral vanity, feckless expressions of empathy, and convictions devoid of courage. What they found hard to stomach were the lies. If you are not going to lift a finger for the Palestinians, have the decency not to pretend to care. At least with Trump, they thought, they knew what they were getting, even if his actions could be unpredictable and mostly not to their liking. They saw in him a leader without moral compass, at ease with the unashamed exercise of power. Unlike his predecessors, Trump did not drone on about an imaginary two-state solution; meant it when he said all options were on the table regarding Iran; and, when he authorized talks with Hamas, dropped the pantomime of refusing to engage with the only Palestinian entity that could decide on matters of war and peace. How much this represents a break with the past remains to be seen. Still, after years of faux outrage and bogus preaching, genuine cynicism was to many a welcome breath of fresh air.

Over decades, the United States had gradually built an alternate universe. A universe in which happy talk comes true and actions produce promised consequences. In which Washington's mission in Afghanistan gives rise to a modern democracy and U.S.-backed government forces can stand up to the Taliban. In which economic sanctions yield desired political change, domesticate the Houthis, reverse Iran's nuclear advances. In which the United States is engaged in a decisive struggle of democratic forces against autocratic regimes. A universe in which moderate Palestinians represent their people, will reform the Palestinian Authority and curb its political demands; a reasonable Israeli center will take charge thanks to gentle American prodding, will agree to meaningful territorial withdrawals and to a Palestinian state worthy of the name. A universe in which a cease-fire in Gaza is imminent, international justice is blind, and Washington's crude double standards do not incessantly defile the international order it purports to defend.

Then there is the actual universe, all flesh and bones and lies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Actor, director, environmentalist Robert Redford dies at 89","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/16/entertainment/robert-redford-death","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:19:47 GMT","


            Robert Redford, the dashing actor and Oscar-winning director who eschewed his status as a Hollywood leading man to champion causes close to his heart, has died, according to his publicist Cindi Berger, Chairman and CEO of Rogers and Cowan PMK.
    


            He was 89.
    


            “Robert Redford passed away on September 16, 2025, at his home at Sundance in the mountains of Utah–the place he loved, surrounded by those he loved. He will be missed greatly,” Berger said in a statement to CNN. “The family requests privacy.”
    


            Known for his starring roles in “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” and “All the President's Men,” Redford also directed award-winning films such as “Ordinary People” and “A River Runs Through It.”
    


            His passion for the art of filmmaking led to his creation of the Sundance Institute, a nonprofit that supports independent film and theater and is known for its annual Sundance Film Festival.
    


            Redford was also a dedicated environmentalist, moving to Utah in 1961 and leading efforts to preserve the natural landscape of the state and the American West.
    


            Redford acted well into his later years, reuniting with Jane Fonda in the 2017 Netflix film “Our Souls at Night.” The following year, he starred in “The Old Man & the Gun” at age 82, a film he said would be his last – although he said he would not consider retiring.
    


            “To me, retirement means stopping something or quitting something,” he told CBS Sunday Morning in 2018. “There's this life to lead, why not live it as much as you can as long as you can?”
    


            In October 2020, Redford voiced his concern about the lack of focus on climate change in the midst of devastating wildfires in the western United States, in an opinion piece he wrote for CNN.
    


            That same month, Redford's 58-year-old son died from cancer.
    


            David James Redford – the third of four children born to Robert Redford and former wife Lola Van Wagenen – had followed in his father's footsteps as an activist, filmmaker and philanthropist.
    


            Born in Santa Monica, California, near Los Angeles, in 1936, Redford's father worked long hours as a milkman and an accountant, later moving the family to a larger home in nearby Van Nuys.
    


            “I didn't see him much,” Redford recalled of his father, on “Inside the Actor's Studio” in 2005.
    


            Because his family couldn't afford a babysitter, Redford spent hours in the children's section at the local library where he became fascinated with books on Greek and Roman mythology.
    


            Yet Redford was hardly a model student.
    


            “I had no patience … I was not inspired,” Redford recalled. “It was more interesting to me to mess around and to adventure beyond the parameters that I was growing up in.”
    


            Drawn to arts and sports – and a life outside of sprawling Los Angeles – Redford earned a scholarship to play baseball at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1955. That same year, his mother died.
    


            “She was very young, she wasn't even 40,” he said.
    


            Redford said his mother was “always very supportive (of my career)” — more so than his dad.
    


            “My father came of age during the Depression and he was afraid to take chances … so he wanted the straight and narrow path for me, which I was just not meant to be on,” he said.  “My mother, no matter what I did, she was always forgiving and supportive and felt that I could do anything.
    


            “When I left and went to Colorado and she died, I realized I never had a chance to thank her.”
    


            Redford soon turned to drinking, lost his scholarship and eventually was asked to leave the university. He worked as a “roustabout” for the Standard Oil Company and saved his earnings to continue his art studies in Europe.
    


            “(I) lived hand to mouth, but that was fine,” Redford said of his time in Europe. “I wanted that adventure. I wanted the experience of seeing what other cultures were like.”
    


            When he returned to the US, Redford began studying theater at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City.
    


            Shy and closed off, Redford said he didn't fit in with the other drama students who were eager to show off their acting skills. After a performance in front of his class with a fellow student that ended in frustration and disaster, Redford said his teacher pulled him aside and encouraged him to stick with acting.
    


            In 1959, Redford graduated from the academy and got his first acting role on an episode of “Perry Mason.” His acting career was “uphill from there,” he said.
    


            His big acting break came in 1963, when he starred in Neil Simon's “Barefoot in the Park” on Broadway – a role he would later reprise on the big screen with Jane Fonda.
    


            Around this time, Redford married Lola Van Wagenen and started a family. His first child, Scott, died from sudden infant death syndrome just a few months after his birth in 1959. Shauna was born in 1960, David in 1962, and Amy in 1970.
    


            As his acting career was taking off, Redford and his family moved to Utah in 1961 where he bought two acres of land for just $500 and built a cabin himself.
    


            “I discovered how important nature was in my life, and I wanted to be where nature was extreme and where I thought it could maybe be everlasting,” he told CNN.
    


            Redford made a name for himself as a leading man in 1969 when he starred opposite Paul Newman – already a major star – in “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.” The Western about a pair of outlaws won four Academy Awards.
    


            Redford said he “will forever be indebted” to Newman, whom he credited with helping him get the role. The two actors had great on-screen chemistry, became lifelong friends and reunited in “The Sting” in 1973, which won the Academy Award for best picture.
    


            Redford starred in a string of hit movies throughout the 1970s: “Jeremiah Johnson”; “The Way We Were,” co-starring Barbra Streisand; “The Great Gatsby”; and with Dustin Hoffman in 1976's “All The President's Men,” about the Watergate scandal.
    


            Teaming up with director Sydney Pollack on “Jeremiah Johnson,” Redford fought with the studio to get the film made the way he wanted – a precursor to his career as a director and his support for independent filmmaking.
    


            “It was a battle from the get-go,” Redford told “Inside The Actor's Studio.” “They (the studio) said … ‘You've got $4 million, put it in the bank in Salt Lake City, you can shoot wherever you want, but that's it. If it goes over, it comes out of your hide.'”
    


            With spare dialogue and stunning scenery, the film tells the story of a Mexican War veteran who has left the battlefield to survive as a trapper in the American West.
    


            It was released more than three years after it was made because, according to Redford, the studio's sales chief thought the film was “so unusual” that it wouldn't find an audience.
    


            “Jeremiah Johnson” ended up grossing nearly $45 million. It wasn't the only time Redford's passion for the art of filmmaking put him at odds with the studios that funded his work.
    


            “The sad thing you have to work against, as a filmmaker, is held opinions about what works or doesn't work,” Redford said. “Sports movies don't work, political movies don't work, movies about the press don't work – so I've done three of them.”
    


            Redford made his directing debut in 1980 with “Ordinary People,” a drama about an unhappy suburban family which earned the Academy Award for Best Picture and another one for him as best director. He continued starring in hit films such as “The Natural” in 1984, which tapped into his passion for baseball, and 1993's “An Indecent Proposal,” which paired him with a much younger Demi Moore.
    


            He later directed the 1993 film “A River Runs Through It,” which won three Academy Awards, 1994's “Quiz Show” and “The Horse Whisperer” in 1998, which he also starred in.
    


            Ruggedly handsome, Redford was often cast as the romantic leading man in films such as “Out of Africa” in 1985, but he wasn't always comfortable with the label and feared being typecast.
    


            “I didn't see myself the way others saw me and I was feeling kind of trapped because I couldn't go outside the box of … good-looking leading man,” he said. “It was very flattering, but it was feeling restrictive … so it took many years to break loose of that.”
    


            Redford's passion for the environment and independent filmmaking merged when he founded the Sundance Institute in 1981.  The nonprofit supports “risk-taking and new voices in American film” as well as theater, and Redford's Sundance resort in a canyon above Provo, Utah, hosts annual workshops for playwrights and screenwriters.
    


            Each year Redford's institute holds the Sundance Film Festival in Utah – the largest annual showcase in the United States for independent film. Many young filmmakers got their big breaks at Sundance, including Steven Soderbergh with “Sex, Lies, and Videotape” in 1989, Quentin Tarantino with “Reservoir Dogs” in 1992 and Ryan Coogler with 2013's “Fruitvale Station.”
    


            Redford's lifelong impact on the film industry was recognized in 2002 with an honorary Oscar.
    


            In his later years, Redford never lost his passion for storytelling through film and remained an outspoken champion of environmental causes. He frequently demurred when asked about retiring.
    


            “I want to make the most of what I've been given,” Redford told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in 2015. “You keep pushing yourself forward, you try new things and that's invigorating.”

Live Updates


• Trump heads to UK: US President Donald Trump is traveling today for a state visit to the UK, where he will be welcomed by the royal family tomorrow at Windsor Castle and meet with Prime Minister Kier Starmer on Thursday.
    


• Meanwhile, back in DC: FBI Director Kash Patel is being grilled by lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including about the investigation into Charlie Kirk's murder and the bungled release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.
    


• Focus on hate speech: Attorney General Pam Bondi said the administration will “target” anyone who uses hate speech, regardless of party affiliation. Trump also suggested that his administration might seek to prosecute journalists, telling a reporter, “maybe they'll have to go after you” while answering a question referring to Bondi.
    


            House Republicans are moving ahead with a plan to avert a government shutdown on September 30, proposing a seven-week stopgap bill that would buy more time for Congress to negotiate a broader deal.
    


            The plan from Speaker Mike Johnson would extend the federal government's current funding through November 21, just before Congress' Thanksgiving recess. Multiple sources close to GOP leadership insist that the bill is “clean” of any partisan language – and said the only new policy is a bipartisan provision to increase cash for member security.
    


            Still, the House GOP's plan sets the stage for a messy funding battle with Democrats, as it did not result from bipartisan negotiations and contains none of Democrats' demands. Most House Democrats are expected to vote against it, forcing Johnson and the House GOP to deliver the votes on their own.
    


            Democrats refuse to support any funding bill that does not involve their party's leadership to discuss their own priorities, such as extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire this year. Republicans, meanwhile, are insisting that must be a separate negotiation.
    


            House leadership hopes to vote on the stopgap bill on Friday, the last day before Congress leaves for a weeklong recess for Rosh Hashanah. It's not yet certain when the Senate would take up the bill.
    


            In total, the House GOP's bill includes $30 million in extra security money for members of Congress and $58 million for security for the executive and judicial branches. It also includes a funding “fix” for DC, which would free up $1 billion of the city's own money, adjusting a mistake in an earlier bill.
    


            Sen. Cory Booker got in a heated exchange with FBI Director Kash Patel during Tuesday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing after the New Jersey Democrat warned that President Donald Trump “will cut you loose.”
    


            “Mr. Patel, I think you're not going to be around long,” Booker warned Patel. “I think this might be your last oversight hearing.”
    


            Booker told Patel that “as much as you supplicate yourself to the will of Donald Trump and not the Constitution of the United States of America,” Trump has shown “he is not loyal to people like you.”
    


            Booker criticized Patel for shifting agents to focus on immigration and allegedly firing agents for political reasons.
    


            “I believe you have made our country weaker and less safe,” Booker said.
    


            Patel replied by telling Booker, “that rant of false information does not bring this country together.”
    


            “My God, my God,” Booker said. “You're going to lecture me on dividing this country?
    


            The two began shouting over each other, with Patel telling Booker the senator was “an embarrassment” and Booker ridiculing Patel for “making a mockery of this committee.”
    


            “I'm not going anywhere,” Patel concluded.
    


            Booker later told reporters that Patel was “disrespectful” to senators after the fiery exchange with the FBI director during the hearing.
    


            “He was disrespectful, he was combative when we have simple fact-based questions. He wouldn't step forward and be accountable for the information that we constitutionally should be getting about the agency,” he said.

            FBI Director Kash Patel was asked by Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt what the FBI can do to help figure out who leaked the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the decision that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion.
    


            Britt called it “mind-boggling” that no one has been able to figure out who leaked the decision, which was published by Politico in May 2020. She said that the US Marshals Service was unable to identify a leaker and closed its investigation in January 2023.
    


            “I can't speak to what the Marshals did and how they conducted their investigation. I can tell you, generally speaking, the FBI has taken over the investigation on the leak, because it was such a detrimental leak you commit to getting to the bottom of it,” Patel said.
    


            Patel also said that the FBI is operating under normal protocol for leak investigations regarding this issue.
    


            “We are utilizing the full resource(s) of the FBI as we usually do on leak investigations, and we will make sure our results are public at the appropriate we need answers,” Patel said.
    


            House Republicans are discussing a new proposal to increase security funding for lawmakers to $30 million and attach it to a stopgap government funding bill, according to two sources familiar with the plans, which was later also confirmed by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole.
    


            “It's basically extra support for being able to hire security people that you can bring around with you. And if we have to do more, we do more,” Cole told CNN.
    


            He said the $30 million for congressional security would be intended to last through the period of time funded by the short-term bill.
    


            It would be in addition to the White House's $58 million request for executive and legislative branch security, which is also expected to be included in the bill.
    


            Republicans are currently discussing the proposal in their closed-door conference meeting, according to a person in the room.
    


More on the shutdown fight: Cole also accused Democrats of throwing a “temper tantrum” that could result in a government shutdown, warning that Republican leadership has no off-ramp strategy if Democrats decide to withhold votes on the short-term bill to fund the government by the September 30 deadline.
    


            The so-called “clean” spending bill would require 60 votes in the Senate to advance the plan, so Democrats have leverage in the upcoming debate. They want to use that leverage to reverse health care cuts in Trump's signature domestic policy law and come up with a plan to extend expiring subsidies to help individuals pay for their health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

            President Donald Trump is on his way to the United Kingdom for a state visit, but before departing Tuesday, he spoke to reporters at the White House and  addressed topics including Charlie Kirk's assassination and the war in Ukraine.
    


If you're just joining us, here's what Trump said this morning:



Killing of Charlie Kirk: Trump praised FBI Director Kash Patel, dismissing scrutiny over the law enforcement leader's handling of the most high-profile moment of his tenure so far.
    


War in Ukraine: Trump said it was time for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept a deal that would end the war with Russia, suggesting the leader whose nation was invaded was a holdup in striking a peace agreement.
    


Israel's Gaza incursion: Trump stopped short of offering a view of Israel's offensive in Gaza City, saying he didn't have many details of the ground incursion. “I have to see. I don't know too much about it,” he said when questioned about the operation to take control of the urban area in the besieged Palestinian enclave. Instead of offering a stance on the Israeli operation, Trump zeroed in on Hamas' use of hostages as human shields.
    


Venezuela: The president said the US military has targeted three boats that he claimed were transporting drugs from Venezuela.
    


Prosecuting reporters: Trump suggested his administration might seek to prosecute journalists who he believes have been unfair to him, telling an ABC reporter, “maybe they'll have to go after you.”
    


Robert Redford: Trump mourned the death of actor Robert Redford, saying, “There was a period of time when he was the hottest.”
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel told lawmakers Tuesday that the White House has not directed him to crack down on political groups or nonprofits in the wake of the assassination of Charlie Kirk.
    


            The comments come a day after President Donald Trump said he'd consider naming far-left anti-fascism group Antifa as domestic terrorists, previewing a plan to crack down on what he's cast as a widespread network of left-wing radicals inciting violence.
    


            “Have you been asked or directed by the White House or others to engage in a crackdown on political groups or organizations, nonprofits, after the murder of Charlie Kirk?” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal asked Patel during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
    


            “No. I've been asked by my chain of command to properly root out criminal activity wherever it is in whatever investigation we are conducting. And that's what we're doing,” Patel responded.
    


            “Nobody gives me a list on who to target,” he added. “My targeting list is from the men and women at the FBI.”
    


            It's a familiar thing to see in London, British guards stoically standing wearing big, furry and black hats.
    


            CNN's Max Foster had an opportunity to speak with one of the guard's about the iconic bearskin hats they wear, ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the United Kingdom.
    


Here's what Lt. Col. Storm Green had to say:

            GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham says there's been progress on moving his bipartisan Russia sanctions resolution and predicts there will be a breakthrough on it by Wednesday, as pressure grows for congressional action.
    


            “There will be a plan here coming out in the next few days, I think, to act on this bill, and I think it will help in this war. That's my hope,” the South Carolina Republican told reporters, noting he spoke to House members on Monday.
    


                    “We've worked very closely with President Trump. I think by Wednesday, we'll have our differences resolved about how the waiver works,” Graham added.
                





            The South Carolina Republican's resolution, which has over 80 Senate co-sponsors, would allow the president to levy up to a 500% tariff on imports from countries that purchase Russian uranium, gas and oil, and have not contributed to Ukraine's war effort.
    


            House and Senate Republican leadership have previously said they are waiting for the White House to give them the green light to hold a vote on the measure, but pressure is mounting, particularly among some Senate Republicans, to move ahead on the floor.
    


            “Europe needs to do more. But quite frankly, it's time for the Congress to legitimize or confer this authority on the president,” Graham said.
    


            “I think the legislation I've been working on with Sen. Blumenthal would be a strong signal to Russia, to China, to Europe, that America, not just President Trump, is behind the idea of holding those accountable who prop up Putin's war machine.”
    


            Graham emphasized that Europe and the US will have to pursue sanctions together.
    


            “We've sanctioned Russia to death. We could add sanctions to Russia. It won't matter. The theory of the case is to go after his customers, to get him to the table, because people won't buy his oil and gas,” he said.
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel defended the recent dismissal of two agency officials who are now contesting their firings, saying they “failed to meet the needs of the FBI.”
    


            During a tense back and forth with the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patel pushed back on a New York Times story that said the two officials, Chris Meyer and Walter Giardina, were fired by the director after becoming targeted by the right for their work on January 6 cases or for their connection to Robert Mueller, the special counsel whose probe into President Donald Trump during his first term has become a political lightning rod for conservatives.
    


            “It appears you terminated these two agents. Why?” Sen. Dick Durbin asked Patel.
    


                    “I'm not going to get into personnel decision that we made,” the director responded, adding later: “Anyone that has been terminated by the FBI generally speaking failed to meet the needs of the FBI and uphold their constitutional duties.”
                





            Durbin, a Democrat of Illinois, went on to say that it was “disgraceful” that Meyer and Giardina, both of whom are veterans, were terminated “apparently because of the rants of a podcaster.”
    


            “That is your opinion, it is not a fact,” Patel shot back without providing any details.
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel blamed Alex Acosta, who previously oversaw a non-prosecution agreement with sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein as a US attorney in Florida, for committing the “original sin in the Epstein case.”
    


            In the deal, Epstein avoided federal charges by agreeing to serve 13 months in prison on Florida state prostitution charges and to register as a sex offender.
    


                    “If I were the FBI director, then it wouldn't have happened,” Patel said.
                





            Patel said that the structure of the deal is, in large part, the reason the Trump administration did not release troves of evidence in the case despite its promise to do so.
    


            The agreement meant the court mandates protective orders “legally prohibiting anyone from ever seeing that material ever again without the permission of the court.”
    


            A Justice Department review later found that Acosta exercised “poor judgement” in striking the deal. He went on to serve as Trump's Labor secretary in his first term.
    


            Republican Sen. John Kennedy later urged Patel to continue making evidence public, saying, “I think you're going to have to do more to satisfy the American people's understandable curiosity.”
    


            The director said that the Justice Department is releasing “as much as we can.”
    


            “I know that's not going to satisfy many, many, many people,” Patel said, “but if they wanted it done right, then the investigation, from its origination, should have been done, right. And he should not have been given a get-out-of-jail-free card.”
    


            President Donald Trump on Tuesday mourned the passing of actor Robert Redford — saying “there was a period of time when he was the hottest.”
    


            Redford, known for his roles “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” and “All the President's Men,” died Tuesday at age 89.
    


            “He had a period of years that there was nobody better,” Trump said before leaving for the UK.
    


            Asked which of Redford's movies was his favorite, Trump said: “Well, you have a lot of them. Honestly, he made, I'd say he made seven or eight great movies that were really great.”
    


            Trump added, “That's a good way to go, I guess.”
    


            US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that it was time for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept a deal that would end the war with Russia, suggesting the leader whose nation was invaded was a holdup in striking a peace agreement.
    


            “He's going to have to get going and make a deal. He's going to have to make a deal. Zelensky is going to have to make a deal,” Trump said Tuesday as he was departing the White House.
    


            Trump has struggled to broker an end to the conflict in Ukraine, and a series of high-profile summits last month — with Russian President Vladimir Putin and with Zelensky and a host of European leaders — appeared to do little to advance the negotiations.
    


            Russia has maintained its maximalist demands to end the war, including taking over the entire Donbas region and insisting Ukraine never join NATO.
    


            Still, it was Zelensky who Trump said Tuesday must agree to a deal.
    


            “And Europe has to stop buying oil from Russia. Okay? You know, they talk. But they have to stop buying oil from Russia,” Trump added, renewing his call for more European efforts to end the war.
    


            Trump insisted his Alaska summit with Putin had yielded results.
    


            “It accomplished a lot, but it takes two to tango,” he said when questioned by CNN about progress a month after the Anchorage meeting.
    


            “It looks like I have to sit in the room with them, because they can't sit in the room together. There's great hatred there,” he said.
    


            President Donald Trump suggested today that his administration might seek to prosecute journalists who he believes have been unfair to him, telling an ABC reporter “maybe they'll have to go after you.”
    


            “You have a lot of hate in your heart,” Trump told an ABC reporter in response to a question about Attorney General Pam Bondi's assertion this week that “hate speech” could be treated as a crime. “Maybe they'll have to go after you.”
    


            The president referenced a $16 million payment that ABC made earlier this year to settle a defamation lawsuit he had brought against the administration, calling it an example of a news outlet being penalized for “a form of hate speech.”
    


            Trump has since sued multiple other outlets in response to critical coverage, most recently filing a lawsuit against The New York Times on Monday that accuses the newspaper of being a “virtual mouthpiece” for the Democratic Party and seeks $15 billion in damages.
    


            “We want everything to be fair,” Trump said. “It hasn't been fair.”
    


            President Donald Trump said the US military has targeted three boats that he claimed were transporting drugs from Venezuela.
    


            The US struck a boat that the government says was tied to the gang Tren de Aragua on September 2, killing 11 people. Trump announced a second strike against alleged “narcoterrorists,” which the administration says killed three people, on Truth Social on Monday.
    


            But speaking to reporters outside of the White House Tuesday, Trump said: “We knocked off three boats, actually, not two. But you saw two.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House about the third boat. CNN has also reached out to the Venezuelan government.
    


            Asked about concerns from Venezuela's leader about continued US strikes, Trump responded: “Well I would say this: right away, stop sending Tren de Aragua into the United States. Stop sending drugs into the United States.”
    


            Trump later said: “And the problem is there are very few boats out on the water. There are not a lot of boats out on the water. I can't imagine why. Not even fishing boats.”
    


            President Donald Trump praised FBI Director Kash Patel, dismissing scrutiny over the law enforcement leader's handling of the investigation into the killing of Charlie Kirk.
    


            “Kash, take a look at what he did with respect to this horrible person that he just captured,” Trump said. “He did it in two days.”
    


            The president added that he retains confidence “in everybody in the administration,” calling it the “best administration ever formed.”
    


            Patel is testifying on Capitol Hill this morning, where he's being grilled over his leadership of the FBI — including his decision to prematurely announce that the agency had a suspect in custody in Kirk's murder, a statement he had to walk back hours later.
    


            Talking with reporters prior to his departure for the UK, Trump also defended Attorney General Pam Bondi, saying she's done an “unbelievable job.”
    


            Bondi came under fire earlier this week for suggesting the administration would prosecute people for “hate speech,” prompting backlash from both sides of the aisle. She later clarified in a post on X that “hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. It's a crime.”
    


            President Donald Trump stopped short of offering a view of Israel's offensive in Gaza City, saying Tuesday he didn't have many details of the ground incursion.
    


            “I have to see. I don't know too much about it,” Trump said when questioned about the operation to take control of the urban area in the besieged Palestinian enclave.
    


            Instead of offering a stance on the Israeli operation, Trump zeroed on on Hamas' use of hostages as human shields.
    


            “Hamas is using the old human shield deal,” he said. “If they do that, they're in big trouble.”
    


            “If they put the hostages in front of them, Hamas, as protection, they call them bodyguards, they're going to have hell to pay,” he added later.
    


            Trump has previously been publicly agnostic on Israel's plans to launch a ground invasion, saying it was a decision for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel began his oversight hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee by running through a timeline of the investigation into Charlie Kirk's alleged killer, touting his own work amid criticism of his early social media posts that caused public confusion.
    


            “It's important this FBI is as transparent as possible,” Patel said.
    


            Ending his opening statement, Patel struck a defiant tone:
    


“I'm not going anywhere. If you want to criticize my 16 years of service, bring it on,” he said.

            Attorney General Pam Bondi today said that “hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment.”
    


            “It's a crime,” she said in a post to X. “For far too long, we've watched the radical left normalize threats, call for assassinations, and cheer on political violence. That era is over.”
    


            Her comments come after President Donald Trump said he'd consider naming far-left anti-fascists domestic terrorists, previewing a plan to crack down on what he's cast as a widespread network of left-wing radicals inciting violence.
    


            Bondi's social media post also went further than comments she made yesterday on the podcast of Katie Miller – former adviser for Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and wife of Trump adviser Stephen Miller – where she used attacks against Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and conservative influencer Charlie Kirk to denounce hate speech.
    


                    “You cannot call for someone's murder. You cannot swat a Member of Congress. You cannot dox a conservative family and think it will be brushed off as ‘free speech.' These acts are punishable crimes, and every single threat will be met with the full force of the law,” Bondi said on X. “It is clear this violent rhetoric is designed to silence others from voicing conservative ideals.”
                





This headline and post were updated with Bondi's statement on social media this morning.



            President Donald Trump has long sought an elusive deal to wrest TikTok's US assets from Chinese control, allowing an American investor group to buy it. That was a nonstarter for China for months. So what convinced the Chinese to relent?
    


            As Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tells it: a threat from Trump to shut down TikTok in the United States.
    


                    “What turned the tide was a call that Ambassador (Jamieson) Greer and I had with President Trump the night after the first day of negotiations, and President Trump made it clear that he would be willing to let TikTok go dark,” Bessent told CNBC this morning.
                





            Bessent said he anticipated Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will finalize a deal during a phone call set to take place Friday.
    


“A history of dueling”: Bessent also commented on his altercation with Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency Bill Pulte.
    


            “Treasury secretaries dating back to Alexander Hamilton have a history of dueling,” Bessent said. “Turned out a little better for Treasury's side this time.”
    


            CNN reported last week that Bessent threatened to punch Pulte in the face during a dinner at Executive Club, an exclusive MAGA-aligned group started by some of Trump's closest advisers, according to the sources. Bessent accused Pulte of talking negatively about him to Trump in private, the sources said, which quickly escalated as Bessent cursed at Pulte.
    


CNN's Samantha Waldenberg contributed reporting to this post. 



            President Donald Trump could begin introducing actions targeting liberal organizations as soon as this week, people familiar with the discussions said, as he looks to channel conservative anger over Charlie Kirk's killing to go after his political opponents.
    


            Trump said yesterday he was open to designating certain left-wing groups as terror organizations and said he was discussing bringing racketeering charges against some operations with his attorney general.
    


            Trump has also raised the possibility of revoking tax-exempt status for liberal nonprofits, and his attorney general and senior adviser have raised the prospect of criminal charges against groups or individuals who are allegedly targeting conservatives.
    


            What actions the president ultimately takes remain an open question. But advisers said there was an across-the-administration effort now underway to identify groups that target conservatives or promote violence, with a goal of taking quick action.
    


            As Trump departs today for a state visit in the United Kingdom, team members are expected to continue those efforts back in Washington, DC, while he is on the three-day trip.
    


Some context: While the suspect in Kirk's killing held “leftist ideology,” according to Utah's Gov. Spencer Cox, a motive for the assassination hasn't been unveiled. The administration has not presented evidence the 22-year-old accused gunman was working with or influenced by the groups Trump has said he is looking to target.
    


            Still, Trump has suggested the killing extended from a wider coordinated effort to sow violence against conservatives.
    


            “We have some pretty radical groups, and they got away with murder,” he said in the Oval Office yesterday.

            Credit scores are falling at the fastest pace since the Great Recession as Americans struggle to keep up with the high cost of living and the return of student debt payments.
    


            The national average FICO score dropped by two points this year, the most since 2009, according to data released Tuesday by the analytics company.
    


            Although credit scores remain significantly higher than during the Great Recession, they are down for the second year in a row. FICO found a growing share of borrowers are falling behind on car loans, credit cards and personal loans.
    


            Younger Americans, exposed to the double whammy of high student debt and low entry-level hiring, are under even more financial pressure.
    


            Gen Z borrowers experienced an average credit score drop of three points — the biggest decline of any age group since 2020 during the pandemic, according to FICO.
    


            The findings underscore the growing disconnect between the euphoria on Wall Street and pessimism on Main Street. While US stocks continue to shatter record highs, a significant chunk of Americans say they are hurting.
    


            “We've seen a K-shaped economy where those with wealth tied to stock market portfolios and rising home values are doing well and others are struggling with high rates and affordability problems,” Tommy Lee, senior director at FICO, told CNN.
    


            Average credit scores fell sharply after the 2008 financial crisis, as unemployment skyrocketed and millions of Americans could not make their mortgage payments and defaulted on their auto loans.
    


            Credit scores increased each year from 2013 to 2024, when they dropped by a single point, according to FICO.
    


            But FICO found that delinquency rates on auto loans, credit cards and personal loans are at or near their highest levels since 2009.
    


            These delinquency rates are “more consistent with an economy in recession than one still in expansion,” FICO said, adding that mortgage and home equity loan delinquency rates are still near historic lows.
    


            FICO found that 14% of Gen Zers have had a large credit score decline of 50 points or more in the past year — more than any other year and double the decline of 2021.
    


            At least some of this pressure on younger Americans is linked to student debt.
    


            Following a Covid-era pause, student loan delinquencies were not reported on credit files until February. The Department of Education restarted collecting federal student loans in default in May.
    


            This shift disproportionately impacts Gen Zers because about one in three (34%) of them have open student loans, double the national at large, according to FICO.
    


            Between February and April, 6.1 million consumers had a student loan delinquency added to their credit file, according to FICO. That means the student loan delinquency rate has climbed to a record high of 29% among the 21 million borrowers with a student debt payment due.
    


            Another 1.9 million consumers haven't had a delinquency reported even though they have student debt payments due and haven't made payments.
    


            The impact of these late student debt payments is amplified by the fact that Gen Zers often don't have the long history of making credit payments that feed into credit scores. That makes their credit scores vulnerable to more volatility, both up and down.
    


            Another problem: Younger Americans are also contending with the most difficult job market in years for new college graduates.
    


            Dimitri Tsolakis, 22, said he applied to hundreds of jobs after graduating from American University in 2024 with a degree in international relations.
    


            It took Tsolakis 14 months to finally land a full-time job, or at least one that wasn't a scam. But the job he did get, as a secretary at a law firm in Orlando, called for a dramatic cut to his income relative to his prior work as a server.
    


            “My credit score took a drastic hit because I had to compromise and take a job where I'm severely underpaid,” Tsolakis told CNN in a phone interview.
    


            Tsolakis owes $35,000 in student debt but has had to pause repayments to focus on making his car payments and paying for other living expenses.
    


            He's hardly alone in skipping payments.
    


            About one in five (19%) of consumers say they paid less or skipped bills to get by in the past year, according to a July survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. That's up from 17% a year earlier.
    


            Even more consumers (47%) said they cut discretionary spending in the past year, while 23% said they reduced essential spending.
    


            FICO found that 64% of Gen Z and 61% of Millennials with student loans rely on credit cards, buy-now-pay-later loans or personal loans to bridge financial gaps.
    


            Sue Murphy, a nurse in Philadelphia, took a parent-PLUS loan to help fund her daughter's college education. The $70,000 in student debt requires monthly payments of just over $500.
    


            To make ends meet, Murphy took on a second job, making her schedule 12 days on and one day off.
    


            “It almost feels like it doesn't pay to be an honest hardworking citizen in this country anymore,” Murphy said.
    


            The plan had been to make 10 years of payments and then have the balance of the student debt forgiven because Murphy works at Temple Health in Philadelphia, a nonprofit medical system that qualifies for public service loan forgiveness.
    


            However, Murphy now fears the student debt won't qualify for forgiveness because of rule changes proposed by the Trump administration.
    


            At the order of the White House, the Education Department has proposed amending the definition of employers that qualify for loan forgiveness by excluding employers involved in “illegal activities.”
    


            “The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program exists to serve American heroes like teachers, police officers, and firefighters — not individuals or employers engaged in illegal activities that harm Americans,” Ellen Keast, deputy press secretary at the Education Department, said in a statement to CNN. “The Department has no business subsidizing the employees who work for organizations that break the law by mutilating and maiming healthy children or aiding and abetting illegal immigration and terrorism.”
    


            Murphy said she makes her payments on time so her credit score hasn't gone down drastically but her high debt-to-income ratio doesn't help matters.
    


            “I will go into retirement with student debt,” Murphy said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — For the first time, federal health officials are taking aim at telehealth companies promoting unofficial versions of prescription drugs — including popular weight loss medications — as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on pharmaceutical advertising.

The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday posted more than 100 letters to various drug and online prescribing companies, including Hims & Hers, which has built a multibillion-dollar business centered around lower-cost versions of blockbuster obesity injections.

The FDA warned the company to remove “false and misleading” promotional statements from its website, including language claiming that its customized products contain “the same active ingredient” as FDA-approved drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. The formulations cited by regulators are produced by specialty compounding pharmacies and aren't reviewed by the FDA.

“Your claims imply that your products are the same as an FDA-approved product when they are not,” states the warning letter, dated Sept. 9.

San Francisco-based Hims said Tuesday that it “looks forward to engaging with the FDA.”

“Our website and our customer-facing materials note that compounded treatments are not approved or evaluated by the FDA,” the company said in a statement.

It's the first FDA attempt to directly police online platforms like Hims, which have long argued they're not subject to traditional drug advertising rules.




A memo signed by President Donald Trump last week directed Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the FDA to ensure that pharmaceutical ads on TV, social media and other websites are “truthful and non-misleading.” As part of the initiative, the FDA promised to send 100 letters to companies with deceptive ads.

The new FDA letters each contain “cease and desist” language. That's a different approach for the agency, which typically drafts its letters in highly bureaucratic language citing specific FDA regulations. 

Hims has been under scrutiny from Washington for months.

Earlier this year, a Super Bowl ad from the company touted the benefits of its weight-loss medications but didn't list any of their side effects or potential harms. FDA rules require advertisements to present a balanced picture of drug risks and benefits.

Makary singled out the ad in last week's Journal of the American Medical Association, calling it a “brazen” example of how advertising is “contributing to America's culture of overreliance on pharmaceuticals for health.”

Hims and similar companies initially sold cheap generic versions of drugs for hair loss, erectile dysfunction and other health issues. But booming demand for obesity medications opened the door to selling cheaper copies.

The FDA permits so-called compounding, or customized production, when there is a shortage of the official versions of FDA-approved medications.

FDA recently determined that the GLP-1 drugs no longer met the criteria for a shortage. That should have ended the compounding, but there is an exception: The practice is still permitted when a prescription is customized for the patient.

Hims and other companies have taken to offering “personalized” dosages and formulations for certain patients, arguing they offer extra benefits.

The letters posted Tuesday come from FDA's drug center.

A letter posted last week from FDA's vaccine division took issue with a TV ad for AstraZeneca's FluMist vaccine, saying the spot's “background music and visual distractions” detract from information about side effects. The letter was signed by FDA vaccine chief Dr. Vinay Prasad, an ally of Kennedy who recently returned to his job at the agency after briefly being forced to step aside.

Researchers and consumer advocates have long complained that the upbeat TV images of patients enjoying life with family and friends often overshadow discussions of side effects.

Additionally, studies have shown that patients exposed to drug ads are more likely to ask their doctors about the medication, even if they don't fit the prescribing criteria. The American Medical Association, the nation's largest physician group, came out in support of a ban in 2015, citing TV advertising's role in “inflating demand for new and more expensive drugs.”

ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia's highest court has declined to consider Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' appeal of her removal from the Georgia election interference case against President Donald Trump and others.

Citing an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship Willis had with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she had hired to lead the case, the Georgia Court of Appeals in December ruled that Willis and her office could not continue to prosecute the case.

Trump hailed the court's ruling as “a great decision” and called Willis' prosecution of him and others for their attempts to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss in Georgia “a rigged case to start off with.” 

“What Fani Willis did to innocent people, patriots that love our country, what she did to them by indicting them and destroying them, she should be put in jail,” Trump told reporters.

Ashleigh Merchant, who exposed Willis' romantic relationship with Wade as defense attorney for Trump co-defendant Michael Roman, said: “We hope this will finally close this chapter.”

Willis said she disagreed with the court's decision, but would direct her office to make the case file and evidence available to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia so it can appoint a new prosecutor to replace her.

“I hope that whoever is assigned to handle the case will have the courage to do what the evidence and the law demand,” Willis said in an emailed statement.

Willis in January asked the Georgia Supreme Court to review that ruling, and the high court on Tuesday declined in a 4-3 decision to take up the case. One judge didn't participate and one judge was disqualified.




That means it will be up to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council to find another prosecutor to take the case. The council's executive director, Pete Skandalakis, said Tuesday he will begin searching for a new prosecutor to replace Willis but didn't know how long that might take.

Skandalakis said that once the new prosecutor is appointed it is “up to him or her what to do with the case.”

That person could continue on the track that Willis has taken, decide to pursue only some charges or dismiss the case altogether. It could be difficult to find a prosecutor willing to take the case, given its complex nature and the resources required.

Even if a new prosecutor wants to continue on the path charted by Willis, it seems unlikely that Trump could be prosecuted now that he's the sitting president. But there are 14 other defendants who still face charges in the case.

One of those defendants is former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. An attorney for Giuliani, Arthur Aidala, said he's hopeful that whoever is ultimately appointed as the new prosecutor will abandon the case entirely. 

“We're cautiously optimistic that they will choose not to go forward,” Aidala told reporters in New York.

A grand jury in Atlanta indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, using the state's anti-racketeering law to accuse them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn Trump's narrow 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia. The alleged scheme included Trump's call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger urging him to help find enough votes to beat Biden. Four people have pleaded guilty.

The Georgia case was one of four criminal cases brought in 2023 against Trump. Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith abandoned two federal prosecutions after Trump won the November election. In his hush money case in New York, Trump was convicted on 34 counts but received a sentence of no punishment.

Willis had asked the Georgia high court to consider whether the lower appeals court was wrong to disqualify her “based solely upon an appearance of impropriety and absent a finding of an actual conflict of interest or forensic misconduct.” She also asked the state Supreme Court to weigh whether the Court of Appeals erred “in substituting the trial court's discretion with its own” in this case.

“No Georgia court has ever disqualified a district attorney for the mere appearance of impropriety without the existence of an actual conflict of interest,” Willis' filing says. “And no Georgia court has ever reversed a trial court's order declining to disqualify a prosecutor based solely on an appearance of impropriety.”

Lawyers for Trump had argued in a court filing that the lower appeals court got it right and that Willis' “disqualification is mandated because it is the only remedy that could purge the taint of impropriety.”

Watch live as Kash Patel appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the first oversight hearing of his tenure as the FBI director. The hearing is likely to be dominated by questions about the investigation into Charlie Kirk's killing and internal FBI upheaval.

FBI Director Kash Patel and Sen. Cory Booker got in a shouting match during Patel's appearance Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, as the New Jersey Democrat accused him of being responsible for a “generational destruction of the nation's premier law enforcement agency.”

Patel retorted, telling Booker that he was an “embarrassment.” For several moments, the Republican chairman of the committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, pounded his gavel but struggled to gain control of the hearing.

The exchange exemplified the tension between Patel and skeptical Democrats, as the FBI director faced questions from senators about the investigation into Charlie Kirk's killing, the case against sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the firings of senior FBI officials who have accused Patel of illegal political retribution.

The oversight hearing, the first of Patel's young but tumultuous tenure, provides a high-stakes platform for him to confront Democrats at a time of internal upheaval and mounting concerns about political violence inside the United States, which President Donald Trump has sought to blame squarely on the left.

Other news we're following: 








U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois says immigration agents have arrested 250 people in the Chicago area since a new enforcement campaign was announced last week.

The Democrat is a member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations and got the information after a requested briefing with immigration officials. She shared details late Monday.

Underwood says the arrests began Sept. 6, two days earlier than a program touted as “Midway Blitz” was publicly announced. She says the operation would include the entire state of Illinois and neighboring Lake County in Indiana.

Top administration officials arrived in Chicago Tuesday, potentially signaling a more aggressive phase of immigration enforcement. DHS officials have not responded to questions about the number of arrests in the Chicago area.

Immigrants are being detained in various locations, sparking fear and leading some people to stay home. Advocates report increased activity from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with unmarked vehicles targeting work vans and staking out neighborhoods with large immigrant populations. 

One Metro Boston city canceled its Hispanic Heritage Month festival due to safety concerns. ICE's “Patriot 2.0"" operation follows a previous crackdown in Boston. 

The U.S. Department of Justice has also filed a lawsuit against Boston over its so-called sanctuary policies. Advocates argue the city's policy of limiting cooperation with ICE keeps the city safe and ensures Boston remains a place for all residents. 

Opponents argue challenging the federal government risks much-needed federal funding and allows criminals to walk the streets.

Patel had posted in the hours after the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk that “the subject” was in custody even though the actual suspect was still at large.

“I don't see it as a mistake. I see it as something -- working with the public to identify that there was a subject in custody,” Patel told senators.

He said he wanted to inform the public that a subject had been taken into custody, even though that person did not end up being the suspect in the shooting.

He told senators: “Could I have been more careful in my verbiage and said we had a subject instead of the subject? Sure.”Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, pushed back, saying it caused confusion by making it sound like authorities had caught the person suspected of killing Kirk.

Patel shot back by saying, “That's not what I said.”

A group of Democratic senators say they are deeply concerned that a Pentagon plan to allow military lawyers to work as temporary immigration judges will violate a ban on using service members for law enforcement and affect the military justice system.

The letter, sent to the military services and provided to The Associated Press, comes two weeks after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges. It is among the steps the Trump administration has taken to use the military in broader ways than previously seen, particularly in its immigration crackdown, including sending the National Guard into American cities and deploying active duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.

“These military officers would serve under the command and control of the Attorney General and would execute administrative determinations at the direction of the Attorney General,” according to the letter signed by 12 Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee. It added that “these actions are inherently law enforcement actions that may not be performed by members of the armed forces.”

Republican Gov. Mike Braun said that the redistricting conversation is “moving” and it's likely inevitable. But he doesn't want to call a special session unless there will be a successful outcome.

“I've been very clear, I want it to be organic,” he said in a video reported by WRTV in Indianapolis.

Indiana GOP lawmakers have been hesitant about redistricting while Texas and Missouri barrel ahead, emblematic of Indiana's independent streak. Braun said a special session could happen any time after November.

The GOP legislative caucuses met last week to discuss redistricting a few weeks after visiting the White House.

(AP Photo/Marc Levy, File)



Gov. Josh Shapiro says the nation must “turn the tide” against political violence and the belief that government can't solve problems while also rejecting vengeance.

Shapiro, a Democrat, delivered the remarks at the Eradicate Hate Global Summit in Pittsburgh. Shapiro said leaders must condemn all forms of political violence and shouldn't use violence as a pretext for more violence or to prosecute constitutionally protected speech.

Shapiro also criticized Trump, saying some people “in the dark corners of the internet, all the way to the Oval Office, want to cherry-pick which instances of political violence they want to condemn.”

In April, Shapiro and his family fled the governor's official residence in the middle of the night after an alleged arsonist set it on fire in an attempt to kill Shapiro.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said he has had no direct conversations with the White House or Border Patrol and reaffirmed that Chicago police would not collaborate with ICE.

“I get that people are feeling a level of anxiety, but they should be assured that we're going to work with all of our stakeholders to make sure the people of Chicago are safe and supported,” he said at a news conference following his signing of an executive order aiming to protect the right to protest.

The order states that, if federal law enforcement disrupts peaceful protests, Chicago police will “collaborate with protest organizers to develop a mutually acceptable alternative plan.”

Johnson said the order was an attempt to be “proactive” amid federal intervention and after protesters clashed with federal immigration agents Friday outside an ICE processing facility in Broadview, Illinois.

They unveiled a stopgap spending bill to keep the federal government through Nov. 21.

The bill generally funds agencies at current levels, though there is an extra $88 million to boost security for lawmakers and members of the Supreme Court and the executive branch. The House is expected to vote on the measure by Friday.

The budget year draws to a close at the end of the month, and Congress has yet to approve funding levels for the coming fiscal year. So, lawmakers will need to pass a stopgap measure to keep agencies funded while they work out their differences for the full year.

Democratic leaders have insisted that Republicans negotiate with them on the spending bill to protect health insurance coverage for millions of Americans. But Republicans leaders have rebuffed those demands and say those discussions are for another time and would not be part of the continuing resolution.

Any spending bill that passes will need some support from Democrats in the Senate as the measure will need at least 60 votes to advance to a final vote.

Patel and the New Jersey Democrat got into a shouting match as Booker charged that Patel is responsible for a “generational destruction of the nation's premier law enforcement agency.”

Patel fired back at Booker, telling him that he was an “embarrassment.”For several moments, the Republican chairman of the committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, pounded his gavel but struggled to gain control of the two men.

Still, Booker predicted that Patel would not last long in his post. He told Patel that Trump “will cut you loose. This may be the last time I have a hearing with you.”

Patel took the opportunity to give a fiery retort to Democratic senators who say the reason he got the job was his loyalty to President Donald Trump.

Patel's leadership of the FBI has been marked by turmoil and Democratic accusations that he's using the law enforcement agency to carry out Trump's goals.

But Patel told the Senate panel that it was “an entire falsehood” to suggest that he only got the job because he was a Trump loyalist.

Patel pointed to his experience as an attorney, congressional staffer and administration official, saying, “There was no loyalty then. There's no loyalty now to anything but the Constitution.”

Former Republican and onetime Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan is running as a Democrat for governor, a remarkable step for a staunch critic of Trump who left the conservative fold in a region where party switchers have gone in the other direction for generations.

“I've never wavered in taking on Trump. So Georgia Republicans threw me out of their party,” Duncan said in his announcement video released Tuesday. “I was leaving anyway. Now I'm running for governor as a proud Democrat.”

A 50-year-old resident of a Republican stronghold north of Atlanta, Duncan joins an already crowded field of lifelong Democrats. Top candidates include former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, state Sen. Jason Esteves and former labor commissioner Michael Thurmond.

Trump seemed miffed when an Australian Broadcasting Corp. reporter asked about his wealth since returning to office. Trump told the reporter, ‘You're hurting Australia very much right now, and they want to get along with me.”

He told the reporter that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese would be visiting soon and “I'm going to tell him about you. You set a very bad tone.”

The president also criticized ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl, whom he's known for years. Karl asked Trump about the attorney general's comments that she will be going after hate speech after the killing of Charlie Kirk.

Karl told Trump that even some of his allies say hate speech is free speech.

Trump responded by telling Karl the administration would “probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly, it's hate. You have a lot of hate in your heart.”

The House Select Committee on China says any deal between Beijing and Washington must comply with a law requiring TikTok to be divested from its Chinese ownership or face a ban in the U.S.

A framework deal was reached over the future of the popular social media platform at a trade meeting Monday in Madrid. Details remain unknown. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the committee's ranking Democrat, said he wants information on the ownership structure. 

“Underpinning all of our concerns is the Chinese Communist Party's access to American data,” he said. The social media platform needs user data to determine what to show users, and Krishnamoorthi said he would be open to discussions if the app is protected from Beijing's infiltration.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in an X post that she was on the ground Tuesday in Chicago “to make clear we are not backing down.”

“Our work is only beginning,” she said.

The news comes as Gregory Bovino, who spearheaded the immigration crackdown that sparked widespread protests in Los Angeles, announced Tuesday his arrival in Chicago, where residents have been bracing for weeks for Trump's promised immigration crackdown and National Guard deployment.

A senator asked if Patel would make a commitment to the agents assigned to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that they would not lose their jobs. His response: Your case assignment “does not dictate your career or your termination.”

Those comments are notable as the FBI director faces allegations in a lawsuit that he fired other agents and FBI leaders based on cases they worked.

Patel has refused to address the termination of those agents, telling lawmakers he won't discuss personnel matters.

The lawsuit filed last week says Patel told an FBI official that he understood the actions were “likely illegal,” but that he had to fire those his superiors wanted him to “because his ability to keep his own job depended on the removal of the agents who worked on cases involving the President.”

In a tense exchange, Sen. Richard Blumenthal accused the FBI director of lying when he told lawmakers at his confirmation hearing that agents would not be subject to political retribution.

Patel objected to the accusation, telling the Democrat from Connecticut: “You accusing me of lying is something I don't take lightly, but I'm not going to get into a tit for tat with you.”

The FBI director insisted that decisions to fire certain FBI agents were made by him, not the White House.

“Any termination at the FBI was a decision that I made based on the evidence that I have as director of the FBI,” Patel said. “It's my job and I'm not going to shy away from it.”

“There is no credible information — none. If there were, I would bring the case yesterday that he trafficked to other individuals,” Patel said, while also acknowledging that previous investigations of Epstein were limited.

Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said that kind of answer was unlikely to satisfy demands to release more information. 

“This issue is not going to go away,” Kennedy said. “And I think the central question for the American people is this: They know that Epstein trafficked young women for sex to himself. They want to know who if anyone else he trafficked these young women to.”

Patel said that the current case files only included “limited search warrants” between 2006 and 2007 because federal prosecutors in Florida had previously cut a secret deal with Epstein that allowed him to avoid prosecution for his previous actions.

Patel says the FBI has 35 open investigations into threats against judges, who have faced a sharp increase in violent messages in recent years.

Federal judges were targeted in 17 of those cases, while the others involved threats against state court judges, Patel said.

The FBI director said he's concerned about the problem, and the agency is referring cases for prosecution when it's supported by the evidence.

Judges have increasingly spoken out against threats of violence, pointing to worrying rhetoric from both sides of the political aisle in recent years and saying the threats have reached a new peak during the second Trump administration.

Johnson also defended employers who take action against employees whose comments go too far.

“That's not the government censoring speech, that's personal behavior and decorum,” the Republican from Louisiana said.

Johnson noted that Trump has been called “the most despicable names” and he urged all leaders to tone it down.

“Leaders cannot call their political opponents Nazis and fascists and enemies of the state because they disagree with their policy priorities,” he said.

Gregory Bovino, who spearheaded the immigration crackdown that sparked widespread protests in Los Angeles, announced his arrival in Chicago with a post on X.

“Well, Chicago, we've arrived!” he said. “Operation At Large is here to continue the mission we started in Los Angeles.”

Advocates for immigrants say they've noticed an uptick in detentions by ICE agents in Chicago as the nation's third-largest city braces for Trump's promised immigration crackdown and National Guard deployment. The threats have deepened dread among already fearful immigrant communities, which cancelled and delayed Mexican Independence Day celebrations. An ICE officer fatally shot a suspect trying to evade arrest last week.

Speaker Mike Johnson said a bill to avoid a partial government shutdown at month's end would not include health care provisions sought by Democrats.

“It will be a clean, short-term continuing resolution. End of story,” Johnson told reporters. He said the measure will be unveiled Tuesday. 

Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries has said House Democrats won't support a partisan bill that “continues to gut the healthcare of the American people.”

But Johnson said Republicans are not going to revisit their big tax cut bill that trimmed Medicaid spending over the coming decade, and said the looming expiration of tax credits for some health insurance coverage is a “December policy issue.”

“The same Democrats who decried government shutdowns under President Biden appear to have no heartache whatsoever at walking our nation off that cliff right now,” Johnson said.

The lawsuit against the paper and four of its journalists, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Florida, says several articles and one book published in the leadup to the 2024 election are “part of a decades-long pattern by the New York Times of intentional and malicious defamation against President Trump.”

Times spokesman Charles Stadtlander said Tuesday the lawsuit “lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics.” Penguin Random House, which published the book, called the lawsuit “meritless.”

Trump has gone after other media outlets, including filing a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the The Wall Street Journal and media mogul Rupert Murdoch in July after the newspaper published a story reporting on his ties to wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Patel was asked by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., whether the Kirk shooting is being treated as part of a broader trend of violence against religious groups, and Patel responded, “We are investigating Charlie's assassination fully and completely and running out every lead related to any allegation of broader violence.”

Patel also said that the FBI is investigating “anyone and everyone” who was involved in an online gaming chatroom on Discord with the alleged shooter. That chatroom involved “a lot more” than 20 people, Patel said.

The FBI director told Sen. Amy Klobuchar that he is “willing to engage and explore new ways” to address gun violence in the United States.

“Whatever creativity we can use to eliminate even just one shooting, one horrific death, I am in favor of engaging with Congress fully to do,” Patel told the Democrat from Minnesota.

Patel was later pressed by Klobuchar on whether he supports a ban on so-called assault weapons.

The FBI director said there are “instances on this legislation that could prevent future attacks” but said he would not “weigh into the creation of legislation.”

The FBI director says his agency, as well as the U.S. military and intelligence community, will be conducting a yearslong mission that seeks to use counterterrorism tactics against drug-trafficking organizations.

“We must treat them like foreign terrorist organizations post-9/11. We must treat them like the al-Qaidas of the world,” Patel told the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Patel argued that law enforcement resources alone aren't enough to dismantle criminal groups that traffic drugs into the U.S. and that the Trump administration is taking an “interagency” approach.

“Whether that's in a kill operation, a capture operation, a surrender operation, or a host nation takedown, like we did with the counterterrorism mission sets in Afghanistan and Iraq and Pakistan and elsewhere, we are applying that to the drug traffickers in Mexico and Venezuela and Colombia,” Patel said.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Tuesday he will seek a third term in the 2026 elections, hoping to beat the odds to become the longest-serving governor in a state where voters have usually said two terms were plenty.

“I've always tried to do what's right for Minnesota, and I'll never stop fighting to protect us from the chaos, corruption, and cruelty coming out of Washington,” Walz said in a campaign video.

Walz has been frequently mentioned as a potential 2028 presidential candidate. He sharply criticized Trump while touring early caucus and primary states after he and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris were defeated. But he told Axios in July he would not run for president if he sought reelection.

Questioned by Durbin on the recent firings of FBI agents, Patel said he would not get into personnel decisions and accused the Democrat of unfairly attacking FBI leadership.

Earlier in the hearing, Patel called it “absolutely disgraceful” to cite what the FBI director described as a “one-sided story” about the firings.

“Your attack on the current leadership of the men and women of the FBI is equally disgraceful,” the FBI director told Durbin.

Patel is facing a lawsuit from three high-ranking FBI officials who have accused him of illegally firing them in a “campaign of retribution.”

“We knocked off, actually, three boats not two,” Trump told reporters when asked about Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's angry response to U.S. military operations that the White House says is targeting Venezuelan drug smugglers.

Trump had confirmed earlier that the U.S. military on Monday had targeted a second boat allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela, killing three aboard the vessel. He also hinted that the military targeting of cartels could be further expanded. 

The White House did not immediately respond to questions about when and where the third strike occurred.

Trump also sent a new warning to the Maduro government on Tuesday: 

“Stop sending Tren de Aragua to the United States,” Trump said. “Stop sending drugs into the United States.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is a close ally of Trump, asked the FBI director what legal justification the administration is using for military strikes on Venezuelan boats that the president has said are carrying drugs.

Patel declined to answer, saying he would leave that to Attorney General Pam Bondi.

While Republicans in Congress haven't objected to Trump using the U.S. military to strike the boats, some are beginning to ask questions on how the operations are conducted and their legal justification. 

Still, Graham expressed support for an aggressive approach to nations where drugs are manufactured.

“We will hunt down every single one of those narco-traffickers,” Patel told Graham.

Durbin asked Patel about statements from Dan Bongino before he became deputy director of the FBI that the bombs found at the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee on Jan. 6, 2021, were an “inside job.”

The FBI director declined to comment on Bongino's comments, but said he found Durbin's criticism of Bongino “disgusting.”

“So you have no evidence?” asked Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

“I got a lot of evidence, and I'll give it to you when I can,” Patel said.

The person who placed the bombs just before the attack on the U.S. Capitol that day has never been identified.

During one combative exchange, Patel was pressed by the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee over an unsigned memo released by the Justice Department in July that said there was no evidence of a Jeffrey Epstein “client list.”

Patel responded with a dig at former President Joe Biden, telling Durbin: “Would you have preferred I used autopen?”

Republicans have accused the Democratic president of signing pardons in his final days in the White House with an autopen instead of by his own hand.

The Senate hearing is quickly becoming tense, with the FBI director repeatedly avoiding answering questions from Sen. Durbin on how the bureau has administered polygraph tests to staff.

Patel told Durbin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, that he wouldn't discuss the specifics of how polygraph tests are administered or what questions come up.

Durbin responded, “You have to have a decent memory when you come before a committee.”

The Associated Press has previously reported that agents and senior executives alike have been subjected to polygraph exams aimed at ferreting out disclosures of information related to Patel.

Patel brought up the Epstein files in his opening statement, seeking to address a topic that's brought criticism from some quarters of Trump's conservative base who want to see more information released about the probe.

The FBI director faulted the original case against Jeffrey Epstein that ended in a plea deal years ago. He says it involved a “very limited search warrant” and asserted that the Trump administration has done more to release all “credible information” they could under the law.

Patel also said Epstein had not been a source for the FBI.

He didn't acknowledge criticism that the FBI and Justice Department have faced in recent months over the abrupt announcement in July that they would not be releasing additional documents from their trove of evidence. 

The state's high court on Tuesday declined to hear Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' appeal of her removal from the case.

Trump reacted to the news by saying it was a “great decision” and a “rigged case to start off with.”

He also called for Willis to be jailed for attempting to prosecute him and several other individuals.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)



Patel has concluded his opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee with a bit of a challenge for his critics: “I'm not going anywhere.”

The FBI director pointed to his experience as a congressional staffer and Trump administration official, saying, “If you want to criticize my 16 years of service, please bring it on.”

Senate Republicans have continued to express confidence in Patel despite criticism from some conservative commentators of how he's led the FBI's response to the killing of Charlie Kirk.

Democrats, meanwhile, will intensely question Patel over what they say is a highly politicized approach to the FBI.

The president reacted to news of the famed actor's death and said he made “seven or eight great movies.”

“He had a series of years where, there was nobody better,” he said.

The Illinois Democrat says both political parties “have a responsibility to bring down the temperature” and encourage unity following Kirk's killing.

In his opening remarks earlier in the hearing, Durbin said Democrats are not responsible for Kirk's death, just as Republicans are not responsible for the killing of a Democratic state lawmaker in Minnesota earlier this year.

The country is going through a period of division and political violence, he said, but “Republicans are not Nazis, Democrats are not evil.”

Patel's opening remarks highlighted his efforts to transform the bureau to focus on combating violent crime.

Patel said the FBI has arrested more than 23,000 violent criminals this year — an increase compared with last year. He also touted the FBI's efforts to target drug trafficking and violent drug cartels.

Critics have raised concerns that the focus on immigration enforcement and violent crime could divert attention from the FBI's ability to focus on matters like counterterrorism.

He has faced some criticism from conservative corners about how he has led the FBI in the wake of the shooting, but Patel told the Senate panel that his agency — “at my direction” — successfully brought the suspect in Charlie Kirk's killing into custody.

He also has touted the number of arrests made by the FBI, saying it represents an increase from the Biden administration.

“We are leading the mission to crush violent crime and defend the homeland,” Patel said.

“We're going to see what happens, because I hear Hamas is trying to use the old human shield deal. And if they do that, they're going to be in big trouble,” Trump said.

Trump in a Monday post on Truth Social said that he had read a news report indicating that Hamas would use the captives as “human shields.”

The Israeli military began a ground offensive targeting Gaza City on Tuesday, slowly squeezing in on the Palestinian territory's largest city that has seen block after block already destroyed in the Israel-Hamas war. Residents still in the city were warned they must leave and head south. The push marks yet another escalation in a conflict that has roiled the Middle East as any potential ceasefire feels even further out of reach despite months of diplomacy.

The president said, “they've been friends of mine for a long time,” called the king an “elegant gentleman” and said, “I think he represents the country so well.”

The president, speaking as he was leaving the White House, said that U.K. officials want to continue trade negotiations during his coming visit.

“They'd like to see if they can get a little bit better deal, so we'll talk to them” he said.

The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dick Durbin, opened his remarks by criticizing Patel for the removal of career FBI officials and the diversion of agents to help with immigration enforcement.

Durbin called Patel “arguably the most partisan FBI director ever,” saying he has “already inflicted untold damage on the FBI.” Durbin accused Patel of putting the country's “national security and public safety at risk.”

The Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee opened the hearing by running through a list of GOP criticisms of FBI investigations related to politics.

Those ranged from the prosecution of White House adviser Peter Navarro for his response to a congressional subpoena, to the probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server.

He also pledged to release new whistleblower records.

Republican Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley opened the hearing expressing sympathy for the fatal shooting last week of Charlie Kirk, which is under FBI investigation.

Grassley decried Kirk's “political assassination,” calling Kirk a “man of God, faith, family and country.” 

Prosecutors are preparing to file a capital murder charge Tuesday against the Utah man who authorities say held a “leftist ideology” and may have been “radicalized” online before he was arrested in the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

Charges against 22-year-old Tyler Robinson are expected to come ahead of Tuesday's first court hearing since he was accused last week of shooting Kirk, a conservative activist credited with energizing the Republican youth movement and helping Donald Trump win back the White House in 2024.

Qatar said Tuesday its ruling emir spoke to the U.S. secretary of state about defense cooperation and the “consequences of the Israeli attack on Doha.”

Majed al-Ansari, a spokesman for Qatar's Foreign Ministry, gave the readout of the talks between Rubio and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.

The two men also spoke about mediation efforts to reach a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, he added, while harshly criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the attack last week on Doha that killed six people.

“If Prime Minister Netanyahu wants peace, he knew the road to peace a long time ago. He just decided not to go through it, and he decided to mediate in bad fate,” al-Ansari said. “And therefore, the questions about the fate of their mediation should be asked of he who is bombing the mediators and those who he is talking with on the negotiating table.”

U.S. indices were mostly higher early Tuesday after Wall Street set new records and investor expectation grew that the Federal Reserve will announce its first interest rate cut of 2025 on Wednesday.

S&P 500 futures rose 0.2% before the bell Tuesday while Big Tech stocks pulled Nasdaq futures 0.3% higher. Futures for the Dow Jones industrials were unchanged.

Oracle shares jumped 5% on speculation it would play a major part in the U.S.-China deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. after the Trump administration announced the framework of a trade deal on Monday.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said after the latest round of trade talks between the world's two largest economies that Trump and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping would speak Friday to possibly finalize the deal.

Shoppers increased their spending at a better-than-expected pace in August from July, helped by back-to-school purchases, even as Trump's tariffs are starting to hurt the job market and lead to price hikes.

Retail sales rose 0.6% last month from July, when sales were up a revised 0.6%, according to the Commerce Department's report. The performance, announced Tuesday, was also likely helped by the continued efforts by Americans to keep pushing up purchases ahead of expected price increases, and higher prices could be bolstering the number as well.

Citing an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship Fulton County District Attorney had with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, the Georgia Court of Appeals had ruled that she and her office not continue to prosecute the election interference case against Donald Trump and others.

Steve Sadow, Trump's attorney in the Georgia case, said in a statement that Willis “deserved nothing less than disqualification.” A spokesperson for Willis did not immediately respond to a text message seeking comment.

The decision means it will be up to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia to find another prosecutor, who could continue on the track that Willis has taken, decide to pursue only some charges or dismiss the case altogether. 

FBI Director Kash Patel will appear before Oversight committees Tuesday and Wednesday as he faces scrutiny over his leadership of the Charlie Kirk investigation and other areas.

ATLANTA (AP) — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they're confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company breaks ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump's successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

Rivian Chief Policy Officer Alan Hoffman said the company believes it can sell electric vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because they're superior.

“We did not build this company based upon federal tax incentives,” Hoffman said. “And we're going to prove that we're going to be successful in the future.”

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian's key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S sport utility vehicle in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making smaller R2 SUVs next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. The company has said the Georgia operation will be able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028. It plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles. 

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it's limiting production now in part to launch 2026 models.




“For Rivian, it's do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can't scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025's first half, according to Cox Automotive. 

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors' slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers. 

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful of the startup automakers.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But the competition now includes Ford's F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado. 

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025's first half.

At the same time, some automakers' ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram's electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian's favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can't benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads. 

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has said he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” acknowledges Rivian faces bumps, but says he remains confident the company can fulfill its promises.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia's Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden's administration in November agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration's hostility toward EVs, Hoffman said Rivian hopes the U.S. Department of Energy will distribute the loan money, arguing it will boost domestic manufacturing.

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Hoffman says Rivian is “in this for the long haul.”

“We think that we can compete with anyone out there and that once given the opportunity, we're going to excel,” he said.

Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., discusses President Donald Trump's crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., and reveals how Congress can avoid a government shutdown on ‘Fox News Live.'

House Republicans have released a plan to avert a government shutdown at the end of this month, and it includes roughly $30 million in additional security funding for lawmakers.

It comes days after Charlie Kirk's assassination last week during a college campus speaking event in Utah.

The measure is mostly a straightforward extension of current government funding levels, called a continuing resolution, or CR, in order to give House and Senate negotiators more time to reach a deal. It would extend through Nov. 21.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he wants to hold a House-wide vote on the measure Friday, after which it will be taken up by the Senate.

SECRET SERVICE UNDER PRESSURE: WHAT KIRK'S ASSASSINATION MEANS FOR TRUMP'S SECURITY

President Donald Trump must sign the measure into law by Oct. 1, the beginning of fiscal year 2026, to avert a government shutdown.

House Administration Committee Chair Bryan Steil, R-Wis., earlier briefed lawmakers on member security options and plans for the funding increase during the House GOP's weekly closed-door conference meeting.

Two sources told Fox News Digital earlier on Tuesday that Steil proposed adding $30 million to a mutual aid fund between Capitol Police and local law enforcement for the duration of the CR, which House leadership sources confirmed would be included in the bill.

""The proposed $30 million plus-up would be into the mutual aid bucket, one of the many programs available. The mutual aid bucket is a program where U.S. Capitol Police reimburses local law enforcement to provide security, traditionally, in a member's district,"" Steil said when asked by reporters after the meeting.

The legislation would also honor the Trump administration's request for an additional $58 million in security funding for the judicial and executive branches.

Another $1 billion would be included in Washington, D.C.'s annual budget, which is allotted by the federal government.

Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wis., said he anticipated that the lawmaker security funding boost in the CR would also make way for discussions for more long-term lawmaker security enhancements, likely in the annual appropriations process for fiscal 2026 funding.

""What you're trying to do, put in perspective, is if you had 24/7 for every member, all 435, it's billions of dollars,"" Fitzgerald told Fox News Digital. ""So we're trying to come up with something that makes sense and that members are comfortable with.""

He continued, referencing the recent assassinations of a Minnesota state Democratic lawmaker and Kirk, ""It's become something that we've already been, since Minnesota, focused on. And now with Charlie Kirk, it's just gone off the charts trying to figure out what you can do.""

And while the desire for added security is palpable among Democratic lawmakers as well, House and Senate Democrats' frustration at being sidelined in government funding discussions has their leaders threatening to oppose the CR en masse.

With a narrow House GOP majority of just two seats, Johnson can afford little dissent among his own conference.

CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION ROCKS CAPITOL HILL, HEIGHTENS LAWMAKERS' SECURITY FEARS

One House Republican told Fox News Digital that Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., raised concerns in the Tuesday morning meeting about current Capitol security being weak.

Burchett, who told Fox News Digital he is still undecided on the bill, confirmed he believed member security measures are inadequate. 

""I've got some real problems there,"" he said, adding of the proposed security increases, ""It's not gonna help with that. That's personnel. That's leadership.""

Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., also all publicly expressed concerns about voting for a CR.

But Johnson argued in a Tuesday press conference that the onus would be on Democrats if they voted against the GOP-led CR.

""Unfortunately, there are some Democrats who are openly pining for a government shutdown in spite of this obvious and necessary step,"" he said. ""Some of them apparently believe that shutting down the government will be some sort of life raft for them so they can regain the support of the American people. I just think that is a fool's gambit.""

He also confirmed that Kirk's assassination gave way to renewed discussions about lawmaker security.

""The tragedy has also initiated a number of uncomfortable but necessary conversations about important issues, like the safety and security of our members and the responsibility of public servants, and the need for political leaders to turn down the temperature and the violent rhetoric in America,"" Johnson said.

FOX Business contributor Katrina Campins analyzes the impact of the Fulton County district attorneys personal relationship with Nathan Wade on Jesse Watters Primetime.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has been permanently sidelined from prosecuting President Donald Trump's election interference case in Georgia after she lost an appeal at the state's highest court. 

The Georgia Court of Appeals in December ruled that Willis and her office could not continue to prosecute the case, citing an ""appearance of impropriety"" stemming from her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.

Willis appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court in January, but on Tuesday the high court declined in a 4-3 decision to take up the case. One judge didn't participate and another was disqualified.

MAURENE COMEY SUES DOJ FOR 'UNLAWFUL' FIRING, DEMANDS REINSTATEMENT

Steve Sadow, Trump's attorney in the Georgia case, welcomed the decision. 

""Willis' misconduct during the investigation and prosecution of President Trump was egregious and she deserved nothing less than disqualification,"" Sadow said in a statement. ""This proper decision should bring an end to the wrongful political, lawfare persecutions of the president.""

Jeff Clarke, a former Justice Department official who is one of 19 defendants indicted under the state's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, said the case now moves to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, which will choose a replacement.

""Praise the Lord for progress in this case. It never should have been brought in the first place,"" he said.

Willis said she disagreed with the decision but would make the case file and evidence available to the Prosecuting Attorneys Council for use in the litigation.

""While I disagree with the decision of the Georgia Court of Appeals and the Georgia Supreme Court's divided decision not to review it, I respect the legal process and the courts,"" Willis said, per Fox Atlanta.

VANCE, BONDI, PATEL TO HUDDLE AT VP RESIDENCE FOR MEETING AMID EPSTEIN FALLOUT

The council's executive director, Pete Skandalakis, said Tuesday he will begin searching for a new prosecutor to replace Willis but didn't know how long that might take. He said once a new prosecutor is appointed it will be ""up to him or her what to do with the case.""

That person could continue on the track Willis had taken, pursue only some charges, or dismiss the case altogether. Finding a prosecutor willing to handle it could be difficult, given its complexity and the resources required.

Even if a new prosecutor tries to follow Willis' path, it seems unlikely Trump could be prosecuted now that he is the sitting president. But 14 other defendants still face charges.

Willis' indictment accused Trump of pressuring officials to overturn the 2020 vote in Georgia, organizing ""fake electors"" and harassing election workers.

A Fulton County grand jury indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, and Trump surrendered at the Fulton County Jail on Aug. 24. That's when the now-famous mugshot was taken — the first ever for a U.S. president.

During the Georgia case, it came to light that Willis was in a romantic relationship with Wade, the special prosecutor she had hired to help lead the case.

The pair eventually acknowledged the relationship but argued it had no impact on the prosecution. Wade later resigned, but the controversy persisted and the Court of Appeals ruled Willis and her entire office had to be disqualified due to the appearance of impropriety.

Ashleigh Merchant, who exposed Willis' romantic relationship with Wade as defense attorney for Trump co-defendant Michael Roman, said: ""We hope this will finally close this chapter.""

'The Big Weekend Show' weighs on the alleged mortgage fraud accusations against Lisa Cook and Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters' call to invoke the 25th Amendment against President Donald Trump.

The Trump administration said Tuesday it would appeal a lower court's decision blocking the president's effort to fire Fed's Lisa Cook to the Supreme Court, an eleventh-hour effort to remove her from the board in the run-up to a crucial interest rate-setting meeting.

White House officials confirmed to Fox News Digital that they will seek to stay the lower court's ruling, and a filing is expected imminently. 

""The president lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. ""The administration will appeal this decision and looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue."" On Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals blocked President Donald Trump from immediately firing Lisa Cook from her role on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, clearing the way for her to participate in a crucial interest rate-setting meeting that begins in a matter of hours.

It was not immediately clear whether the Trump administration would seek an emergency stay from the Supreme Court before the two-day meeting of central bankers kicks off on Tuesday. 

LAWYERS FOR COOK, DOJ TRADE BLOWS AT HIGH-STAKES CLASH OVER FED FIRING

For months, Trump has pressed the Federal Reserve to cut rates in order to help spur the nation's economic growth. Fed watchers broadly expect the central bank to cut rates during the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). 

The outcome of the FOMC meeting impacts every American, with knock-down effects felt in borrowing costs from everything from mortgages to credit cards.

The D.C. Appeals Court ruling also comes as the Senate narrowly voted 48-47 Monday night to approve Trump's Fed board nominee, Stephen Miran. He will also participate in the FOMC meeting that will help decide the direction of the economy.

Trump last month tapped Miran — who currently leads the White House Council of Economic Advisers — to fill the seat vacated by Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler, following her resignation in August. He will finish the remainder of Kugler's term, which ends on Jan. 31, 2026.

SENATE CONFIRMS STEPHEN MIRAN TO FED BOARD AHEAD OF CRUCIAL RATE CUT MEETING

Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb temporarily blocked Cook's firing, allowing her to continue in her current role for now. She said Trump likely violated Cook's due process rights and that the Federal Reserve statute does not account for conduct that occurred before a governor took office, like the mortgage fraud alleged against Cook.

The allegations originated with Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the federal agency that regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

Pulte tied Cook to a trio of properties in Michigan, Georgia, and Massachusetts, which prompted scrutiny over whether Cook had misrepresented how the homes would be used. The three mortgage loans were issued in 2021, before she was nominated by former President Joe Biden to join the Fed board.

Pulte made two separate referrals to the Justice Department over Cook's mortgage applications.

Trump seized on those allegations and ousted Cook on Aug. 25, which prompted her to sue him in federal court three days later. Her lawsuit named as defendants Trump, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.

FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR LISA COOK SUES TRUMP

The suit, which was filed on Aug. 28, centered on whether Trump satisfied the ""for cause"" provisions under federal law required to remove a sitting Fed governor, is the first of its kind. Cook's lawsuit does not address the allegations that she listed multiple houses as a primary residence on mortgage filings.

The Justice Department opened a criminal investigation on Sept. 4 into Cook over allegations of mortgage application fraud. Her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, wrote in a filing on Sept. 2 that she ""did not ever commit mortgage fraud.""

Cook's lawyers have also stressed both in court filings and in arguments before Judge Cobb last month the novelty of Trump's attempt to oust her — a move they argued lacked sufficient cause, and could be used as a dangerous pretext to oust other members of independent federal boards.

Saying that he's ""not done yet,"" Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, on Tuesday launched a campaign for a third term as Minnesota governor.

""We've made historic progress in our state, but we're not done yet,"" Walz wrote in a social media post.

And taking a jab at President Donald Trump and his administration, Walz said in a campaign launch video that ""I'll never stop fighting to protect us from the chaos, corruption and cruelty coming out of Washington.""

""I've seen how we help each other through the hard times,"" Walz added. ""And boy, we've seen terrible times this year. I'm heartbroken and angry about the beautiful people we lost to gun violence. But it's in these moments we have to come together. We can't lose hope because I've seen what we can do when we work together.""

Vice President Kamala Harris picked Walz as her running mate after she replaced President Joe Biden atop the Democrats' national ticket last summer.

Taking aim at Trump and his running mate, now-Vice President JD Vance, Walz criticized the GOP ticket as ""just weird.""

But Trump ended up sweeping all seven key battleground states in last year's presidential election to win back the White House.

TRUMP NOT ON BALLOT BUT FRONT-AND-CENTER IN 2025 ELECTIONS

This year, Walz has kept up his verbal critiques of Trump as the governor has continued to build his national profile.

But the 61-year-old governor was heavily criticized by Republicans after comparing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to Nazi Germany's Gestapo. The governor was called out by congressional Republicans during a June hearing, but he refused to apologize.

Walz, a former high school teacher and football coach, is often mentioned as a possible 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, but he told Axios this summer that he wouldn't seek the White House if he ran for re-election as governor in 2026.

His three months as Harris' running mate put Walz under the glare of the national political spotlight, and brought new scrutiny about his record as governor, and before that as a congressman, and his handling of the violent protests following the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

He was also criticized for exaggerating his rank during his years with the Minnesota National Guard, and was faulted for leaving the military to run for Congress ahead of his unit being deployed to the war in Iraq.

Walz was first elected governor in 2018, winning by 11 percentage points. He won re-election in 2022 by an 8-point margin.

But he'll be bucking history as he runs again in 2026. No Minnesota governor has won a third consecutive term since the state switched to four-year terms six decades ago.

""Governor Tim Walz has been a bold leader for Minnesota, and we're thrilled that he is running again to continue delivering for families across his state. Governor Walz is fiercely dedicated to making life better in Minnesota, cutting taxes for the middle class, going after wasteful spending, and lowering the cost of prescription drugs,"" Gov. Laura Kelly of Kansas, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said in a statement.

But Republican Governors Association communications director Courtney Alexander argued in a statement that ""while Tim Walz is spending his time fundraising with the nation's most liberal donors and pushing the disastrous policies of national Democrats, Minnesota is suffering. Minnesotans deserve a governor who will actually do the job, work for them, and take governing seriously. That's not Tim Walz.""

Former business executive and Army veteran Kendall Qualls and physician and former state Sen. Scott Jensen, the 2022 GOP gubernatorial nominee, are among the candidates running for the Republican nomination.

Fox News correspondent Matt Finn has the latest on the search for a motive in the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on 'Special Report.'

PROVO, Utah – The Utah County Attorney's Office told Fox News they are ""optimistic"" that charges will be filed on Tuesday against Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old Utah native who was arrested last week for the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. 

Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray is planning a noon MDT press conference on Tuesday at the Utah County Health & Justice Building in Provo, Utah – about a 15-minute drive from Utah Valley University's campus, where Kirk was killed less than one week ago. 

The press conference is scheduled as prosecutors approach the three-business-day deadline to issue formal charging documents against Robinson, who was arrested on Friday at his home in Washington, Utah, following a 33-hour manhunt after Kirk was killed Wednesday.

If the attorney's office meets the noon deadline, charges will be announced at the press conference and then Robinson will make his first court appearance at 3 p.m. MDT virtually from the Utah County Jail in Spanish Fork, Utah, where Robinson is being held under ""special watch,"" according to authorities.

If there is a delay announcing Robinson's formal charges, the announcement would slide to Friday as the attorney's office can extend the deadline up to three business days.

DEATH PENALTY LOOMS FOR CHARLIE KIRK'S ACCUSED KILLER, BUT LEGAL BAR IS HIGH AS TRUMP, COX MOUNT PRESSURE

The remote hearing will be livestreamed. The likely brief hearing is intended to inform Robinson of the charges against him and provide him with an attorney if he has not already retained one, Gray shared in a statement to Fox News. 

Robinson ""was arrested and booked into the Utah County Jail early Friday morning on suspicion of committing three crimes related to the murder"" of Kirk, Gray said. Those crimes include aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and a felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury. 

Gray has indicated Robinson's formal charges will likely be consistent with his preliminary charges. Robinson is being held without bail.

""Under Utah law, aggravated murder carries a penalty of either death, life in prison without the possibility of parole, or twenty-five years to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Obstruction of justice carries a penalty of one to fifteen years in prison. Felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury carries a penalty of five years to life in prison,"" the attorney's office shared in a statement. 

If the Utah County Attorney's office meets the Tuesday deadline, charges will be listed on the ""Criminal Information"" document, which will trigger the formal start of the criminal case against Robinson. 

A possible delay would indicate his office requires additional time to prepare the charges, according to Gray.

""Our ability to file charges depends on how quickly we can gather and carefully review mountains of evidence. We will be thorough and deliberate at every stage of this case,"" he said. 

""My office's mission is to protect our community by vigorously investigating and prosecuting crime, compassionately assisting crime victims, and seeking justice for all. We will spare no effort to achieve those ends in this, and every case,"" Gray added. 

Attorney General Derek Brown told Fox News Digital on Friday that Robinson could face a combination of state and federal charges. 

President Donald Trump and Gov. Spencer Cox, R-Utah, have both called for the death penalty against Robinson, which is a possibility under Utah state law.

The media frenzy had mostly dissipated on Utah Valley University's campus on the evening of Monday, Sept. 15, 2025, as students and locals returned to campus to pay their respects to Kirk. 

As campus reopened for UVU students seeking mental health resources and employees returning to work, memorials filled the grass outside campus.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","It's time to end the ‘Gaza genocide' canard","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3807701/time-to-end-gaza-genocide-canard/","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Each new day brings with it the same old accusation, no less poisonous for all the repetition: Israel is committing “genocide” in Gaza. Hostility to Israel expresses itself, now, without apology or any attempt to hide the antisemitism that fuels it.

The Irish broadcaster RTÉ declares that it will boycott the Eurovision 2026 song contest if Israel is permitted to participate. A music festival in Ghent, Belgium, cancels the appearance of the Munich Philharmonic because its conductor is Israeli. The Croatian president refuses to meet Israel's foreign minister, who's on an official visit to Croatia. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez laments that his country “doesn't have nuclear arms.” Why? Because with them, presumably, he could “stop the genocide in Gaza, pursue its perpetrators, and support the Palestinian population.” And European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announces, in a German accent, that the European Union will suspend all payments to Israel in response to the war in Gaza.

WHAT AMERICA COULD LEARN FROM ISRAEL AND UKRAINE

As an American who is proud of his country's unceasing support for Israel, and as a Jew who supports Israel and a number of Jewish causes in this country, Europe, and in the Jewish state itself, I say that it is time to put to rest, definitively and forever, all accusations of Israeli wrongdoing in Gaza. Every single one.

To that end, I urge everyone who reads this piece to read two irrefutable works that establish beyond doubt that Israel is acting fairly, lawfully, and justly in its pursuit of its war of self-defense and self-preservation against Hamas in Gaza. The first is a meticulously researched report, published by the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University, titled “Debunking the Genocide Allegations: A Re-examination of the Israel-Hamas War from October 7, 2023 to June 1, 2025.” The report has four authors, of whom two are distinguished military historians, one an independent quantitative analyst, and one a member of the Israeli bar.

Readers of the Washington Examiner will not, I suspect, need persuading that Israel has waged war with the utmost care and caution. What they will appreciate, however, is the ammunition that a report such as this one from Bar-Ilan University provides ammunition that would help those on the side of Israel to take on and defeat the antisemites, haters, Islamists, and leftists, as well as to debate those in the political mainstream, such as von der Leyen, who are in thrall to the fashionable demonization of Israel.

We can't simply dismiss such people as misguided or as cranks. We must challenge them at every step. No canard must go unanswered.

To those who declare that Israel is intentionally starving the Gazan population, deliberately killing civilians, making no distinction in its use of force between civilians and Hamas terrorists, and conducting disproportionate strikes, I say: Hold your tongue and read this report, which lays out the facts as they are, while pointing out also the factual, political, and ideological manipulation engaged in by Israel's opponents in an attempt to denigrate the Jewish state, and to adjudge it guilty, with no evidence, of “genocide,” that most absolute of human sins of which the Jews themselves are victims.

In recent days, a dubious organization called the International Association of Genocide Scholars passed a resolution stating that Israel was guilty of genocide. Numerous critics have been quick to point out that this association reached its conclusion based on reinterpretations of the conventional definition and laws on genocide in ways that dumbed genocide down, to put it crudely but succinctly.

The Bar-Ilan report addresses the problem: “Much like currency losing value through inflation when printed recklessly, certain terms lose their significance when used indiscriminately. If all high-intensity urban military conflicts in the future — despite significant efforts to protect civilian lives—are labeled as acts of genocide simply because of the immense human suffering they cause, the outcome will be fundamentally contrary to the objectives of international humanitarian law.”

Equally heinous was the decision of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a United Nations initiative, to loosen the definition of famine in such a way as to ensure that conditions in Gaza could be called a “famine,” a classic case of manipulating a definition to serve a blatantly anti-Israel agenda.

Alongside the Bar-Ilan document, I urge you to read Beyond Proportionality: Israel's Just War in Gaza, a book by Thane Rosenbaum, who is a law professor at Touro University. “The moral challenge that Israel faces is unique,” Rosenbaum writes. “When one side is torching infants and gang raping teenagers, what is to be done with such an enemy who exists right next door — especially when the martyrdom of its own people will redound against you?” It is hard, if not impossible, to imagine a civilized society having to fight a more harrowing, more diabolical war.

And yet, Rosenbaum says, Israel has fought its demonic enemy by the book. While the world asks Israel to endure whatever the barbarians can do to it, Israel's government and soldiers, the men and women of the exemplary Israel Defense Forces, in so many ways the most moral army in the world, have fought not just against Hamas but also against the moral relativism with which the world confronts Israel.

THE HAMAS UNIT THAT HUNTS PALESTINIANS

As Rosenbaum explains, Israel's military actions, against Hamas terrorists in Gaza and against Hamas leaders in their safe havens abroad, have been tailored carefully to the laws of war. Their targets have always been terrorists, tunnels, weapons caches, and logistics centers, not civilians. Those who say otherwise are driven not by an understanding of the laws in question, but by a desire to back Israel so far into a corner that its very survival becomes precarious.

In fighting the war against Hamas in this meticulous, conscientious, and unwaveringly humane way, Israel has put its own soldiers in danger as they fight from house to house. But that, of course, is the price a civilized people must pay to protect their civilization — our civilization. And it is a price that Israel has paid willingly — for itself, and for all of us.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Georgia Supreme Court rejects Fani Willis appeal in Trump election case","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3809149/georgia-supreme-court-rejects-fani-willis-appeal-trump-election-case/","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 14:42:33 GMT","

The Georgia Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, leaving in place a lower-court ruling that disqualified her from prosecuting President Donald Trump in the state's 2020 election interference and racketeering indictment.

The decision, announced Tuesday, ends Willis's bid to remain on the high-profile RICO case and transfers prosecutorial responsibility to a new attorney. The justices voted 4-3 to reject the appeal, with one justice disqualified and another not participating, according to court filings cited by the Associated Press.

“The Georgia Supreme Court has correctly denied review of the Georgia Court of Appeals decision disqualifying DA Fani Willis and her office as prosecutors in the Fulton County RICO case,” said Steve Sadow, Trump's lead defense attorney. “Willis's misconduct during the investigation and prosecution of President Trump was egregious and she deserved nothing less than disqualification. This proper decision should bring an end to the wrongful political, lawfare persecutions of the President.”

Willis was removed after revelations that she concealed a romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she hired in 2021 to help lead the case. Defense attorneys alleged the relationship constituted a conflict of interest and undermined public confidence in the prosecution, and they also claimed that she received illegal kickbacks. Though Wade resigned in March 2024 following a ruling by Judge Scott McAfee that either he or Willis had to step aside, the Georgia Court of Appeals ruled in December 2024 that Willis's continued involvement in the case was untenable.

In that 2-1 decision issued in December, judges on the appellate panel said the appearance of impropriety could not be cured by Wade's resignation alone. The decision effectively barred Willis and the entire Fulton County District Attorney's Office from participating in the case.

Willis petitioned the state's highest court for review in January, arguing that no Georgia court had ever disqualified a prosecutor for mere appearance issues without proof of actual misconduct. She also contended that the appeals court overstepped by reversing the trial court's discretionary ruling.

With the state Supreme Court's denial, the case must now be reassigned to an entirely new prosecutorial office. The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia will oversee the appointment process. It remains unclear whether the new prosecutor will pursue the full slate of charges Willis brought, limit the scope of the case, or drop it altogether.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON THE RISE IN THE US: A TIMELINE OF KEY INCIDENTS

The case stems from an August 2023 indictment accusing Trump and 18 others of participating in a racketeering conspiracy to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results. The charges center, in part, on Trump's phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which the president urged officials to “find” enough votes to reverse the outcome.

President Donald Trump is suing the New York Times for $15 billion, claiming the publication defamed him. 

He called the New York Times a “full-throated mouthpiece of the Democratic Party” and pinpointed several pieces leading up to the 2024 presidential election that he said were written to cause the president “reputational and economic harm.” Trump's lawyers filed the defamation lawsuit on his behalf in the Middle District of Florida late Monday night. 

The 85-page complaint names the New York Times Company, publishing company Penguin Random House, and New York Times writers Susanne Craig, Russ Buettner, Peter Baker, and Michael Schmidt as individual defendants. 

The lawsuit names several articles by the four reporters and one book published by Penguin Random House and written by Craig and Buettner, Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father's Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success. Trump's lawyers said the pieces “are part of a decades-long pattern by the New York Times of intentional and malicious defamation against President Trump.”

“The subject matter of this action—a malicious, defamatory, and disparaging book written by two of its reporters and three false, malicious, defamatory, and disparaging articles, all carefully crafted by Defendants, with actual malice, calculated to inflict maximum damage upon President Trump, and all published during the height of a Presidential Election that became the most consequential in American history—represent a new journalistic low for the hopelessly compromised and tarnished ‘Gray Lady,'” Trump's lawyers wrote in the complaint.

Trump is bringing two counts of defamation against all defendants, meaning he believes they made false statements to injure his reputation. His lawyers clarified in the complaint that the defendants wrote the articles and book with “actual malice,” meaning they “published such statements negligently, with knowledge of the falsity of the statements, and/or with reckless disregard of their truth or falsity.”

Trump claimed the Lucky Loser book is “false, malicious, and defamatory,” listing several statements in the text he said Craig and Buettner knew were false when written, including statements about Trump's disposition on his show The Apprentice versus in real life and about receiving money from his father through fraudulent schemes.

The first article Trump referenced in the complaint as “defamatory, malicious, and false” is an article by Craig and Buettner written in the lead-up to the book's publication, “The Star-Making Machine That Created ‘Donald Trump.'” The second is a piece written by Baker called “For Trump, a Lifetime of Scandals Heads Toward a Moment of Judgment.” The third is a piece written by Schmidt called “As Election Nears, Kelly Warns Trump Would Rule Like a Dictator”.

TRUMP TO TARGET ‘RADICAL-LEFT' GROUPS FUNDING VIOLENCE THAT LED TO CHARLIE KIRK'S DEATH

Trump announced the lawsuit first on Truth Social.

“Today, I have the Great Honor of bringing a $15 Billion Dollar Defamation and Libel Lawsuit against The New York Times, one of the worst and most degenerate newspapers in the History of our Country, becoming a virtual ‘mouthpiece' for the Radical Left Democrat Party,” Trump posted. “I view it as the single largest illegal Campaign contribution, EVER. Their Endorsement of Kamala Harris was actually put dead center on the front page of The New York Times, something heretofore UNHEARD OF!” 

The New York Times responded to the lawsuit in a statement posted on X.

“This lawsuit has no merit,” a spokesperson said. “It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics. We will continue to pursue the facts without fear or favor and stand up for journalists' First Amendment right to ask questions on behalf of the American people.”

The president's lawsuit came after he threatened to sue the newspaper last week for publishing articles about a note and drawing, supposedly by Trump, that was given to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. Trump has denied that the note was from him. He has also sued the Wall Street Journal over reporting related to the note and drawing.

“The ‘Times' has engaged in a decades long method of lying about your Favorite President (ME!), my family, business, the America First Movement, MAGA, and our Nation as a whole,” Trump said in his post. “I am PROUD to hold this once respected ‘rag' responsible, as we are doing with the Fake News Networks such as our successful litigation against George Slopadopoulos/ABC/Disney, and 60 Minutes/CBS/Paramount, who knew that they were falsely ‘smearing' me through a highly sophisticated system of document and visual alteration, which was, in effect, a malicious form of defamation, and thus, settled for record amounts.”

As mentioned in the social media post, it is not the first time Trump has sued a news company. Previously, Trump sued ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos for comments he made in an interview with Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC), claiming that Trump had been found liable for rape. Trump reached a settlement deal with the network and anchor in December 2024 in which they agreed to pay the president $15 million in exchange for dropping his lawsuit. 

MSNBC ANALYST MATTHEW DOWD FIRED AFTER ‘INSENSITIVE' CHARLIE KIRK SHOOTING REMARKS

In July 2025, Trump and Paramount Global reached a $16 million settlement over a lawsuit the president filed against CBS News for the network allegedly editing an interview between then-Democratic candidate for president, Vice President Kamala Harris, and 60 Minutes correspondent Bill Whitaker. The interview occurred just weeks before the 2024 presidential election, and Trump called it “the biggest scandal in broadcast history.” He claimed CBS News “took her answer out and gave her a different answer after it was shot.”

The network denied the claims but admitted it was edited due to time constraints.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The top Republican in the Colorado House, Rose Pugliese, resigned from office Monday following clashes with Democratic lawmakers in a special session and a scandal involving a secret photograph of another lawmaker.

In a letter to her supporters, Pugliese said she was leaving elected office to focus on her children.

“I have spent the months reflecting on my life choices, especially in relation to my children. As a single mom, I raise my two children on my own. I am all that they have. There is nothing more important in my life than them. They have made so many sacrifices for me to be able to represent you. But they also need their mom right now, and I need to keep them safe,” she wrote. 

She was elected to be the Colorado House Minority Leader in 2024 after former Colorado House Minority Leader Mike Lynch resigned after failing to disclose an arrest for drunk driving and possessing a firearm while intoxicated.

Her resignation comes after she clashed with Democrats on the Colorado House floor during a special session. The clashes followed the abrupt resignation of Republican state Rep. Ryan Armagost, the former House minority whip, who took a picture of a Democratic lawmaker without her knowledge during floor proceedings. 

He then sent that picture of Democratic state Rep. Yara Zokaie to fellow Republican state lawmakers, some of whom compared her outfit to that of a stripper and a prostitute. The photo then became the subject of a social media harassment campaign against Zokaie.

Pugliese was in the group chat where the photo was posted and crudely discussed, but she did not engage in the comments about Zokaie. She removed Armagost from his committee assignments three months after she knew the photo had been sent in the group chat.

The Federal Reserve is all but certain to cut interest rates for the first time since President Donald Trump regained office. Here is what to expect.

The Federal Open Market Committee is meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday to decide what to do with interest rates for the sixth time this year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will lead the meeting, which comes amid new concerning data showing a slowing labor market, and will likely be the most closely watched meeting of Trump's second term.

Investors expect that this will be the meeting where the central bank pivots, switching from keeping interest rates high to beginning the gradual process of loosening monetary policy. Powell will have to thread a careful needle with how the Fed starts to cut rates, because too much too soon could further ignite inflation, while too little too late could send the economy into a recession.

“He has a tough job, no doubt about it,” Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, told the Washington Examiner.

Trump and his allies have been aggressively agitating for lower interest rates for months. He has argued that the Fed and Powell are holding back the economy and that lower interest rates would help consumers.

To understand the Fed's position, one needs to understand its dual mandate. The Fed's central mission is to balance the need for price stability while pushing for full employment.

For years, the Fed has been working to stifle inflation, which exploded under former President Joe Biden and has since remained too high. The Fed's goal is 2% long-run inflation, which is considered healthy price growth.

But now, there are signs that the labor market is weakening. Job numbers from past months have been revised down, raising concerns about an economic slowdown. There are increasing fears of a recession, which would be a worst-case scenario for the Fed, Trump, and Republicans heading into the midterm election season.

Crucially, despite expectations for an interest rate cut, inflation is still too high.

Inflation, tracked by the consumer price index, rose to 2.9% in August. The producer price index report showed that annual inflation unexpectedly fell seven-tenths of a percentage point to 2.6% for the year ending in August.

The Fed's preferred gauge of inflation held steady at 2.6% for the year ending July, the most recent reading.

Some might think that the Fed cutting rates right now could cause inflation to go back up, but Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, said that even with the expected 0.25% interest rate cut, rates would still be considered elevated.

“We should be mindful that rates would still be restrictive with even this modest easing,” Hamrick told the Washington Examiner. “So it's not as if they're removing all restriction, they're just simply removing some.”

Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, also pointed out that there are still lingering concerns about how the tariffs might affect the inflationary calculus.

Trump's tariff agenda has been one of the most aggressive in modern history, and while some argue that they will represent a one-time price adjustment, others fear more lasting effects. Powell said that the Fed is monitoring the tariff situation.

While Trump has vociferously pushed for lower interest rates, the Fed operates independently of the White House, and driving the speculation of a rate cut at this meeting has to do with the labor market, not the president.

Over the past several weeks, a series of data has shown that the jobs market is notably weaker than previously reported.

The economy added just 22,000 jobs in August, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. Also, the July jobs report revealed that some 258,000 fewer jobs were added in May and June than previously reported. 

Additionally, the government announced that labor market growth for the 12 months ending in March was 911,000 jobs less than previously reported.

Also, consumer sentiment fell to the lowest level since May this month, according to a preliminary reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index released last Friday.

“This is a slowing economy,” Long said. “I've been calling it a slow-speed economy right now, and the concern is that slow speed turns to stall speed. The labor market has been frozen for months with almost no hiring outside of healthcare and AI.”

The Fed's current interest rate target is between 4.25% to 4.50%. Most Fed watchers predict that the likely rate cut will be by 0.25%, the typical size of rate revisions. While that will be welcome news for those pushing for lower rates, Trump has advocated for much deeper cuts.

Investors put the odds of a quarter-percentage-point cut at about 96% and an even bigger half-percentage-point revision at 4%.

But some other key insights into the FOMC's thinking will be revealed after the conclusion of the meeting on Wednesday. Namely, what is known as the “dot plot.” The dot plot is a visual survey that shows where each member thinks interest rates should be in the coming months and years.

“I think that there's a high likelihood that that they'll say that it may well be prudent to cut rates further, but they will take that as a meeting-by-meeting issue,” Hamrick said.

Powell's post-decision press conference will also be closely watched. During the meeting, he will field questions from the press for about an hour. His responses have the ability to move markets.

The intrigue surrounding this meeting makes it even more closely watched. Trump has long pushed for lower interest rates, so his reaction to the meeting is hotly anticipated.

Also, new Fed governor Stephen Miran will be part of the FOMC decision after being confirmed by the Senate along party lines just hours before the two-day meeting began. He is replacing Fed governor Adriana Kugler, who unexpectedly stepped aside last month. Her term ended in January, and Miran is set to serve out the remainder of her term.

Democrats and some Fed experts have criticized Miran for only opting to take an unpaid leave of absence and not resigning from his job as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Trump has also attempted to fire another sitting Fed governor, Lisa Cook. Trump announced his plan to fire and replace her after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte accused her of mortgage fraud, but Cook filed a lawsuit and a judge recently issued a temporary restraining order blocking the move.

Trump's opponents say the accusations are a pretext to fire a monetary policy committee member and put in a replacement who is more amenable to cutting interest rates and supporting the president's goals.

FED RATE CUTS COULD BRING HOUSING RELIEF SOUGHT BY TRUMP

Fed independence has increasingly become a focus, and Roach predicted that Powell might face questions about it during his press conference.

“Fed independence, that topic might come up in the press conference, and I think Powell is going to keep that short and sweet,” Roach told the Washington Examiner. “He's going to say, I'm not influenced by politics, end of discussion.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

An appeals court rejected President Donald Trump's effort to remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook from her position.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2-1 against Trump's bid for emergency relief to fire Cook before the two-day Fed meeting on Tuesday. The court ruled that she will stay in her position as she litigates her dispute with the president. Trump is likely to seek aid from the Supreme Court, but it's unlikely a ruling will be made before the meeting begins.

In a concurring opinion written by Judge Bradley Garcia, joined by Judge Michelle Childs, he argued that Cook is likely to succeed in her case against Trump, so she should remain in her position for the time being.

“Given that Cook has a property interest in her position, she is entitled to ‘some kind' of process before removal,” Garcia wrote. “Before this court, the government does not dispute that it provided Cook no meaningful notice or opportunity to respond to the allegations against her. The government argues only that Cook ‘does not explain what difference a hearing would have made.' Even accepting that premise, Cook's entitlement to process stands apart from whether she would succeed in securing a different outcome.”

Trump announced Cook's firing last month over mortgage fraud allegations made by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. Cook sued over the firing, being granted a temporary restraining order by Judge Jia Cobb last week.

“The public interest in Federal Reserve independence weighs in favor of Cook's reinstatement,” Cobb wrote in an opinion on her decision.

Cook first declared her intention to stay in her position just hours after Trump announced her firing.

JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP FROM FIRING FED GOVERNOR LISA COOK

“President Trump purported to fire me ‘for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so,” she said.

Thank you for your series of articles on nuclear warfare. I was especially moved by the essays on Japanese internment and Kurt Vonnegut, but all of them led me to wonder why we humans seem so incapable of learning from the past.

Noah Hawley was correct to note that our current age is rife with innovations that are technically sweet but have rarely been subjected to the question Just because we can, should we? I wonder what Vonnegut would say if he were alive today.

Ellen Vliet Cohen Arlington, Mass.

One question is not answered in The Atlantic's August issue: What can really be done to rid the world of nuclear weapons? Perhaps it is time that this topic reentered public discussion.

My proposal is that the 186 countries that don't have nuclear weapons assemble and draft an ultimatum to the countries that do, stating that unless the nuclear-armed states get rid of their weapons, they, the non-nuclear-armed states, will band together to conduct the research and development necessary for each of them to have their own weapons. That's it. Risky? Yes. But is it riskier than the present situation? Perhaps not. Ross Andersen, in “The New Arms Race,” predicts that the nuclear club may double under existing conditions. Staying on the present course assures us of only one thing: that we will eventually, by intention, misjudgment, human or technological error, or just plain bad luck accomplish our mutual assured destruction. The ultimatum risks nothing more than that.

How can I describe the feeling I had when I turned to “The Light of a Man-Made Star” and saw the photographs from Michael Light's 100 Suns? First among them is a photograph of the Hood test, to which I, as a small child, was exposed. My father, a mineral exploration geologist interested in uranium, had brought my brother, mother, and me to Nevada that summer.

I was young, and my memories of that time are few: lifting my pillow off the floor in the bunkhouse to expose a rattlesnake, the ghostly rise and fall of a player piano's keys. Years later, many residents of the area contracted cancer from the fallout. Danger, secrecy, and the unnatural—these were the hallmarks of my own private nuclear age.

The following year, in 1958, my father went to work on a feasibility study for Project Chariot, to determine whether the government should use nuclear devices to bomb a harbor into the coast of northwestern Alaska. The project was classified, and he didn't speak of it until the year I turned 12, when I accidentally discovered a book-length document titled “The Effects of Nuclear Weapons” in our bookcase. The chapter that I most remember was titled “Effects on Personnel.” It contained photographs of hibakusha—Japanese atomic-bomb survivors—with their bodies exposed to display the kimono patterns that had been burned into their backs. I've never shaken these images from my mind, or forgotten that those photographed were treated in the text not as victims but as subjects of an experiment.

My father continued to prospect in Alaska for radioactive minerals. The summer before the Cuban missile crisis, he found a large deposit of beryllium, an element crucial to the workings of nuclear weapons; it earned him a write-up in Newsweek and a citation from the Alaska legislature. I grew up to become an English professor, and I taught Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle in a course on nuclear issues that I developed in the early 2000s. Vonnegut's portrayal of Felix Hoenikker struck close to home.

I read “Damn You All to Hell!,” Tom Nichols's article discussing films about nuclear war, with interest. He left out an obscure contribution to the genre: In 1964, Rod Serling wrote a TV movie starring Peter Sellers, Carol for Another Christmas, which portrayed a nightmarish future of nuclear destruction. My father was active in groups that urged a nuclear-test-ban treaty. He was so impressed with the movie that he bought a copy, got a projector and a screen, and went around Chicago showing it to anybody who would watch. I was a teenager and it frightened me—it seemed that we were all doomed to die in nuclear war. The movie remains worth a watch today.

Judith Jacobson Baltimore, Md.

I appreciated “Damn You All to Hell!” and could relate to Tom Nichols's anecdote about teaching today's students about nuclear war. After 23 years on active duty in the Army, I also went into academia, teaching courses in political science and intelligence studies. When I first taught a class on homeland security, I shared videos of “duck and cover” drills and received similarly incredulous reactions from my students, who after 9/11 were living with the threat of terrorism—not nuclear war. At one of the colleges where I taught, I had a colleague who owned a home with a fallout shelter constructed in the 1960s. I took students to see it so they could imagine what it would have been like to actually live there. It wasn't until I showed them the 1999 movie Blast From the Past, however, that they fully grasped what a fallout shelter would have to look like for a family to survive a nuclear war.

Eleven years ago, I visited Manzanar with my wife, never having known that such a place existed. We were told that the word manzanar means “apple orchard” in Spanish, because the land where the internment site stood had originally been an apple orchard. Now, we discovered, it was a national historic site. Trying to imagine life in the prison camp was impossible. We couldn't visualize how families had been ripped from their homes and crammed into barracks surrounded by guard towers and barbed wire. Our visit ended in Manzanar's cemetery, which people still visit to see the graves of their ancestors. What we did not hear or see were the firsthand stories of the people who lived there. Andrew Aoyama's “The Expatriate,” about Joseph Kurihara, was an article we needed to read, even 11 years later.

Richard Grove Philadelphia, Pa.

I appreciated Jeffrey Goldberg's article, “Nuclear Roulette,” which quotes me in its last sentence: “Most of all, we forget the rule articulated by the mathematician and cryptologist Martin Hellman: that the only way to survive Russian roulette is to stop playing.”

Society neglects the nuclear threat at its peril. If we would honestly face that threat—and others, such as climate change—they could transform into opportunities to finally build the more peaceful, cooperative world we have dreamed of for ages, but thought ourselves incapable of achieving. To quote a paper I wrote some years ago, “Technology has given a new, global meaning to the Biblical injunction: ‘I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life that you and your descendants may live.' ”

He didn't just want to win elections. He wanted to win a generation.

“We finally meet,” Charlie Kirk said to me.

I'd come to a Phoenix hotel in September 2022 to see Kirk host a conference on the offenses of the “radical left.” I remember that he gripped my hand, unbuttoned his suit jacket, and then eyed the long table in the drab, airless meeting room where I'd sat waiting for him. “This is like a show trial,” he said.

Kirk wanted to debate, which was his stock-in-trade. By the time we met, I'd been reporting on him for several years—about his campaign tactics, his opposition to coronavirus-vaccine mandates, and his mission to remake American education—and he didn't like my coverage. “We disagree,” he told me. But he was also disarming, appreciating that we shared Chicago roots and joking that my round, thin-rimmed glasses made me look “woke.” Maybe he saw me as a prospect for conversion. “So how do you view the world?” he asked me. I told him that my job as a reporter was figuring things out and explaining them to the public.

In that spirit, I want to explain a few things that I learned about Kirk that day. The interview was off the record. But last week, after Kirk's assassination, his spokesperson told me that I could bring his words to the public. Over the course of an hour with me, Kirk reflected candidly on his priorities and—it's strange to write this now—on his own legacy. He wasn't trying to win the next election, he made clear to me, so much as an entire generation.

Read: What if this is a turning point?

Kirk didn't want to be seen principally as a political activist. Because of his success in mobilizing voters to elect Donald Trump, he's often portrayed that way. But electoral politics accounted for only a small part of his work, he told me. He professed to be less interested in evaluating the merits of political candidates than in arguing, for example, about “the Marxist construction of labor.” He didn't just want to change how people voted; he wanted to change how they thought. “You can decide to believe me or not, but the politics stuff, I'm just kind of like …” he trailed off and shrugged. “I do show up to the events, happy to see it. I'm more focused on educational, transformational, multi-decade change.”

I believed him. This is why Kirk spent hours each week ministering to young people on his podcast, The Charlie Kirk Show. It's why he steered his conservative youth organization, Turning Point USA, to churches and schools, not just to voting booths. “It's fine, I love Trump, all that,” he told me, but he lamented that Turning Point's political victories attracted “all the sexy headlines,” that “Trump-endorsed group” was its primary identifier. “See, politics is always an outgrowth,” he said. “If you're able to get people to believe philosophy, anything's possible.”

As Kirk pivoted our conversation from politics—the upcoming midterms, plans for 2024—to religious faith, his voice rose. Countering left-wing ideas, he told me, “that's the thing that fires me up the most.” He spoke of his desire to imbue young people with Judeo-Christian values to help them build a “cogent worldview” and reject policies that he opposed, such as “stupid race stuff.” A year earlier, he had formed a religious branch of Turning Point called TPUSA Faith, which used summits, study groups, and online courses to spread ideas about the Christian foundations of the United States and “eliminate wokeism from the American pulpit.”

With missionary zeal, he laid out his catechism for me: “What does it mean to be a biblical citizen? Where do rights come from? What kind of form of government is best? Who are you as a human being? Why does that matter? Does the Bible have an intent to how we actually create a system of order?” He dispensed with one-line answers and spoke in full paragraphs, showcasing the rhetorical style that made him appealing to his followers. “Was the founding of the nation a deist roll of the dice, or was there a robust Protestant movement,” he asked, “actually laid into this complex, incredible experiment that we still live through?”

He told me about his techniques, how he built his flock by keeping them entertained. “You can't keep on doing the same thing over and over again,” he said, quickening his speech. “You gotta be sharp; you gotta be new; you gotta be fresh; you gotta know your stuff.” I asked Kirk how he kept sharp. “I've been reading a lot of old stuff,” he said, with the pride of an autodidact: “Aristotle's Politics, Metaphysics, the Ethics; Plato's Republic; love Augustine, Aquinas.” He argued that America's founding principles drew from the well of evangelical Protestantism, the ideas about Christian faith propounded by the preachers of the Great Awakening—Jonathan Edwards, Jonathan Mayhew, George Whitefield.

Kirk aimed to create a modern-day religious revival that would convert unbelievers into biblical citizens. On his podcast and in his public appearances, he launched blistering attacks on Muslims, racial minorities, and transgender identity (the last, he said, was “a throbbing middle finger to God”). He argued that America was being threatened by immigration, affirmative action, feminism, environmental regulation, and the separation of Church and state—and that it could be saved only through a recommitment to the Bible, faith, and family. “That's my passion,” he told me.

Read: A new and dangerous kind of fame

His pulpits of choice had always been at educational institutions—colleges and high schools across the country. Kirk viewed Turning Point's field program, aimed at establishing campus chapters to promote conservative viewpoints, as his greatest accomplishment. “You say, ‘What's my baby?' That's the thing I love,” he told me. Polls in the years since I spoke with him, along with the results of the 2024 election, reflect the headway he made, especially with young men. His organization's platform at high schools, in particular, afforded him influence—“persuasive ability to really make people think differently” while they were still impressionable. “When we're approaching 1,000 high-school chapters, which we'll hit in the next 18 months, that's a big deal,” he said. “That's a very big educational monolith.”

Kirk had even bigger ambitions. In the months before I spoke with him, he introduced a new educational initiative, Turning Point Academy, which pledged to combat what it called “woke ideology” in public education by forming Christian schools “where all areas of study are rooted in God's truth.” The project promised to transform Turning Point's education work from recruiting at existing schools—encouraging students to engage in political activism and change their community—into creating an alternative. There would be “teacher training, curriculum, podschooling, homeschooling,” he said, marketed to “people who believe in a free society, the constitutional order, all the stuff we believe in.” It would offer a nine-month “Prep Year” program for high-school graduates.

He seemed unfazed by a setback in his efforts to develop K–12 educational curricula that I'd uncovered: Plans for an online academy marketing an “America-first education” had fallen apart. “A mountain of a molehill,” he said of my story, telling me that I would see that “God works mysteriously.” What did that mean, I asked, in tangible terms? The first brick-and-mortar Turning Point school, Dream City Christian, had just been inaugurated in the Phoenix area, Kirk told me, promising that he would soon plant Turning Point schools in every major metropolitan area—an ambition that remains very far off. “Education, I think, is the greatest growth opportunity in the next 50 years,” he said.

Kirk was then nearing 30, and I wondered what would come next. “How do you run a youth organization if you're no longer in your 20s or 30s?” I asked him. He said that he was confident about his legacy and that he saw himself not as the symbol of a student group, but as the leader of an educational juggernaut. “People can run colleges when they're 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years old,” he told me. “So you can be in the education space the rest of your life.” (In the days after his death, his team said that Turning Point USA had received 32,000 inquiries about forming new campus chapters.)

“Look, here's the thing,” Kirk told me. “We're here to win.”

He meant more than the upcoming midterms or the next presidential election. “Politics, it's fine,” he told me. “It's just that politics is moments in time.” Kirk wanted to refashion America itself, and he believed that he was laying the spiritual foundations for it.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The contradictions at the heart of this fundamental right in democracies.﻿

Free speech is the foundation of democracy. It's the lifeblood of a liberal society. Saying what you want to say, what you need to say, is the top spot in the bill of rights for a reason, right?

But speech is also powerful. And slippery. And people can use it in dangerous, unpredictable, chaotic ways. So how do we manage that tension? Should free speech be a little less free? Or is it truly an unimpeachable right?

The dangers and virtues of free speech have gained new relevance after the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. He has been praised in death by those on the right and beyond as an exemplar of free speech — debating his ideological foes on college campuses and speaking his mind on his podcast. But he has also been held up as an enemy of free speech by his critics — having set up a “watchlist” online of college professors deemed insufficiently deferential to conservatives, explicitly encouraging visitors to intimidate and report them, and having frequently denigrated the democratic value and participation of minorities, women, and his political opponents. Now, politicians, businesses, and media organizations are firing and threatening people who have criticized Kirk after his death — in other words, punishing them for their speech.

Fara Dabhoiwala is a historian at Princeton and the author of a new book called What Is Free Speech?: The History of a Dangerous Idea. A few weeks ago, before Kirk's death, I invited Dabhoiwala onto The Gray Area to talk about the contradictions at the heart of free speech, how the concept was invented, who it empowered, and what it's become in the digital age.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

I want to start with the myth of free speech. Most people treat it as a timeless, universal, almost sacred ideal. Your book takes a hammer to that. Why did you think it was important to challenge that story?

Because it's central to modern culture and because the way we talk about it is often wrong. We all believe in freedom of expression, and rightly so. But two things get missed.

First, psychologically, no one likes being told what to say or not to say. That instinct is powerful. Second, we misunderstand free speech if we try to define it purely from first principles — philosophical or judicial. You can't really grasp it without history.

A decade ago, I toured with a previous book on the history of sex. I saw how differently people could — or couldn't — speak about it in different cultures. In China, where it was translated, the text itself was censored; I saw up close how comprehensive the censorship apparatus is. That trip made me ask: If we in the West value free expression so deeply, where does that idea come from? Why do we disagree so sharply about what it means? Those are historical questions, so that's where I went.

If you asked most people to define free speech, they'd say it's the absence of censorship. Simple and clean. What's wrong with that?

It's seductive and incomplete. We presume that if you remove censorship, you automatically expand freedom. But freedom of speech has a shape: It's about who is speaking, to whom, and in what context. Some people's freedom is greater than others, even within the same society. Historically, for example, women's voices were less likely to be taken seriously than men's. That's not solved by simply abolishing a censor's office. Power and context still shape expression.

Part of your argument is that free speech has never been a coherent ideal — and it can't be — because it denies two basic facts about communication: speech is an action in the world, and it's context-dependent. Can you lay that out?

Speech is an action. Voltaire once wrote to a friend, “I write in order to act.” We speak and publish to have effects in the world. Free speech doctrine — especially in its hardest American form — pretends there's a neat line between speech and action. That's just not true. Speech is a particular kind of action. Often it's trivial, but it can be consequential.

And communication is exquisitely context-dependent. Meaning changes depending on who speaks, where, why, and to whom. A president's remarks on television aren't the same as a late-night bar conversation. A joke about a sensitive topic lands differently depending on the speaker and the audience. A content-only approach — “the right to say X words” — ignores the reality that those same words can mean very different things in different contexts.

Many people call themselves free speech absolutists. To be one, do you have to deny those realities?

If you're an absolutist, you're forced to wave away questions of harm and context. And there's a further point: because speech is action, it can be harmful to individuals and to the public good. Defamation can destroy reputations and livelihoods. Conspiracy theories can wreck public discourse and incite violence. Societies have always known this and regulated speech accordingly.

Absolutism feels virtuous — you're for freedom and against censorship. But it also spares you the hard thinking about the real effects of communication. In practice, nobody is truly absolutist. Even the most libertarian judges in US history have drawn lines about disrupting a courtroom, about targeted harassment, about time, place, and manner. Everyone balances, whether they admit it or not.

The hard question is where to draw the line between offense and harm. Offense has to be permitted in a free society. Harm is trickier, and that border will always be contested. 

Yes. We're always balancing on slippery slopes. That's what living in a free, democratic society means. The boundaries should be as capacious as possible, and “harm” should be defined narrowly. Laws are blunt tools; they can't capture the nuance of communication and are easily weaponized.

But one way to be less confused is to distinguish kinds of expression. Artistic expression should get the broadest latitude: offense isn't harm, and literal truth isn't the point. Political speech is different. Truth matters in democratic discourse. If we allow conspiracy and intentional falsehood to swamp the public sphere without guardrails, democracy corrodes. Different arenas call for different considerations.

It's striking how people's views on “harmful speech” map onto their place in the power hierarchy. The movement that shouts “free speech” when it's out of power often suppresses it when it's in power.

That's perennial. “Free speech” has always been a weaponized slogan. It's invoked to advance whatever one's current political aims happen to be. That hypocrisy isn't new; it's built into the incoherence of the slogan.

Let's talk about amplification. Not just the right to speak, but the power to be heard. Is that a form of power?

Absolutely. And it's the missing piece in most modern debates. We tend to imagine free speech as a duel between an individual speaker and the state. We ignore the media — the institutions that amplify or muffle voices. In the 19th century, people already saw that mass media shape whose voices are heard and what counts as legitimate opinion. Their incentives — profit, political influence — often run against truth-seeking.

Today, online platforms play that role. Their algorithms constantly elevate some speech and bury other speech. If free speech aims to advance truth and enable an equitable public sphere, then the power of amplification has to be part of the equation.

Before the First Amendment, was free speech ever treated as an inherent, fundamental, limitless right?

No. Before the 18th century, the focus was on limiting the harms of expression — to individuals and to the community. People had learned from grim experience that unpoliced rumor and falsehood lead to riots, pogroms, and chaos. The English-speaking world passed its first law against “false news” in 1275.

Modern “liberty of the press” emerges in early 18th-century England for contingent reasons. Prepublication censorship lapses; print explodes; parties use newspapers as weapons. The slogan “liberty of the press” catches on, but it's always paired with anxiety about “licentiousness” and abuses of liberty. No one believed the right was absolute.

Most Americans have never heard of Cato's Letters, yet you argue they're foundational to our tradition. What were they?

A weekly column that ran in London starting in 1721, written by two anonymous journalists. Much of it recycled republican theory — Locke, Machiavelli — into bite-sized attacks on the government. But in the middle of this very derivative project was something strikingly original: a proto-absolutist theory of free speech. They argued that free speech is the most fundamental right; any restriction is a slide into tyranny; and speech can't cause real harm compared to the harms of censorship.

It was tailor-made for colonial America. The rhetoric suited revolutionaries who wanted to portray imperial authorities as tyrants. The ideas from Cato's Letters flowed into American pamphlets and, ultimately, the First Amendment's rhetoric.

And your research suggests the authors weren't exactly disinterested philosophers.

Far from it. The text doubled as a defense of their own partisan practices. They denounced corruption while participating in it — switching sides for money, seeking government patronage. One of the authors even became a government propagandist. The irony is that their simplistic theory outlived the grubby reality that produced it, crossing the Atlantic and lodging in American political culture.

John Stuart Mill is the modern giant here. What's his role?

Mill's On Liberty is a landmark and remains inspiring, and his defense of “experiments in living” is profound. But as a theory of speech, it's less coherent than people remember. He grounds free expression in individual self-realization and treats speech as so akin to thought that it's nearly immune from scrutiny. That elides the fact that expression does affect others; that's the point of expression.

There's also the imperial context. Mill spent his career as a senior official of the British Empire in India. He explicitly limits his ideal of near-limitless expression to “advanced” civilizations. For “lesser” ones, he thinks the risks of harm are too great. His critics at the time called this out. We remember Mill's gorgeous rhetoric; we forget the caveats that undermine it.

Then there's the “marketplace of ideas.” If we just get out of the way and let speech collide, truth will win. Is this a metaphor you'd like to kill?

I understand the appeal; I wish it were true. But a genuine marketplace of ideas would require equal access to truthful information, shared norms about evidence, and roughly equal ability to participate. That's the opposite of our current media environment.

There are institutions that try to approximate a truth-seeking marketplace: scholarship, serious journalism, high-standard publishing. They have guardrails — fact-checking, peer review, professional norms — and over time they do converge on truth. The scientific consensus on climate change is a good example. But in the wider political sphere, “marketplace” is a fig leaf for the elevation of spectacle, grievance, and profitable falsehood.

Is the American approach exceptional now?

Yes, now. One of the surprises of my research is that from the late 18th century through the 1940s, American practice wasn't so different from Europe's. There was a balancing model: freedom paired with responsibility and an acknowledgment of potential harms. In 1789, just weeks after the First Amendment text was agreed, news of the French Declaration of the Rights of Man reached America. It enshrined freedom of expression and the responsibility not to abuse it. American commentators praised that formulation as superior. Pennsylvania promptly adopted that balancing language in its state constitution, and other states followed.

What changed was the Cold War. In a struggle against totalitarianism, Americans recoiled from anything that sounded like “collective” thinking. The Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence swerved toward a harder, more absolutist line. Noble intentions — simplifying doctrine, protecting dissidents — had unintended effects: widening the gap between legal theory and communicative reality and opening the door to legally protected harms in the public sphere.

To defend the First Amendment for a moment: It's been a crucial safeguard against state overreach, protecting dissidents and civil rights leaders. I'd rather live with the chaos of too much speech than the dangers of too little. But I admit that the digital era has made me less certain.

Both models — absolutist and balancing — have flaws. The difficulty with the contemporary American version is that it refuses to grapple with speech as action and with amplification power. That refusal has been embraced by corporations that govern online discourse globally.

We should also stop pretending platforms are neutral conduits. Their algorithms are constant moderation for profit. Historically, every new mass medium — radio, television, film — came with public-interest regulation. In the 1990s, the U.S. took a different path for the internet. Section 230 gave platforms sweeping protection: They can moderate and also avoid responsibility for what they publish. Combine that with “more speech is the only answer,” and you have a recipe for irresponsibility at scale.

And the standard worry: Do we really want platforms — or governments — deciding what counts as acceptable speech?

It's a fair worry, but “do nothing” isn't a solution. The most sophisticated attempts so far are in the European Union. The basic model there is to create independent, arms-length oversight bodies — nonpartisan, public-interest oriented. Then require transparency: What are your rules, and are you applying them consistently? No more black boxes. And then scale obligations to power. A tiny startup shouldn't face the same burden as a trillion-dollar platform that can afford robust moderation and has global impact. If you profit from shaping the public sphere, you inherit responsibilities to it.

So what now? Do we need to stop treating free speech as a fixed, universal ideal to be perfectly realized and instead see it more clearly as a political tool — one we adapt to our ends?

We need to get more sophisticated. We're living through a global media revolution; the old rules don't fit, and that's why the topic is so hot again. The way we talk about free speech is too simple. We ignore amplification. We collapse distinct spheres — art, scholarship, politics — into one undifferentiated debate. We pretend the ideal has no shape, when in fact it's always about power: who gets heard; who doesn't.

We won't agree on everything. But we can have better arguments if we use better concepts. That's what I hope the book offers.

However messy it is, the ideal still seems worth defending. I certainly believe that, and I think you do too. No one here is anti–free speech.

Of course. It's a noble ideal and essential to a free society. But we should always ask: What is the speech for? For art, the aim is imagination — shock, delight, provocation. For democratic discourse, the aim is self-government. There, we have to take the problem of harm seriously — not just the American, very narrow standard of immediate incitement, but the broader, historically well-known ways in which speech can corrupt the public sphere and strip people of equal dignity.

What about the press? What's our responsibility in a free society?

In the 1940s and after, as people thought seriously about media power, the American response — short of formal legislation — was professionalization: journalism schools, editorial standards, error correction. Those norms, however imperfect, tried to align media power with the public good. If we lose that, we regress to a world of pure rumor and propaganda.

And yes, commercialization distorts incentives. The “capitalist press,” as early socialists sneered, often serves profit before truth. That tension is real, and it matters.

If I put a map in front of you and asked you to point to the country managing all this best, could you?

No. Not the US. Not Britain. Not India. Every system is struggling, which may just reflect the messiness of human communication. We're also still in the early stages of the most significant communications revolution since print — maybe bigger. Renegotiating the boundaries of speech and power will take time. Let's hope we sort it out before the lights go out.

Anything you want to leave people with?

The next time you see a “free speech” crisis and feel the urge to pick a side instantly, pause and ask: What is this slogan being used to do? What is it concealing? Often “free speech” short-circuits a deeper political debate we ought to have. Don't let the slogan preempt the substance.

Trump wants to be a cultural tastemaker. The CIA did it first.

The modern Republican Party has fully embraced Andrew Breitbart's maxim that “politics runs downstream of culture.” That seems to be part of why President Donald Trump has spent so much time in his second term trying to take control of American arts: because that's the water that streams down into politics. If American politics is ever going to be purely Trumpian, American culture had better become so first.

Trump has ordered the Smithsonian to conduct a review that will leave it better aligned with his own understanding of arts and history. (He wants less focus, he's said, on “how bad slavery was.”) He has installed himself as chair of the Kennedy Center and called for an end to drag shows and so-called “woke” history. He cut federal funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, and Corporation for Public Broadcasting, sending ripple effects through the nation's arts infrastructure. Some of the funding left in the NEA, Trump has earmarked for his own pet projects: a sculpture garden depicting Trump-approved national heroes (no abstract sculptors need apply); patriotic plays and concerts that are themed to America's 250th anniversary.

As Trump grabs for influence over the American arts, he's been straightforward in what he thinks it should look like. He likes big, bombastic, spectacle-driven work that is also fully representational, uncluttered by metaphors or symbolism. He wants nothing that might suggest that America has ever been less than great, except for when it was under Democratic leadership. He wants nostalgic Norman Rockwell-style Americana, not Kehinde Wiley. He doesn't want Hamilton; he wants 1776, and not the all-female 1776 revival from a couple of years ago, either.

Trump isn't being all that innovative here. The US government has meddled in American arts before. Most famously, the CIA spent decades during the Cold War funding some artists and literary magazines while surveilling and harassing others, the better to shape America's image on the world stage. The CIA thought that politics were downstream of culture, too — especially when you and your enemy both have nuclear bombs and would like to avoid using them.

“In our eagerness to avoid at all costs the tragedy of open war, ‘peaceful' techniques will become more vital in times of pre-war softening up, actual overt war, and in times of post-war manipulation,” runs a CIA memo from 1945, anticipating the shift in tactics that the new atom bomb would necessitate. It was clear even this early on, writes historian Frances Stonor Saunders in her authoritative book The Cultural Cold War, that the “operational weapon” the US would use to fight the war with the Soviets “was to be culture.”

Putting the CIA's cultural cold warfare next to Trump's arts power grab is a surprisingly revelatory exercise. Previously, when institutions of the US government got mixed up in the arts world, it was usually because they believed it to be of existential importance how America is depicted in the art that it exported to the rest of the world. Going from the CIA to Trump to back again, we can see how America ran a propaganda war in the 1960s, and how it's trying to do so again today, in 2025.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

The CIA's cultural Cold War was carefully discreet. Many of the artists they helped fund and promote had no idea the CIA was distributing their work; some suspected, and avoided looking the gift horse too closely in the mouth.

The primary vehicle through which the CIA did its work was the Congress for Cultural Freedom, an international anti-communist organization dedicated to winning the war of ideas against the Soviets. Ostensibly, the Congress for Cultural Freedom was an independent organization, but more than one contemporary noticed that it had surprisingly deep pockets for an arts foundation headquartered in impoverished postwar Europe. The artists and intellectuals it funded could expect to be flown first class to beautiful locations, feted in luxury hotels, and connected with broad and prestigious platforms.

The money was all from the CIA, and it came with strings attached.

The journalist and Army combat historian Melvin Lasky outlined the strategy in a 1947 internal military memo that would come to be known as the “Melvin Lasky Proposal.” Lasky condemned the United States' postwar failure to win over “the educated and cultured classes” of Europe to the American cause, since it was they who, “in the long run, provide moral and political leadership in the community.” Soviet propaganda, Lasky wrote, had tarred America's image abroad: “Viz., the alleged economic selfishness of the USA (Uncle Sam as Shylock); its alleged deep political reaction (a ‘mercenary capitalistic press,' etc.); its alleged cultural waywardness (the ‘jazz and swing mania,' radio advertisements, Hollywood ‘inanities,' ‘cheese-cake and leg-art'); its alleged moral hypocrisy (the Negro question, sharecroppers, Okies); etc. etc.”

Unsurprisingly, the CIA's policy of suppressing any art about America's race problem hit Black writers especially hard.

Against such a campaign, Lasky wrote, it was useless to take the high road and simply let the facts speak for themselves. America needed advocates of its own to counter the Soviet story.

Lasky saw a potential solution to this problem in the establishment of a literary journal. It would be, he wrote, “a demonstration that behind the official representatives of American democracy lies a great and progressive culture, with a richness of achievements in the arts, in literature, in philosophy, in all the aspects of culture which unite the free traditions of Europe and America.” The idea was that America had to prove to Europe that it was more than just a collection of morally depraved hicks with a segregation problem. Only then would it be able to save Europe from the Soviet threat.

After the CIA adopted Lasky's proposal, his original idea of one journal became 20, all funded secretly by the CIA through the Congress for Cultural Freedom. The Congress at its peak also funded prestigious international conferences, art exhibitions, and public performances. All of them were evaluated by the CIA to confirm that they fit the brief as outlined by Lasky: they showed that the US had a tradition of highbrow culture that would appeal to the aesthetes of Paris and Berlin, and they did not condemn America for its “moral hypocrisy” — for class divides or entrenched systemic racism or anything else. For the CIA, the official and clearly stated goal of these magazines was to present European intellectuals with a vision of American-style capitalism that would seduce them away from a lingering interest in Communism.

A lot of this art and culture was genuinely very good and very important. Via the Congress for Cultural Freedom, the CIA became a champion of Abstract Expressionist art as the antithesis of Soviet-style social realism. It supported the Museum of Modern Art (which destroyed an in-progress Diego Rivera mural when Rivera painted in Lenin and declined to paint him out), and the Paris Review, originally established by a CIA agent as part of his cover. (For a full account of the Paris Review's relationship with the CIA, see Joel Whitney's deeply researched Finks: How the CIA Tricked the World's Best Writers). It turned the Boston Symphony Orchestra into an internationally celebrated institution.

Art that did engage with America's race problem, however, or with its flourishing practice of interfering in the democratically elected governments of other countries, was considered highly suspect, and potentially a tool of the Soviets. It received no prestigious CIA funding. Sometimes, it was suppressed entirely.

Unsurprisingly, the CIA's policy of suppressing any art about America's race problem hit Black writers especially hard. James Baldwin and Richard Wright both wrote extensively about the sins of the Soviet Union early in their careers, and at the time, the CIA backed them accordingly. Their essays were republished in the Paris Review and in the CIA-funded magazine Encounters, and their novels were distributed internationally using government funds. Yet when they turned their attention from the Soviets to the problem of American racism and the American surveillance state, they lost the CIA's good wishes. The stable of magazines secretly controlled by the CIA began to decline to publish their writing. The FBI and likely the CIA as well began to infiltrate their lives and assemble files on them. (Wright described the turn as “the CIA's vacillating between secretly sponsoring and spying.”) W.E.B. Du Bois, meanwhile, who had no anti-Communist credentials, got it worst of all: the State Department simply denied him a passport.

The CIA was also active in Hollywood, where it examined films carefully for any hint of a plotline that could become anti-American propaganda. One CIA report from 1953 describes how the agent has persuaded Paramount to add “well dressed negroes” as extras to films, including one set in a tony golf club, in order to avoid fanning up a conversation about American racism. The agent admits that he couldn't quite figure out how to pull the move off for a film set in the antebellum South. “However,” he added, “this is being off-set to a certain degree, by planting a dignified negro butler in one of the principal's homes, and by giving him dialogue indicating he is a freed man and can work where he likes.”

Not every film could be fixed so easily. One script was found to be beyond the pale for its “implication [that the] wealth of Anglo-Texans [was] built by exploiting Mexican labor.” “I'll see to it that it is killed each time someone tries to reactivate it at Paramount,” the agent promised. (It made its way to Warner Brothers instead, where it became Giant, James Dean's last movie.) The now-iconic Western High Noon, too, was condemned for “its unsympathetic portrayal of American townsfolk and its featuring a Mexican prostitute character.” The movie was already out in the world by the time of the CIA agent's report, but he promised to sabotage its chances at the Oscars anyway. (It still walked away with four trophies, if not Best Picture.)

The artistic world that the CIA built was one of American innocence. It was a world in which Black Americans had free access to wealth and prestige, people of color were never exploited, and the races existed together in a state of beneficent harmony. Aesthetics existed in a pure sphere of their own, one where brushstrokes and colors were celebrated as depoliticized expressions of freedom. Art that was explicitly political was lesser, a form of glorified propaganda. The legacy of Western art was the world's greatest cultural achievement, and America was now the guardian of that legacy.

In many ways, that's the artistic world that Donald Trump seems to be trying to build now all over again. Only this time, there's no reason to pitch the art to the tastemakers of Europe.

Trump's taste in art tends toward the populist and the kitschy. Aesthetically, the work that he's promoting as president has less in common with the highbrow work championed in secret by the CIA, and more to do with the favorite art of Joseph McCarthy, the other great Cold War censor of American culture and a Trumpian figure if ever there was one.

McCarthy, writes Saunders in The Cultural Cold War, “was an autarchist—he wanted ‘Made in America.' … McCarthyism was a movement—or a moment—fired with populist resentment against the establishment. In turn, McCarthy's vulgar demagoguery was received as an insult by the ruling elite. He represented what A.L. Rowse in England scorned as ‘the Idiot People'; he offended Brahmin taste, which recoiled at mediocrity, hick mentality, the dreaded midcult.”

The artists and thinkers whose works were presented to the public as most urgent and necessary, important as they might have been, were not necessarily the most urgent and necessary artists and thinkers working at the time.

So averse to the highbrow was McCarthy that some CIA agents have claimed they had to promote figures like Pollock in secret, covertly, just to avoid McCarthy's outcries. “Imagine the ridiculous howlings that would've gone up,” one tells Saunders in The Cultural Cold War: “‘They're all Communists! They're homosexuals!' or whatever.”

Trump, too, has no use for the kind of heady intellectualism the CIA pushed during the Cold War. The art he is pushing tends to be heavily representational, and in fact is required to be so. The grant application for his planned National Garden of American Heroes explicitly forbids “abstract or modernist” statues — a problem, as Politico reported in May, because the United States does not currently have a strong tradition of representational sculptures.

Representational art was considered Soviet during the Cold War, so the CIA didn't support it. Lacking lucrative prizes, prestigious coverage from literary magazines, or appearances in international exhibitions, representational art began to wither away. In artistic circles, it came to be considered unfashionable and unintellectual, like Victorian architecture or mall portraits. We're still living in the world that choice built: The biggest pool of talent for representational sculpting is now in China.

It's this kind of lopsided artistic ecosystem that can occur when the government meddles in the artistic world, even decades after the fact. “The government seemed to be running an underground gravy train whose first-class compartments were not always occupied by first-class passengers,” wrote publisher and critic Jason Epstein in 1967, as news of the CIA's meddling in the cultural world began to make its way into the public. “The CIA and the Ford Foundation, among other agencies, had set up and were financing an apparatus of intellectuals selected for their correct cold-war positions, as an alternative to what one might call a free intellectual market where ideology was presumed to count for less than individual talent and achievement, and where doubts about established orthodoxies were taken to be the beginning of all inquiry.”

The artists and thinkers whose works were presented to the public as most urgent and necessary, important as they might have been, were not necessarily the most urgent and necessary artists and thinkers working at the time. They were the ones who fit the CIA's stated priorities best.

Now we're left in the world they made — one where, whatever your thoughts may be on the value of representational art, the fact is that we don't have much of it, due in part to an artificially-produced devaluation.

That is one of the more innocent side effects of the kind of state interference with the art world that the CIA performed so covertly and that Trump is doing now with such pointed candor. More troubling is the thing they all seem to agree on, the CIA, Trump, and McCarthy too, the point where they all overlap: the belief that any work of art that engages with America's sins must be suppressed, and any work of art that papers them over must be lifted up and celebrated. When the government starts interfering with art, it always seems to coalesce around the idea that the government itself is beyond artistic reproach.

Chris Van Hollen on a government shutdown, Charlie Kirk, and Zohran Mamdani.

Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that Democrats would be seeking a restoration in funding to Medicare and to extend Obamacare subsidies in the upcoming government funding bill. If Republicans refuse to come to the table, Senator Schumer says Democrats will withhold their votes, forcing a government shutdown at the end of the month.

Days before Schumer's announcement, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at an event in Utah. In the aftermath, President Donald Trump and his allies laid blame at the feet of Democrats and the left. In a speech from the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump vowed that his administration would “find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it.” Some are arguing that in the midst of this heightened rhetoric, picking a fight over the budget could give Trump license to further his authoritarian aims. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland thinks it's worth the risk.

In an interview with Today, Explained, Van Hollen said “there are always risks, but again, it's Republicans and the Trump White House that will be taking this risk, because they will clearly be seen to be going it alone, trying to essentially impose total one-party rule on the country.” Senator Van Hollen believes that the Republicans have more to lose by withholding concessions than the Democrats do by holding the line.

Below is an excerpt of Senator Van Hollen's conversation with Today, Explained host Noel King, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Schumer and minority leader Hakeem Jeffries have set their terms for avoiding a government shutdown. They want Republicans to reverse Medicaid cuts and to extend the Obamacare subsidies. What's your position on a shutdown?

Well, first and foremost, we should not be giving President Trump a blank check to continue his lawless activities, including his illegal withholding of funds from — for example, NIH [the National Institutes of Health], where people are undergoing clinical trials for cancer — and he's withholding funds that could literally mean a death sentence for them. And the GAO, the Government Accountability Office, has found that he is illegally impounding, withholding these funds. And so, we can't give them a blank check without guardrails and safeguards to make sure that that won't happen.

What do guardrails and safeguards look like? What specifically are you after here?

So, for example, the Republicans in the Senate and the House voted for this so-called rescission package, meaning that they voted to undo resources, appropriations that they previously voted for. You can make that much harder to do by requiring, for example, a 60-vote margin to pass it.

You can also do other things, Noel. For example, if the president were to engage in an illegal rescission, you could have an across the board immediate cut in White House appropriations. So, there are things you can do if Republicans were willing to join us, but so far, they're not willing to take on President Trump in any way.

The country was in a very similar position back in March of this year. And the concern back then was that, if Democrats shut down the government, they would end up taking the blame. They would end up alienating voters. Is that a concern this time around?

Well, this would be the Trump administration and Republicans in the Congress shutting down the government, because they decide to go it alone. They decide to have a one-way street. They decide to give President Trump a blank check for his lawless activity. And I don't think the American people want to see President Trump get a total blank check, because they've seen that he's withholding monies from things like FEMA and places that have been hit by disasters and refuse to provide funding for disaster relief. He's withholding funds from the National Institutes of Health. In fact, by our calculation right now, they're withholding about $400 billion of funds for important priorities for the current fiscal year we're in, which ends in just a few weeks. So, if they're doing that now, he will do it again unless we stop it.

In the first half of the show, our colleague Andrew Prokop proposed this as one possible scenario: An extended shutdown leads Republicans to believe that Democrats are abusing the filibuster, and so they end the filibuster. And so, that means that Republicans no longer need any Democrats to vote with them, and they can do whatever they want. He's painting the shutdown as quite a dangerous possibility for Democrats. What do you think about that?

There are always risks, but again, it's Republicans and the Trump White House that will be taking this risk, because they will clearly be seen to be going it alone, trying to essentially impose total one-party rule on the country. Trump's sort of authoritarian impulses would have no checks and no balances on them.

With respect to Republicans getting rid of the filibuster, I think they recognize that more democracy in the Senate and the House does not favor them in the long run. I mean, I've been an advocate for ending what's called the supermajority requirement to end a filibuster; you would still have ample debate for weeks or months, but at the end of the day, you would bring debate to a close with 51 votes. Republicans have been able to do what they want without doing that. So, for example, they use the reconciliation process to pass big tax cuts for the very rich and cut programs for working Americans. We saw them do this in the so-called “big, beautiful bill,” which is beautiful if you're a billionaire but stinks for everybody else. So, the big things Republicans like to do, like tax cuts, they get to do even with the filibuster in place. I don't think the Republicans will go down that road, because the supermajority requirement [that currently exists] to end a filibuster favors their agenda, not the people's agenda.

After the conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was killed by a shooter last week, President Trump in a speech from the Oval Office blamed, quote, “the radical left.” He vowed to, quote, “find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it.” 

This strikes people as a potentially very concerning threat to free speech, civil liberties. Have the events of the past week changed your mind at all about how you approach the Trump administration? What do you think the president is saying here?

I'm very, very alarmed by what the president's saying. There's no room for political violence in our discourse. We can have robust debates without it veering into violence, and there should be no vengeance. President Trump had a chance to bring the country together to say that political violence is unacceptable regardless of its source, but instead, he's decided to engage in finger pointing. Instead, he is weaponizing this awful tragedy, this murder, to advance his political goals, which include going after what he calls folks on the left, which, in Trump world, means anybody who disagrees with Donald Trump. So yes, it's very concerning that he would threaten to use the full power and instruments of the federal government to literally go after people who disagree with him.

There is a lot at stake for Democrats here. As you've been saying, polling shows that Americans are really displeased with the party and not just the general public. Democrats themselves are not happy with the party. In August, an Associated Press poll of Democrats saw people using words like “weak,” “tepid,” “ineffective,” and “broken” to describe their own party. What do you think is going on here?

Well, I don't think the Democrats have done enough to stand up to Donald Trump's lawlessness, nor do I think Democrats have done enough to put forward our own positive vision of what we would do, including taking on very powerful special interests and fighting instead for the common good and the public interest.

I was invited just over the weekend to speak to the Polk County, Iowa, Democratic Party, and I laid out exactly that argument: that more needs to be done to stand up to Donald Trump in this moment. But clearly in 2024, the American people, the majority of the American people, did not trust us to take on the status quo and take on these special interests. And so, I believe we need to be much more clear not only about what we're fighting against, but what we are fighting for.

At that event on Saturday, you also endorsed Zohran Mamdani. You criticized other Democratic leaders for delaying on endorsing him. You referred to something that you called “spineless politics.” What's going on? What's Mamdani doing that you like?

What I said was, as we prepare to try to win majorities in the House and the Senate in 2026, we need to first win the 2025 races. We have big races in Virginia and New Jersey for the governor seats, great candidates, and we also need to win the mayoral race in New York City. I pointed out that Donald Trump has spent a huge amount of time and resources trying to defeat Mamdani. Mamdani's platform was people who work in New York should be able to afford to live in New York, which would be good for people in New York City; and Des Moines, Iowa; and in Maryland; and throughout the country. And yet, you have these very powerful big money, special interests — financial interests combining with Donald Trump to try to defeat Mamdani. And so, I do think this is a moment where Democrats need to stand up for the person who is fighting to reduce costs and make sure that people can afford to live where they work.

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs is hoping for sentencing help from an unlikely source: some of the dozens of escorts he hired for ""freak offs,"" men the prosecutors are counting as victims.

As early as Friday, Combs' legal team intends to submit a sentencing brief to the judge, arguing that some of these ""entertainers"" gave prosecutors never-revealed interviews that actually help the defense.

""We plan to summarize these individuals' accounts to the government for the court,"" the defense told US District Judge Arun Subramanian in a filing last week.

Federal prosecutors want any pre-sentencing arguments relating to these pretrial interviews to be sealed from the public.

""Statements of non-testifying witnesses are traditionally considered nonpublic,"" prosecutors argued in a recent court filing. They have asked the judge to count these escorts as victims at a sentencing scheduled for October 3.

Combs' team counters that none of the escorts are victims, and that details from their pretrial, prosecution interviews should not be sealed or even partially redacted.

A prosecution spokesman declined to comment. A defense lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Combs' six-week trial ended July 2. The millionaire rap entrepreneur was found not guilty of sex-trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges and convicted of two lesser counts of transporting people across state lines for purposes of prostitution.

Prosecutors say Combs caused multiple people to cross state lines for the dayslong sex performances he called freak offs — not just longtime girlfriends Cassie Ventura and a second ex who testified pseudonymously as ""Jane,"" but male escorts as well.

Two of these escorts testified at trial that they witnessed Combs being violent with Ventura and Jane during freak offs.

But in closing arguments, Assistant US Attorney Christy Slavik showed the jury a collage of 27 escorts whom she alleged Combs hired, many of whom were caused by Combs to cross state lines for these encounters.

""This slide shows you just a subset of the strangers who had sex with Jane and Cassie in these rooms for hours and days on end, drugged, covered in oil, sore, exhausted, over and over again,"" Slavik told the jurors as the escort collage was shown to jurors and the courtroom audience.

All 27 were referred to by photo and by either name or alias during the trial. It's unclear how many of the 27 gave pre-trial interviews to prosecutors, or how many of them prosecutors intend to say were victims when they file their own pre-sentencing brief later this month.

The judge has yet to rule on whether the defense will have to redact the names of these non-witness escorts in their sentencing memo.

The defense has also argued for more time — and more pages — for this all-important sentencing brief. The judge previously set a 25-page limit for both sides and has ordered the defense to have its brief ready by Friday. The defense has asked to submit it on Monday instead.

Combs faces up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced; the maximum for each of the two counts is 10 years.

Prosecutors have said that they will seek at least five years in prison total.

But that was in July; the number of ""victims"" will figure into their final sentencing recommendations. Prosecutors have also said they will count the trial evidence of Combs' admitted violence and drug use in their ultimate sentencing recommendation.

The defense has said they will ask for zero jail time, and told Business Insider last month that he is a changed man who hopes to become an anti-domestic abuse advocate. They argued this month that the escorts should not count as victims in the judge's sentencing math.

""The government has taken the view that several consenting male 'entertainers,' who willingly consented to sexual activity with Ms. Ventura and Jane, are now victims"" under the meaning of federal sentencing guidelines, defense lawyers wrote this month.

""These individuals did not testify, and we plan to summarize these individuals' accounts to the government for the court.""

Combs has been jailed since his arrest in September 2024.

Subramanian has not said when he will rule on the defense requests for more time and pages, or on their request to file any pre-sentencing arguments relating to the escorts without redaction.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Meta leaked its own announcement about its new smart glasses display","https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-leaked-smart-glasses-display-announcement-rayban-oakleymeta-connect-2025-9","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:08:00 GMT","

Meta's would-be surprise announcement about its new smart glasses display was leaked on Monday ahead of a major company event. The culprit? Meta itself.

Meta posted and then removed a YouTube video showing off its new Ray-Ban smart glasses and Oakley smart glasses days before Meta Connect, the company's annual flagship conference that is set for Wednesday and Thursday this week.

UploadVR first reported on the leaked video, which it also captured and uploaded clips of to X. A source with knowledge of the situation confirmed the leak to Business Insider.

One video clip shows off a new pair of Meta Ray-Ban glasses that include a heads-up display, or HUD, that will let wearers superimpose maps and text onto the real world, as well as a wristband that interacts with them. The glasses appear to be labeled ""Display."" The second video clip shows off a pair of wraparound Meta Oakley glasses with a center camera.

Meta did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

The leaked video appears to have spoiled what could have been an exciting surprise at Meta Connect — the integrated HUD, which brings the company a step closer to producing commercial glasses with the level of tech it showed off in its Orion prototype.

Meta's Orion glasses, which Business Insider's Peter Kafka tried out last year, are augmented-reality glasses that come with a HUD and a wristband that tracks muscle movements. Meta said at the time the product was too expensive to bring to mass market.

Meta isn't the first company to show off smart glasses with a built-in display. Google showed off its own version in May, powered by Android XR, a new platform for augmented reality glasses. Google is partnering with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster to design its frames, which are expected to be released later this year.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been bullish on smart glasses. During the company's second-quarter earnings call in July, he said smart glasses will eventually be the primary way people interact with AI and that anyone not using them would be at a ""cognitive disadvantage.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg are worth about as much as one of America's largest companies","https://www.businessinsider.com/musk-ellison-zuck-buffett-berkshire-stock-tech-ai-trillion-wealth-2025-9","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 09:40:00 GMT","

The three wealthiest people on the planet are worth a combined $1 trillion, about as much as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Larry Ellison, a cofounder of Oracle, and Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, had net worths of $429 billion, $360 billion, and $269 billion as of Monday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Together, they're worth $1.06 trillion, virtually matching Berkshire's market capitalization and comfortably surpassing the $800 billion-plus market values of Oracle, JPMorgan, and Walmart.

It's striking that three individuals are worth as much on paper as Berkshire, a corporate behemoth that generates about $370 billion in annual revenue, employs nearly 400,000 workers, and has arguably the world's greatest living investor at its helm.

Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg are worth so much because they're the biggest shareholders of some of the world's most valuable companies. Musk owns about 13% of Tesla and 42% of SpaceX, Ellison holds about a 41% stake in Oracle, and Zuckerberg has about a 13% stake in Meta.

The trio clear the $1 trillion mark because they've hugely increased their wealth as a group. While Musk's fortune has shrunk by about $4 billion this year to date, Ellison's net worth has nearly doubled, surging by $167 billion as Oracle stock has soared over 80% since January 1. Zuckerberg's wealth has jumped by $61 billion, fueled by Meta stock's 30% gain in 2025.

Most ultrawealthy people have also grown substantially richer this year. The 17 members of the $100 billion club have added a net $486 billion to their joint fortunes, boosting their combined wealth to around $3.3 trillion at Monday's close — a figure greater than the market values of Alphabet or Amazon.

Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg have seen their fortunes balloon in recent years thanks to investor optimism around AI's potential to slash corporations' costs and supercharge their profitability.

Oracle's stock price climbed as much as 43% last Wednesday alone, lifting the company's market value by nearly $300 billion at its peak, after it projected rapid revenue growth fueled by AI demand.

Musk could become the world's first trillionaire with the help of a prospective Tesla pay package unveiled last week. The proposed deal would grant Musk shares worth over $1 trillion if he manages to increase his company's market value by about eightfold and hit a slew of operational targets within the next decade or so.

Musk purchased about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock on Friday, signaling he likes his chances.

President Donald Trump is suing The New York Times.

In a lawsuit filed on Monday, Trump accused the Times and four of its journalists of defamation and libel.

""The New York Times has been allowed to freely lie, smear, and defame me for far too long, and that stops, NOW!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday night.

He is seeking at least $15 billion in damages, per the lawsuit.

The White House and the Times did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Trump's lawyer, Alejandro Brito, filed the lawsuit in the Tampa division of the Middle District of Florida. Brito represented Trump when he sued ABC News and The Wall Street Journal for defamation. ABC News paid Trump a $15 million settlement last year.

In the court filing, Trump's lawyers said the Times had been trying to ""destroy his reputation as a successful businessman, and subject him to humiliation and ridicule.""

The filing cited several articles about Trump published by the Times last year. It also took aim at ""Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father's Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success,"" a book written by two Times reporters, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner. Craig, Buettner, and their publisher, Penguin Random House, were listed as defendants alongside the Times.

""The Book and Articles are part of a decades-long pattern by the New York Times of intentional and malicious defamation against President Trump,"" Trump's lawyers wrote in the court filing.

""Today, the Times is a fullthroated mouthpiece of the Democrat Party. The newspaper's editorial routine is now one of industrial-scale defamation and libel against political opponents,"" the filing said.

Trump's lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

This isn't the first time Trump has sued the Times. In 2021, he filed a lawsuit against the paper, accusing the Times and its reporters of conspiring with his niece, Mary Trump, to obtain his tax records. Craig and Buettner were two of the three reporters named in Trump's lawsuit.

Justice Robert Reed of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan dismissed the suit in May 2023 and ordered Trump to pay the outlet and its reporters their legal fees. In January 2024, Reed said Trump owed the Times and its reporters $392,638.69 in legal expenses.

OpenAI on Tuesday announced it will launch a dedicated ChatGPT experience with parental controls for users under 18 years old as the artificial intelligence company works to enhance safety protections for teenagers.

When OpenAI identifies that a user is a minor, they will automatically be directed to an age-appropriate ChatGPT experience that blocks graphic and sexual content and can involve law enforcement in rare cases of acute distress, the company said.

OpenAI is also developing a technology to better predict a user's age, but ChatGPT will default to the under-18 experience if there is uncertainty or incomplete information.

The startup's safety updates come after the Federal Trade Commission recently launched an inquiry into several tech companies, including OpenAI, over how AI chatbots like ChatGPT potentially negatively affect children and teenagers.

The agency said it wants to understand what steps these companies have taken to ""evaluate the safety of these chatbots when acting as companions,"" according to a release.

OpenAI also shared how ChatGPT will handle ""sensitive situations"" last month after a lawsuit from a family blamed the chatbot for their teenage son's death by suicide.

""We prioritize safety ahead of privacy and freedom for teens; this is a new and powerful technology, and we believe minors need significant protection,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.

In August, OpenAI said it would release parental controls to help them understand and shape how their teens are using ChatGPT. OpenAI shared more details about those parental controls on Tuesday, and it said they will be available at the end of the month.

The company's upcoming controls will allow parents to link their ChatGPT account with their teen's via email, set blackout hours for when their teen can't use the chatbot, manage which features to disable, guide how the chatbot responds and receive notifications if the teen is in acute distress.

ChatGPT is intended for users who are ages 13 and up, OpenAI said.

""These are difficult decisions, but after talking with experts, this is what we think is best and want to be transparent in our intentions,"" Altman wrote.

In this article

The framework agreement for the social media platform TikTok will include new investors as well as existing investors in the platform's Chinese parent company ByteDance, sources told CNBC's David Faber.

The deal is expected to close in the next 30 to 45 days, according to the sources, who asked not to be named because the details of the negotiations are confidential. As part of the agreement, Oracle will keep its cloud deal with the platform, the people said.

""Where this thing is capitalized and how large it is remains to be seen,"" Faber said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""'I'm hearing it's actually going to be relatively small in terms of the actual size of the checks that are written for the entity itself, and it will not be something that is going to go public at some point.""

The White House, TikTok and Oracle did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

TikTok's future in the U.S. has been uncertain since 2024, when Congress passed a bill that would ban the platform unless ByteDance divested from U.S. operations. Lawmakers had grown concerned that the Chinese government could access sensitive data from American users or manipulate content on the platform.

Deal talks have dragged, with President Donald Trump extending the deadline three times since taking office in January. 

The new details about the deal come after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that the U.S. and China have reached a ""framework"" deal for TikTok.

Bessent said Tuesday that commercial terms had been in place since March or April, but the Chinese put it on hold after Trump's ""liberation day"" tariff blitz.

Oracle has been floated as a potential investor or buyer of TikTok for months.

Reuters reported in January that the White House picked Oracle to handle TikTok's data collection and software updates as part of a deal.

Trump has previously said he'd be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok in the U.S.

President Donald Trump's actions relative to the Federal Reserve amount to an effort to limit or eliminate the central bank's independence, according to 82% of respondents to the September CNBC Fed Survey.

Those actions, according to majorities of the 29 respondents, will result in weaker growth, higher inflation and unemployment and a lower value for the dollar.

The survey found that 41% of the economists, fund managers and strategists surveyed believe that the president's actions are directly aimed at eliminating the Fed's independence, with 41% saying they are designed to limit them. Just 10% say the president is moving to support the Fed's independence.

""The Trump administration is likely to continue its attempts to reduce the independence of the Fed with an objective being to pressure the Fed to reduce short-term interest rates meaningfully and boost economic growth even at the expense of placing some upward pressure on inflation,"" said Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief economist, Hugh Johnson Economics.

Joel Naroff of Naroff Economics added, ""By appointing loyalists to the Fed, Trump expects to gain effective control over policy while maintaining plausible deniability if, or more likely when, the policies go awry.""

But Thomas Simons, chief U.S. economist at Jefferies, says he thinks the threat to Fed independence is ""overblown."" He says he does not expect Trump appointees ""to have concentrated power to sway the consensus of the FOMC. The de-centralized power within the committee to make decisions is the key to ensuring that policy is not unduly influenced by the president.""

Still, a 68% majority think the president's actions will put upward pressure on inflation; and 57% say it will result in higher unemployment; and 54% see lower economic growth; 74% believe it will lower the value of the U.S. dollar.

Yet respondents are divided overall on the effect on interest rates, with 39% believing the president action's will result in lower rates and the same percentage forecasting higher rates as a result.

The Fed meets this week with agreement among respondents that it will cut by a quarter point, but substantial disagreement over what the central bank should do. While 97% say the Fed will cut by a quarter point, just 41% think that's the right move. The rest are evenly divided, with 28% favoring a half-point rate reduction and 28% supporting no cut at all — likely reflecting a similar debate on the Federal Open Market Committee.

On average, respondents forecast a bigger decline in the fed funds rate this year, with the rate dropping from the current level of 4.38% to 3.66%, roughly reflecting three quarter-point cuts this year, or one additional cut compared with the July survey. Next year, the funds rate is forecast to fall to 3.13% compared with 3.46% in the July survey.

That outlook could reflect renewed concern about growth and unemployment.

""The labor market is weak, consumers have not yet noticed tariff-driven inflation, and inflation pressures are likely to really be transitory,"" said Drew T. Matus, chief market strategist, MetLife Investment Management. ""It is time for the Fed to begin a rate cutting cycle - the path, not a single move, is what matters.""

Respondents raised their recession concerns for the first time in four months, with the recession probability jumping to 40% from 31% in the prior survey. Fifty-five percent see a moderate recession, if one happens, lasting 10 months, up from 38% in July. The rise comes with a forecast for a sharper increase in unemployment this year and next, but the growth outlook unchanged at 1.5% for 2025, bouncing back to 2% in 2026. Forecasts for the consumer price index rose a bit to 3.05% for 2025 but declined for 2026 to 2.8%, which would keep the Fed above its 2% inflation target.

""Tariffs and uncertainty remain the major threat to growth, however, a reduction in Fed independence could add to these risks,"" wrote John Ryding, chief economic advisor, Brean Capital. ""Monetary policy works best when central banks are free from political interference.""

Respondents have a bit more confidence in the economic effects of tariffs than they did in the July survey, but a majority still say they are uncertain. That could be because 86% still see price increases to come from tariffs, with half of those believing that substantial price increases remain on the way. Asked who is shouldering the cost of tariffs, the average respondent says 31% is paid by the consumer, 29% by wholesalers and importers, and 23% by retailers. Just 18% of the tariff burden is judged to be borne by exporters, contradicting the administration's claim that Americans are not paying the tax.

""Economists, myself included, over-estimated the near-term inflationary impact of tariffs because we didn't anticipate companies eating the tariffs and squeezing margins,"" said Richard Bernstein, CEO, Richard Bernstein Advisors. ""However, the recent sizable weakness in employment seems the direct result of those squeezed margins.""

Tariffs were judged to be the No. 1 threat to the economic expansion, followed by uncertainty around the administration's policy. The president's efforts to limit or eliminate the Fed's independence was seen as the third-biggest risk followed by immigration policy.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday that President Donald Trump was willing to let TikTok cease operating in the U.S., and that it was ""what turned the tide"" in the deal framework with China.

""President Trump made it clear that he would have been willing to let Tiktok go dark, that we were not going to give up national security in favor of the deal,"" Bessent told CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

TikTok parent company ByteDance is still looking at a Sept. 17 deadline to divest the app's U.S. operations or potentially be shut down in the country.

The Trump administration hasn't yet formally extended the deadline, though U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Monday that more time may be needed for the deal to be finalized and signed.

Bessent said Tuesday that the commercial terms of the deal between ByteDance and the new investors had been done ""in essence"" since March or April.

After Trump's massive tariff announcement on April 2, the Chinese put the deal on hold, he said.

Trump's tariff and trade threats, as well as chip restrictions, have weighed on relations between the world's biggest economies, but the deal for TikTok could mark a turning point, with Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping expected to speak Friday to finalize the deal.

""We were able to reach a series of agreements, mostly for things we will not be doing in the future that have no effect on our national security,"" Bessent said Tuesday.

Though Trump may be open to letting the app go dark, the White House started its own TikTok account last month. The administration has nearly 1 million followers on the platform.

""The kids wanted it so badly,"" Trump said outside the White House on Tuesday. ""I had parents calling me up. They don't want it for themselves. They want it for their kids. They say if I don't get it done, they're in big trouble with their kids.""

A number of potential U.S. owners have been floated in the past several months, with Trump voicing support for Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison or Tesla CEO Elon Musk. 

CBS News reported Monday that Oracle was among ""multiple companies"" in the potential deal, citing sources.

Oracle is already key to TikTok's web infrastructure, Reuters reported in January.

The news service said the White House was lining up a deal with Oracle and a group of outside investors to take over the app's U.S. operations, with the cloud giant handling data collection and software updates.

J.P. Morgan Private Bank is launching a new lifestyle service for its wealthy clients, offering discounts and referrals on everything from private jet flights and travel to household staffing and art restoration.

The move comes as private banks and wealth management firms seek to find ways of serving clients outside of core investing and financial advice, which have become increasingly commoditized. J.P. Morgan said ultra-high-net-worth clients and family offices are more and more turning to their wealth advisors for broader nonfinancial advice.

""There is a growing trend among clients who want our advice outside of traditional wealth management,"" said William Sinclair, co-head of J.P. Morgan Private Bank's Global Family Office Practice. ""They view J.P. Morgan as a trusted source because of our clients.""

The services will give J.P. Morgan Private Bank's U.S. clients access to a specialized network of companies that have been carefully vetted and curated by the bank. There is no additional charge to access the services, and clients will get exclusive offers, free consultations, discounted rates and other deals from the companies on the platform.

The services include everything from private jet flights and luxury travel to household staffing, health-care management and collectibles advice. They also include aggregated financial reporting programs, bookkeeping and bill pay services (known as ""CFO services""), which are in strong demand by ultra-wealthy investors and family offices.

For travel advice, clients will be able to access Valerie Wilson Travel, which J.P. Morgan acquired in 2022 as part of its purchase of travel management company Frosch. The bank didn't name other companies available on the platform but said they include a wide range of providers across various services.

The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.

Subscribe here to get access today. 

In private aviation, clients will be able to choose from a jet card program, fractional ownership or charter, depending on their needs. For collectibles, clients will be able to get advice on managing, maintaining or selling their collections, from cataloging and restoration, to selling or buying in the primary or secondary markets.

For household staffing, clients will get access to recruiting firms that specialize in family offices and households. The service will also feature financial management services and financial reporting tools, where clients can see all of their investments in one place.  

Sinclair said private jet services tend to be the most requested by private bank clients, along with bill paying and payroll management for household employees. He said business owners who sell their enterprises often ask the bank to help find new health insurance plans.

Emily Margolis, head of lifestyle services for the private bank, said J.P. Morgan will add more services to the platform as it grows.

""We're looking at physical security, insurance, more in-depth HR, areas that we see more requests,"" Margolis said.

Nearly two years into its retaliatory military offensive in the Gaza Strip, Israel said it has launched a long-studied ground assault on Gaza City.

""IDF troops have begun expanding ground operations in Gaza City as part of Operation Gideon's Chariots II,"" the Israeli Defense Forces said Tuesday on social media.

""Gaza is burning,"" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz had said earlier in the day, in a separate Google-translated update. ""We will not relent or turn back — until the mission is complete,"" he added.

The ground invasion marks a deepening of Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip, which once housed 2.2 million people and has devolved into a starvation-stricken battlefield. Gaza City, previously the enclave's most populous urban settlement, is still home to hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinian people.

Israel insists its campaign targets the demilitarization of Hamas and release of hostages taken by the Palestinian militant group after its terror attacks in October 2023. 

Speaking to reporters as he prepared to leave Israel, visiting U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signaled that a ground invasion of Gaza City was imminent.

""Well, as you saw, the Israelis have begun to take operations there. So we think we have a very short window of time in which a deal could happen. We don't have months anymore,"" he said. ""Our preference, our number one choice, is that this ends with a negotiated settlement with Hamas.""

CNBC has reached out to the IDF and Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment.

Israel's military progress in Gaza has increasingly isolated the Jewish state on the international stage.

Several Western nations initially backed Israel's right to self-defense and to pursue Hamas militarily after the Palestinian militant group's terror attacks, but have since noted the perceived disproportionality of the Jewish state's Gaza campaign and risk to civilians.

Nations including Norway, Spain and Ireland recognized Palestinian statehood in the spring of 2024, with France, Canada and Australia later announcing plans to take the same step this month. In a blow to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration, a report by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Tuesday concluded that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinian people in the Gaza enclave.

The U.N.-commissioned report does not officially speak for the U.N., which has not yet used the term ""genocide.""

In November 2024, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas officials on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the Gaza conflict and October 2023 terror onslaught.

The U.N. commission's Tuesday findings could deal a further reputational blow to Israel, which has sought to retain working trade ties with international partners. In August, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, said it had quit its investments in U.S. machinery manufacturer Caterpillar and five Israeli banks following a review of the companies' connection to the Gaza conflict. Germany has meanwhile halted the export of weapons to Israel for in the Gaza Strip.

Broader market reactions have been muted, barring brief spikes in oil prices when Israel entered direct confrontations with Hamas' crude-rich patron Iran and with other of Tehran's proxies, such as Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthis.

Yet Arab nations in the oil-bountiful Middle East — many of which entertain or are building solid relations with the U.S. — are unlikely to protest Israel's current aggression in Gaza through an oil embargo, as they did in 1973, according to experts.  

""We would have to really see the big oil producers of the region — Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Iran — join and create an oil embargo,"" Marko Papic, macro and geopolitical expert at BCA Research, told CNBC's Dan Murphy. ""There is absolutely no talk of that, and therefore I believe this will continue to be completely and utterly market irrelevant for global investors.""

He also downplayed the odds of success of Israel's latest Gaza offensive, which he qualified as ""yet another incursion that is unlikely to root out Hamas, and the reason for that is that Hamas is an ideology that will persist, either in its current form or in some future form.""

Despite this, Israel's invasion threatens to rupture the Jewish state's already shaky political relations with its Arab neighbors, many of which have historically supported the Palestinian cause. The Gaza City invasion comes after Arab and Muslim leaders convened in Qatar and called for a review of ties with Israel following the country's strike on Doha last week.

Qatar's emir urged leaders to take ""concrete steps"" against Israel in response to a missile strike on Doha which killed six people, including a Qatari national. Israel said the strike was aimed at Hamas' political leadership, who were, at the time, discussing Washington's latest ceasefire proposal. Doha has long acted as a mediator between Israel and Hamas, hosting the political office of the group for many years.

Views on Israel are divided among other Gulf nations. The UAE signed the Abraham Accords in 2020, recognizing Israel and establishing diplomatic normalization along with Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco after years of Arab isolation. The agreement now faces ""the most difficult time since it was signed five years ago,"" Emirati academic and political scientist Abdulkhaleq Abdulla told CNBC.

U.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has made it his mission to improve ties between Israel and other Arab nations, cementing Washington's influence in the Middle East.

Saudi Arabia is Trump's next big hope for normalization of relations with Israel, but that could now be out of reach. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has signaled that this step would require a credible and irreversible pathway to the establishment of a Palestinian state.

For both the UAE and Saudi Arabia, the issues of ongoing deaths in Gaza and the potential Israeli annexation of the West Bank could imperil Trump's ambitions to expand the Abraham Accords during his second term.

""While relations can keep on being resilient, they are taking a different nature – limited in scope, mostly under-the-radar, focusing on security interests, and without a meaningful public dimension,"" Nimrod Goren, president and founder of Mitvim, told CNBC.

""Should the Israeli government decide to annex any part of Palestinian territories in the West Bank, following upcoming recognitions of a Palestinian state, then ties with Arab countries will suffer another blow and will further deteriorate. Israel should refrain from such a step, and the US should stop any such intentions,"" he added.

Meta spent billions of dollars unsuccessfully trying to make virtual reality catch on with consumers. As it shifts its metaverse bet toward smart glasses, investors will be watching to see how the public responds.

The social media company is set to unveil its most advanced smart glasses yet on Wednesday at its Connect annual event. The glasses, internally codenamed Hypernova, feature a small display that can be controlled via hand gestures through a wristband that utilizes neural technology, CNBC reported in August.

A promotional video of the device reportedly appeared on Meta's YouTube page on Monday but was later removed.

The device, expected to cost $800, builds upon Meta's partnership with EssilorLuxottica, which spawned the AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses in 2023 and the Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses unveiled in June. Those glasses contain cameras, speakers and microphones, allowing users to command the Meta AI voice assistant to take a photo, shoot video or play music.

Wall Street has been concerned about the spending by Reality Labs, the company's division in charge of developing consumer hardware products like the Ray-Ban Meta glasses and the Quest VR headsets. Meta revealed in July that its Reality Labs division recorded an operating loss of $4.53 billion during the second quarter, and has totaled nearly $70 billion in losses since late 2020.

Investors understand that Meta's Reality Labs spending won't significantly pay off for years, but they also ""want to see progress"" that indicates they will ""see potential returns on investment,"" said Justin Post, a Bank of America Securities internet research analyst. For now, smart glasses seem like a more sound investment than VR headsets, which are still niche and could take years to blossom, he said.

""I've definitely seen the company's focus shift from VR headsets to glasses,"" Post said. ""At this point, the glasses are going to be much more impactful and more mass market.""

Meta declined to comment.

In Hypernova, Meta is selling smart glasses with a display to consumers for the first time. Though that display is expected to be small and limited in what it shows to users, the release of Hypernova represents a middle ground between the Ray-Ban Meta glasses and the experimental Orion augmented reality glasses that Meta showed off during last year's Connect event.

The Orion AR glasses, working in tandem with a wireless computing ""puck,"" can project 3D visuals onto the physical world that people can interact with using a wristband. But while the Orion AR glasses can produce dazzling visuals, it's still experimental and costly to make, said Anshel Sag, a principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.

""Delivering something like Orion at scale will take time, which is why they are still a prototype,"" Sag said. ""I think a single display is a move in the right direction and would help build an ecosystem of apps.""

Connect presents Meta with an opportunity to build off the unexpected success of the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, said Leo Gebbie, a CCS Insight analyst and director. EssilorLuxottica said in July, during the company's most recent earnings report, that Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses sales more than tripled year over year.

""It really feels like a chance to break through with a really new product category,"" Gebbie said.

Analysts will also be watching for any signs that Meta's recent artificial intelligence-related strategy shifts, which kicked off in June when the company invested $14.3 billion into Scale AI, can help its hardware efforts. The glasses could be the right hardware form factor for AI features, Post said.

""If they get the integration right with devices, it really could be a better portal for AI than even phones,"" he said.

But although Meta has the money and technical talent to build its smart glasses, it needs to cultivate an ecosystem of developers who will build compelling apps and software that captivate consumers, Sag said.

The risk for Meta is that consumers ultimately reject the Hypernova and potentially the broader market of smart glasses with displays, Gebbie said. At $800, the glasses are expected to cost more than twice as much as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, which start at $299. Already, Meta is setting low internal expectations for sales of the Hypernova glasses, CNBC reported in August, but the company will want the unveiling to at least generate some buzz.

Meta's ambition is for smart glasses to become the next major personal computing platform. For now, Apple and Google remain on top with the iOS and the Android mobile operating systems, respectively.

Apple declined to comment. Google didn't respond to a request for comment.

It's unclear if Meta's glasses will ever usurp the smartphone's standing with consumers, but there's enough of a threat that both Apple and Google are working on their own competitive products. Apple is reportedly working on its own glasses project, and Google in May announced a $150 million partnership with Warby Parker to build smart glasses

""The fact that everyone is now developing glasses suggests that Meta's Reality Labs concept was well conceived, and they're out in front at this point on glasses,"" said Post. ""The question for the competition is, can they leverage their mobile operating systems to get people to buy their glasses?""

Novo Nordisk on Wednesday flagged promising late-stage trial results for its new Cagrilinitide obesity treatment, as the Danish pharmaceutical giant seeks a next-generation alternative to its blockbuster Wegovy weight-loss drug.

Early analysis from a phase 3 REDEFINE 1 trial showed the once-weekly Cagrilintide monotherapy injection helped patients reduce their weight by 11.8% on average after 68 weeks, compared to 2.3% for those on placebo, the company said.

Cagrilintide is a nascent form of weight loss treatment which differs existing GLP-1s, such as Novo Nordisk''s Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound. The long-acting amylin analogue which works by mimicking a hormone that is co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas to increase satiety.

The drug maker also pointed to the treatment's increased tolerability profile, describing it as ""well-tolerated"" with the most common side effects being gastrointestinal and mainly ""mild to moderate.""

Shares of Novo Nordisk were up 1.3% by 11:15 a.m. London time, shortly after the findings were released.

""In our clinical trials, Cagrilintide has provided substantial weight loss, in a distinct manner compared to approved obesity medications, and appears well-tolerated,"" Martin Holst Lange, Novo Nordisk's chief scientific officer and executive vice president of research and development, said in a statement.

""We're excited that these data, the first phase 3 data of a next-generation amylin therapy, show promise and we look forward to further investigating Cagrilintide's potential in the dedicated phase 3 RENEW programme,"" Lange added.

Novo Nordisk is seeking a next-generation obesity treatment after the runaway success of its Ozempic diabetes and Wegovy obesity treatments have lately come under pressure from supply constraints and increased competition from copycat compounded drug makers.

Drug makers are also seeking alternative treatments for patients who struggle to remain on GLP-1s long term. Roche and Zealand Pharma are also developing an amylin analogue obesity treatment known as Petrelintide.

Investors were previously disappointed by late-stage trial results for CagriSema, a combination therapy which combines Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, along with Cagrilintide.

However, Soren Lontoft, pharma equity analyst at Sydbank, told CNBC that the side-effect profile was perhaps the most promising aspect of the new treatment.

""The side effect profile for Cagrilintide is of more interest than the weight loss. A more favourable side effect profile (with low discontinuation rate) than Wegovy and Zepbound is what I'm looking for,"" Lontoft said by email on Tuesday.

The sub-analysis trial results, which were presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes congress in Vienna, Austria, evaluated adult patients with obesity or overweight and a weight-related comorbidity without diabetes.

A dedicated phase 3 RENEW trial — which investigates the efficacy and safety of the drug in patients with obesity or who were overweight, but without associated comorbidities — is scheduled to start in late 2025.

In this article

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Tuesday it had opened an investigation into about 174,000 Tesla Model Y cars from the 2021 model year over reports that electronic door handles can become inoperative.

NHTSA said it had received reports citing an inability to open exterior doors, including after parents exited the vehicle to remove a child or to place a child in the rear seat before starting a trip.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

NHTSA's preliminary evaluation is the first step before the agency could seek a recall of the vehicles if it believes they pose an unreasonable risk to safety.

NHTSA said it has nine reports of parents being unable to open doors on 2021 Tesla Model Y vehicles. In those reports, parents were unable to reopen a door to regain access to the vehicle and in four instances parents resorted to breaking a window to regain entry into the vehicle.

The agency noted that Tesla vehicles have manual door releases inside, but children may not be able to access or operate the releases even if the vehicle's driver is aware of them.

NHTSA said its initial review suggests this condition appears to occur when the electronic door locks receive insufficient voltage from the vehicle. The agency said repair invoices report replacement of the vehicle's low voltage battery after incidents, but no owners reported seeing low-voltage battery warnings prior to exterior door handles failing.

 Strategy's Michael Saylor and BitMine's Tom Lee are among 18 industry leaders who will look at ways to pass the BITCOIN Act and enable budget-neutral ways to buy Bitcoin. 

US lawmakers are to meet with 18 crypto industry executives, including Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, on Tuesday to discuss how Congress can move forward with President Donald Trump's Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

Those in attendance will also include Fundstrat CEO Tom Lee, who is also the chairman of BitMine, as well as MARA CEO Fred Thiel, according to crypto advocacy group The Digital Chambers, which shared the full list with Cointelegraph on Monday. 

The industry executives are looking to build momentum behind the BITCOIN Act, a measure introduced by US Senator Cynthia Lummis in March that calls on the government to acquire one million Bitcoin (BTC) over five years. 

The purchases would be funded through the Federal Reserve and Department of the Treasury, with Trump's executive order stating that it must be financed through budget-neutral strategies.

The roundtable will be hosted by The Digital Chambers and its affiliate, The Digital Power Network, they said. 

The BITCOIN Act could be the next major focus for lawmakers on crypto legislation, following their efforts to pass the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill in July.

The Bitcoin industry executives will pitch ideas around how the US can fund these Bitcoin purchases without impacting taxpayers, the Digital Chambers told Cointelegraph.

Among the budget-neutral strategies that have been floated so far are the reevaluation of the Treasury's gold certificates and tariff revenue.

They will also seek to learn what has stalled momentum with the BITCOIN Act over the last six months, and what the biggest objections to the bill are among lawmakers.

Several Bitcoin mining executives will attend the roundtable as well, including CleanSpark executives Matt Schultz and Margeaux Plaisted, MARA's Jayson Browder, and Bitdeer's Haris Basit.

Oops, something went wrong

Some Bitcoin treasury firms are losing their luster as share prices sag below a key threshold, TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza shared in a Tuesday note.

Among 13 Bitcoin-buying firms tracked by the investment bank, four are trading “at meaningful discounts” against the value of their respective crypto holdings, he said. Among them were Semler Scientific (-4%), Sequans (-25%), DDC Enterprise (-18%), and Bitcoin Treasury Corp (-18%).

To an extent, these firms are trying to emulate Strategy's playbook. Like the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, they typically measure success based on the amount of Bitcoin that they own per share. All four firms pivoted toward buying Bitcoin this year.

Together, these firms have accumulated $1.15 billion worth of Bitcoin, but shifting stock prices have constrained a go-to source of funding. They can no longer issue common shares to buy Bitcoin, and while capturing that premium, purchase the asset to increase Bitcoin per share.

Strategy, which owns $73.49 billion worth of Bitcoin, has never slipped below the threshold. Within the cryptosphere, that ratio is colloquially referred to as mNAV, or market-to-net-asset value. Still, at a 1.29x premium, Strategy's mNAV was two basis points away from all-time lows on Tuesday, according to Bitcoin Treasuries.

“A lot of this is an attention game,” Carlos Guzman, a research analyst at market maker GSR, told Decrypt, suggesting that Strategy benefits from a first-mover advantage.

Strategy's premium peaked at 3.1x in November—before the debut of most Bitcoin treasury firms. As that premium has shrunk, common issuance has grown less accretive, Vitanza noted. That has made it more difficult for Strategy to grow its Bitcoin per share.

Bitcoin treasury firms are known to experience outsized volatility, “and bears clearly having their day,” Vitanza said. Some stocks should realistically trade at a premium, he said, given their lack of fees, ability to take on leverage through cheap debt, and manage operating expenses.

Bitcoin Goes Slack as US Strike on Venezuela Sparks Turmoil Ahead of Fed Meeting

Moreover, TD Cowen expects “a number” of existing Bitcoin treasury firms to outperform the underlying asset, Vitanza said, noting that some struggling ones will likely be acquired.

James Chanos is likely among the bears Vitanza pictured. In May, the famed short-short seller declared that he was betting on an increase in Bitcoin's price and against Strategy's shares. When he unveiled his trade, Strategy was trading at a 1.94x premium to its Bitcoin holdings.

On Monday, Bitcoin treasury firm Kindly MD saw its premium temporarily evaporate after its CEO, David Bailey, encouraged the company's doubters to sell their shares. Trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “NAKA,” its stock crashed more than 54% on Monday to $1.26 a share. The drop came after a tranche of shares became freely tradable for certain investors.

Shares rebounded to $1.51 on Tuesday, a 21% increase, according to Yahoo Finance. But with a market cap of around $568 million, the company's shares changed hands at a 1.004 premium to its Bitcoin holdings.

The market may be souring on certain Bitcoin treasury firms today, but broadly, an increase in the asset's price could flip the script fairly quickly, GSR's Guzman said.

“Excitement for Strategy has gone away, but then the market turns, and it comes back,” he said. “Even if we're seeing like these discounts right now, it could easily turn around if there's more excitement or a big rally in Bitcoin.”","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States extended their winning streak on September 15, posting a combined net inflow of $260.02 million, according to data from SoSoValue.

The inflows marked the sixth consecutive day of gains, reinforcing renewed institutional interest in the asset class.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) once again led the field, recording $261.82 million in daily net inflows. That brings its historical inflows to $60.04 billion, making it the dominant player in the market.

Fidelity's FBTC followed with $7.54 million, raising its cumulative inflows to $12.63 billion. Meanwhile, Bitwise's BITB posted the largest outflow of the day, losing $18.81 million, though its total net inflows still stand at $2.33 billion.

The surge pushed the combined net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETFs to $151.72 billion, representing 6.6% of the total Bitcoin market capitalization.

Cumulative inflows across Bitcoin products now total $57.09 billion. Daily trading activity remained strong as well, with $3.03 billion worth of transactions recorded on Monday.

The streak of inflows builds on momentum earlier in the week. On September 12 alone, Bitcoin ETFs attracted $552.78 million, led by IBIT with $366.2 million and Fidelity's FBTC with $134.7 million.

That session capped four straight days of positive flows, totaling $1.7 billion and reversing the weakness seen in early September, when funds recorded their first weekly outflows since June.

Ethereum ETFs are also seeing renewed demand after a period of turbulence. On September 15, BlackRock's ETHA logged its strongest inflow of the month, adding $363.19 million worth of Ether, or 80,768 ETH.

The one-day gain lifted ETHA's total assets to $17.09 billion and daily trading volume to $1.5 billion, marking a sharp rebound from more than $787 million in outflows recorded earlier in the month.

Grayscale's ETHE added $10 million on the day, while Fidelity's FETH saw $13.46 million in outflows. Despite recent volatility, cumulative inflows across all Ethereum ETFs have climbed to $13.72 billion, with assets under management at $30.35 billion.

The turnaround reflects a broader resurgence in crypto investment products. CoinShares reported that digital asset funds drew $3.3 billion in inflows last week, the largest since July.

Bitcoin led with $2.4 billion, while Ethereum reversed eight consecutive days of outflows to post $646 million in net inflows over four days.

With both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs now drawing steady inflows, analysts suggest institutional appetite remains strong despite ongoing market volatility.

92 Crypto ETF Applications Await SEC Review as Altcoin Funds Gain Momentum

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently reviewing 92 cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart.

The figure marks an increase from April, when 72 applications were pending, showing the accelerating pace of filings as asset managers push to expand regulated access to digital assets.

Most of the new proposals face October deadlines and center on altcoins such as Solana, XRP, and Litecoin. Solana leads the pipeline with eight filings, followed by seven for XRP, making the two tokens the most sought-after beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Industry heavyweights, including Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares, are among those seeking approval, with some proposals also targeting Ethereum staking products.

Meanwhile, new launches are imminent. The REX-Osprey XRP ETF, trading under the ticker XRPR, is set to debut this week after clearing the SEC's 75-day review period under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

It will be the first U.S. ETF to provide spot exposure to XRP. Within days, a Dogecoin ETF from the same issuer, DOJE, is expected to follow, marking the country's first memecoin ETF.

REX-Osprey previously introduced a Solana staking ETF in July, though inflows have been modest, and also filed for a BNB staking product.

Other filings point to broadening institutional interest. Bitwise has filed for a spot Avalanche ETF, structured as a Delaware statutory trust with Coinbase Custody as the administrator, while 21Shares has proposed an active crypto ETF and leveraged products tied to Dogecoin and Sui.

The flurry of applications comes as regulated crypto investment products gain traction globally.

Analysts say approval of altcoin ETFs could open new avenues for institutional capital, deepening liquidity across major tokens and potentially reshaping market dynamics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","How high can Ethereum price go after Fed rate cut?","https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-high-can-ethereum-price-go-after-fed-rate-cut","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 11:42:40 GMT","

 Ether price eyed fresh highs as it held above a key trendline, with markets betting on a 96% chance of Fed cuts and further easing this year. 

Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has fallen 5.73% from its weekend high near $4,766, retreating as traders trim risk ahead of Wednesday's Federal Reserve interest rate decision. 

The pullback reflects caution in the market, but the bigger question is whether the Fed's potential dovish shift could reignite Ethereum's rally and how far its next move might extend.

Ether bulls are defending the 20-day exponential moving average (20-day EMA; the green wave) near $4,450, showing resilience as markets price in a 96.1% chance of a Fed rate cut this week, up from 85.4% a month ago, with two more reductions expected by year's end.

The consolidation has become a bull pennant, a continuation pattern typically preceding another leg higher. Volumes have steadily declined during this formation, a hallmark sign of a maturing pennant setup.

Related: Bitcoin, Ether could make ‘monster move' in next 3 months: Tom Lee

The chart pattern projects a move toward $6,750 by October, more than 45% above current levels, if ETH closes decisively above the pennant's upper trendline. 

This ETH upside target resembles the ones recently put forth by Tesseract CEO James Harris and analyst Donald Dean.

A failure to defend the 20-day EMA could open the door to a further decline toward the area defined by the triangle's lower trendline (~$4,350) and the 50-day EMA (the red wave) near $4,200.

But many analysts say these declines will likely lead to more dip-buying, leading the ETH price higher.

That includes chartist Ash Crypto, who suggested that dropping below the pennant's lower trendline wouldn't invalidate the upside setup but instead send prices rallying over $5,000 in the coming weeks.

Chartist TheBullishTradR shares a similar view, suggesting that Ethereum could still retrace into the $4,100–$4,300 “super trend support” zone before staging a more substantial reversal higher.

Meanwhile, analyst Luca notes that ETH has reclaimed the golden pocket (0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement lines), with price now aligning closely to this zone and the daily Bull Market Support Band.

The chartist sees this as a classic “Breakout → Retest setup,” when price breaks above resistance, then pulls back to test it as support before continuing higher. He added:

Key Takeaways

U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs command $151.72 billion in total net assets, or 6.6% of BTC's market cap.

The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to announce a rate cut on Sept. 17, 2025.

Ethereum ETFs hold $29.72 billion in net assets, representing 5.46% of ETH's market cap.

Markets are rallying behind the pending interest rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has seen $619.73 million pour into U.S. spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Interestingly, attention appears to be returning to ETH funds after a brief period of exits.

As per SoSoValue data, Ethereum ETFs recorded $359.73 million in daily total net inflows on Sept. 15, marking day five of a renewed inflow streak now totaling just over $1.09 billion.

After pulling a historical $5.43 billion in July, funds followed up this momentum with $3.87 billion in monthly net inflows for Aug.

This follows weeks of net inflows, the cracks began to show in late August and early September as investors pivoted back toward BTC ETFs, albeit briefly.

Momentum was lost and weekly outflows peaked at $787.74 million during the first week of Sept. As of today, those losses have been balanced out.

As per SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs garnered $260.02 million in daily total net inflows on Sept. 15, 2025.

It marks a fifth consecutive day of inflows now totalling more than $2.6 billion.

Bitcoin funds conceded some ground to ETH funds through July, though they still managed to tally $6.02 billion in monthly net inflows.

They suffered a similar fate in August, when they saw $751.12 million in monthly net outflows.

Markets are now rallying in anticipation of tomorrow's supposed rate cut announcement, and behind ETFs, crypto markets have moved steadily over the past week.

As per CoinMarketCap, the crypto market cap is up by half a percentage at $4.01 trillion in the past 30 days.

Bitcoin is trading up $115,405 for the past week, and Ethereum has risen 3.87% to $4,501 in that same time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","$XRP Flashes Massive Buy Signal — Could These Be the Best Altcoins to Explode?","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:ee7fd4bd3094b:0-xrp-flashes-massive-buy-signal-could-these-be-the-best-altcoins-to-explode/","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 10:30:47 GMT","

Crypto analysts found a strong ‘buy signal' in $XRP's recent market performance, indicating a potential significant upward move very soon.

Specifically, trader Ali Martinez identified a TD Sequential in XRP's charts. $XRP has been trading around the critical $3.00 support zone. This is important because, historically, significant $XRP accumulation happened at this level. 

Traders worry about the coin falling below the $3.00 support, which could cause a decline of roughly 10% to approximately $2.70.

$XRP's future performance could depend on factors such as the SEC's decision on $XRP-related ETFs and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies.



Overall, technical indicators suggest a bullish market trend, indicating that now's the perfect time to consider investing in $XRP. However, you should prepare for some market volatility to manage the risks carefully.

As $XRP climbs, investors reaping profits are rotating their gains into emerging altcoins, such as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Maxi Doge ($MAXI), sparking a wider altcoin surge.

Read here to learn about the best altcoins to buy this altseason.

1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Is Turning Bitcoin Into a Powerhouse – You Won't Believe How

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is an upcoming scalability solution that fills the gap between Bitcoin's security and the speed and liquidity of Layer 2 ecosystems. $HYPER offers a variety of features including:

$HYPER is a triple-chain utility token with its promising tokenomics and multi-chain capabilities, positioning it as a versatile asset for advanced portfolio strategies.

Read more about Bitcoin Hyper's utility in our guide.



The project has also been gaining wide traction from big players. Yesterday two whales scooped $58.6K worth of $HYPER, split between a $31.5K and a $27.1K buy — signalling that big wallets are not waiting! Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is currently priced at $0.012925 with a listing price set at $0.012975. Considering the project's ambitious roadmap, our expert projections place $HYPER at $0.02595 by the end of 2025 (about 100% ROI), $0.08625 by the end of 2026 (around 7.5x ROI), and as high as $0.253 by 2030 (over 22x ROI from presale). 

Besides, you can earn up to 70% APY by staking. If you buy $1,000 $HYPER today, you could acquire ~77,370, potentially earning around $700 in staking rewards by year-end.

That's $1,700 if the price only reaches the listing level, while the upside could be much higher when $HYPER hits its roadmap milestones.

Presale opportunities like this don't wait. Here's how to buy Bitcoin hyper today!

Secure your $HYPER at today's presale rate and staking rewards — tomorrow could bring the next surge.

2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Is Taking Meme Coins to the Moon – Here's What You Need to Know

Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is another booming meme coin that combines meme culture with aggressive utilities. The project's biggest USP is its super high staking rewards, initially as much as 146%.

Additionally, $MAXI isn't just a token; it's a lifestyle. Every buy-in is a flex—max leverage, max pump, max culture. Here is why $MAXI could be your next big bag this altseason:



Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is now priced at $0.0002575, with a total of $2.2M raised so far. The next price surge is less than two days away, and with $MAXI whales buying $37K less than a month ago, you can practically feel the pump.

Investing $500 in $MAXI today could be pretty profitable down the line, considering both price appreciation and stakeholding rewards.

At a 146% APY, $500 could generate up to $730 in staking rewards by year-end, bringing your total gains to $1,230, even without factoring in a potential price spike.

With $MAXI, the upside potential is unmistakable if the token continues to ride the altseason momentum. You can grab your $MAXI today by visiting the Maxi Doge presale website — the next pump could hit as soon as tomorrow.

3. Why $XRP's Upcoming Bounce Means Altcoins Are Ready to Explode

$XRP's upward price trend has a general positive impact on the altcoin market for numerous reasons. For starters, when a bluechip coin like $XRP rallies, it renews investor optimism and boosts market confidence, a sentiment that spills over into other altcoins.

Furthermore, $XRP's price rally mirrors the growing institutional interest, which is increasing trading volumes, creating a favorable environment for altcoins to perform well.



TradingView's 1-week rating suggests a strong bullish outlook, with analysts projecting a potential surge towards the $4.20–$4.50 range once the coin breaches the resistance level around $3.40.

Additionally, $XRP breaking key resistance levels coincides with favorable macroeconomic conditions, such as Bitcoin stabilization and regulatory clarity, which simultaneously boosts the broader altcoin market appeal. $XRP is now live on major crypto exchanges, while $HYPER and $MAXI presales remain exclusive to early presale buyers. With $XRP leading the charge, early investors have a chance to score big by joining in on $HYPER and $MAXI presale today. 

This isn't financial advice. The cryptocurrency market can be highly volatile. Always do your own research before making any investments.

A surge in leveraged bets on altcoins is beginning to build ahead of a key Federal Reserve policy decision this week, a move that could introduce significant volatility to the crypto markets this month.

Altcoin open interest is now close to surpassing Bitcoin's, a setup that has historically preceded a drawdown in blue-chip digital assets.

“An uptick in altcoin leverage is the eagerness for alt season,” Stephen Gregory, founder of crypto trading platform Vtrader, told Decrypt. 

Gregory pointed to the recent rally for altcoins last week and leveraged bets as evidence for the shifting sentiment.

Open interest for altcoins has swelled from $30 billion on September 1 to $38.6 billion as of Monday, eclipsing Bitcoin's $40 billion and Ethereum's $30 billion, according to Coinalyze data.

While open interest does little to provide a directional bias in the way prices move, it can indicate sophisticated traders are positioning themselves ahead of key events.

“People are rotated out of Bitcoin and into alts in the short term,” Gregory said, cautioning that larger traders may be attempting to “front run” the anticipated rate cut on Wednesday.

“The Fed's rate cut decision could cause retail to assume its bullish while whales lever up on shorts and push a liquidation event,” he said. 

Tensions have risen across both traditional and crypto markets over the central bank's future monetary policy as it fights to remain independent amid pressure from the Trump administration.

President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have previously urged the Fed to reduce its September Funds Rate by as much as 50 basis points, going so far as to call for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's resignation multiple times this year.

Given the backdrop, traders are now “bracing for potential volatility,” Shawn Young, chief analyst at MEXC Research, told Decrypt.

The analyst pointed to an increase in one-week at-the-money implied volatility and one-week 25-delta skews as evidence of anticipated short-term price movements.

“Given these indicators, we might expect heightened market activity and potential price fluctuations in the coming days,” he said. “Traders should remain vigilant and consider adjusting their strategies to navigate the anticipated volatility.”

ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart confirmed  that the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) and the Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) are scheduled to list on Sept. 18, following a short delay from their initial Sept. 12 target.

Both products were filed under a single prospectus, which also included TRUMP and BONK ETFs—though no launch date has been set for those.

Developed by REX Shares in partnership with Osprey Funds, the ETFs will allow investors to gain exposure to DOGE and XRP through standard brokerage accounts, sidestepping the need for crypto wallets or direct exchange holdings.

Shares will trade on major U.S. platforms like the NYSE or Nasdaq, making the tokens more accessible to traditional investors.

Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which went through a protracted approval process under the Securities Act of 1933, these funds leverage the Investment Company Act of 1940, commonly known as the “40 Act.”

The framework provides a streamlined path for products that include enhanced investor protections around custody, governance, and transparency—features regulators view favorably.

The ETFs will hold XRP directly while using a Cayman Islands subsidiary to manage exposure, capped at 25% of assets.

They may also use derivatives to supplement spot tracking, aligning with U.S. tax rules for regulated investment companies.

The SEC's willingness to greenlight products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum underscores growing institutional demand for altcoin exposure.

XRP and DOGE are merely the first in line: more than 90 ETF filings tied to other cryptocurrencies, including Avalanche and Litecoin, remain under review.

Analysts expect decisions on some of these as early as October, with approval odds running as high as 95%.

If successful, the XRP and DOGE ETFs could pave the way for billions in new inflows, potentially fueling broader adoption of altcoin-based investment products.","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Saying in a Monday (Sept. 15) blog post that it is in the early stages of this exploration, Base added it has not determined the timing, design or governance of a potential network token.

The company said it had not considered adding a network token in the past but is exploring it now because its blockchain and ecosystem have expanded Base's original goals to become “an open stack that makes it simple for anyone to build, trade and earn on-chain.”

“As we look toward building a global on-chain economy, we believe it should be open and accessible,” Base said in the post. “As the ecosystem has grown and community participation has deepened, it's made us reconsider our philosophy.

“Exploring a network token is one path toward making our vision of a global on-chain economy real, and a Base network token has the potential to accelerate Base's decentralization and expand opportunities for builders and creators across the ecosystem,” the company said.

Coinbase opened the Base blockchain to the public in August 2023 after a six-month test phase in which the network was open to developers.

The company said at the time that Base was designed to be low cost, easy to use, built for developers, decentralized and connected into the largest decentralized ecosystem, Ethereum.

Coinbase said during a July 31 earnings call that Base Chain now supports real-time settlement of stablecoin payments.

PYMNTS reported at the time that with USDC volume up, Base Chain scaling and business-focused products like Coinbase Business and Shopify integration gaining ground, Coinbase is pushing toward a vision of crypto as connective tissue for modern finance.

In a Monday post on X, Coinbase Co-Founder and CEO Brian Armstrong said the company is exploring a Base network token because it could support the acceleration of decentralization and expansion of creator and developer growth in the Base ecosystem.

“To be clear, there are no definitive plans,” Armstrong said. “We're just updating our philosophy. As of now, we're exploring it.”

ByChrister Holloman,

Contributor.

The payments and asset management industries are undergoing a fundamental reset. A report from McKinsey published last this summer finds that stablecoins and tokenized cash are emerging as serious challengers to incumbent infrastructure, with transaction volumes forecast to reach as much as $250 billion per day within three years. That inflection point is forcing banks, asset managers, and technology providers to move quickly or risk irrelevance.

Few incumbents are leaning in as aggressively as Franklin Templeton. The firm's head of digital assets, Roger Bayston, says blockchain technology is not a side project but a new foundation for how securities, funds, and collateral will be issued, traded, and managed.

Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton

Bayston recalls that Franklin Templeton's early work in the space was pure R&D. The question was basic: What could distributed ledgers do for an asset manager? The answer was equally basic at first, eliminate costly reconciliations and duplicative ledgers that plague capital markets. But once the regulatory picture began to shift in the U.S. earlier this year, the firm moved from exploration to commercialization.

“The biggest challenge we faced for years was the regulatory construct,” Bayston said. “That changed dramatically after the first of the year. Now it's about focus, delivery, and scaling what we've incubated into real products.”

Franklin Templeton's showcase product is Benji, the blockchain-enabled representation of its U.S. Government Money Fund. Instead of holding shares in a brokerage account, investors hold a token in a digital wallet. Transfers are nearly instantaneous, and the fund pays intraday yield calculated down to the second, a feature impossible in legacy systems.

While the concept may sound niche, demand is growing. Early adopters include crypto-native firms and exchanges looking for a yield-bearing alternative to stablecoins in collateral management. Bayston noted that these clients want to post collateral that earns income, not sit idle. In practice, that means Benji can slot into derivatives and lending markets where stablecoins dominate today.

McKinsey's report highlights exactly this convergence. Yield-bearing, tokenized cash equivalents are becoming popular complements to traditional stablecoins, with Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Ondo among the early movers.

For Bayston, tokenization is not just about faster money funds. It is about transforming what investors can own, “We've updated transfer agency infrastructure with blockchain,” he said. “Now, previously illiquid or non-fungible assets, from private funds to fractional ownership of a sports team, can potentially be wrapped into a client portfolio alongside traditional securities.”

Natalya Thakur, is CEO of Knova which provides the API infrastructure layer that unifies traditional and tokenized assets, helping institutions manage, automate, and transact across all asset types in real time and she commented,

“Franklin Templeton's launch of Benji shows how tokenization is making even the most traditional products, like government money funds, more dynamic and interoperable. Institutions are seeking to integrate tokenized and traditional assets into a single operational stack, where yields can be optimized and collateral can move instantly. Tokenized funds like Benji will thrive when paired with infrastructure that lets firms orchestrate them side-by-side with securities, stablecoins, and deposits.”

That idea echoes McKinsey's thesis that tokenized money, deposits, and securities could reshape capital markets, treasury operations, and even cross-border remittances. The implications extend beyond cost savings to entirely new product categories and customer segments.

Franklin Templeton has already launched multiple versions of Benji, including U.S. and European Union structures. Early traction is strongest in crypto-native markets where the instrument is used as collateral, but Bayston envisions adoption in public markets as regulations catch up.

He points to recent developments like the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation and the U.S. GENIUS Act as accelerants. With clearer rules, tokenized funds can coexist with, or even displace, stablecoins in mainstream financial plumbing.

Bayston avoids bold five-year predictions, but he is confident about the near term. Franklin Templeton has built a tokenization platform across public and private funds. The next step is deploying it widely across its asset management businesses.

“We know the wallet ecosystems have hundreds of millions of customers we don't touch today,” Bayston said. “Meeting their needs is a tremendous opportunity for us.”

The McKinsey report argues that 2025 could be the year stablecoins and tokenized assets cross into the financial mainstream. For Franklin Templeton, the shift is already underway. By blending plain-vanilla money funds with blockchain rails, the firm is proving that tokenization is not just a theory but a functioning business model.

If other incumbents hesitate, they may find themselves disrupted not by fintechs but by peers willing to rewire their infrastructure for the digital era.

London, United Kingdom, September 16th, 2025, Chainwire

Today, XYO, the first DePIN and blockchain project with 10M+ nodes, launches XYO Layer One, a blockchain network designed specifically for data-heavy industries, such as those in artificial intelligence (AI), logistics, and cloud services. With this launch, XYO introduces the first blockchain built to handle large volumes of data without slowing performance, making it the first scalable network designed for data. XYO is the industry's first Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) project, earning $8.8M in revenue in 2024 and attracting 80% of its users from outside the crypto space.

Since 2018, XYO has been working on a variety of data-heavy blockchain products, such as the mobile app COIN, where users can turn their everyday data into real-world rewards. Initially focusing on location data, XYO has expanded today to house an ecosystem of over 10 million nodes, or data-producing devices and individuals, around the world. XYO's products are designed to provide accurate, validated data to third parties and its partners, ranging from simple real-world data such as location and temperature, to complex digital action validation, such as individual survey responses and shopping habits. In one campaign, XYO worked with a partner to optimize supermarket chains' product organization using responses from everyday shoppers.

XYO decided to launch its own blockchain after more than seven years in the industry, when no existing option could meet the project's need for a high-efficiency, data-focused network. The growth of other data-heavy industries, such as AI, Real-World Assets (RWA), and DePIN also require a blockchain designed specifically for this level of data usage. 

For example, AI models require enormous streams of accurate data to avoid bias and improve training outcomes. In real estate and supply chain management, tokenized assets depend on precise, verifiable inputs that XYO Layer One is capable of delivering. XYO Layer One's ability to process large volumes of real-time data with low latency and provide data validation capabilities offer a uniquely valuable solution for both emerging and established industries.
		



XYO will first migrate its own products to the new XYO Layer One blockchain, and be followed by key partners.

New technologies in XYO Layer One tackle the most outdated processes in blockchain today. Current chains scale poorly, slowing down transactions and causing immense gas price spikes. XYO Layer One introduces novel features that evolve blockchain into technology that can scale regardless of data and transaction load. XYO has published deeper information about these features (such as XYO's Lookback Window, Step Hash, and Proof of Perfect innovations) with their XYO Layer One documentation.

XYO's lightweight model improves blockchain speeds, and minimizes hardware strain for DePIN, RWA, AI and other data-heavy projects. 

New Chain, New Tokenomics

The new XYO Layer One Blockchain also arrives with the debut of a dual-token model for XYO, who launched their first and eponymous cryptotoken, $XYO, in 2018. Today, the XYO token is listed on most of the world's major exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, Kucoin, and Bitpanda with more to be announced in the coming weeks. 
		



$XYO token functions as a deflationary asset with a fixed supply, and within the XYO Layer One Blockchain, $XYO serves as the primary token for DePIN rewards, governance, payment, security and staking roles. $XYO is designed to secure the protocol and align long-term incentives flawlessly and will continue to do so for the lifespan of XYO.  

For handling the continuous, high-volume transactional demands of XYO Layer One, XYO is launching their second token, $XL1. The new token is expertly designed to serve as the native token of XYO Layer One, powering the daily operations of the network, including payment of gas fees, transaction processing, blockchain functions, priority fees, and rewards for node operation. $XL1 complements the original $XYO token by handling utility while $XYO remains the core token of XYO's massive product ecosystem, governing the new XYO Layer One blockchain and maintaining the token's long-term value. 

$XL1 is earned by staking $XYO, which locks $XYO token into XYO Layer One and creates perpetual relevance within the ecosystem. A significant portion of $XYO's circulating supply is expected to remain locked within XYO Layer One over the long term through its combined staking and incentivization model. By staking $XYO, participants earn $XL1, which allows them to engage with all functions of the chain while also securing the reliability and efficiency of the broader ecosystem. System staking is available, enabling anyone to stake $XYO and earn $XL1. Early participants benefit from higher emissions, as rewards decrease gradually over time.

The original $XYO token provides governance, staking, and long-term value for the XYO ecosystem, while $XL1 covers rewards and transactions for its native XYO Layer One blockchain. This model creates a practical blockchain framework that's capable of supporting DePIN, AI, and other demanding, data-focused applications.

About XYO:




Founded in 2018, XYO is the first DePIN and among the largest, with more than 10 million nodes worldwide. XYO collects and validates data, connecting Web3, Web2, and industries such as AI, real-world assets (RWA), and geolocation. Its unique Proof of Location and Proof of Origin technologies secure data for asset tracking, DePIN applications, gaming, and a variety of other demanding industries. XYO created the COIN App, which introduced millions of users to blockchain by rewarding participation in data validation. The XYO token is listed on most of the world's major exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, KuCoin, and Bitpanda. In addition to establishing the XYO Foundation, XY Labs Inc. became the first crypto company in the United States to gain SEC approval for a Regulation A offering, opening investment to both accredited and non-accredited investors. In 2022, XY Labs tokenized its shares, which trade as $XYLB on the tZERO ATS, establishing its leadership in the RWA space.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","American Express is now offering NFT passport stamps for travelers","https://cointelegraph.com/news/american-express-unveils-nft-passport-stamps-customers","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 02:11:04 GMT","

 American Express cardholders can now receive NFT passport stamps showing the countries they've visited as a way to commemorate their past travels. 

Payments company American Express has launched blockchain-based stamps for customers as a digital keepsake of their travels.

Each travel stamp will be stored as an ERC-721 non-fungible token on the Ethereum layer-2 Base to preserve their travel history and their favorite overseas memories, according to the company's website. 

“Part of the magic of travel is reminiscing about past getaways, and commemorative keepsakes are a powerful way for travelers to relive their favorite trips,” Amex Digital Labs Executive Vice President Luke Gebb said on Monday. 

“As physical passport stamps continue to disappear, Amex Passport creates an opportunity for Card Members to celebrate their travels.” 

Each stamp can be customized to highlight the best experiences from each trip, such as a special attraction, standout meal, or hotel stay, or favorite activity, Amex said.

Only those holding a US Amex consumer card linked to their online account are eligible for the Amex Passport, and the NFTs cannot be transferred. 

Each stamp will only show the country or region of the stamp, stamp description, and the date of when the stamp was earned, Amex said, adding that personal information and trip details won't be visible on Base. 

Data from Base's block explorer, BaseScan, shows that the Amex travel stamp smart contract was created 25 days ago.

The development is the latest example of a public blockchain helping corporations and their users securely store data without a centralized server. 

Last month, the US Department of Commerce said it would start publishing economic statistics, including gross domestic product data, on the blockchain. 

Demand for new travel stamp solutions is strong, too, according to a recent Amex survey, which found 73% of respondents wanted more ways to commemorate past trips digitally.

Another 56% said they missed receiving passport stamps when arriving in a new country.

Amex travel stamps can be shared on social media or saved to a camera roll, and trips booked through Amex up to two years ago will be automatically added for customers.

The crypto travel industry remains relatively niche but has picked up the pace in recent months.

In February, crypto-native travel platform Travala integrated crypto payment options for 2.2 million hotels on Trivago, a hotel metasearch engine that allows users to compare accommodation prices from various booking sites.

Data from Travala in May showed crypto users typically spend three times more for an average hotel stay and typically stay longer in a certain place to accompany their flexible and remote working lifestyles.

Meanwhile, Triple-A data states that 14% of crypto transactions were spent on travel and hospitality in 2024, while more airlines started accepting crypto for bookings.

American Express launches NFT passport stamps using blockchain to help travelers preserve memories as physical stamps fade away.


American Express passport stamps are now available to cardholders who want to capture their journeys digitally. 
The company launched these blockchain-based stamps as a way for travellers to record and share memories, as physical passport stamps begin to fade from use. 
This move shows both nostalgia for travel traditions and the rising demand for digital keepsakes.
How American Express Passport Stamps Work
Cardholders who use a U.S. consumer Amex card linked to their online account are eligible for the program. 
Whenever they make international purchases or book trips, stamps are automatically generated. American Express has even backdated the feature, adding travel history from up to two years ago.

Ready for your next trip? @AmericanExpress just rolled out in-app passport stamps to give travelers new ways to collect, own, and share their journeys — built on Base.https://t.co/QyLknA5W7B
— Base (@base) September 15, 2025

Moreover, each stamp displays only the country or region, a description and the date it was earned. Notably, sensitive information like personal trip details is not visible on Base. 
This ensures privacy while still creating a shareable travel record. Stamps can be posted on social media, saved to a camera roll or used as a personal archive of travel milestones.
Why Blockchain for Travel Memories
Physical passport stamps are disappearing across parts of Europe as new electronic systems replace them. 
American Express passport stamps are aiming to tap into traveller nostalgia by offering a digital replacement. According to a company survey, 73% of respondents wanted better digital ways to commemorate trips and 56% said they miss receiving traditional stamps.
Blockchain technology makes sure that each stamp is permanent, tamper-proof and securely stored, without relying on centralised servers. 
By making the tokens non-transferable, American Express is aiming to avoid regulatory issues tied to speculation. This sets up the product as a utility-focused feature, rather than another crypto collectable.
Travel Industry Embracing Blockchain
American Express is not alone in bringing blockchain into travel. Platforms like Travala already allow users to book millions of hotels with crypto. 
Data shows that crypto users tend to spend more per stay and stay longer due to remote work flexibility. Airlines and hospitality providers are also gradually accepting crypto payments.
American Express passport stamps stand out because they address an emotional need, rather than a payment process. 
Instead of focusing on transactions, the stamps celebrate the experiences behind them. This makes the feature appealing to travellers who value memories as much as convenience.
Market and Industry Response
The launch has been received positively. American Express shares rose slightly this week after the announcement, while Coinbase stock also edged higher. 
The move shows confidence that blockchain can be integrated into mainstream financial products without relying on speculation.
Overall, American Express passport stamps show how blockchain can move beyond finance and speculation into everyday applications. Instead of focusing on profit, the stamps prioritise user experience and memory preservation.
For a company with a long history in travel services, the feature combines tradition with technology in a way that feels natural. 
As physical stamps disappear, American Express offers a modern alternative that could redefine how travellers capture their journeys.

American Express has launched a blockchain-based travel stamp system for US cardholders. The digital stamps serve as commemorative keepsakes for international trips.

The stamps are stored as ERC-721 non-fungible tokens on Base, Ethereum's layer-2 network. Each stamp records the country visited and the date earned without revealing personal information.

Only US Amex consumer cardholders with linked online accounts can access the feature. The NFTs cannot be transferred between users or sold.

The stamps are part of a new Amex travel app launching September 18 for iOS. Android users will get access in the following weeks.

Cardholders can customize each stamp with trip highlights. These might include special attractions, meals, hotel stays, or activities from their travels.

The stamps can be shared on social media or saved to camera rolls. Trips booked through Amex up to two years ago will be automatically added for customers.

An Amex survey found 73% of respondents want more ways to commemorate trips digitally. Another 56% said they miss receiving physical passport stamps when entering new countries.

Luke Gebb, Executive Vice President at Amex Digital Labs, said the feature helps travelers celebrate their journeys. He noted that physical passport stamps continue to disappear worldwide.

Data from BaseScan shows the Amex travel stamp smart contract was created 25 days ago. The contract handles the minting and storage of the digital stamps.

The stamps only display country information, descriptions, and earning dates. Personal details and specific trip information remain private on the blockchain.

Fireblocks provides wallet services for the NFT feature. This ensures secure token management for cardholders using the system.

The new app includes other travel features beyond NFT stamps. It combines booking, planning, and trip management in one platform.

Users get access to themed destination guides and centralized trip details. The app connects directly to premium programs like Fine Hotels + Resorts and The Hotel Collection.

A new feature shows estimated wait times at Centurion Lounges when they reach capacity. This helps Platinum Card holders better plan their airport time.

The crypto travel industry has grown in recent months. Travala integrated crypto payments for 2.2 million hotels on Trivago in February.

Data from Triple-A shows 14% of crypto transactions went to travel and hospitality in 2024. More airlines have started accepting crypto for flight bookings.

READ MONOGRAPH  

PwC has acted as financial and legal advisor to Antolin, a global supplier of technological solutions for the automotive interior, in the formalization of a €150 million financing within the framework of the guarantee plan of the Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO). 

The financing is part of ICO's guarantee program aimed at supporting access to credit for companies with tariff exposure in the United States. In addition to ICO, five of Antolin's main financing entities have participated in the operation: CaixaBank, Santander, BBVA -acting as agent bank-, Sabadell and HSBC. The loan has a maturity of seven years and a grace period of 18 months, which will allow the company to extend the average life of its debt, increase its liquidity and gain operating margin to continue promoting its strategic roadmap.

With this transaction, Antolin reinforces its financial strength and advances in the consolidation of its transformation plan, focused on improving profitability and adapting to the new demands of the automotive industry.

PwC's legal team was led by David Mellado (partner) and Javier Peñalver (partner), with the support of Jose Andrés Torrente Blanco (associate).

Next month will mark the fifth anniversary of the start of public pilots for China's  central bank digital currency (CBDC). This timing could mark very significant changes in the project. Earlier this week, Mu Changchun gave a slightly cryptic speech about the CBDC, known as the eCNY or digital RMB. Mr Mu is the leader of the Digital Currency Research Institute at the People's Bank of China. Our interpretation of his remarks is that he implied that the central bank may embrace tokenization and that the digital currency may morph into involving fractional banking, although he did not explicitly say so. If that's the case, it would become a tokenized deposit solution anchored by a wholesale CBDC.

In other words, rather than the current CBDC requirement of 100% backing at the central bank, perhaps commercial banks might only keep a proportion of issued tokens at the central bank, or just use it for interbank settlement. Mr Mu also highlighted the problematic lack of interest payments for eCNY holders, given their reluctance to hold idle currency. If a central bank directly offered interest to the public, that could crowd out commercial bank deposits. But if the eCNY simply becomes a format for fractional banking, then it makes sense to allow digital currency holders to earn interest.

As context, he discussed how the credibility of commercial bank money is underpinned by the central bank's role as lender of last resort combined with deposit insurance. He said, “the central bank's guarantee capabilities have effectively given commercial bank money the characteristics of central bank money, blurring the lines between the two and leading to their gradual convergence.”

Friends,

In the midst of the Trump regime's shameful attempt to attack any and all organizations and institutions that oppose it, we must not and will not back down from holding Trump accountable for his corruption and lawlessness. 

Yesterday, the New York Times — which Trump just sued for $15 billion for allegedly defaming him — reported that Steve Witkoff, Trump's envoy to the Middle East, apparently made a multi-billion dollar deal with Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of the ultrarich ruling family of the United Arab Emirates who controls $1.5 trillion of the Emiratis' sovereign wealth.

In return for Sheikh Tahnoon's investment firm depositing $2 billion into World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency start-up founded by the Witkoffs and Trumps, the White House agreed to give the U.A.E. — in particular, a sprawling technology firm controlled by Sheikh Tahnoon — access to hundreds of thousands of the world's most advanced and scarce computer chips, despite national security concerns that the chips could be shared with China.

This is just the top of the iceberg of Trump's crypto corruption. 

To understand the full extent of it, you need to go back to four days before early voting started in 2024. That's when Trump and his sons launched the crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. 

As soon as Trump won, money started pouring in.

Then, just days before returning to office, Trump launched a separate crypto scheme, selling TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins. Memecoins are a type of cryptocurrency based on an image or online joke.

Within his first six weeks in office, Trump called for a “Crypto Strategic Reserve”— a government backed stockpile of crypto assets, sort of like our oil reserve, but completely pointless. That announcement made crypto prices soar.

So far, the Trump family has made about $3 billion from crypto  — with many purchases by foreign buyers. Forbes now estimates that over half of Trump's entire net worth is crypto-based.

With Trump acting as both the President of the United States and as his own crypto brand ambassador, it's hard to tell which job he's doing at any given moment.

One US company said it explicitly purchased $2 million of Trump's meme coins to influence trade policy.

The corruption goes further. 

Trump's pro-crypto SEC chair, Paul Atkins is heavily invested in crypto himself. He's been lifting financial guardrails in ways that will make it easier for crypto firms (like the Trumps') to spread into new markets, and going easy on crypto fraud. 

Chinese billionaire Justin Sun had been charged with crypto-related fraud before Trump was elected. After Trump's election, Sun invested more than $115 million into various Trump crypto products. What happened next? Trump's SEC suddenly stopped prosecuting Sun. 

Trump's SEC also abandoned a lawsuit against Binance, a crypto exchange that had previously pled guilty to money laundering.

This happened just days after Binance started listing a Trump cryptocurrency on its marketplace.

The corruption goes even further. 

Trump's Justice Department even scrapped the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, giving a green-light to all kinds of crypto crime, even though Americans lost $9.3 billion in crypto scams in 2024.

The crypto industry spent big on House and Senate races, on both Republicans and Democrats. Why? So the Senate would pass the so-called GENIUS Act — a regulatory bill that the crypto industry lobbied for. Eighteen Democrats joined with nearly all Republicans to vote yes.

The bill gives a stamp of legitimacy to so-called “stablecoins,” a type of currency that Trump's World Liberty Financial makes and sells. 

Stablecoins claim to be more stable because they're supposedly tied to the value of other assets that are held as collateral — like the dollar or Treasury securities. But we already saw one collapse just a couple years ago, wiping out some investors' life savings.

While the bill appropriately bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins, it places no such restrictions on the president.

The most dangerous part of the GENIUS Act is how it allows crypto to reach into mainstream financial systems. 

All this corruption is bad enough. Worse, it could tank the economy.

The GENIUS Act opens the door to institutions investing more heavily in crypto. It would even let banks and big corporations, like Walmart, Amazon, or Facebook, launch their own digital currencies — potentially thousands of them — all with little oversight.

Trump has also opened the door to letting retirement plan administrators invest 401(k) funds in crypto. That could put your savings at risk even if you never buy any cryptocurrencies.

As we saw during the 2008 financial meltdown, the more the economy becomes entwined with volatile and speculative investments, like crypto, the greater the risk to all of us. The failure of risky bets can have a domino effect.

If a single cryptocurrency began to tank — as crypto has done in the past — investors would likely rush to sell off crypto to get their real money back. This could lead to massive bank runs.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has predicted that under the GENIUS Act, crypto firms could end up holding more than $2 trillion in U.S. treasury bills as collateral. If they had to suddenly liquidate those assets to cover a bank run, the value of U.S. securities could plummet, triggering a global financial crisis.

Crypto has shown no redeeming social value and it poses huge dangers to our economy. Yet Trump is enabling it to worm into the economy because he's taken huge crypto payoffs that have made him and his family billions of dollars. 

What can you do? 

For starters, please share this video to help spread the truth.

In a surprising pivot, the European Central Bank is exploring ways to transform its planned digital euro into something resembling a stablecoin, a move that could reshape the future of digital currencies in the region. According to insights from Anton Golub's Newsletter, this shift comes as regulators grapple with the dominance of private stablecoins like Tether, which they've effectively pushed out through stringent rules. The ECB's original vision for a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, was more conservative, but recent pressures from U.S.-based innovations and declining cash usage have forced a rethink.

This development follows the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which has made it challenging for non-compliant stablecoins to operate in Europe. Golub's analysis highlights how the ECB is now considering “Plan C,” essentially mimicking stablecoin features to compete directly with private issuers. By doing so, the bank aims to maintain monetary sovereignty while offering users the convenience and programmability that have made stablecoins popular in crypto markets.

Regulatory Pressures and Strategic Shifts

The push for a stablecoin-like digital euro is also influenced by external factors, including the U.S. passage of the GENIUS Act, which has bolstered regulated stablecoins like Tether's new USA₮. As detailed in a recent post on Anton Golub's Newsletter, this American initiative has heightened competition, prompting European officials to accelerate their plans. Reuters has reported that the ECB is facing an uphill battle in the European Parliament, where concerns about privacy, banking sector disruption, and innovation stifling are rampant.

Industry insiders note that the digital euro could run on public blockchains such as Ethereum or Solana, a departure from earlier intentions to use private networks. This idea, covered in DL News, reflects a broader effort to enhance adoption and interoperability. By leveraging existing blockchain infrastructure, the ECB hopes to reduce reliance on non-European payment providers and strengthen the euro's global role, as outlined in Morningstar's analysis of the plan's implications for the single currency.

Challenges in Privacy and Adoption

Privacy remains a thorny issue, with lawmakers worried that a digital euro might enable excessive surveillance. Euronews has emphasized that while the project aims to preserve cash's anonymity in a digital form, striking the right balance with anti-money laundering requirements is crucial. Discussions among EU finance ministers are intensifying, targeting a legal framework by year's end, but hurdles like holding limits and inclusion of non-euro countries persist.

Critics argue that this stablecoin pivot might undermine traditional banks by disintermediating them from payment flows. Yet, proponents, including ECB officials, see it as essential for eurozone autonomy amid the rise of dollar-backed stablecoins. As Euronews reports, the digital euro won't rival the dollar internationally but could fortify Europe's financial independence.

Implications for Crypto and Global Finance

Looking ahead, this evolution could bridge the gap between centralized finance and decentralized ecosystems. Golub's Substack points out that after chasing Tether out, Europe is now chasing its model, potentially leading to hybrid systems where CBDCs integrate with DeFi protocols. This might spur innovation in programmable money, smart contracts, and cross-border payments, appealing to tech-savvy users and businesses.

However, success hinges on addressing parliamentary concerns and ensuring seamless integration with existing systems. As the ECB renews its pitch, per Reuters, the outcome will test Europe's ability to adapt to a digital-first economy without sacrificing core values like privacy and stability. For industry players, this signals a maturing market where central banks are no longer just regulators but active competitors in the digital asset space.

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has criticized Europe's digital currency ambitions, mocking the European Central Bank's Digital Euro project.

The criticism comes as regulators scramble to tighten oversight under the EU's landmark MiCA framework.

In a post on X (Twitter), Ardoino quipped that “Santa will bring us all the Digital Euro,” a sarcastic remark aimed at the central bank digital currency (CBDC) currently in its preparatory phase.

The ECB launched the Digital Euro in November 2023, billed as a secure and privacy-conscious complement to cash.

However, Ardoino's jibe suggests deeper tensions between CBDCs and private stablecoins like Tether's USDT, which dominate crypto markets outside Europe.

The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, in force since December 2024, was designed to standardize crypto oversight across the European Union. Yet just months into implementation, major national regulators say the rollout is already faltering.

France's Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), Austria's Finanzmarktaufsichtsbehörde (FMA), and Italy's Consob issued a joint statement warning of “major differences” in how countries are applying MiCA.

“Despite the coordination efforts of ESMA, the first few months of application of the Regulation have revealed major differences in how crypto-markets are being supervised,” read an excerpt in the statement.

The watchdogs stressed the need for urgent alignment with global standards from the Financial Stability Board and IOSCO.

They cautioned that crypto firms may “shop around” for lenient jurisdictions without stronger EU-level supervision.

In their opinion, this would expose investors to risks and undermine Europe's competitiveness.

Against this backdrop, the three watchdogs proposed four reforms:

Tether, meanwhile, has so far resisted engaging with MiCA. Under the law, stablecoin issuers face stringent requirements:

Ardoino has argued that these rules pose more risks than benefits for consumers and issuers. One key sticking point is the requirement for independent reserves audits, an area where Tether has long faced criticism.

When MiCA becomes safer for consumers and stablecoin issuers, then we might reconsider.

While the company publishes attestations, it has not secured a full audit since promising one in 2017. In an April 2025 interview, Ardoino acknowledged difficulties in securing a top-tier auditor, citing industry-wide reputational risks after the collapse of FTX and other scandals.

“Why would [an auditor] risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?” he said.

Consumer advocates remain unconvinced. A report from Consumers Research called Tether's lack of an independent audit a “distressing red flag” that may ultimately bar it from EU markets.

While Tether holds out, industry players like Coinbase, Kraken, and Bybit have already secured approvals under MiCA.

The European Commission has even floated proposals to soften certain provisions, raising further concerns among national regulators about regulatory arbitrage.

The next checkpoint will be in September, when the EU will provide a nine-month status update on MiCA's rollout.

Beyond skepticism about CBDCs, however, Ardoino's mockery of the Digital Euro highlights Europe's uneasy path in balancing innovation, investor protection, and competitiveness in the global digital asset market.

Next Technology Holding Inc., also known as NXTT, has joined the ranks of publicly traded firms that are increasing their exposure to Bitcoin. 

The firm filed a $500 million shelf registration to issue common stock while also stating that part of the capital will be channeled into the accumulation of Bitcoin.

Next Technology disclosed in its SEC filing that it is establishing a shelf registration for up to $500 million in common stock, paving the way for one or more offerings in the months ahead.

The announcement triggered an initial sell-off in NXTT shares, which fell almost 3% in post-market trading on Monday, according to Seeking Alpha.

While the filing gives management discretion over the use of proceeds, Next Technology has indicated in past disclosures and commentary that Bitcoin acquisition remains a core corporate strategy.

Within a short span, Next Technology has managed to establish itself as one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin relative to its size. The firm reported holding roughly 5,833 BTC, including 5,000 acquired in recent months.

The alignment with Bitcoin has boosted NXTT's profile among crypto-focused investors but also raised its risk profile. Bitcoin-linked equities tend to trade with high volatility, mirroring the digital currency's price swings.

NXTT's strategy is not so different from the moves made by Semler Scientific, which earlier this year filed a $500 million shelf registration to fund Bitcoin purchases and general corporate purposes. The trend is growing and for Next Technology, the potential to allocate part of the new proceeds toward additional BTC accumulation represents both a bet on long-term digital asset adoption and a branding exercise that aligns the company with the cryptocurrency narrative.

The longer-term impact lies in execution, and this includes how much stock is ultimately sold, at what prices, and how the capital is deployed. If a portion of proceeds is used for Bitcoin purchases, NXTT could further concentrate its balance sheet exposure to a single, volatile asset.

Investors remain divided on the merits of such a strategy. Advocates argue that Bitcoin's supply cap and growing institutional adoption justify corporate treasuries allocating capital to it as a hedge against inflation and a store of value.

NXTT has already tested investor tolerance for dilution. The company also recently announced a $9 million registered direct offering of stock and warrants. That sale was relatively modest compared to the new $500 million ceiling but illustrates management's willingness to raise funds quickly.

Despite the bullish narrative, risks abound. The SEC filing gives management a wide window in how to deploy proceeds, and there is no guarantee that significant sums will ultimately be directed toward BTC purchases.

Shareholders face potential dilution from future issuances, while the company's fortunes may become increasingly tethered to the volatility of digital asset markets.

The post China's Next Technology Holding Plans $500M Stock Sale to Boost Bitcoin Stash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News

Next Technology Holding, China's largest corporate bitcoin holder 2025, is planning to sell up to $500 million of its stock to buy more BTC and cover other business needs. The Nasdaq-listed company already owns 5,833 Bitcoin, worth around $671 million, making it the 15th-largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. Even with big paper profits from earlier purchases, the company is showing it wants to keep growing its Bitcoin stash.

Next Technology filed with U.S. regulators, saying the money raised from the stock sale would be used for general corporate purposes, with Bitcoin purchases at the top of the list. If the company uses half of the $500 million for Bitcoin, it could buy more than 2,100 BTC, bringing its total holdings to over 8,000 BTC.

This move is part of a larger trend where companies use stocks, loans, or other financial tools to buy Bitcoin. This year alone, the number of public companies holding BTC has nearly doubled to 190 companies as per data, and together they now own over 1 million BTC, which is more than 5% of all Bitcoin in circulation.

Next Technology's stock fell about 12% after the announcement, mainly because investors worried about the impact of issuing new shares. But the company has already made huge gains on its Bitcoin purchases. It bought its Bitcoin at an average price of $31,386, and with BTC now around $115,000, the holdings show a paper profit of more than 266%.

Corporate buying like this can reduce the number of Bitcoins available on exchanges, creating a supply squeeze. With only about 5% of Bitcoin left to mine, more corporate demand could push prices higher. Companies like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific are setting very high Bitcoin goals, 210,000 BTC and 105,000 BTC, showing how much influence corporate buying could have on the market.

This development is bigger than one company's play. It shows how Bitcoin is moving deeper into corporate balance sheet strategy, no longer just the domain of U.S. giants like MicroStrategy. A Chinese-linked firm ramping up BTC exposure also challenges the idea that Beijing's crypto stance stifles adoption completely; corporates are finding pathways to embrace digital assets globally.

If Next Technology follows through, it not only strengthens Bitcoin's case as a strategic reserve asset but also signals to Wall Street and Asia alike that treasury allocation to BTC is becoming mainstream.

As the world of online gambling continues to evolve, many Canadians are exploring the exciting realm of crypto casinos. With the rise of digital currencies, platforms like Stake have gained popularity for their unique offerings and user-friendly experience. But as we dive into this new frontier, a crucial question arises: Is Stake safe for Canadians?

Understanding the security of payments at crypto casinos is essential for players who want to protect their funds and personal information. For those looking for a deeper breakdown of features, bonuses, and safeguards, this Stake crypto casino review offers valuable insights into how the platform operates.

In this article, we'll unpack the security measures in place at Stake, examine potential risks, and provide practical tips to help you make informed decisions about your online gaming experience. Join us as we navigate the landscape of crypto gambling and uncover what you need to know about staying safe while enjoying the thrill of the game. 

GamblingInformation.com as experts of Stake casino and crypto casinos says that stake has emerged as a leading platform for crypto gambling, particularly among Canadians. This growth stems from its user-friendly interface and extensive range of gaming options. Stake offers everything from classic casino games to innovative slots, appealing to diverse preferences.

We attract players with competitive odds and enticing promotions, enhancing the overall gaming experience. Our loyalty program rewards frequent players, further solidifying its popularity. In addition, Stake's integration of popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum allows for seamless transactions, meeting the needs of tech-savvy users.

Safety remains a priority for Stake, utilizing advanced security protocols to protect player data and financial transactions. For Canadians, this assurance is critical, given the concerns surrounding online security. Stake implements measures such as two-factor authentication (2FA) and encrypted communication channels, which significantly diminish the risk of unauthorized access.

Moreover, Stake has cultivated a vibrant community through live chat features and social media engagement. This sense of community attracts players looking for interactive gaming experiences, making the platform even more appealing. As regulations around cryptocurrency gambling evolve in Canada, Stake positions itself as a trusted option for players seeking secure and enjoyable gaming.

Stake's combination of diverse games, competitive promotions, and robust security has contributed to its growing popularity in Canada's crypto gambling landscape.

Stake prioritizes the security of its users by employing various advanced technologies and protocols to ensure safe gaming experiences.

Stake uses state-of-the-art encryption technology to secure data transmissions between users and the platform. This encryption protects sensitive information, such as personal details and financial data, from unauthorized access. By using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocols, Stake encrypts communications, creating a safe environment for transactions. This commitment to encryption enhances users' trust while ensuring compliance with industry standards. Consequently, players can confidently engage in their gaming activities, knowing their data remains protected throughout their experience.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) plays a critical role in enhancing security on Stake. This protocol requires users to provide two forms of identification before accessing their accounts. Typically, this involves a combination of a password and a temporary code sent via SMS or an authentication app. By implementing 2FA, Stake significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, making it more challenging for potential security breaches to occur. This added layer of protection helps ensure that user accounts remain secure, allowing players to enjoy their gaming without concerns about their personal safety or data integrity.

We explore the diverse payment options at Stake, ensuring players can choose the most convenient and secure methods for transactions.

Stake embraces cryptocurrencies, providing seamless deposit and withdrawal options. We support popular digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple. These cryptocurrencies enhance transaction speed and security, appealing to players who prioritize anonymity and low fees. Players benefit from quick deposits, often processed instantly, while withdrawals typically occur within 24 hours, an advantage for crypto users. Additionally, Stake's integration of digital wallets allows users to manage assets easily and track their transactions effectively.

For players preferring traditional payment solutions, Stake offers various options. We accept credit and debit cards, including Visa and Mastercard, along with e-wallet services like Skrill and Neteller. These methods provide added convenience for Canadians not yet engaged in cryptocurrency. Deposits via these options generally process instantly, while withdrawal times may vary. By accommodating both crypto and traditional methods, Stake ensures all players can enjoy secure transactions that align with their preferences.

Understanding the regulatory landscape is crucial for Canadian players interested in crypto casinos like Stake. The legal framework governing online gambling and cryptocurrencies in Canada impacts payment security, user experience, and overall trust in the platform.

Canadian gambling laws vary by province, with each jurisdiction having specific regulations regarding online gaming and crypto gambling. Federal laws oversee money laundering and fraud prevention while allowing provinces to regulate gaming operations. While there isn't specific legislation for crypto casinos, existing legal principles apply. Canadian players must ensure they adhere to provincial regulations when engaging in crypto gambling activities, particularly regarding age restrictions and responsible gaming practices.

Licensing plays a vital role in ensuring the safety and security of crypto casinos. Stake operates under licenses from reputable jurisdictions, demonstrating compliance with stringent regulatory requirements. These licenses enforce measures related to player protection, responsible gambling, and secure financial transactions. Stake's adherence to international compliance standards enhances its credibility, ensuring our funds and personal information remain secure while gaming.

Online crypto gambling presents various risks that players must consider. Understanding these risks can enhance our gaming experience and ensure safer transactions.

Fraud and scams are prominent risks in the crypto gambling space. We often encounter phishing attacks where malicious actors impersonate legitimate platforms to steal personal information. Fake websites also lure unsuspecting players with enticing offers but disappear once funds are deposited. Conducting thorough research on the legitimacy of any casino, checking user reviews, and verifying licensing information helps mitigate these risks. We should only engage with trusted sites like Stake that implement robust security measures and require verification steps. Staying vigilant against fraudulent activities protects our investments and personal data.

Market volatility represents another significant risk in crypto gambling. Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, experience rapid price fluctuations that can affect our betting budgets. For example, a sudden drop in value could lead to substantial losses if we stake assets without understanding the market trends. Utilizing a stablecoin may help us manage this risk, as these digital currencies maintain a consistent value. It's essential to monitor market conditions and develop a sound strategy before participating in crypto betting. Recognizing the inherent volatility enables us to make informed decisions while engaging in our favorite games. For more on crypto security, check out resources from Cointelegraph.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","RWA News: Abu Dhabi Firm With $370M in Assets to Offer Yield on Ripple's Stablecoin","https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/16/orqo-launches-usd370m-abu-dhabi-asset-manager-plans-yield-platform-for-ripple-s-rlusd","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 10:41:15 GMT","

ORQO Group, a new institutional asset manager with $370 million in assets under management, has launched on Tuesday with plans to build out a yield platform for Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin.

The group, headquartered in Abu Dhabi, consolidates four entities from both traditional finance and digital assets: Mount TFI, a private debt specialist and licensed fund manager in Poland, Monterra Capital, a multi-strategy digital hedge fund in Malta, blockchain engineering studio Nextrope and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Soil compliant with MiCA, the EU's crypto framework.

Already licensed in Poland and Malta, the group is seeking approval from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market to expand services in the Middle East, a region it sees as a hub for regulated digital asset growth.

""It's an opportunity to become a global on-chain asset manager,"" ORQO CEO Nicholas Motz said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""We have all the pieces: the off-chain asset management, and on-chain, too.""

ORQO's effort is part of a larger trend that's been reshaping crypto markets: moving traditional financial instruments like private credit, U.S. Treasuries, or trade finance deals onto blockchain networks. The process is also known as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). Data from rwa.xyz shows that the RWA market has grown into a nearly $30 billion sector, though it remains tiny compared to traditional finance markets such as the $2 trillion private credit sector. Still, the growth potential is immense: the tokenized RWA market could reach $18.9 trillion by 2033, a joint report by Ripple and BCG projected.

Yield platform Soil is a key piece in ORQO's gameplan, connecting the firm's RWA access with crypto capital capital. It aims to provide returns on stablecoins deposits from tokenized private credit, real estate and hedge fund strategies.

As part of the next stage, the firm plans to open several credit pools targeting holders of Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin in the near future, allowing investors such as institutional treasuries or protocol reserves to earn a yield on their holdings.

Google is taking a step toward merging artificial intelligence (AI) and digital money, rolling out a new open-source protocol that lets AI applications send and receive payments, which includes support for stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, according to a press release.

To incorporate stablecoin rails, Google teamed up with U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase, which has been developing its own AI-integrated payments infrastructure. 

The company also worked with the Ethereum Foundation and coordinated with more than 60 other organizations, including Salesforce, American Express, and Etsy, to cover traditional finance use cases.

The move builds on Google's earlier work to establish a standard for “AI agents.” These digital agents may eventually handle complex tasks, such as negotiating mortgages or shopping for clothes, without direct human input.

In April, Google rolled out a protocol to standardize agent-to-agent communication. The latest update extends that framework into financial transactions, aiming to ensure payments are secure, interoperable, and executed with the human user's intent in mind.

Google's experiment demonstrates a growing trend of activity across the stablecoin market. USDC-issuer Circle's oversubscribed IPO indicated investor appetite earlier this year, with some suggesting that stablecoins are a ""monetary revolution in the making.""

Data from DefiLlama shows $289 billion worth of stablecoins are in circulation, a jump from $205 billion at the turn of the year.

According to CoinDesk Data, Solana's SOL traded at $232.11 as of 12:30 UTC on Sept. 16, holding relatively firm after a choppy day that saw prices test both the $230 and $238 levels.

Altcoin Sherpa, a widely followed trader, said earlier today on X that he sees SOL and BNB as stronger bets than ETH. He noted that new funding flows and market structures appear more SOL-oriented, while ETH has already made a substantial run and may need time to consolidate.

He added that majors still move in step with BTC: if BTC weakens, it is unlikely SOL, BNB, or ETH will keep rising. But if bitcoin rallies on positive macro developments, he expects majors to follow — with SOL and BNB likely leading in performance. Sherpa said he remains long both SOL and BNB, while his ether position is comparatively small.

According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, SOL traded within an $8 range during the Sept. 15–16 analysis window, moving between a $238.09 high and a $230.13 low. 

The heaviest selling occurred between 12:00 and 17:00 UTC on Sept. 15, when SOL slid nearly $8 from peak to trough. Volume spiked to 1.5 million units during this decline, marking intense selling pressure.

Afterward, buyers repeatedly defended the $233–$234 area, establishing a short-term “floor.” SOL consolidated with participation from around 650,000 units of volume, suggesting a mix of institutional distribution and retail accumulation.

Toward the end of the session, price action improved. Between 07:00 and 08:00 UTC on Sept. 16, SOL broke out of a tight $235.52–$236.50 band, briefly climbing to $236.90 on a 46,000-unit spike in just a few minutes. That surge pushed the price toward a $237.50–$238 resistance zone before momentum cooled.

Overall, the data shows SOL stabilizing after sharp swings, with a clear support base near $233 and a ceiling forming between $237.50 and $238.

The latest 24-hour CoinDesk Data chart, ending at 12:30 UTC on Sept. 16, shows SOL at $232.11 after retreating from a $236–$237 intraday zone. Trading narrowed into the $232–$234 band, reinforcing that area as short-term support.

The one-month chart shows SOL still trending upward overall, though the recent pullback highlights that SOL is testing its support base rather than extending gains. The consolidation suggests the token may need to gather momentum before another attempt higher.

Suddenly, it's all about Ethereum rival Solana and its native token SOL as the broader market holds its breath ahead of Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate decision.

Michael Novogratz, the founder and CEO of Galaxy Investment, says Solana could evolve to become a settlement infrastructure in global finance. Why? Because the blockchain can handle over 6 billion transactions a day, which is way higher than the  400 million-700 million trades global securities markets usually deal with, he said. Speed matters.

At BaseCamp 2025, Coinbase's layer-2 network hinted at plans for a token launch that could accelerate decentralization and unveiled a Solana bridge to boost cross-chain connectivity. Pantera Capital's Dan Morehead announced that Solana is their largest bet, valued at $1.1 billion, calling it the fastest and best-performing blockchain, which has outpaced even Bitcoin over the past four years.

If that's not enough, Kyle Samani, chairman of Nasdaq-listed Solana treasury company Forward Industries, said over the weekend that the company plans to deploy funds to boost the Solana-native decentralized finance ecosystem.

All these signs suggest SOL could outperform bitcoin BTC$116,879.56, ether (ETH) and other major tokens if the Fed cuts rates by the 25 basis points this week, as expected. If it surprises with a 50-basis-point move, things could get wild. Keep your eyes on those SOL/BTC and SOL/ETH trading pairs.

Currently, SOL is trading around $235 after peaking near $250 over the weekend. Other major cryptocurrencies are stuck in neutral, trailing behind stocks, which continue to hit fresh highs.

On the stablecoin front, the Bank of England proposed limits on how the value of dollar-backed stablecoins an individual can hold, as low as 10,000 pounds ($13,600), citing systemic risks. Stani Kulechov, Aave's CEO, called the move “absurd” and urged the crypto community to stand up against such regulations.

More countries, especially those with current account deficits, will likely consider similar measures to curb outflows that dodge traditional banks.

And as for the traditional markets, Monday's mix of rising stocks and the VIX, Wall Street's fear gauge, has some observers raising their eyebrows. History shows these moments often precede market corrections, so stay alert!

 Strategy's Michael Saylor and BitMine's Tom Lee are among 18 industry leaders who will look at ways to pass the BITCOIN Act and enable budget-neutral ways to buy Bitcoin. 

US lawmakers are to meet with 18 crypto industry executives, including Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, on Tuesday to discuss how Congress can move forward with President Donald Trump's Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

Those in attendance will also include Fundstrat CEO Tom Lee, who is also the chairman of BitMine, as well as MARA CEO Fred Thiel, according to crypto advocacy group The Digital Chambers, which shared the full list with Cointelegraph on Monday. 

The industry executives are looking to build momentum behind the BITCOIN Act, a measure introduced by US Senator Cynthia Lummis in March that calls on the government to acquire one million Bitcoin (BTC) over five years. 

The purchases would be funded through the Federal Reserve and Department of the Treasury, with Trump's executive order stating that it must be financed through budget-neutral strategies.

The roundtable will be hosted by The Digital Chambers and its affiliate, The Digital Power Network, they said. 

The BITCOIN Act could be the next major focus for lawmakers on crypto legislation, following their efforts to pass the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill in July.

The Bitcoin industry executives will pitch ideas around how the US can fund these Bitcoin purchases without impacting taxpayers, the Digital Chambers told Cointelegraph.

Among the budget-neutral strategies that have been floated so far are the reevaluation of the Treasury's gold certificates and tariff revenue.

They will also seek to learn what has stalled momentum with the BITCOIN Act over the last six months, and what the biggest objections to the bill are among lawmakers.

Several Bitcoin mining executives will attend the roundtable as well, including CleanSpark executives Matt Schultz and Margeaux Plaisted, MARA's Jayson Browder, and Bitdeer's Haris Basit.

Executives from crypto-focused venture capital firms Off the Chain Capital and Reserve One will be in attendance, as will Andrew McCormick, the head of investment platform eToro's US business.

TradFi representatives who will take a seat at the roundtable will include Western Alliance Bank's David Fragale and Blue Square Wealth's Jay Bluestine.

 Google's AI payment protocol was developed in collaboration with Coinbase, signaling crypto's growing role in powering the AI-driven digital economy. 

Google has unveiled an open-source protocol that allows AI applications to send and receive payments, including transactions using stablecoins — highlighting the growing role of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies in the emerging AI-driven web.

The initiative is being launched in partnership with Salesforce, American Express and more than 60 other companies, Fortune reported Tuesday. Stablecoin functionality was developed in collaboration with crypto exchange Coinbase, and the Ethereum Foundation was also consulted on the project. 

James Tromans, head of Web3 at Google Cloud, confirmed the rollout, telling Fortune that the protocol was designed to support both “existing payment rail capabilities as well as forthcoming capabilities such as stablecoins.”

Coinbase engineer Erik Reppel said the exchange worked with Google to make their payment systems interoperable. “We're all working to figure out how to make AI transmit value to each other,” he told Fortune.

The payment system builds on Google's Agent2Agent Protocol, introduced in April, which provides a framework for AI agents to exchange information and interact more efficiently. It was developed with support from more than 50 technology partners, including PayPal, Salesforce and SAP, and consulting firms such as Deloitte, McKinsey and PwC.

The Tuesday announcement comes amid a growing push to connect AI agents — autonomous software programs capable of making decisions without human input — with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Such integration could streamline trading, improve user interaction, and expand real-world payment use cases.

Stablecoins may prove to be the most impactful crypto use case for AI agents, emerging just as both technologies gain broader mainstream adoption. These dollar-pegged tokens recently received a regulatory boost in the United States through the GENIUS Act.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz recently underscored stablecoins' importance in this shift, predicting that AI agents will eventually become “the biggest user of stablecoins.”

The Ethereum Foundation has also highlighted stablecoins' potential in powering AI-driven applications. 

In August, the foundation pointed to the dormant HTTP 402 status code — which denotes “payment required” — and noted that, when paired with Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3009, it could enable AI agents to execute stablecoin transfers automatically.

At the time, the foundation stated that “autonomous agents are about to become Ethereum's biggest power users.”

 Whale selling and a reduction in XRP ledger activity over the past two months increased the downside potential for XRP price to drop toward $2. 

Key takeaways:

XRP's failure to hold $3 points to a continued downside risk to $2.40-$2.00.

Whales continue to sell XRP.

Declining daily active addresses signal reduced transaction activity and liquidity.

XRP (XRP) price flashes warning signs below $3 as bearish technical patterns emerge on its daily chart, coinciding with selling by whales and declining network activity. 

XRP price has been forming a descending triangle pattern on its daily chart since its rally to $3.66 multi-year highs, characterized by a flat support level and a downward-sloping resistance line.

The recent breakout above the triangle's upper trendline was a fakeout as bulls struggled to keep the price above $3, signaling a lack of strength.

Therefore, failure to reclaim $3 soon, where the 50-day SMA sits, could sink the XRP/USDT pair to the next support at $2.70. 

Further down, the following levels to watch are the 200-day SMA at $2.50 and, later, the downside target of the triangle at around $2.06, down 31% from current price levels.

Moreover, XRP's descending triangle analysis is accompanied by a bear flag on the same time frame, which warns of a possible decline to as low as $2.40, after the support at $3 was lost.

As Cointelegraph reported, if the price reclaims $3, buyers will then try to resume the uptrend by pushing the XRP above the flag's upper boundary at $3.20. If they do that, the XRP price could rally to $3.40 and subsequently to $3.66.

Onchain data shows that large investors booked profits on the latest rally to $3.10. 

The Supply Distribution metric shows a sharp drop in the supply held by entities with a 1–10 million balance. These addresses now own 6.79 billion XRP supply, marking a six-week low. 

The chart below shows that these whales have offloaded over 160 million XRP tokens worth over $476 million at current prices in the last two weeks.

This underscores that the big investors are likely anticipating lower prices in the near future despite impending spot ETF approvals and Fed rate cuts.

Meanwhile, a significant rise in XRP exchange reserves adds to the headwinds, data from Glassnode reveals. 

The chart below shows that the XRP balance on exchanges increased by 665 million tokens to 3.94 billion on Monday from 3.3 billion on Aug. 27, increasing the supply available for selling. 

The XRP Ledger has seen a significant drop in network activity over the last two months. Onchain data from CryptoQuant shows that the daily active addresses (DAAs) are far below the July 18 peak of 50,482 DAAs.

With only around 21,000 daily active addresses at the time of writing, user transactions have declined significantly, possibly signaling reduced interest or a lack of confidence in XRP's near-term outlook.

New addresses have also dropped from a 2025 high of 11,000 daily to the current count of 4,300 over the same period, suggesting declining network adoption and user engagement.

Historically, declines in network activity typically signal upcoming price stagnation or drops, as lower transaction volume reduces liquidity and buying momentum.

How a Billionaire's Plan to Reach Another Star Fell Apart

An abandoned plan to visit another star highlights the perils of billionaire-funded science

By Sarah Scoles edited by Clara Moskowitz

Eddie Guy

In 2016 billionaire Yuri Milner hosted a press conference at One World Observatory, the atrium topping the slick skyscraper at the center of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex. Milner had grown rich investing in tech start-ups, and now he wanted to spend some of that money on sending a spaceship to the stars.

He called the plan Breakthrough Starshot: a project that would eventually take human technology to another solar system. The idea was that high-powered lasers would propel tiny probes to 20 percent of the speed of light, impelling them with enough inertia to launch them toward the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, within 20 years. Milner and his Breakthrough Initiatives, a group of space science research projects related to life in the universe, were pledging $100 million toward a proof of concept. At the event, Milner was joined by, among others, Mae Jemison, a former astronaut and head of 100 Year Starship, an interstellar research program funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; Pete Worden, former director of NASA's Ames Research Center; and Stephen Hawking, world-famous physicist.

Zachary Manchester, currently an associate professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, signed on for the project's early stages. He remembers it seeming incredible that he, then a wide-eyed 20-something, was at the top of a metropolis, hanging out with people he considered legends—people such as Freeman Dyson, a physicist best known for positing that advanced civilizations could eventually cloak their stars in megastructures that siphoned their power. Dyson was one of several scientific luminaries who were joining the project, including Nobel Prize winner Saul Perlmutter and Martin Rees, then the U.K.'s Astronomer Royal.

In short, the Starshot launch event was flashy. A video preview narrated by actor Seth MacFarlane was also flashy. The text that went along with the announcement? Flashy. “With current rocket propulsion technology, it would take tens or hundreds of millennia to reach our neighboring star system, Alpha Centauri,” it read. “The stars, it seems, have set strict bounds on human destiny. Until now.”

Milner's money wasn't quite an Apollo-project investment, but it was more than anyone had ever dedicated to interstellar travel, a field with a history of relatively little funding and a trail of projects that never reached the stars. In the 2010s DARPA and NASA founded the 100 Year Starship research program to figure out how to send humans light-years away in the next 100 years. Private research groups such as the Tau Zero Foundation and Project Icarus also launched initiatives. None of them have come to much. Maybe this time the goal was within reach. After all, besides the money itself, the big names attached to Breakthrough Starshot gave legitimacy to an endeavor that might otherwise have seemed fringe. The announcement made a splash in the press, including a cover story in this magazine.

But almost a decade later Breakthrough Starshot is conspicuously quiet. After the initial big bang the project seemed to whimper out. Now there are no more big announcements, no multi-institution meetings and no more funding. What remains is confusion among even scientists working on Breakthrough Starshot about the project's status. According to an e-mail from Worden, Starshot's executive director, who declined an interview for this article, “We have put the program on hold and are working to transition portions to others.”

The Breakthrough Starshot announcement even in April 2016 included, from left, documentary writer and producer Ann Druyan, Zachary Manchester, Yuri Milner, Stephen Hawking, Freeman Dyson, Mae Jemison, Pete Worden, Avi Loeb and Philip Lubin.

Between 2016 and today scientists and engineers on the project did make progress toward the stars—or at least toward understanding what it would take to make progress toward the stars. But engineering an interstellar journey is almost ludicrously difficult. With today's rocket technology, it would take thousands of years to get to the nearest star. Processes and components need to be invented, iterated on and vetted, at great expense, most likely over decades. Sure, “$100 million sounds like a lot of money,” says Edwin Turner, an emeritus astrophysicist at Princeton University and one of the first people to be involved in Breakthrough Starshot. “It's certainly more than pocket change for most of us, but it's not really very much for huge technological programs.”

The total doled out, according to one insider, was far below $100 million anyway. The fact that most of the money never seems to have materialized means the case of Breakthrough Starshot isn't necessarily one of waste. But it's a study in the perils of relying on the ultrarich to fund science: when the guy with the billions is ready to move on, the whole project is off.

Breakthrough Starshot is based on a simple but technologically audacious concept: build a powerful set of lasers on Earth, and use them to propel “lightsails” on tiny spacecraft weighing about as much as a paperclip. A traditional rocket would carry the craft to space; once it was some 37,000 miles from Earth, the lasers would light up, shooting 100 gigawatts of power at the lightsails. Their combined photons would slam into the sails, powering them forward like wind on a sailboat. Ten minutes later the spacecraft would be zooming at 20 percent of light speed and already halfway to Mars—a journey that takes months with current technology. At that rate it would hit Alpha Centauri—specifically, Proxima Centauri, the closest star in the system—in a couple of decades. During its flyby Starshot would glimpse both the star and the Earth-size exoplanet known to exist in the star system. The craft would send a signal back to Earth before sailing on toward the rest of the Milky Way.

The basic idea of using light for propulsion dates to the 1920s, when Russian scientists Friedrich Zander and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, pioneers of rocketry, proposed using the pressure of sunlight to push a vehicle through space. Some details of Breakthrough's specific plans, however, came from the work of a University of California, Santa Barbara, physicist named Philip Lubin. Back in 2009, seven years before Breakthrough Starshot began, Lubin attended a conference at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif. There researchers were discussing focused energy in the form of lasers, microwaves, particle beams, and more, known as directed energy, “mostly for purposes of taking down threats,” Lubin says, meaning incoming missiles.

But as Lubin sat at the conference, he began to dream about other uses for the technology, especially if it were scaled up. Could it be used to protect Earth from asteroids rather than from intercontinental ballistic missiles? Or, he thought later, to propel a spacecraft far, far away? At home Lubin started crunching numbers. “I always want to figure out why it won't work, why you cannot do this,” he says.

Despite his best efforts to defeat himself, it seemed the idea would work: You could direct energy at an incoming space rock, heat a portion of it up, vaporize that spot and shift the asteroid's orbit just enough to curve it away from Earth. And you could probably also send a spaceship on a significant journey. Lubin eventually applied for and received NASA funds to research both plans.

After the explosion of a meteor over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013, Lubin's planetary-protection work—under the project name DE-STAR—got more attention. Lubin, perhaps a future savior of the planet, was invited to give talks to other scientists, including one at the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute. There he mentioned that this same technology could also enable interstellar flight. A colleague told him he should talk to a guy named Pete Worden.

Lubin didn't, but he did keep working on his interstellar laser ideas with continued money from NASA. In 2015 he spoke at a conference hosted by the 100 Year Starship project. There he finally met Worden, who suggested Lubin send over a written version of his ideas. Lubin responded with a roadmap for interstellar flight, later published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society.

Worden wrote Lubin back quickly. “I have a friend,” Lubin recalls him saying. “You mind if I send it to my friend?” Lubin told him sure, send it to whomever you want. The friend, of course, was Milner, and by January 2016 Lubin was meeting with Milner at his Bay Area mansion. In front of Milner was Lubin's interstellar roadmap, bedazzled with yellow Post-it notes. “Yuri says to me, ‘You know, I've always dreamed, since I was a child, of going to the stars,'” Lubin recalls. “‘And now you've shown me the path.'”

Milner wanted to send the paper to experts who could evaluate its strengths and flaws. “If the reviews come back positive, then I'm willing to put in a fair amount of money,” Lubin recalls Milner saying. He mentioned $100 million. “Unfortunately that, by the way, never came true,” Lubin says. “There was no $100 million.” The top two scientists affiliated with the project declined to be interviewed for this story.

Before officially announcing Starshot, Breakthrough officials had quietly recruited other thinkers in the field. In addition to Turner, who already knew Milner through a separate project called Breakthrough Listen, which searches for signals from alien civilizations, there was Mason Peck, an engineering professor at Cornell University and previously NASA's chief technologist. “That kind of opportunity does not come along every day, and I was all in from the very beginning,” Peck says. Kelvin Long, a physicist and aerospace engineer who co-founded Project Icarus, also hopped onboard early. He sent Worden a design study, which he had written in three days while stuck in travel, for a hypothetical space probe that could move at 10 percent of the speed of light.

At Starshot's founding, the group identified around 30 problems to be solved before anyone could send an interstellar probe anywhere. Worden and James Schalkwyk of the Breakthrough Prize Foundation, working with three researchers from the Australian National University, wrote a chapter providing an overview of the project's initial phases for physicist and editor Claude Phipps's 2024 book Laser Propulsion in Space: Fundamentals, Technology, and Future Missions. Thirty-seven research groups, according to that summary, convened to understand and reduce the technology risks in those major areas. “Then the whole project came down to trying to figure out how to spend $100 million productively,” Turner says.

Sometimes members of the crew got a bit of money to support their research, sometimes not. Starshot did bring people together, though—in person and virtually—to talk about their personal research on those problems. “Breakthrough is essentially a set of meetings,” Lubin says. Other sources also cited meetings as a primary way scientists participated in the project.

Beginning in 2016, the Breakthrough Initiatives sponsored Breakthrough Discuss meetings “focused on life in the Universe and novel ideas for space exploration.” The meetings, which were never specific to Starshot but did frequently cover topics related to the interstellar mission, have continued through 2025, with a gap in 2020 and a virtual meeting in 2021. Smaller satellite meetings also convened over the years to discuss specific technological and scientific aspects of the problem.

The Breakthrough Starshot spacecraft would probably be a small computer chip called a nanocraft. The prototype shown here is about 15 millimeters wide.

While they lasted, the meetings brought scientists and engineers together to investigate where the technology stood, what problems they didn't have solutions to, how feasible it was to overcome those problems and build something launchable, and what timelines and costs doing so would entail. There was palpable excitement in the early years—scientists felt they were part of a team embarking on an ambitious but tractable undertaking. They knew their biggest challenges were in certain areas: the design of the sail, the functionality of the laser system, the makeup of the spacecraft, and the construction of a communications apparatus that could signal back to Earth from light-years away. So, essentially, the whole system.

It's hardly worth sending a ship to another star if you won't be able to prove you've done it. Starshot would need to not just reach Proxima Centauri but also find a way to send back a signal strong enough to be detectable on Earth. It's a considerable challenge, however, to point a signal in the right direction from light-years away when both the probe and Earth are moving. Plus, both those feats must be accomplished with diminutive instruments on a spacecraft the mass of a pen cap or two.

According to Peck, Milner might have had unrealistic ideas—or at least ideas that conflicted with some of the scientists' suggestions—about what those signals should be like. “I do think Yuri Milner is very intelligent,” Peck says. “I do think he has an adequate technical background” for the project. But he wanted things like video or 4K images from Alpha Centauri. And that, in Peck's view, was putting the cart before the horse, to make an ancient analogy for a 21st-century endeavor.

To Peck, getting just one computer bit of information from another solar system would be valuable. Perhaps the probe could send a yes-or-no answer to a single question—is there a certain percentage of oxygen in the planet's atmosphere, for instance, or does the radiation environment seem suitable for life? “It's only incrementally better to get a gigabit from Proxima Centauri,” he says.

According to the 2024 book chapter, the team found several ways to make comms somewhat feasible. The scientists could build a huge array of smaller receivers on the Earth end to catch weak transmissions. They also could enlarge the spacecrafts' transmitting antenna and send communications in optical instead of radio wavelengths, which can transfer more data faster. The team decided to use the sun as a beacon to point the homebound transmission toward, helping the information reach the right part of the vast universe. Still, Long calls the communications problem the “elephant in the room” in that it didn't get as much attention in initial research as other topics did—an assessment Carnegie Mellon's Manchester agrees with.

Propelling the probes far enough and fast enough that they have something to communicate requires solving another problem: the lasers. Or, as the Starshot team called them, “the photon engine.”

The first issue, the team found, was that a single laser would need to be impractically powerful—incomparable to anything that exists today. The researchers could create an array of smaller lasers whose beams would combine into one with 100 gigawatts of power, but then they'd need to ensure the light waves lined up with one another, like sound waves that are in tune. “People made serious progress on that,” Manchester says. “They were able to do it with tens of lasers in the lab, which is a breakthrough.”

There was palpable excitement in the early years—scientists felt they were part of a team embarking on an ambitious but tractable undertaking.

But not quite enough of a breakthrough for Breakthrough. The project would need even more lasers, and those lasers would have to work outside the lab to reach deep into space—which poses another problem. “How do you get that out of the atmosphere without getting messed up?” Manchester asks. Turbulence in the upper air will cause the beam to twinkle.

They would need to adjust for that twinkling in real time. One laser, called a guide star, could shoot through the atmosphere constantly, and the scientists could use data about how it got distorted to correct the other lasers. But that correction would require millions of adjustments every second. In the 2024 book chapter, Worden and his co-authors pegged it as potentially the largest technical hurdle for the entire program.

The lasers pose a financial hurdle, too. To make Starshot feasible, the cost of powering them must come down from the current price of $100 per watt to around $0.01 to $0.05 per watt, according to Long. Peck is optimistic because, theoretically, the cost of laser power should decrease over time, similar to how Moore's law predicted that transistors in computer chips should get steadily smaller as the years passed. Still, that discount isn't instantaneous. “We were likely looking at a launch date not in the next 20 years, as the sponsor had hoped, but perhaps in 30 or 40 years,” Long says.

Regardless of how much the laser costs, what form it takes or when any of this finally happens, policy is an issue. A laser that blasts out the equivalent of four power stations' worth of energy is, as the conference that spurred Lubin's original research interest demonstrates, a weapon. The only solutions for that problem are international cooperation and trust, which aren't at all-time highs right now.

Once the photon engine is up and working, that laser energy has to hit the lightsail of a given spacecraft and propel it forward with a power of about 100 gigawatts. The sail must hold up to the onslaught while withstanding acceleration at a g-force of 40,000—that is, 40,000 times the pull of gravity you would feel if you fell off a cliff.

Substances that can withstand both the rigors of warp speed and the shock of a laser-cannon blast and remain reflective tend to be heavy. Starshot envisioned a lightsail material that can stretch four meters wide but weigh only a gram. The initial Breakthrough phase aimed to identify potential materials and designs, a process led by Harry Atwater of the California Institute of Technology, who did not respond to a request for an interview. The leading candidate substance his team found, according to the 2024 summary, is silicon nitride. Atwater and his colleagues published that result in 2022. Engineers have been able to fabricate it at submicron thicknesses—less than one-tenth the thickness of Saran Wrap.

Ultrathin wafers of the material can be puzzle-pieced together into a larger structure that is mostly reflective and doesn't absorb much light. Breakthrough engineers have done this assembly on the millimeter scale but not the meter scale. Atwater and his team also coded a computer simulation that could figure out how various lightsail designs would perform during interstellar flight.

Another group, based at the University of Sydney, worked on ways to keep the hypothetical lightsail stable. The researchers joined meetings in 2021 and 2022 and shared their findings, but they never received any money from Breakthrough. “The whole thing always was outrageous,” University of Sydney physicist Michael Wheatland says of the project's ambition. “I never believed it. But I think my perspective on things like this is that if you do fundamental research to try to solve a problem in the context of some outrageous scheme like that, then you can do really useful research.”

And that's what the Sydney team did. They knew the sail would constantly be pushed around by the laser beam as it accelerated, so the team had to find some way to push it back to center. “But that then gives you oscillations,” Wheatland says. Moving the laser could account for that, but like with the correction to untwinkle the lasers, the movement may be too much to ask of a bunch of lasers.

When the project started, people thought interstellar travel was crazy—or they didn't think about it at all.

The sails are a separate problem from the spacecraft itself, which must be as small and lightweight as possible. Breakthrough calls the tiny spaceships “nanocraft.” The leading candidate is the brainchild of Manchester, that wide-eyed graduate student when the program began. Manchester's early creations weren't meant for voyaging beyond the solar system—or even beyond Earth's orbit. As a graduate student at Cornell, working under Peck, he started designing postage-stamp-sized satellites around 2009. He called them, variously, Sprites and ChipSats. In 2011 he crowdfunded the project, and in 2014 he launched around 100 ChipSats to space. A glitch prevented them from deploying, though, and they burned up on the way back through the atmosphere.

After that disappointment, Manchester became involved with Breakthrough. His tiny satellites seemed like just what the team was looking for. “The notional idea was that some version of my ChipSat would end up being attached to that lightsail,” he says. Manchester went on to do his postdoc at Harvard University, working officially on non-ChipSat projects. But with Breakthrough's help he was able to keep the ChipSat project on life support. “They were super nice to me during all of that,” he says. “They would help me out, and they gave me little bits of funding.”

In 2019 Manchester was able to go for launch again, successfully deploying 105 ChipSats at once. He showed they could communicate with one another in space, acting as a swarm. The federal government let him fly them only once. “Then the [Federal Communications Commission] decided that we were going to destroy the world with space debris,” he says—which wouldn't be a problem if they were headed way beyond low Earth orbit, to infinity and beyond.

Breakthrough hasn't gone beyond anywhere, of course. Still, in all four problem areas, the teams found that nothing was technically wrong with the basic plan. They also did enough research to find out what they didn't know and what kinds of technical development (and money) would be required to make the concept reality.

Progress was almost certainly slowed by the fact that the $100 million never materialized. Although the Starshot grants weren't made public, Lubin's experience might illustrate the scale of the spending. His group got two grants, one for $116,000 and another for about $80,000. Some of his colleagues in Australia also got $80,000. “We got less than $200,000 spread out over eight years,” Lubin says. That was much less than NASA put toward Lubin's directed-energy interstellar work, although Breakthrough's press-centric approach meant its name was better associated with the project. “Breakthrough contributed less than 5 percent of the funding in our program in the end,” Lubin says. “So it was always a little blip along the way. But in the public mind the entire program was a Breakthrough program, and that is simply not true at all.”

The closest star system to the sun, Alpha Centauri, includes three stars. Two of them are a binary pair, seen in this close-up from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory (inset). A third star, Proxima Centauri, orbits the central two.

Lubin calculates that overall, Breakthrough spent roughly $4.5 million on about 30 contracts. In late January 2025, after I contacted Worden and Avi Loeb of Harvard, also a Breakthrough scientist, a spokesperson for the Breakthrough Prize Foundation reached out. Worden and Loeb had declined interviews, but the spokesperson said, “I have a potential way to move your story significantly forward.” She later referred to a report on the project that would be finished around spring 2025 and made available to Scientific American, but that report had not appeared by the time this issue went to print.

At this stage the future of the program is murky. Starshot appears to be on indefinite hold, if not over, although there was no final announcement and no fanfare to match its beginnings. Peck is not sure where things stand. “As far as I can tell, they've put it on pause, at least,” he says. “And I think it's probably not going to continue for the near future.”

Physicist Martijn de Sterke, part of the Sydney group, and his colleague Boris Kuhlmey, a Sydney physicist who's helping with Starship-related research, heard only informally that Breakthrough Starshot was done. “It appears that this project has kind of disappeared,” de Sterke says. “We have not heard from them for probably two years.”

Some sources have interpreted the program's end as a realization that an actual starship, though technically possible, is still distant. “I think it's going to take 30 to 50 years of very hard work by a large number of very dedicated people, much like a Manhattan Project on steroids,” Lubin says. Maybe that timeline wasn't appealing to Milner, some sources speculate, and neither was spending a Manhattan Project amount of money. Turner has a different perspective on how things turned out. To explain, he turns to the familiar example of medieval cathedrals, which took centuries to build—a length of time that humans rarely dedicate to any single project these days. “That [comparison] is often made as a kind of snide criticism of the short-sightedness of modern civilizations or people or profit motives,” Turner says. “But I think it's actually a result of how fast technology is moving.”

The innovations behind a cathedral's arches and finials didn't change much over the 200-year course of its construction. But the technology undergirding our world is unrecognizable compared with that of just a couple of decades ago. “It's very hard trying to imagine a major technological thing we're working on now for which they could have done anything at all useful 200 years ago,” Turner says. “Nothing they could have done would make the slightest difference to us.” Maybe that's what Breakthrough leadership decided about Starshot: it's best left to the people of tomorrow.

Despite the project's nebulous end and uncertain future, many participants spoke about Breakthrough positively. Manchester, for instance, sees it as at least a psychological success. When the project started, people thought interstellar travel was crazy—or they didn't think about it at all. “Breakthrough changed society's conception of this kind of stuff as a legitimate area of scientific inquiry,” he says.

Serious people worked on the project, did serious things, made serious progress—even if not directly on a path toward Alpha Centauri. “It's still a long way off, but it's a lot closer than it was five or six years ago,” Manchester concludes. The program also inspired people such as de Sterke and Kuhlmey to work on fundamental physics and engineering problems that might not have gotten attention otherwise. And maybe, at the end of the day, that will be Starshot's legacy. “If there was a one-sentence summary of what Breakthrough was and did,” Lubin says, “it was to bring attention to the dream.”

New Fossils Could Help Solve Long-standing Mystery of Bird Migration

Tiny fossils hint at when birds began making their mind-blowing journey to the Arctic to breed

By Lauren N. Wilson & Daniel T. Ksepka edited by Kate Wong

A breeding pair of ornithurine birds and their hatchlings survey the coastal floodplain. These birds shared this landscape with dinosaurs, such as the Pachyrhinosaurus herd in the background. 73 million years ago in what is now northern Alaska.

Golden autumn sunlight glints through the sedges and shrubs of the tundra in northern Alaska. Winter is approaching, and soon the region will be buried under snow and ice. For the past three months the chatter of the Arctic Tern colony has served as the soundtrack of the summer breeding season. But now, with daylight waning, the terns need to head south. In an instant, the usually noisy birds will fall silent, a behavior known as “dread.” Moments later the entire colony will take to the skies to begin its 25,000-mile journey to Antarctica—the longest known migration of any animal on Earth.

The Arctic Tern is not the only bird that spends its breeding season in the Arctic. Billions of birds belonging to nearly 200 species—from small sparrows such as the Smith's Longspur to large waterfowl such as the Greater White-fronted Goose—make their way to the far north every spring to reproduce and then make the return flight south for the winter. It's no easy feat. Migration is costly. Even under ideal conditions, such an epic journey requires huge amounts of energy and exposes the travelers to dangerous weather. The mortality risk is high.

But undertaking these trips allows the birds to take advantage of the seasonal conditions in these environments. The endless summer sun supports lush plant growth, flourishing insect swarms, and plentiful fish populations nourished by zooplankton blooms. With 24 hours of light a day, the birds can more easily catch food such as slippery fish and tiny insects. The round-the-clock daylight also means many of the animals that prey on birds are less likely to sneak up on a nest unnoticed.

Scientists have long wondered when birds began making these extraordinary journeys. New fossils that we and our colleagues have discovered and analyzed are finally providing some clues. A decade of expeditions to the Arctic Circle in Alaska has yielded a trove of bird fossils—including several hatchlings. The remains, which date to approximately 73 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period, constitute the earliest known record of birds reproducing at polar latitude. The fossils hint that early birds may have already been traveling to the top of the world to raise the next generation of winged wonders.

The polar migration of birds is one of nature's great spectacles. To make the marathon journey to the Arctic, birds need physical stamina. They typically have various anatomical and behavioral adaptations to long-distance travel. The Arctic Tern, for example, is a marvel of efficiency. Its skeleton is lightweight and partially filled with air, allowing it to glide for long distances without expending any energy to flap its wings. It can eat on the move, plucking fish from the surface of the ocean as it flies. And, like many migratory birds, it can sleep while gliding.

Migrants also need to be skilled navigators to reach their breeding ground. The precise methods by which birds find their way remain mysterious, but biologists generally agree that they use some combination of visual landmarks; the position of the sun, moon and stars; Earth's magnetic field; and scent-based clues. A degree of learning also seems to be involved—in many species, first-time migrants appear to simply fly in the correct general direction, whereas experienced birds may use landmarks to take a more efficient route.

Scientists have rediscovered dozens of three-dimensionally preserved teeth and bones from hatchling birds, including this tip of a beak, from the Arctic Circle in Alaska, showing that birds were reproducing at polar latitude by 73 million years ago.

Pat Druckenmiller

As impressive as the trip itself is, the Arctic migration is part of a much grander scheme: the birds are literally changing their ecosystems at their destinations. Although most Arctic birds are only physically in the Arctic for the breeding season, they spur the success of plants by pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds. They also help to manage insect and rodent populations and, by extension, help to control the spread of disease. In fact, birds are so critical to the success of their habitats that they are hypothesized to have played a key role in structuring remote ecosystems over deep time. Birds carry small organisms, such as plants and insects, over long distances to colonize remote polar regions. Were it not for the evolution of migratory birds, today's tundra would be much more barren.

Despite the importance of migration for the birds themselves and for the wider landscape they inhabit, we actually know very little about the origins of this phenomenon. To answer such a fundamental question, we have to look backward in time to the fossil record. Unfortunately, the polar fossil record is sparse, and most of the fossil-bearing sediments there are covered in ice or water. In spots where these sediments are exposed, fieldwork is often challenging, dangerous and expensive. Furthermore, bird bones are some of the rarest fossils in the world because they are small and fragile, making them less likely to survive long enough to fossilize, let alone to be discovered by paleontologists.

In the rare cases when we do manage to find a fossil bird in the Arctic, it can be difficult to determine whether that bird was a visiting migrant or a permanent resident. Let's say we find exactly the same species, in rocks from exactly the same time period, at both temperate and polar latitudes. Even then, we can't say the extinct species migrated. There's always the possibility that it merely inhabited a broad area year-round. The range of the modern-day Common Raven, for instance, encompasses practically the entire Northern Hemisphere.

There is a clever way to home in on whether a fossil deposit contains migratory birds, however. The vast majority of living birds that inhabit polar regions migrate to lower latitudes after the breeding season ends. So, if we find fossil evidence of birds not just present but breeding at polar latitudes, we are headed in the right direction. This is where our work on fossils from a Late Cretaceous body of rock in northern Alaska called the Prince Creek Formation comes in.

At the beginning of the 1993 movie Jurassic Park, a team of paleontologists gently brushes away sand to reveal an intact dinosaur skeleton in the badlands of Montana. Although fossil fieldwork is never as simple as removing loose sediment with a paintbrush (sorry, Steven Spielberg), Arctic fieldwork is in a league of its own. Winter brings temperatures as low as –50 degrees Fahrenheit, tons of snow and limited hours of daylight. The summer isn't a walk in the park, either: giant mosquitoes are out in force, it's almost always rainy and cold, and there is So. Much. Mud. Moreover, large mammals are out and about, making potentially dangerous wildlife encounters a concern.

In August of 2022 one of us (Wilson) was on her second trip to the Arctic. It was about five in the morning when she awoke in her tent along the Colville River near the Prince Creek Formation. The sun had already been up for hours. With a couple more hours before she needed to be up, she was frustrated that she had to climb out of her warm sleeping bag to pee. She begrudgingly put on a hat and coat and unzipped her tent, still half asleep. Then her heart stopped. About 20 yards away, right near one of her crewmates' tents, was a giant, fuzzy brown blob. She tried frantically to remember her bear training: Should she call out and try to wake everyone else up? Grab her bear spray? Try to scare it out of the camp? Only after putting herself through this roller coaster of emotions did she finally realize that the “bear” had a large set of horns on its head. Thankfully, the camp visitor was just a musk ox.

One may wonder why we bother with such extreme fieldwork. Wilson has often found herself wondering the same thing while working in –30-degree-F weather. But for the same reason the fieldwork is challenging, the fossil discoveries in the Arctic are some of the most exciting in the world. The Prince Creek Formation is located at a modern-day latitude of 70 degrees north and preserves fossils of animals that lived an estimated 72.8 million years ago. Plate tectonic activity has shifted Alaska south since that time. During the Late Cretaceous, these species would have been living at an even higher paleolatitude of 80 to 85 degrees north, practically at the North Pole. Summers would have brought plentiful light and warmth, but year-round occupants of the ecosystem had to endure winters with freezing temperatures, snowfall and about four months of continuous darkness.

Paleontologists have known about dinosaurs from the Prince Creek Formation since 1983, but it's only in the past couple of decades that work led by Patrick Druckenmiller of the University of Alaska Museum of the North and Gregory Erickson of Florida State University has begun to change our perception of Arctic life in the Cretaceous. Their team's discovery of baby dinosaur fossils helped to demonstrate that dinosaurs were year-round inhabitants of the ecosystem because the baby dinosaurs would have been too young to migrate before the onset of winter. More recently, smaller bones found alongside the dinosaur fossils have led to another exciting discovery: the oldest evidence of polar bird reproduction.

To date, we have identified more than 50 three-dimensionally preserved bird bones, along with dozens of teeth, from the site. The fossils are so tiny that they could all fit together in a single jam jar. Nevertheless, they represent one of the best collections of Late Cretaceous North American bird fossils and document the presence of at least three types of birds that lived alongside nonbird dinosaurs in Arctic Alaska. Not only that, but many of the fossils belong to baby birds and represent the earliest known growth stages of these groups of birds. Together these fossils demonstrate that birds have been nesting in the Arctic for at least 73 million years, nearly half the time they have existed on Earth.

Close study of these delicate fossils has allowed us to reconstruct the birds of the Prince Creek Formation and their role in the ecosystem. Picture the Arctic in early summer 73 million years ago. The coastal floodplain that was desolate throughout the long winter is now lush with plant life and buzzing with insects. It's the perfect setting for a newly hatched chick to grow up in. A head pops up from a bowl-shaped nest. It belongs to a baby ornithurine, a close relative of modern birds. He is still covered in downy feathers and scrambles about on skinny legs, not yet ready to take flight. While learning his way around the world, he takes special care to stick close to his parents. Unlike many other Late Cretaceous birds, he and his relatives have a toothless beak that serves as a precise tool for picking off creeping insects under their watchful eyes. This chick hatched a month ago and is already off to a strong start thanks to a new evolutionary innovation: the larger egg laid by advanced ornithurine birds.

The coastal floodplain offers premium real estate for nesting. Dinosaurs of all kinds are preparing for the arrival of their young, and last year's young are still recovering from their first Arctic winter. The ornithurine chick and his family aren't the only types of birds here to call this landscape home. Kick-diving hesperornithines are hunting in the river waters, and ternlike ichthyornithines are wheeling overhead. And they're all here for the same reason birds still nest in the Arctic today: lots and lots of sunshine.

The Prince Creek birds provide definitive evidence that birds bred in the Arctic during the Cretaceous. Whether they migrated there from elsewhere to reproduce is tougher to establish. We can get at this question from a few angles, however. Let's start by considering whether these birds had the ability to make such a journey in the first place. We know that any birds from the preceding Jurassic period are unlikely to have flown very far. Such early birds had not yet evolved many of the features that help modern birds fly skillfully and efficiently. For example, the iconic Archaeopteryx was capable of flight, but it appears to have had relatively low endurance and couldn't perform complex maneuvers. The keeled sternum, or breastbone, that anchors the pectoral muscles in modern birds was either absent or at most a flat cartilaginous plate in Archaeopteryx. Clawed fingers interrupted the leading edge of its wing, and compared with birds of today, its feathers appear to have been less flexible and thus less adept at forming a coherent airfoil. Even its tail seems like an archaic reminder of Archaeopteryx's grounded ancestry. Whereas modern birds have a short tail with a special plough-shaped bone called the pygostyle that lets them spread their tail feathers into a fan, Archaeopteryx retained a long and aerodynamically unwieldy tail similar to that of its theropod dinosaur ancestors.

Researchers excavate a fossil site along the Colville River in northern Alaska.

Over time birds evolved a panoply of skeletal and soft-tissue features that improved their flight capabilities. The bony tail became shorter, and the fingertips diminished from large claws to tiny bones hidden under the feathers. Advanced Cretaceous birds in the group Ornithothoraces, which includes the Prince Creek specimens, are in many ways the first birds with an unquestionably proficient flight apparatus. In these birds, the sternum bears a keel that provides additional attachment for the muscles that power the flight stroke. The shoulder joint is oriented higher on the back, allowing for better positioning of the wings. The first finger also anchors an alula, a cluster of small feathers that acts as a mini airfoil, helping in fine maneuvers. Thanks to these anatomical innovations, the Prince Creek birds (apart from the flightless hesperornithines) would have been capable of flying great distances to the Arctic to breed.

A closer look at where these birds fit in the avian family tree provides more clues to how they came to reproduce in the far north. Ornithothoraces is divided into two groups: the enantiornithines and the ornithurines. Enantiornithines were the dominant birds for most of the Cretaceous period. These toothed birds ranged from sparrow- to turkey-size and showed a great diversity of forms, from Longirostravis, with its slender bill, to the blunt-toothed Bohaiornis, to the toucan-beaked Falcatakely. They lived almost everywhere.

Ornithurines, which include modern birds and their close relatives, were rarer in Cretaceous ecosystems. Like enantiornithines, most Cretaceous ornithurines still had teeth. But advanced members of the group differed from enantiornithines in having fewer teeth; no gastralia, or belly ribs; and separated pubis bones, which allowed them to lay larger eggs. In contrast to the enantiornithines, which seem to have thrived in forested environments, ornithurines appear to have stuck largely to aquatic habitats during the Cretaceous.

Intriguingly, the Prince Creek bird fossils all come from ornithurine birds. We have identified bones and teeth of three types so far: ternlike ichthyornithines; hesperornithines, which used their feet to propel themselves through water; and some nearly modern close relatives of living birds. Notably absent from our assemblage are any enantiornithines. If all Ornithothoraces were capable of long-distance flight, why are the otherwise ubiquitous enantiornithines missing from Alaska?

To recover small bones and teeth, the team washes fossil-bearing sediments through screens and takes the resulting concentrate back to the laboratory for examination under a microscope.

Kevin May

We suspect one answer lies in the egg. Anyone who regularly cooks eggs has probably noticed a little white blob, which for many people spoils the otherwise appetizing appearance of the yolk. This blob is the chalazae, a pair of protein-rich “tethers” that attach the yolk to the shell. Chalazae protect the embryo when birds rotate their eggs in the nest to ensure that the embryos get thoroughly bathed in nutrients during incubation. Reptiles, which lack chalazae, do not practice egg rotation. In fact, rotating a crocodile egg can disrupt development of and kill the embryo.

So far paleontologists haven't found any fossil chalazae that might allow them to trace the origin of this structure. But we have a hunch that it evolved in ornithurines because crocodilians, nonavian dinosaurs and enantiornithines all buried their eggs at least partially in the ground. Fossil clutches of enantiornithines demonstrate that they placed their eggs vertically in sediment or soil, leaving only the tops exposed. This arrangement would have stabilized the eggs, keeping the embryo safely attached to the yolk, but it was much less efficient for incubation. At best, brooding enantiornithines would have been able to make only partial contact with their eggs, resulting in poorer heat transfer and slower development of the embryo. In fact, some paleontologists speculate that they could not incubate via body contact at all, because the eggs were too small to support that parent's weight.

Perhaps the lack of this tiny embryo “seat belt” explains the absence of enantiornithines in the Arctic. Most modern birds that breed in northern Alaska nest from late May through June. For birds that can nest in vegetation, this is a lovely time of year. Yet even at the start of June, snow may still persist in patches, and the soil may remain chilly or even frozen. Temperatures were warmer in the Cretaceous, but the Arctic winter was still dark and cold, and spring would have taken longer to arrive than at more southern latitudes. For ground-nesting enantiornithines, cold soil would have been highly unwelcoming for nests.

Why not just wait until later in the summer to nest? There may simply not have been enough time. Because enantiornithines could not provide full-contact incubation, their eggs probably took substantially longer to hatch than those of birds that can sit on their eggs in nests built in vegetation. The inexorable march of the seasons would have left almost no time for fledging for birds that hatched in late summer.

The Arctic Tern migrates tens of thousands of miles every year between its breeding grounds in the Arctic and its wintering grounds in Antarctica.

Still, although enantiornithines took several years to grow to full size, they appear to have been highly precocial as hatchlings. In fact, there is some evidence they could fly within a day of hatching. That might seem to make up for the longer incubation time in the race against winter. But another aspect of enantiornithine biology might have thrown up a roadblock to Arctic breeding.

Recently discovered fossils preserved in amber reveal that enantiornithines molted their body feathers all at once. This style of molting allowed them to trade their juvenile plumage for adult plumage rapidly when the time came. Yet it would have been a big liability in colder climates. If an early cold snap occurred during a molting interval, being caught half naked could have been deadly to small-bodied birds that had to generate their own body heat, as opposed to obtaining it from external sources such as the sun. By eliminating the possibility of nesting in the summer and overwintering, this molting pattern might have served as a barrier to those birds inhabiting Arctic environments year-round.

Needing a longer runway to make it from the egg to migration-ready seems to have left enantiornithines unable to establish themselves in the Arctic. Ornithurines, in contrast, were able to exploit the Arctic at least seasonally thanks to evolutionary innovations in reproduction and development that occurred in their lineage.

Our work on the Prince Creek birds is not over yet. We currently have only circumstantial evidence that they were migrating to the Arctic to breed rather than living there year-round. But we may be able to build our case with a technique called stable isotope analysis, which lets us use comparisons of the ratios of different forms, or isotopes, of the same element in an animal's teeth or bones to infer its diet, reconstruct its environmental conditions, and even trace its movements over its lifetime.

We know that dinosaurs were overwintering in the Arctic because their young would not have been ready to migrate anywhere the first winter after hatching. Perhaps comparisons of the isotopic compositions of bird and dinosaur teeth could inform us about the habits of the Prince Creek birds. Many biological factors, such as diet and metabolism, influence isotopic compositions, though. We still have a lot of groundwork to do to understand these factors before we apply stable isotope techniques to our fossil birds.

Meanwhile let's check in on our hatchling. The Late Cretaceous world is harsh for an ornithurine chick still learning the ropes. At just a month old, he is still very vulnerable and depends on his parents for comfort and safety. If he strays too far, he risks becoming dinner for one of the many dromaeosaurs who are also trying to provide for their young. Because of these predators, many of his siblings won't survive to the end of the summer, and some just might end up as fossils in the long run. If he can make it a few months, perhaps he will fly south with his kin to somewhere sunny for the winter. He'd be one of the lucky ones. This scenario is the harsh reality of life at the top of the world. But in the remarkable adaptations and behaviors of birds lies hope for survival.

Alzheimer's Drugs Are Finally Tackling the Disease Itself. Here's How

While our understanding of Alzheimer's disease is far from complete, the latest therapies, and others in more than 100 clinical trials, offer new hope

By Esther Landhuis, Now Medical Studios & Jen Christiansen edited by Lauren Gravitz & Jen Christiansen

This article is part of “Innovations In: Alzheimer's Disease” an editorially independent special report that was produced with financial support from Eisai.

Alzheimer's disease has proved to be a tricky target, and researchers and drug developers have been pursuing effective treatments for decades. Debates rage over the disorder's underlying causes, and various approaches have faced one hurdle after another. But the field has reached a turning point. Over the past four years the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved several therapies that address some of the condition's potential biological roots rather than merely mitigating symptoms—a key scientific milestone. Despite the advances, however, there is still a long list of open questions and so much work to be done.

The brains of people who die with Alzheimer's show a distinct biology: clumps or “plaques” of amyloid beta proteins in spaces between neurons and tangles of tau proteins that accumulate primarily within the nerve cells. One prevailing theory holds that amyloid builds up early, and tau tangles develop when nerve cell damage is underway but cognitive symptoms are not yet apparent. Over time these pathogenic, or disease-causing, proteins disrupt nerve cell communication. The newest treatments—lecanemab and donanemab—bind to amyloid beta proteins, clear them from the brain and modestly slow cognitive decline.

But the progression from disease-linked proteins to actual dementia is long and inexact, and amyloid and tau proteins accumulate in people with other neurodegenerative disorders, too. With Alzheimer's there is often a 20- to 30-year lag between the initial detection of amyloid and obvious cognitive decline. According to one study that predicted disease risk based on demographic data, death rates and amyloid status, fewer than one quarter of cognitively healthy 75-year-old women who test positive for amyloid in a spinal fluid analysis or positron-emission tomography (PET) brain scan will develop Alzheimer's dementia during their lifetime. Such findings suggest that amyloid alone is not driving disease progression and have spurred scientists to investigate other strategies.

DNA-sequencing analyses have identified gene variants that influence Alzheimer's risk. Some of these genes point to a critical role of immune activity and inflammation in the disease process. Other research indicates that one way to reduce disease risk is through lifestyle changes. According to a 2024 report, nearly half of dementia cases worldwide could be prevented or delayed by actions addressing 14 modifiable risk factors, including hearing loss, physical inactivity, and vascular risk factors such as diabetes and smoking (many of which also impact immune activity and inflammation).

A well-known hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the buildup of tau (a) and amyloid beta (b) proteins in the brain. Over time plaques and tangles cause neuron damage (c) and cell death. But most Alzheimer's patients have accumulated other proteins, too, such as alpha-synuclein, as well as blood vessel damage that can appear before amyloid plaques. Recent evidence suggests that inflammation, immune processes and vascular risk factors also play a key role in the disease.

There are more than 100 ongoing clinical trials testing a variety of interventions, each of which targets one or more potential contributors to dementia. “We will get there in stages,” says Sudha Seshadri, a neurologist and founding director of the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio in Texas. “The amyloid-lowering treatments are a piece of it. Immune-modulating drugs are probably going to be a piece of it,” she says. It will also be important to control for vascular risk, she adds, which “is important regardless of what else is happening.”

The mechanisms listed here are considered key elements of Alzheimer's risk:

Neurotransmitter receptors • Proteins on nerve cell surfaces that receive signals and play a critical role in memory and learning. Some drugs for Alzheimer's block harmful activity at these receptors, and others boost activity by preventing the breakdown of neurotransmitters.

Amyloid • A protein that, when misfolded, can build up outside of nerve cells in the brain and form plaques that disrupt neural function. Several therapies aim to dissolve these deposits.

Inflammation and immune processes • These can be activated by the buildup of abnormal forms of amyloid and tau in the brain, leading to nerve cell damage and cognitive decline.

Tau • A protein that typically helps to maintain a cell's structure and shape. It can build up within neurons and form tangles, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's, along with amyloid plaques. Some new therapies attempt to target pathological forms of tau, preventing these proteins' aggregation and enhancing their clearance.

Synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection • Ways in which the brain modifies connections between neurons during learning and memory and protects neurons from damage. Both processes can be disrupted in people with Alzheimer's.

Metabolism • The process by which the brain breaks down nutrients. In Alzheimer's patients, PET scans show abnormally low glucose metabolism in brain areas important for memory and cognition. Some therapies aim to increase the metabolism of glucose, which the brain needs for energy.

Vasculature • Specialized blood vessels in the brain form a dynamic interface known as the blood-brain barrier, which helps to supply nutrients to nerve cells and protect the brain from pathogens. Breakdown of this barrier has been associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's.

Growth factors and hormones • Proteins that can protect brain cells from damage and stimulate the production of new cells. Some therapies aim to replenish them and provide an extra layer of protection.

Epigenetic regulators • Proteins and other molecules that turn a gene on or off without changing the underlying DNA sequence. In doing so, they can influence the accumulation of misfolded amyloid, misfolded tau, or other pathogenic proteins.

Neurogenesis • Neural growth. Damaged nerve cells can contribute to memory impairment and cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer's. Promoting the growth of new nerve cells could help slow that decline.

Oxidative stress • An unhealthy overabundance of free radicals relative to antioxidants in the body, which can harm nerve cells and disrupt their function. Some therapies aim to relieve oxidative damage by enhancing the activity of specific enzymes that neutralize free radicals.

Proteostasis • A process that maintains proper protein folding, synthesis and degradation in cells and can become impaired in people with Alzheimer's. Some experimental interventions promote cellular pathways that prevent misfolded proteins or that facilitate their removal.

APOE • Abbreviation for apolipoprotein E, a protein-encoding gene that has three major forms: ε2, ε3 and ε4. APOE ε4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's. People have two copies, or alleles, of APOE. Having one APOE ε4 allele can increase someone's lifetime risk of disease up to fourfold over that of people with two copies of the most common variant, APOE ε3; two APOE ε4 alleles can raise the risk up to 25-fold. People with two APOE ε3 alleles are 40 percent more likely to develop Alzheimer's than those with one ε3 and one ε2.

This chart includes 138 drugs across 182 clinical trials—pharmacological Alzheimer's trials registered with clinicaltrials.gov as of January 2025. Though not comprehensive (for example, not all trials based outside of the U.S. are included), the dataset provides a useful big-picture view. [Editor's Note: Trials focused on exercise, lifestyle or caregiver interventions, cognitive behavioral therapies, supplements, medical foods or stem cell therapies are also not included.]  Trials are grouped according to shared mechanism of action on the left (treatment targets) and therapeutic goals on the right. Pie charts show what percent of each category of drugs are in phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 trials. (Drugs in phase 3 trials are generally closer to FDA approval than phase 1.) Neurotransmitter receptors, amyloid and inflammation are currently the most often targeted mechanisms. The most popular therapeutic category is disease-targeting drugs—in which the goal is to slow clinical decline by focusing on molecules and body systems. Symptom-targeting drugs, in contrast, aim to improve measurable symptoms that are already present at the start of the treatment.

While drugs that target the proteins amyloid and tau have garnered heavy attention and funding, other therapeutic approaches have focused on other biological mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease. Examples of the latter group are described below.

Inflammation • Keeping nerve cells healthy and protecting them from damage requires balance between soluble and membrane-bound forms of a protein called TNF-α. In conditions of immune dysfunction, a rise in soluble TNF-α disrupts the healthy balance, or homeostasis, and drives up inflammation. One company (INmune Bio) is developing a drug that binds and deactivates soluble TNF-α, restoring health-promoting effects of the transmembrane form.

Metabolism • Insulin, a hormone that regulates energy availability and brain cell communication, also helps to maintain immune and vascular health. A clinical trial led by Suzanne Craft of the Wake Forest University School of Medicine is testing intranasal delivery of insulin and the diabetes drug empagliflozin in people with early Alzheimer's or mild cognitive impairment.

Vasculature • Several companies are developing new versions of amyloid antibodies that can penetrate the brain more effectively—for instance, Roche's trontinemab. At least one company, Neuvasq, is developing an earlier-stage intervention that targets the vasculature itself, to test whether a less leaky blood-brain barrier could slow disease progression.

APOE • Some therapeutic strategies aim to reduce or get rid of the APOE ε4 risk variant, increase protein production by the protective gene form, APOE ε2, or edit the APOE ε4 gene to the APOE ε2 version. In a small gene therapy study, Lexeo Therapeutics used modified viruses to deliver the APOE ε2 gene into the spinal fluid of 15 Alzheimer's patients who had the more dangerous APOE ε4 variant.

Can Diet and Exercise Really Prevent Alzheimer's?

Early studies suggest that lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise and social engagement may help slow or prevent Alzheimer's symptoms—but the evidence is inconsistent, and many doctors remain cautious

By Sara Harrison edited by Lauren Gravitz

Luisa Jung

This article is part of “Innovations In: Alzheimer's Disease” an editorially independent special report that was produced with financial support from Eisai.

When Juli comes home after work, her husband doesn't regale her with stories about his photography business the way he once did. Instead he proudly shows her a pill container emptied of the 20 supplements and medications he takes every day. Rather than griping about traffic, he tells her about his walk. When they go out to a favorite Mexican restaurant, he might opt for a side salad instead of tortilla chips with his quesadilla. “He's actually consuming green food, which is new,” says Juli, who asked to be identified by only her first name to protect her husband's privacy.

Over the past year Juli's husband has agreed to change his daily habits in hopes of halting the steady progression of Alzheimer's disease, which he was diagnosed with in December 2023 at age 62. Juli and her husband are both self-employed, and their insurance plans didn't cover the positron-emission tomography scans for disease tracking that a neurologist prescribed, which would have cost thousands of dollars. So they decided to spend that money on a doctor who promises that diet and lifestyle changes can treat Alzheimer's. He recommended a keto diet, along with light cardio exercise and strength training. He also prescribed a bevy of supplements, such as creatine, which Juli's husband takes alongside the memantine and donepezil prescribed by his neurologist. Juli doesn't expect the diet and daily walks to cure her husband, but she hopes the healthy lifestyle will help manage and even improve his condition. It feels like common sense. “You stop eating fried food, you move your butt, and you feel better,” she says.

Increasingly, evidence suggests that addressing health problems such as vision and hearing loss, stress, poor diet, diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol and high blood pressure can help slow or even prevent Alzheimer's symptoms. It's a tantalizingly simple solution to a complicated condition that has proved difficult to treat. For families like Juli's that have been left with a grim diagnosis and few options, lifestyle changes bring a much needed sense of hope and agency. But researchers worry about overpromising on the efficacy of these changes, especially for people already experiencing dementia symptoms. Evidence around the importance of different diets, exercises and activities—when to start them and which to prioritize—is mixed, and only in a few high-quality studies have researchers examined large, diverse groups of people. It's a promising but nascent field of research, one that scientists worry gives patients dangerous and heartbreaking hope for a cure that doesn't exist.

“There are a lot of claims,” says Miia Kivipelto, a dementia researcher at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. She worries about expensive but unproven regimens that promise to reverse cognitive decline, restore and protect the brain, or significantly improve cognition for people with early-stage Alzheimer's or other dementias. “Of course, people want to have hope,” she says. But she cautions against making promises that can't be upheld. “It's risk reduction,” she says. “That's maybe what we can promise.”

Kivipelto led the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), a trial that enrolled more than 1,200 residents of Finland between the ages of 60 and 77. Results were published in 2017. They showed that after two years, participants who were given nutritional advice, exercise regimens and brain-training games had improved their executive function, processing speeds and complex memory by about 83, 150 and 40 percent, respectively, compared with those who didn't take those measures. Kivipelto has continued to follow that initial FINGER cohort and found that several years after the initial trial, their health in general continues to be better than that of their counterparts. The participants had a lower risk of stroke, had fewer medical emergency room visits and needed less inpatient care. Now Kivipelto is running World Wide FINGERS, a global network of studies investigating the same interventions in different countries and populations.

It's not clear whether these interventions prevent disease onset or simply delay it.

Similarly encouraging data have come from the Systematic Multi-Domain Alzheimer Risk Reduction Trial (SMARRT), a two-year randomized, controlled study. Researchers tested the effect of treating modifiable risk factors such as uncontrolled hypertension, social isolation and physical inactivity with more than 170 septuagenarians and octogenarians at high risk for dementia. Participants chose a few interventions to prioritize out of eight options, such as improved physical fitness or social connection. After two years, no matter which intervention people opted for, those who received individualized treatments had reduced risk factors for dementia and a 74 percent greater increase in cognition compared with their counterparts in the control group.

It's not clear whether these interventions prevent disease onset or simply delay it. At a certain point, prevention and treatment become almost the same thing: if people can postpone the onset of symptoms until they're 85 or 90 years old, Kivipelto says, “they might die of something else.” A report from a commission on dementia from the Lancet Group—which comprises experts who make recommendations on health policy and practice—suggests that addressing a range of these lifestyle-based risk factors could help reduce the global incidence of Alzheimer's and dementia by 45 percent population-wide. For people with a genetic predisposition to dementia, introducing diet, exercise, and other modifications before symptoms appear might be particularly important for fending off illness.

The idea that diet and exercise could curb a disease that currently affects more than 55 million people globally is an exciting prospect. But scientists say the field is simply too young for anyone to make bold assertions that lifestyle interventions could act as treatments or cures. “We don't have mature information,” says Howard Feldman, a neurologist at the University of California, San Diego.

One big caveat is that studies such as SMARRT and FINGER were conducted with people who had mild cognitive decline, not full-blown dementia. “There are people who are really exaggerating some of these claims,” says Kristine Yaffe, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and the lead author on the SMARRT study. “There's very little evidence that these [interventions] work when people have the disease.”

Also, the list of possible risk factors gets longer as more data emerge. When Kivipelto started FINGER, she didn't look at elements such as poor sleep and stress. But more evidence suggests that these factors could increase risk for Alzheimer's. Meanwhile interventions that had shown initial promise, such as the MIND diet—a diet geared toward brain health that combines elements of Mediterranean and hypertension-focused diets—weren't backed by further research.

Answering questions about lifestyle changes—what works, what doesn't and why—is particularly challenging because these interventions are not as easy to quantify as medications are. When researchers test pharmaceuticals, they're often investigating how a molecule interacts with a specific receptor. “We're gonna look at making sure that we've got target engagement, that we've got the right amount of medicine for the target and that we're getting the right effects,” Feldman says. Nonmedical interventions don't work in that way. Take exercise: There's no particular receptor to examine. Instead exercise might lead to better blood flow in the brain. It might affect cerebral metabolism. It could affect insulin levels or increase oxygen flow. All these factors have been linked to the development of Alzheimer's in some way.

Then there's the matter of dosage: What is the right amount of exercise? How much should people exert themselves and for how long? And how can researchers assess compliance? When researchers test pills, they can easily dispense medication and count how many pills are left at the end of a trial. It's much harder to know whether someone in a lifestyle study has done the assigned exercises or whether all participants worked out at the same intensity.

Another big unknown is when these interventions should begin. Some research suggests that to reduce risk factors, middle age might be the most impactful time. Kivipelto says that it's never too late to start but that the most effective interventions may vary with age. Stress and sleep might be bigger risk factors in middle age, whereas social isolation might become more important as people grow older. “You should have a kind of check wherever you are in your life,” she says.

Perhaps the biggest limitation, however, is that scientists can't measure all the biological and environmental systems at play, nor can they follow enough people for a long enough period to understand which systems are most important. One theory suggests that health interventions—such as diet, exercise and social stimulation—work because they boost cognitive reserve, or the ability of a person's brain to resist dementia. People with more cognitive reserve might not show symptoms even if they have the same pathology as someone else who is symptomatic. Researchers think being active, eating right and socializing might help build up that cognitive-reserve buffer. But they can't measure it. There is no known biomarker for cognitive reserve and no way to measure its effects over time. “It's an evolving concept,” Kivipelto says.

Even while scientists work on more high-quality studies of lifestyle changes for Alzheimer's—with large, diverse patient populations, control groups, and careful measurements for the intensity of the intervention—numerous commercial companies claim to offer scientifically backed cures. These products, including the approach Juli and her husband are trying, are often based on research in predatory journals, which charge authors high fees to publish papers that look scientific but have none of the oversight of peer-reviewed publications. Others lack rigorous trials and rely only on case reports that don't describe study methods and can't be replicated. Still others haven't been tested in large groups or in humans at all. For example, small studies have suggested ketosis could help improve cognition, but no large-scale clinical trials have tested the hypothesis. Similarly, creatine supplements have shown promise in mice but have not been tested extensively in humans. No large, high-quality clinical trials have shown that supplements can improve human cognition or brain health, but companies selling these products now represent an industry valued at more than $6 billion globally.

Some people spend their life savings to follow a protocol that requires them to remediate mold in their homes, even though the evidence linking mold and dementia is debated. Other families report that sticking to a restrictive diet ultimately feels cruel when a parent or spouse has few pleasures left. Neurologist Joanna Hellmuth, then at the University of California, San Francisco, wrote an article in 2020 in the Lancet Neurology about pseudoscience and dementia, warning that fraudulent solutions can be financially and emotionally harmful for families. “Hope is important in the face of incurable diseases and intuitive interventions can be compelling,” she wrote. “However, unsupported interventions are not medically, ethically, or financially benign, particularly when other parties might stand to gain.”

Even under the best of circumstances, changes to diet and exercise cannot ward off Alzheimer's for everyone. Yaffe has seen patients who play bridge, go running and practice über-healthy lifestyles only to be astonished to learn they also have Alzheimer's. “There's something called bad luck, and there's something called genetics,” she says. Scientists measure the impact of lifestyle modifications in population-wide estimates that don't translate to individual risk. Diet, exercise, hearing aids, and other interventions might reduce the global incidence of dementia by 45 percent, but that doesn't mean they will reduce your specific risk by the same amount. Yaffe estimates that roughly half of a person's Alzheimer's risk is based on genetics, and half probably depends on their activity level, diet and luck. But the biggest risk factor is age.

Even as Juli is gently prodding her husband to eat more broccoli, she's also preparing for his inevitable decline. The couple is in the process of moving from their two-story home in a Dallas suburb to a single-story house they are having built in a nearby gated community. Her husband will trade in his car for a golf cart, and Juli will work almost entirely from home to make sure he stays safe. She knows they are incredibly lucky to be able to afford to build their new home from the ground up. She's already designed it with a shower and doors wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair.

Juli acknowledges that it's impossible to know whether the changes to their health routines are working. There's no control group, no way to assess how her husband's disease might have progressed if they'd stuck to only medications. Right now they can afford the supplements ($150 per month), extra visits to doctors ($900 per hour twice a year), blood draws ($500 every six months), and memberships to their doctor's practice and to a platform that promotes the protocol they are following ($3,000 per year).

For Juli, the costs are justified by the change she sees in her husband. Their daily regimen gives him a sense of agency, which has alleviated some of the anxiety and depression that plagued him after his diagnosis. “It's given him work to do—and hope,” she says. “If that's all we take away from it, it's worth it.”

See How Fusion Energy Could Power the Future

Inertial confinement reactors, stellarators and tokamaks each have pros and cons

By Clara Moskowitz & Matthew Twombly edited by Clara Moskowitz & Jen Christiansen

Matthew Twombly

Nuclear fusion promises a green and infinitely renewable supply of energy—if we can harness it. Fusion happens all the time inside the sun. But to recreate the process on Earth, we must control incredibly hot, chaotic matter in an exceedingly dense state.

Prototypes of several different fusion-reactor designs are being tested around the world. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, for example, uses lasers to spark fusion in a small pellet of fuel. Tokamaks, such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France, use electromagnetic fields to confine plasma and heat it to the temperatures and densities necessary to ignite fusion. And stellarators, such as the Wendelstein 7-X experiment in Germany, add a twist to the magnetic field concept of tokamaks.

It's too soon to say whether any of these technologies can overcome their challenges to become a reliable energy source. But the motivation to make that happen is clear. “Necessity is the mother of invention,” says Laura Berzak Hopkins, associate laboratory director at the Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). “We have increasing energy demands and a changing climate, and fusion is the way we can address both those needs.”

Nuclear fusion is the process by which two atoms combine to form a larger atom (minus a bit of mass) plus energy.

To achieve sustained fusion, the atoms must reach a certain temperature and density, and they must stay in these states for an extended period. There are three general ways to meet these conditions.

The goal is to get more sustained energy out of the system than goes in.

Experiments in 2022 at NIF—the most famous inertial confinement facility—provided proof of concept. The project did release more fusion energy than its lasers used to create the reaction, but charging those lasers incurred an energy cost.

Recent experiments using magnetic confinement have also demonstrated progress. Two different concepts—a stellarator and a tokamak—have each held superheated plasma at the right temperatures and densities for nearly one minute, achieving new records. Why is this significant? Containing the fuel for sustained times is a huge challenge. To understand why, let's dive into an example.

Tokamak reactors—such as the massive ITER project, which is still under construction—use a doughnut-shaped container. Here's how they work:

1 • Remove all gas from the vacuum chamber, then charge the magnetic system around the vessel.

2 • Inject a small amount of deuterium and tritium gas into the vacuum.

3 • Switch on the coil of wire called a solenoid at the center of the tokamak to start up the magnetic field that will keep the gas contained. Run a powerful electric current through the vessel. This current strips electrons off the gas particles, which collide with other particles to kick off more electrons. The atoms become an ionized gas called a plasma, in which charged particles follow magnetic field lines.

4 • Heat the plasma to thermonuclear temperatures (150 million degrees Celsius) by injecting electromagnetic radiation and beams of high-energy neutral atoms.

5 • As the temperature rises, the density and energy within the plasma increase, causing particles to collide and initiate fusion. Some of the energy released from each reaction is used to heat additional incoming fuel, perpetuating fusion. The goal is to then transfer most of the heat out of the reactor and use it to generate electricity via, for example, steam turbines.

The process seems straightforward. So why is it so difficult?

When left to its own devices, plasma is turbulent, with pockets of temperature variations that create convection currents. This turbulence also moves heat from the plasma core to the edge, dampening the fusion reactions.

Scientists want to encourage collisions between particles within the plasma to promote fusion, but they also need to avoid particle collisions with the reactor hardware itself. Powerful magnetic fields steer the plasma around the doughnut in a roughly circular path.

But a closer look reveals that the particle trajectories aren't that simple. Different plasma shapes each have benefits and drawbacks in maximizing temperature and density. Within the suspended plasma inside of a tokamak, particles move in two general patterns: helical motion (called ion gyro motion) and a banana-shaped path.

Different reactor shapes and sizes result in different plasma trajectories and have different pros and cons.

All tokamaks confine the plasma using a central electric current that can make fusion reactions difficult to maintain. Traditional doughnut-shaped tokamaks have more space in the middle. This space makes room to shield a central electromagnet from the heat of the plasma.

Spherical tokamaks—such as PPPL's National Spherical Torus Experiment-Upgrade—have narrower central areas than traditional tokamaks. They are more compact, can more efficiently confine plasma particles, and can be more economical to build. But the smaller central area requires a skinnier central electromagnet that can make the generation of the plasma current more difficult.

Stellarators, which take a twisted shape, don't require a central current to keep plasma trajectories in check. Magnets along the winding tunnel wall do the trick. But getting up to temperature can be tricky.

Matthew Twombly

Because our energy demands are high and getting higher, it's likely that there is room for multiple models to succeed. “I'm confident that we need fusion,” PPPL's Berzak Hopkins says, “so that makes me very confident that we will solve fusion.”

Plant stem cells are crucial for the world's food supply, animal feed, and fuel production. They lay the foundation for how plants grow. Yet, much about these mysterious building blocks remains unknown. Previous analyses have failed to locate many of the important genes that regulate how these cells function.

Now, for the first time, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) plant biologists have mapped two known stem cell regulators across thousands of maize and Arabidopsis shoot cells. Their research also uncovered new stem cell regulators in both species and linked some to size variations in maize. This method for recovering rare stem cells could be used across the plant kingdom. CSHL Professor David Jackson explains: ""Ideally, we would like to know how to make a stem cell. It would enable us to regenerate plants better. It would allow us to understand plant diversity. One thing people are very excited about is breeding new crops that are more resilient or more productive. We don't yet have a full list of regulators -- the genes we need to do that.""

Jackson and his colleagues first focused on two well-known stem cell regulators called CLAVATA3 and WUSCHEL. A former postdoc in Jackson's lab, Xiaosa Xu, delicately dissected a small piece of maize and Arabidopsis shoots containing stem cells. Then, the team used a ""microfluidics"" machine to separate each cell, convert its RNA into DNA, and label it with a tag that identifies which cell it came from.

The process, called single-cell RNA sequencing, allows researchers to see how genes are expressed in thousands of cells at once. ""The great thing is that you have this atlas of gene expression,"" Jackson says. ""When we publish that, the whole community can use it. Other people interested in maize or Arabidopsis stem cells don't have to repeat the experiment. They will be able to use our data.""

Single-cell RNA sequencing allowed the team to recover about 5,000 CLAVATA3 and 1,000 WUSCHEL-expressing cells. Next, they identified hundreds of genes that were preferentially expressed in both maize and Arabidopsis stem cells, suggesting they may be evolutionarily important across many plant species. From there, they were able to link certain stem cell regulators to productivity in maize. Such links could someday help breeders select specific strains for food, animal feed, or fuel production.

""It's foundational knowledge that could guide research for the next decade,"" Jackson says. ""It can be used not only by developmental biologists, but physiologists, who think about how corn ears grow and how to improve productivity, and then breeders.""

Long-term stress levels, measured through hair samples, may provide important clues about mental health risks in children with chronic physical illnesses (CPI), according to new research from the University of Waterloo.

The study highlights how high hair cortisol, a type of steroid hormone, acts as a powerful early warning sign that could help identify children who live with CPI and who could be most at risk of mental health challenges, helping guide prevention and treatment strategies to better support their health and well-being.

An estimated 40 percent of children in Canada live with a CPI -- a number that has been rising steadily for decades. These children face a much higher risk of developing mental health problems than their healthy peers, putting them at greater risk for poor quality of life, suicidal thoughts and increased reliance on health-care services.

""Living with a chronic illness means facing daily challenges such as taking medications, missing school and adjusting activities, all of which can take a serious emotional toll,"" said Emma Littler, a Waterloo PhD candidate in Public Health Sciences and lead author of the study.

""Our findings suggest that chronically high stress, measured through hair samples, could help identify children with CPI at the highest risk for developing mental health problems. This opens the door to earlier and more targeted support.""

The study followed 244 Canadian children with chronic physical illnesses over four years, measuring stress using hair cortisol -- a biological marker that reflects stress levels over time. Researchers found that more than two-thirds of these children had persistently high cortisol levels. Those children were also more likely to show symptoms of depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns compared to peers whose cortisol levels decreased over time.

When the researchers compared these patterns to reports of emotional and behavioral difficulties, they found that children whose cortisol levels declined over time showed fewer symptoms of anxiety, depression and behavior problems than those whose cortisol levels stayed high.

""Identifying these risk factors early could help doctors and families intervene before emotional and behavioral difficulties take hold,"" said Dr. Mark Ferro, a professor in Waterloo's School of Public Health Sciences and co-author of the study.

""Hair cortisol offers a non-invasive, easy-to-collect biomarker that could one day be used to screen children and track whether treatments or support programs are helping to reduce stress.""

The study, ""Association between hair cortisol and psychopathology in children with a chronic physical illness,"" was recently published in Stress and Health. 

Ferro and colleagues from Waterloo and McMaster University also published new research showing that biomarkers found in the blood of children with CPI may help predict future mental health challenges. The study, Inflammatory biomarkers predictive of psychopathology in children with physical illness, found that some blood signals were linked to children with CPI experiencing worsening mental health over time, while others were associated with improvements. The findings suggest that routine blood tests, combined with mental health check-ups, could help doctors identify children who may need extra support earlier.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New drug could be first to stop deadly fatty liver disease","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250915202836.htm","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 09:03:54 GMT","

Researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine have identified a new investigational drug that shows promise in treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a serious form of fatty liver disease linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes that can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and even liver cancer.

The study, published in the August 23, 2025 online edition of The Lancet, found that the medication, ION224, targets a liver enzyme called DGAT2, which plays a key role in how the liver produces and stores fat. By blocking this enzyme, the drug helps reduce fat buildup and inflammation, two major drivers of liver damage in MASH.

""This study marks a pivotal advance in the fight against MASH,"" said Rohit Loomba, MD, principal investigator of the study and chief of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at UC San Diego School of Medicine. ""By blocking DGAT2, we're interrupting the disease process at its root cause, stopping fat accumulation and inflammation right in the liver.""

The multicenter, Phase IIb clinical trial involved 160 adults with MASH and early to moderate fibrosis across the United States. Participants received monthly injections of the drug at different doses or a placebo over the course of one year. At the highest dose, 60% showed notable improvements in their liver health compared to the placebo group. These benefits occurred regardless of weight change, suggesting the drug could be used alongside other therapies. The medicine showed no serious side effects linked to the treatment.

MASH, formally known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), affects people with metabolic conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes. It is often called a ""silent"" disease because it can progress for years without symptoms.

More than 100 million people have some form of fatty liver disease in the U.S. and as many as 1 in 4 adults worldwide may be affected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If left untreated, MASH can progress to liver failure and often may require a transplant.

""This is the first drug of its kind to show real biological impact in MASH,"" Loomba said. ""If these findings are confirmed in Phase III trials, we may finally be able to offer patients a targeted therapy that halts and potentially reverses liver damage before it progresses to life-threatening stages.""

Loomba, who is also director of the metabolic-dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) research center at UC San Diego School of Medicine, and a gastroenterologist and hepatologist at UC San Diego Health, adds that for patients and families affected by this serious condition, these results bring new hope for better care and outcomes. He emphasizes that early intervention and targeted therapies may also help reduce the burden on health care systems by preventing costly and complex liver disease down the line.

Next steps include a larger clinical trial to move closer to making this treatment widely available.

Co-authors of the study include Erin Morgan, Keyvan Yousefi, Dan Li, Richard Geary, Sanjay Bhanot, all from Ionis Pharmaceuticals, and Naim Alkhouri, Arizona Liver Health.

Funding for this research came from Ionis Pharmaceuticals (ION224-CS2).

The mosquito Aedes aegypti transmits dengue and other viruses. Credit: Cadu Rolim/Fotoarena via ZUMA

Last month, a parade of vehicles wound its way through three cities in Brazil, releasing clouds of mosquitoes into the air. The insects all carry a secret weapon — a bacterium called Wolbachia that lowers the odds that the mosquitoes can transmit the dreaded dengue virus to humans.

This is the world's largest ‘mosquito factory': its goal is to stop dengue

This is the world's largest ‘mosquito factory': its goal is to stop dengue

These infected mosquitoes are the latest weapon in Brazil's fight against dengue, which infects millions of people in the country each year and can be fatal. A biofactory that opened in the town of Curitiba in July can produce 100 million mosquito eggs per week — making it the largest such facility in the world. The company that runs it, Wolbito do Brasil, aims to protect about 14 million Brazilians per year through its Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.

That will come as welcome news for the Brazilian health officials battling the rapidly growing threat of dengue. In 2024, the country experienced its worst outbreak yet: with 6.6 million probable cases and more than 6,300 related deaths. This year's outbreak, although less severe, is also one of the highest on record, with 1.6 million probable cases so far (see ‘Dangerous outbreaks'). And the problem is spreading. Argentina, Colombia and Peru also experienced record-breaking outbreaks in 2024 and have seen a sustained increase in cases in recent years. Across Latin America and the Caribbean, deaths from dengue last year totalled more than 8,400 and the global figure reached more than 12,000 — the highest ever recorded for this disease.

SOURCE: Brazilian Ministry of Health

As outbreaks grow larger and the crisis becomes more urgent, the Wolbachia method isn't Brazil's only bet. A locally produced dengue vaccine is now awaiting approval by the country's drug-regulatory agency, and its health ministry expects to start administering tens of millions of doses by next year.

These twin advances offer some hope to other countries — in the region and beyond. Driven by forces such as climate change, mosquito adaptation, globalized trade and movements of people, dengue is becoming a crisis worldwide, with an estimated 3.9 billion people at risk of infection. As Brazil rolls out its armies of infected mosquitoes and a vaccine in the coming year, the rest of the world will be watching closely.

Currently, there is one main dengue vaccine in use around the world: Qdenga, licensed by the Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda. The vaccine has been approved in many countries, including Brazil, which was the first nation to include it in its public-health system.

However, Qdenga's roll-out in Brazil is limited. The country bought nine million doses of the two-dose vaccine this year: enough to vaccinate 4.5 million of its population of more than 210 million. So far, Qdenga has been administered to children between the ages of 10 and 14, one of the groups most likely to end up in hospital after contracting dengue, together with older people. Its safety and efficacy have not yet been tested in adults aged over 60.

The main reasons for such a limited roll-out in Brazil are availability and cost. Even though Brazil secured Qdenga from Takeda at one of the cheapest prices in the world —around US$19 per dose — the cost is still high compared with other vaccines. And even in the most optimistic scenario, the maximum number of doses Takeda could provide by 2028 is 50 million — enough to vaccinate 25 million people. What's more, for people who have not had dengue before, clinical trials did not show Qdenga to be effective against all four variants — or serotypes — of the dengue virus.

When will dengue strike? Outbreaks sync with heat and rain

When will dengue strike? Outbreaks sync with heat and rain

Brazil is trying to address all of those limitations with its one-dose vaccine candidate, developed at the Butantan Institute, a public biomedical research centre in São Paulo. “Having local production capacity gives us independence on decisions — how many doses we need, and at what speed to vaccinate,” says Esper Kallás, Butantan's director. “You can practise prices that are more suitable and absorbable by a public-health system such as Brazil's.”

Butantan is also optimistic that its vaccine will be effective against all four forms of dengue. Severe disease usually occurs when a person is infected by a different serotype to their first infection. That means that a successful vaccine needs to generate antibodies for all four serotypes without triggering severe reactions, which makes it a difficult vaccine to develop. “It was indeed a challenge, as each serotype behaves differently,” says Neuza Frazatti Gallina, manager of the viral vaccine development laboratory at Butantan.

The vaccine's development began at the US National Institutes of Health in the late 1990s, where scientists transformed dengue viruses they had isolated from patients into weakened vaccine strains that could trigger the production of protective antibodies without causing disease. In 2009, Butantan extended that research by working to solve the challenges of combining the four strains into a vaccine.

After testing 30 formulations, Butantan arrived at one that proved highly effective in preventing infections, according to the preliminary results of a phase III trial involving more than 16,000 volunteers in Brazil. The study reported that two years after vaccinations, the formulation was 89% effective in preventing infections in people who had previously been infected with dengue, and 74% effective in those with no previous exposure1.

“It was a well-designed trial,” says Annelies Wilder-Smith, who is team lead for vaccine development at the World Health Organization (WHO). But she says one limitation of the trial is that it was conducted in a single country, and therefore runs a risk that all four serotypes were not circulating at the time.

In fact, serotypes 3 and 4 were not prevalent during the data-collection period of the clinical trial, although they are now circulating in Brazil. Butantan researchers suggest that the vaccine will be effective against serotypes 3 and 4, pointing to data from a phase II trial2 in 300 adults that showed participants produced neutralizing antibodies to each of the serotypes. That study evaluated safety and immunological response in the short term, rather than looking at the vaccine's long-term efficacy in preventing infections. The full results of the Brazilian phase III trial — which will provide data on long-term effectiveness — are not yet public and are undergoing peer review.

The vaccine is already moving through the country's regulatory process. And although there's still no certainty about when Anvisa, Brazil's regulatory agency, will approve the vaccine, the government is counting on it. In February, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced that, starting in 2026, the Ministry of Health would be buying 60 million doses annually.

To meet that demand, Butantan is now producing the vaccine at its São Paulo facility. On its lush campus, an entire building is dedicated to churning out doses.

Regarding the vaccine's approval, “We are very confident,” says Kallás. “We also anticipate that there is a very prominent need to have this product in the arms of people. So we hit the road running and started producing vaccines late last year.”

Although Butantan's production efforts will focus initially on meeting Brazil's need for millions of doses, Kallás expects that the vaccine could reach other countries. Butantan has been discussing with its development partner — the pharmaceutical giant Merck — and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) how to make the vaccine accessible to other countries. The logical first step, he says, would be to roll it out through PAHO to Latin America and the Caribbean, and then to other regions.

In the meantime, Merck is developing a potential vaccine for Asia with an almost identical formulation, which builds on the knowledge that Butantan has developed. In a statement, the drug firm said that Butantan is “sharing clinical data and other learnings”. In June, Merck started enrolling participants for its own phase III trial. “All the data, experiences and insights they have collected with the Butantan vaccine will be helpful,” says Wilder-Smith.

While Butantan awaits news about the vaccine's approval, the Wolbachia method to control dengue is gaining momentum. The World Mosquito Program (WMP) — a non-profit group of companies owned by Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, where the strategy was developed — has operations in 14 countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico and Colombia, but Brazil leads the way in terms of the scale of its expansion.

The method's arrival in the Americas is tied to Brazilian researcher Luciano Moreira, now the chief executive of Wolbito do Brazil. Wolbachia is naturally present in around 50% of insects, but not in the mosquito species Aedes aegypti, which is the main transmitter of dengue and many other viruses.

Both metabolic surgery and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) improve cardiometabolic outcomes, but their long-term outcomes have not been directly compared. Here, we compared macrovascular and microvascular outcomes in 1,657 patients (65.7% female) with type 2 diabetes and obesity who underwent metabolic surgery with 2,275 similar patients (53.5% female) who received treatment with GLP-1 RAs. Using a doubly robust estimation method to balance baseline characteristics between groups, we examined the time to all-cause mortality, incident major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), nephropathy and retinopathy over a median follow-up of 5.9 years. The 10-year cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was 9.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.8–10.8%) in the metabolic surgery group and 12.4% (95% CI 9.9–15.2%) in the GLP-1 RA group (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.68 (95% CI 0.48–0.96), P = 0.028). Compared with the GLP-1 RA group, metabolic surgery was also associated with a lower risk of MACE (adjusted HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.51–0.82; P < 0.001), nephropathy (adjusted HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.43–0.67; P < 0.001) and retinopathy (adjusted HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.29–0.75; P = 0.002). These findings indicate that even with the availability of GLP-1 RAs, metabolic surgery remains superior to medical treatment. Future studies should compare the cardiometabolic outcomes of metabolic surgery with newer GLP-1 RAs that are more effective for weight reduction.

Nature-based solutions (NbS) can mitigate the climate crisis and provide co-benefits to biodiversity and human well-being. We identified opportunities for NbS in the US by mapping both critical habitat for birds under a changing climate and carbon stocks and sinks. We then investigated the alignment of these locations with areas important for human well-being and land-dependencies. Finally, we identified High Priority NbS areas that align with irrecoverable carbon to focus conservation efforts on places with significant long-term carbon storage potential. Although ~ 30% of US lands have some protection, < 3% of protected US lands align with priorities for birds, carbon, and human well-being. Of the 312 million acres of priority areas for birds, carbon, and human well-being identified, 71% lack legal protection or formal conservation plans (14% of US lands). Targeting such areas for NbS conservation and restoration would help achieve equitable climate benefits by guiding conservation investments to marginalized communities, while also ensuring maintenance of lands that are critical for biodiversity tracking a changing climate. At least 80% of all birds, carbon, and human well-being priorities co-occur with local communities who have cultural and socioeconomic ties to the land, making it imperative to work with these communities to achieve successful conservation outcomes.

Habitat loss and climate change are two of the most pervasive and detrimental threats to biodiversity globally1,2,3. Climate change contributes to species declines4,5,6,7as a consequence of range loss and/or exposure to climate change-related threats8,9,10,11,12. Furthermore, conversion of natural ecosystems has accelerated climate change by contributing up to 20% of the world's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through released carbon into the atmosphere13.This number is expected to increase as continued warming leads to accelerated carbon loss13. These dual climate change and biodiversity global crises require urgent solutions. Conserving natural habitats through the implementation of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) is a promising strategy for simultaneously addressing both crises while providing additional ecosystem services14,15. The IUCN broadly defines NbS as actions that protect, sustainably manage, and restore both natural and modified ecosystems to address societal challenges and benefit both people and nature (https://iucn.org/our-work/nature-based-solutions). Restoring or maintaining natural ecosystems under an NbS framework can provide co-benefits to people, including clean and abundant drinking water from healthy watersheds; increased productivity from healthy soils; flood control from functioning wetlands; and temperature moderation from healthy forests15,16. Understanding where opportunities for NbS occur, including natural areas with high carbon sequestration and sinks that align with key areas for biodiversity currently and under future climate change, as well as the impacts they may have on human well-being in those areas, should be a priority in area-based conservation17. Global conservation area-based targets, such as Target 3 of the 23 targets under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF) to protect 30% of lands and water by 2030 (hereafter ‘30 × 30'), and the Global Deal for Nature to protect 50% by 2050 (‘Half-Earth'), are focused on reversing biodiversity loss through the conservation and restoration of natural areas18. Most protected areas in the US have been established for geological or scenic preservation, with little focus on biodiversity or climate change19,20,21. While ~ 30% of continental US lands (including Alaska) are considered formally protected, indicating we are already at the 30% target on paper, in practice, the majority of these lands are managed for multiple uses and were not established with biodiversity goals in mind. Moreover, the rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities have historically been overlooked22,23. There is a growing consensus for the need to consider more than a nominal protection designation of pre-defined acreage targets, including elevated focus on simultaneous biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services such as carbon mitigation (i.e. protection of carbon stores and sinks) in conservation planning (see Target 3 under the KMGBF; https://www.cbd.int/gbf/targets/3). Thus, mapping areas of high value for NbS will guide area-based conservation efforts, and on-the-ground NbS implementation17,23,24.

The few analyses that identify ‘optimal' NbS focused conservation portfolios that maximize biodiversity and carbon benefits simultaneously often overlook the rights of people living in these areas, as well as the implications of traditional land conservation and protection designations for displacing people and current land uses. Currently, NbS implementation has been criticized for a lack of inclusive participation or capacity to foster change that is transformative25. Notably, area-based conservation targets, such as 30 × 30 and Half-Earth26,27,28, have the potential to perpetuate environmental injustices if consideration of human well-being and livelihoods are ignored29. Conservation without community co-development and support is likely to be ineffective30. In addition, consideration of other area-based conservation measures beyond protected and conserved lands, such as sustainable management, should be integrated into NbS planning efforts. This includes engaging local communities and private landowners in land governance and management activities that achieve positive and sustained outcomes for biodiversity and ecosystem services, while also respecting locally-relevant values and rights31. Given the interconnectedness of climate change, biodiversity loss, and human well-being, a holistic solution with an emphasis on the human communities at highest risk from climate change and land degradation who have historically been marginalized, and even victimized, is critical in conservation planning. Additionally, access to natural areas in the US has been shown to have disparities across race, socioeconomic status, and housing composition, with People of Color and low-income communities being grossly underrepresented32,33. Access to nature can influence overall human health and well-being and foster opportunities for green economic development32,34. Governing bodies have historically ignored social and environmental justice and disregarded how marginalized human communities (e.g., Indigenous groups and Black and brown communities) are included or engaged in setting large-scale conservation targets27,35. Understanding who lives in priority restoration areas and how they may be affected by NbS and land management decisions, is critical for reaching successful and equitable conservation outcomes36. This includes marginalized and historically excluded communities, as well as communities affected by changes in local land management, including those with land-dependent livelihoods, cultural importance factors such as sustenance and spirituality, or risk of green gentrification25; hereafter, these groups are referred to as Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs).Though nearly 30% of US lands are currently within the protected area network, it remains unclear how well these lands help us achieve goals for biodiversity and climate change, and to what extent they account for human well-being. We must identify where conservation action provides maximum return on investment for biodiversity and climate change and who will benefit or be engaged in the process37. Here, we propose a spatially-explicit, conservation framework for integrating multiple priorities into a spatial assessment of NbS-focused, area-based targets (Fig. 1). This framework identifies the spatial distribution of areas that are important for NbS (i.e., biodiversity and climate change mitigation) as well as the human communities whose well-being and land-dependent livelihoods could be impacted by conservation actions, within the context of area-based conservation targets. We focus on birds as representatives of biodiversity, as they are monitored globally and can be effective indicators of overall biodiversity when conservation planning spans many species, habitats, and environmental gradients38,39. We then focused in on areas within the human purview to manage that have high irrecoverable carbon stores40and where they coincide with high value areas for birds, carbon, and human communities, to identify locations prime for NbS action. We focused on the continental United States (US), but this framework can be applied at any scale from local to global. These national maps can be used in combination with local datasets and in partnership with IPLCs to identify what counts toward the 30% goal under 30 × 30 and to design local, state or regional conservation plans that simultaneously address biodiversity, climate change, and the needs of human communities. This approach identifies High Priority NbS Areas across the US to help guide conservation efforts where they are most needed, with social-ecological considerations at the forefront of decision-making41 (Fig. 1).

Conceptual diagram of how Bird, Carbon, and Human priorities (BCH priorities), areas of alignment between bird climate strongholds, areas important for carbon storage and sequestration, and vulnerable human communities facing inequities (opportunities to equitably improve human well-being), are classified as, (A) priorities to maintain and (B) priorities to restore, based on the overlap of conservation priorities for birds (pink), carbon (green), and human well-being (yellow). Priorities to maintain are areas where Climate Strongholds and existing carbon stores and sinks are actively benefiting bird species resilience and carbon mitigation. Priorities to restore are areas where Vulnerable Climate Strongholds and potential areas for additional carbon storage and sequestration have potential benefits to bird resilience and carbon mitigation if restored. In each scenario (A and B), we focus on two areas of NbS overlap (1) alignment of Climate Strongholds and carbon priorities (benefits to Bird and Carbon: BC priorities) and (2) alignment of all three priorities (benefits to birds, carbon, and humans: BCH priorities). For both BC and BCH priorities to maintain and restore, we also consider areas with IPLCs considerations (i.e., BC + IPLCs and BCH + IPLCs) as additional priority area types (not shown).

We identified 1.1 billion acres of Bird and Carbon (BC) priorities to maintain existing habitats or restore habitats using NbS across all seven ecosystems examined (Fig. 2). A total of 74% of BC priorities occur on unprotected land with no conservation mandate (see Supplementary Table S4). These are potential opportunities under 30 × 30 to conserve biodiversity and mitigate carbon, comprising 43% (980 million acres) of the US (Table 1; Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S5). Currently 13% (305 million acres) of the continental US is under strict formal protection (GAP 1–2), with an additional 18% (410 million acres) under multiple-use conservation protection (GAP 3, Table 1). Thus, nearly three-fourths of the US (69%) lacks any formal protection. Nearly 50% of current GAP 1–2 protected lands coincide with BC priorities (Table 1; Fig. 3), which equates to 6% of US lands (143 million acres) that could count towards the 30 × 30 target (Table 1; Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S5). Currently, 48% of GAP 3 managed lands overlap with BC priorities, equating to 9% of US lands (200 million acres) that provide additional opportunities for increased protection and could count towards 30 × 30 while benefiting birds and carbon (Table 1; Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S5).

US lands identified with the highest potential for NbS focused on birds and carbon (BC priorities), as well as potential to promote equitable human well-being (BCH priorities) if maintained or restored. Darker color tones indicate conservation priorities occurring in communities that rely on the land for cultural preservation and/or socioeconomic factors (BC + IPLCs and BCH + IPLCs). This map was created using ESRI ArcPro 3.2.2 (https://pro.arcgis.com/).

US lands identified with the highest potential for NbS focused on birds and carbon (BC priorities), as well as potential to promote equitable human well-being (BCH priorities) if maintained or restored according to their current GAP status. Darker color tones indicate conservation priorities occurring in communities that rely on the land for cultural preservation and/or socioeconomic factors (BC + IPLCs and BCH + IPLCs). This map was created using ESRI ArcPro 3.2.2 (https://pro.arcgis.com/).

A total of 19% of US lands (438 million acres) align with BC priorities and are also within communities identified as priorities for human well-being (BCH priorities; Table 1; Fig. 2). A quarter of the US population lives in communities with these BCH priorities (hereafter “BCH communities”). Less than 3% of US lands are currently protected BCH priorities (Table 1). Of the 438 million acres of BCH priorities, 71% are unprotected and 15% are within GAP 3 designation. These lands sum to 380 million acres of conservation opportunity across the continental US (or 14% and 3% of the US, respectively; Table 1) with potential co-benefits for people.

Furthermore, BCH communities had high community inequities, including less access to nature (91% of the population in BCH communities), followed by chronic health conditions (73%), pollution exposure (62%), and high exposure to climate change risk (47%) (Fig. 4b). Overall, 95% of populations in BCH communities face multiple inequities in each region of the US (Fig. 5). Community inequity was high in the Southern Great Plains, Northern Great Plains, and Southeast although the inequity patterns varied regionally (Figs. 4b and 5).

Bird and Carbon (BC) conservation priorities overlap with human communities experiencing co-occurring inequities. This map shows the number of co-occurring inequity indicators (including climate, pollution, health, and nature access) experienced by the human communities overlapping BC priority areas. Geographic region boundaries are shown in black line. This map was created using ESRI ArcPro 3.2.2 (https://pro.arcgis.com/).

Across all communities with BC Priorities, IPLCs considerations affected a greater percentage of the population (36%) than community inequities (30%). Of the 1.32 billion acres of BC priorities in the US, regardless of protection status, 80% (1.12 billion acres) also have indicators of IPLCs considerations (i.e., BC + IPLCs priorities) and 29% (387,083,039 acres) are in communities with inequitable human well-being in addition to having IPLCs considerations (i.e., BCH + IPLCs priorities; Supplementary Table S4). A total of 72% (764 million acres) of BC + IPLCs priorities and 69% (269 million acres) of BCH + IPLCs priorities are unprotected, with an additional 17% and 16% in GAP 3 lands, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). Across the continental US, 43% of GAP 3 lands coincide with BC + IPLCs areas and 15% coincide with BCH + IPLCs areas (the percentage of GAP3 in these priorities out of the total US GAP3 area, Table 1, Supplementary Table S5).

Of the population living within BC priorities and IPLCs, the majority depended on the natural resource industry (63%). Natural resource industry dependence was highest in the central and western regions, and lowest in the east (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table S6). Green gentrification was the next most prevalent indicator, affecting 37% of the population across the US, but percentages were greatest in the Northeast (59% of population), Southwest (46% of population), and Southeast (43%; Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table S6). A total of 10% of this US population (BC + IPLCs, and up to 70% in Alaska) resides in communities that share a mix of legal boundaries belonging to tribal and non-tribal governments, and state and federally recognized American Indian lands. Populations with high potential for green gentrification were more prevalent in priorities to restore, while populations associated with Indigenous land and natural resource industry were higher in priority areas to maintain (Supplementary Table S6).

We identified 261 million acres (11.7% of US lands) of High Priority NbS Areas (Fig. 6) as all combined BC priorities (BC, BCH, BC + IPLCs, and BCH + IPLCs) that align with areas of highest irrecoverable carbon density (i.e., areas of high value carbon stores that are under direct human influence and are crucial for climate mitigation success, thus providing an ideal data layer for prioritizing NbS action)40. We highlight these areas to differentiate regions of the highest priority to better support conservation decision-making within a NbS framework, and to direct efforts of highest potential climate mitigation value when conservation resources are limited. Looking across these High Priority NbS Areas, this includes 53 million acres (2.4% of US lands) of BC priorities, 121 million acres (5.4% of US lands) of BC + IPLC priorities, 10 million acres (0.5% of US lands) of BCH priorities, and 77 million acres (3.5%) of BCH + IPLCs priorities. High Priority NbS Areas are primarily distributed in the Northwest, Northeast, and Southeast regions, where forests, wetlands, and coastal areas contain large amounts of irrecoverable carbon (Fig. 6). A total of 80% of High Priority NbS Areas align with priorities for human well-being, with most of those areas (76%) with IPLCs considerations.

US lands identified as High Priority NbS Areas that align both with the highest potential for NbS focused on birds and carbon (BC priorities), as well as potential to promote equitable human well-being (BCH priorities) if maintained or restored and fall within the footprint of irrecoverable carbon density. These areas are the highest priority to better support conservation decision-making within an NbS framework. Darker color tones indicate conservation priorities located in communities that rely on the land for cultural preservation and/or socioeconomic factors (BC + IPLCs and BCH + IPLCs). This map was created using ESRI ArcPro 3.2.2 (https://pro.arcgis.com/).

Currently, of the 13% of US lands with a strict legal mandate for biodiversity protection (here, Gap 1 and Gap 2 lands), only 6% align with BC priorities and < 3% overlap with BCH priorities, revealing that we have not been successful to date at representing NbS priorities within our current protected area portfolio. Here, we identified an additional 980 million acres (43% of US lands) of unprotected land with potential opportunities for NbS to conserve BC priorities, and nearly 312 million acres (14% of US lands) representing opportunities to conserve BCH priorities. Here, NbS conservation efforts must go beyond traditional protection, and include actions such as sustainable land management and collaboration with private landowners14. Focusing NbS conservation efforts on these lands would meet 30 × 30 goals and help address the dual climate and biodiversity crises17,42, while simultaneously benefitting human communities.

Meeting 30 × 30 targets by increasing or adding protections to existing multiple-use areas (GAP 3) covering nearly 18% of US lands e.g.23 would fail to maximize the benefits of NbS and improve human equity, despite 49% of GAP 3 lands having high value for birds and carbon (totalling 9% of US lands). In addition, we found only 19% of US lands with conservation protection, and 17% of multiple-use lands that also align with BCH priorities (each covering just under 3% of US lands). Protected areas historically have not been designated with biodiversity, climate change or equitable human well-being in mind. More so, traditional conservation practices have been focused on optimizing resource extraction or preserving recreational, scenic, or geological value on land that has been colonized19,20,21,43. These same practices have also led to restricted access to protected lands and lack of inclusion in conservation decision-making, with the brunt of the inequity falling on communities of color, rural communities, and IPLCs43. Therefore, we must look beyond the current protected lands system to meet 30 × 30 targets with NbS in mind.

Here, we identified nearly 14% of currently unprotected US lands where NbS-focused conservation could improve equitable human well-being alongside BC priorities (i.e., BCH priorities). Our results indicate 95% of socially vulnerable populations located in BC priorities face multiple inequities, including 91% without adequate access to nature, and > 70% with chronic health conditions, which is consistent with other work demonstrating that communities of color in the US live in areas with more human modification33 and less access to nature32. Given that access to green spaces promotes increased physical activity and mental health, and thus improves human well-being32,34, prioritizing conservation efforts and NbS within these highly modified habitats would likely benefit human well-being in addition to biodiversity and climate mitigation. For example, NbS conservation and restoration action could focus on regions with relatively high community inequity, including areas in the Southern Great Plains, Northern Great Plains, and Southeast (Fig. 5). Focusing on NbS conservation and restoration actions in these regions can help fuel a ‘restoration economy', providing localized social and economic benefits to local communities and economies44.

Conservation actions in these priority areas will necessitate working closely with IPLCs to develop conservation solutions that support their well-being and land dependency needs and count towards 30 × 30. We found 80% of BC priorities fall within IPLCs (BC + IPLCs priorities), and most of these lands are not currently protected. The high overlap of these areas is key for addressing biodiversity loss and climate change and highlights the importance of conservation actions that account for people's cultural values and livelihoods. This includes strategies such as integrating ethical considerations into conservation triage, an approach which traditionally prioritizes areas based on conservation urgency where resources are finite45. However, this approach generally does not consider social-ecological connections46. The High Priority NbS Areas identified here allow conservation practitioners to focus on the areas of highest importance for birds, in conjunction with where irrecoverable carbon stores are at risk of being lost without conservation actions. However, 80% of these High Priority NbS Areas fall within areas of low human well-being and numerous IPLC considerations. Effective conservation triage in these areas needs to account for social-ecological challenges46. Adaptive governance and knowledge co-production are essential components of conservation planning that deliver effective and ethical outcomes for human well-being as well as biodiversity, and climate mitigation46.

We considered three IPLCs attributes that have been historically affected by conservation and land protection decisions, acknowledging that several more IPLCs attributes could be considered and thus, our estimates of conservation areas in need of IPLCs actions are likely an underestimate. 30 × 30 has set a target to inclusively conserve and restore, and explicitly recognizes many human uses of lands and waters can benefit natural systems including working lands47. This is an important framing, as even with expansion of protected areas, biodiversity loss and extinction rates continue to remain high48.Therefore, protection status alone does not guarantee conservation success without additional management actions49,50,51. Within the context of climate change, proactive management strategies need to be implemented to continuously adapt to changing environmental conditions52,53,54. As part of this approach, we must engage private landowners in conservation, NbS, and stewardship of the land in a manner that can sustain both nature and the people that depend on it31. This includes working closely with private landowners in rural and working lands, as 63% of our IPLCs within BC priorities (77% when only considering IPLCs with BC priorities to maintain, Supplementary Table S6) are employed in the natural resource industry across all regions and priorities in our study. Working lands, if managed appropriately, can be successful NbS and beneficial for both carbon sequestration14,15 and biodiversity conservation55. Conservation practitioners can help support communities in sustainable management of local natural spaces56 by developing and maintaining programs that incentivize NbS. Market-based approaches that encourage the restoration or maintenance of natural land cover, as well as provide guidance on extractive practices that minimize biodiversity and carbon loss, can be key strategies for tackling the climate and biodiversity crises in conjunction with supporting the livelihoods of local communities. For example, ranchers can implement grazing practices that are bird-friendly, thereby promoting resilient grassland bird communities57, while simultaneously increasing the market value of the beef produced via bird-friendly land certifications. These strategies will be particularly critical in the Northern and Southern Great Plains, Alaska, Northwest, and Midwest, where communities with BC priorities have high dependence on natural resources for livelihoods. Private lands are crucial for both sustaining biodiversity and climate change mitigation, and thus local and co-produced conservation solutions that move beyond singularly relying on traditional protected area mandates will be critical going forward31,37,55.

Focusing on collaborations supporting and enhancing Indigenous land management or community-led protected area establishment may offer a path towards reaching 30 × 30 conservation targets that benefits human well-being and elevates Indigenous land rights. First, Indigenous lands are home to 10% of the US population within IPLCs with BC priorities, but this proportion was as high as 70% in Alaska. Given dispossession and forced migration, Indigenous lands have been reduced by nearly 99% of their historic extent58. However, Indigenous-managed lands have been shown to have greater vertebrate species richness and threatened species richness than protected areas. This highlights the importance of Indigenous land management, stewardship, and knowledge to conservation59,60,61. The human impact of conservation decision-making will also be strong in priority areas to maintain, as we found both natural resource industries and Indigenous populations were higher within these areas. Given the legacy of displacement and protection of land without collaboration within areas of high conservation value such as these, key conservation opportunities should be identified in partnership with IPLCs.

Green gentrification - the greening of urban spaces that leads to increased property values and subsequent displacement of low-income residents62- warrants particular attention given the likelihood of human displacement associated with restoration or wilding efforts in urban settings63. Roughly 37% of BC + IPLCs communities across all regions were at risk of green gentrification, especially within the southern and eastern US. This risk was notably higher within priority areas to restore across all regions. Conservation practitioners must acknowledge that NbS restoration projects can both improve human well-being and have unintended consequences for local communities. New urban green areas have been associated with declines in populations of People of Color, indicating that in some cases, ecosystem restoration or natural climate solutions/NbS resilience projects may cause unintended consequences for vulnerable communities64. The risk of displacement may be highest in areas vulnerable to climate change (e.g. high sea-level rise risk areas), especially close to downtown locations and near active transportation lines64,65. The focus should be on identifying where urban neighborhoods align with areas for potential conservation and resiliency projects and working with local communities to understand where and how to undertake such efforts63. This includes identifying and implementing anti-displacement tools (e.g., community land trusts) to secure affordable housing in the vicinity of conservation projects and ensuring that conservation projects are desired by the local community prior to their commencement63,64.

While our findings and conclusions offer a quantitative framework of the ongoing challenges facing equitable conservation planning, we acknowledge that conservation planning inherently requires many subjective decisions, values, and objectives. Variation in input values or threshold choice can yield different priority areas. While we recognize this introduces bias, an assessment of that bias was not our goal, and several other studies have addressed the effects of different weighting, thresholds, and valuation schemes in conservation assessments66,67,68,69,70. In addition, we used commonly applied and recommended thresholds in all analyses (see Methods). Our approach exemplifies only one potential avenue for the strategic implementation of NbS under 30 × 30. Other approaches may consider terrestrial biodiversity, climate corridors, climate velocity metrics67, or different societal values (e.g., natural capital assets, cultural services71 or IPLCs that are nature dependent72 and could be affected by conservation actions. Thus, we offer our analysis as a starting point for the continued development of a socio-environmental approach to conservation planning designed to address the most pressing human and environmental crises of our time.

Here, we provide a spatial framework for integrating values of both conservation and human communities within the context of NbS focused, area-based conservation41. To stabilize and reverse the biodiversity and climate crises, places of high value for birds that align with ecosystem carbon storage and sequestration are recommended as high priority for NbS conservation actions, particularly those located within High Priority NbS Areas. Yet, we recognize that local communities may be at odds with these identified priorities, especially those dependent on the land for their livelihoods and cultural practices. In such cases, conservation planning should account for the needs of the community and the desired conservation outcomes56,73, and should include ethical conservation triage practices. As progress is made towards 30 × 30 goals, the most successful conservation plans will promote human well-being alongside actions that restore and conserve nature and help stabilize our climate. We must shift away from historical practices that have excluded Indigenous communities for the sake of “protection” and perpetuated green gentrification that marginalizes people with low socioeconomic status (largely Black and Brown populations). Ongoing and future conservation within the current global context must be strategic, and ambitious, but also intentional and inclusive, ensuring local communities and conservation practitioners work together towards mutual goals.

We identified NbS priorities, or areas of opportunity to benefit biodiversity, climate mitigation, and human communities. Key terms and definitions for each are provided in Supplementary Table S1. These refer to areas identified by our method as priorities, a definition commonly used in literature on spatial prioritization for biodiversity conservation (see citations, all of which refer to areas identified by their methods as “priorities” or “priority areas”)42,66,67,74. These areas are a function of our analytical decisions and objectives and thus do not represent the only priorities to be considered in 30 × 30 conservation planning. First, to identify areas that meet dual conservation targets for both birds and carbon (BC priorities), we mapped Existing NbS Areas, or areas of high carbon storage and active carbon sinks that align spatially with Climate Strongholds, which we defined as areas important for birds today and under future climate change scenarios. We defined these NbS alignment areas as Bird and Carbon priority areas to maintain, where protection or sustainable management and conservation actions should be implemented to protect key carbon stores and sinks in areas of high value to birds (Fig. 1). We also identified Potential NbS Areas, or areas with high potential to act as carbon sinks if anthropogenic disturbance is minimized, which align with Vulnerable Climate Strongholds, defined as Climate Strongholds at high risk of conversion or with currently high levels of conversion and degradation. We refer to these NbS areas of alignment as Bird and Carbon priorities to restore, where restoration has the highest potential to improve carbon storage, sequestration, and bird habitat (Fig. 1). Together, these areas were identified as Bird and Carbon priorities (BC priorities). Next, we assessed the alignment of these BC priorities with spatial data on marginalized communities across the US to identify areas where conservation efforts could simultaneously benefit biodiversity, climate change, and equitable human well-being, and designated these areas Bird, Carbon, and Human priorities (BCH priorities; Fig. 1). These areas provide the greatest NbS co-benefit value. Here we identify opportunities to address human well-being by focusing on socially vulnerable communities, based on socio-economic considerations in addition to having at least one more inequity indicator in the following categories: climate change, pollution, health, and access to nature. Next, we assessed how these NbS priorities intersect with IPLCs, defined here as Indigenous peoples, and non-Indigenous communities with land-dependent livelihoods or cultural importance indicated by a prevalence of employment in the natural resources industry and lower-income urban households prone to displacement due to green gentrification (BC + IPLCs priorities and BCH + IPLCs priorities). The spatial analyses used to identify BC and BCH priorities were conducted using R statistical language (version R-4.1.3)75. Finally, we differentiated regions of the highest conservation priority to better support conservation decision-making by intersecting BC priority areas with areas of high irrecoverable carbon density (see High Priority NbS Areas, data description below). We defined these as High Priority NbS Areas, and provided a breakdown of BC, BCH, BC + IPLCs, and BCH + IPLCs that occur within the overlapping area. Irrecoverable carbon has elevated importance for climate mitigation and Nbs actions, as these locations host key carbon stores under direct human influence that, if lost, could not be recovered in a meaningful timeframe for addressing climate impacts40.

We identified Climate Strongholds and Vulnerable Climate Strongholds for birds in 17 biogeographical groups as per69 using an optimization approach implemented with Zonation conservation planning software76. Birds were represented by previously published species distribution models developed by Bateman et al.11 at a 1-km resolution across North America for a baseline period (1981–2010) and for three future time periods (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. For a list of species associated with each biogeographical group, please see Supplementary Table S2. The 17 biogeographical groups were based on habitat affiliations for 557 bird species (see Supplementary Table S2) and NbS focus areas11, as per15,69 for seven ecosystems (forests, grasslands and rangelands, aridlands, interior wetlands, coastal wetlands, tundra, and urban and suburban systems) across four major regions of the continental US (eastern, central, western, and Alaska). For each biogeographical region (e.g. eastern forests), we calculated the spatial extent of each ecosystem in each time period based on both current and future land cover projections that incorporated climate change, sea level rise, and human population growth77,78,79,80,81,82,83.

We represented each species by its predicted suitability above a species-specific threshold as per11,69 and included projections from both breeding and nonbreeding seasons and all time periods under an ensemble of 15 GCMs as input features in Zonation. Following prior work to develop climate-informed bird prioritizations e.g.,1,69, we used the Core Area Zonation algorithm to rank the landscape based on current and future climate suitability for birds, habitat availability, and landscape condition. For all ecosystems we used the Global Human Modification Index84 to represent degradation due to human activities. For forests, we also incorporated the Forest Landscape Integrity Index85 by selecting the maximum value between the two indices to identify the greatest disturbance threat. We used the inverse of the index to represent landscape condition (i.e., high degradation = poor condition). We limited condition layers to the extent of each biogeographical group for each time-period, and associated species layers with the corresponding condition layer from each time-period using Zonation's grouping function to capture habitat quality and availability. We used Zonation's ecological interactions function to downweight locations farther than a species' natal dispersal capacity for each time period1,86,87,88 up-weighted at-risk species (derived from NABCI conservation status scores and climate vulnerability scores; see Supplementary Table S2)11 and weighted present and near-future predictions higher than late-century predictions to address the increasing uncertainty of climate change projections over time89. To ensure that opportunities for conservation under 30 × 30 encompass ecologically distinct regions and are available across the continental U.S., we stratified rankings either by watershed boundaries (for coastal wetlands) or Bird Conservation Regions (for all other habitat groups; BCRs), the latter being distinct ecological regions with similar bird communities, habitats, and conservation issues90.

To identify Climate Strongholds, we selected the core (top 20%) and supporting biodiversity areas (top 40%-top 20%) of the landscape ranking91,92 within each ecosystem (with the exception of (sub)urban where we used the core area (20%) due to the broad footprint of this system and generalist nature of species included). We selected the top 20 and 40% thresholds as they have been shown to be robust thresholds that capture more individuals per species than areas of lower priority91,92. These top areas were predicted to have high climate suitability for birds and low human modification at present and/or under future climate change scenarios. To identify Vulnerable Climate Strongholds, we included both (1) areas not identified as Climate Strongholds but ranked in the top 40% of the prioritization when landscape condition was not considered (i.e., areas that have high climate suitability for birds but have been exposed to high amounts of human modification) and (2) areas in the top 40% of the difference between rankings with and without landscape condition (i.e., areas with the greatest potential to increase their value to birds if landscape condition was restored).

To identify existing and potential carbon priority areas, we identified locations with active (i.e., areas that currently function as significant carbon stores or sinks) and potential (i.e., areas that could have high carbon sequestration value if disturbance is minimized) carbon mitigation capacity. We used datasets from the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) model to map carbon storage and flux (i.e., sequestration rate, or the annual amount of carbon exchange between an ecosystem and the atmosphere) in the contiguous US93. To map areas of high carbon storage, we used Total Ecosystem Carbon (TEC) from the latest year available (2015), which measures aboveground and belowground carbon up to two meters. To map areas of high carbon sequestration, we used Net Biome Productivity (NBP), which measures the realized annual rate of carbon exchange, incorporating human and natural disturbances. To identify areas with high potential for increased carbon sequestration, we mapped annual Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP), or carbon flux in the hypothetical absence of natural or human disturbance, and calculated the difference between NBP and NEP. We recognize this may overestimate the area with potential for increased carbon sequestration given some ecosystems require natural disturbances; however, data distinguishing natural and anthropogenic carbon losses were not available.

To map carbon storage and flux in Alaska, we used data from the Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning (SNAP) program based on the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model simulations for Alaska and Northwestern Canada, averaged during 2001-201094.

We summarized flux rates across the lower 48 from 1980 to 2015 to obtain the average and maximum sequestration rate over time (measured in tons of carbon per year). We summarized high and low estimates of flux rates, calculated as the difference between carbon sequestration continuing at average historical rates from 1980 to 2015 (low) versus maximum historical rates (high).

To calculate flux rates in Alaska, we subtracted heterotrophic respiration (HR) from vegetation Net Primary Productivity (NPP) to obtain NEP (net flux without accounting for loss due to disturbance (C/m2/yr). To calculate NBP (gC/m2/yr), we subtracted emissions due to disturbance (fire emissions from organic layer and vegetation burning) from NEP. Total carbon was calculated by summing the decadal average of soil and vegetation carbon pools (gC/m2).

We extracted carbon estimates within the biogeographical extent of the Climate Strongholds for each of the 17 biogeographical groups. We included all areas also mapped in the corresponding IBIS time series dataset of the dominant land cover class (i.e., forests, grasslands and rangelands, and aridlands) to ensure the carbon data aligned with the appropriate habitat. Existing NbS areas included areas in the top 20% of TEC for each ecosystem or that had a positive flux based on NBP, indicating these areas currently have high carbon storage capacity or are actively sequestering more carbon than they emit. We chose the 20% threshold for carbon to be comparable, and for assessing potential spatial overlap, with our Climate Strongholds, based on best practices in prioritization assessments looking at multiple conservation values17,95,96. Potential carbon priority areas included areas where NEP was greater than NBP, indicating these areas could sequester more carbon if disturbance was minimized. We did not adjust carbon sequestration estimates for albedo, but acknowledge that in some ecosystems, especially high latitude conifer forests, reduced albedo can lead to a warming effect that offsets carbon storage benefits97.

Within each ecosystem, we identified NbS priorities as Bird and Carbon priorities to maintain (BC priorities, maintain), where Climate Strongholds overlap with Existing Carbon Priority Areas (Fig. 1). We considered these areas to have the greatest conservation benefit as they simultaneously help birds adapt to climate change while mitigating further carbon emissions. We also identified Bird and Carbon priorities to restore (BC priorities, restore) where Vulnerable Climate Strongholds aligned with Potential Carbon Priority Areas (Fig. 1). In Alaska, we only calculated BC priorities to maintain due to lack of available carbon data incorporating human disturbance. We merged each ecosystem level BC priority layer across the US into a single layer of priorities to maintain and a single layer of priorities to restore. We then overlaid BC maintain and restore priorities to create a single layer of BC priorities. As there was some overlap among habitats, any overlap between priorities to maintain and restore were considered priorities to maintain so as not to double count areas. Lastly, we assessed the current protected status within the different priorities within the context of US progress towards meeting the area-based conservation goal under 30 × 30.

We included five indicators of inequitable human well-being (hereafter “inequity indicators”) to identify where BC priorities aligned with opportunities for establishing equitable outcomes for human communities. We considered locations to have opportunities for improving equitable human well-being (hereafter “priorities for human well-being”) if communities were identified as socially vulnerable based on socio-economic considerations98 in addition to having at least one more inequity indicator in the following categories: climate change, pollution, health, and access to nature99. We obtained social data for human well-being from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) PLACES database100 and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)98 which considers socio-economic status, household composition and disability, minority status and language barriers, housing type and transportation availability, the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) beta version of their Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST)99 and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) environmental justice screening and mapping tool, EJScreen101. Data from these sources come from a range of multi-year estimates (i.e., American Community Survey 2014–2018 and 2015–2019 estimates), analyses, and collection years that fell within 2014–2021. In addition, health inequity indicators were based on 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System community surveys that assessed both the present status of individuals (i.e., physical inactivity and mental health as of 2019) and health history of individuals (e.g., history of heart disease and diabetes throughout the individual's lifetime). All our human well-being analyses were calculated within 2010 US Census Tract units (hereafter, “communities”).

To identify priorities for human well-being, we applied the methodologies used by the EPA and CEQ to highlight disadvantaged communities which they define as communities that are both (1) at or above the 65th national percentile for SVI, and (2) at or above the 80th national percentile for one (or more) inequity indicators. These thresholds were set by the EPA and the CEQ and are recommended to be used with their data products.

We created a health inequity indicator, which considered the four health conditions (crude prevalence of asthma, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and low life expectancy which were included in CEJST and two additional health conditions from the PLACES database: the prevalence of physical inactivity and poor mental health. We added the latter two conditions because physical activity and mental health have been directly linked to access to greenery and outdoor spaces102. If a community was ranked within the 80th percentile (as per EPA, see above) for any of these six health conditions, the tract was classified as having a health inequity.

To create a pollution inequity indicator, we combined several CEJST environmental burden indicators that focused on sources of pollution and non-clean infrastructure. These CEJST indicators were obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) EJSCREEN environmental indicators101. Communities were classified as having this indicator if they were above the 80th percentile for any of the following conditions: wastewater discharge, proximity to hazardous waste facilities, Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) sites, Risk Management Plan (RMP) sites, diesel particulate matter (PM) exposure, traffic proximity and volume, or PM 2.5 in the air.

To create an indicator of climate change risk inequity, we kept the same indicators used to measure climate burdens in CEJST: a community was classified as having climate inequities if it was within the 80th percentile for expected agricultural, building, or population losses due to natural hazards103. For an access to nature indicator, we intersected census tracts with the US Protected Areas Database (PADUS version 2.1)104 to identify communities without access to land formally protected for biodiversity (i.e., census tracts that did not intersect areas listed as GAP status 1–2 and Open Access in PADUS)104.

To identify BCH priorities, areas where priorities for birds, carbon, and human well-being overlapped, we intersected our priorities for human well-being with our BC priorities.

We focused on IPLCs, a subset of human communities having the potential to be negatively affected by protected area designations and other conservation actions, given these communities depend on the land for cultural preservation and livelihoods. Such communities include those of Indigenous peoples, those with a high percentage of their population employed in the natural resources industry, and marginalized and low-income urban communities who are particularly prone to displacement due to green gentrification. Green gentrification is a complex issue, but a large component of long-term displacement is increased housing costs associated with green infrastructure63. Despite the variation in land-dependencies existing within and between these three groups (e.g., economic living standards, subsistence living, health and wellness, culture, and spirituality), all of these dependencies are linked to overall human well-being and are reasons for mandating the inclusion of these communities in land management decisions105,106.

For our IPLCs considerations, we used several data sources and retained our 80th percentile threshold for consistency with our inequity indicators. For the Indigenous land indicator, we identified communities intersecting Indigenous land boundaries from the US Census Bureau's 2019 National American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian Areas (AIANNH) dataset107. These boundaries represent federally recognized American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, state-recognized American Indian reservations, and state designated tribal areas. For the natural resources industry indicator, we included communities within the 80th percentile for the percent of their working population in the natural resources industry from the US Census Bureau's 2016–2020 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates of Selected Economic Characteristics108. Natural resources industries include agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and mining. Finally, for the green gentrification indicator, we included communities within urbanized area boundaries classified by the 2010 US Census109 that were also in the 80th percentile for the housing cost burden variable used in CEJST. Housing cost burden is the percent of households in each tract earning < 80% of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Area Median Family Income by county110 and are spending > 30% of their income on housing costs.

To identify priorities that may require IPLCs engagement in conservation planning, we identified communities having at least one IPLCs indicator (i.e., Indigenous land, natural resource industry, or green gentrification). We intersected these communities with our BC priorities and our BCH priorities and refer to these coincident areas as BC + IPLCs priorities and BCH + IPLCs priorities, respectively.

To assess protected status for all priorities, we used GAP status, a measure of intent to conserve biodiversity classified as follows: GAP 1–2 are under permanent protection for conservation, GAP 3 is under protection but allows multiple uses and extraction, and GAP 4 has no known legal conservation mandate. Here, we classify GAP 1 and 2 lands as highly protected, given the mandate to protect biodiversity and natural land cover and exclude human resource extraction22,66,111. USGS Gap Analysis Project, 2018). Gap 3 and 4 designated lands as they currently are managed may be inadequate to conserve lands in a way that maintains biodiversity, carbon mitigation values, and/or support human well-being22. However, Gap 3 and 4 lands have the potential to be beneficial to biodiversity, climate mitigation value, and human well-being with some adjustments, such as changes in management practices, restoration efforts, and/or increased access to nature23.

We flattened the PADUS GAP status data layer104 across overlapping areas by retaining the highest level of protection for each area (i.e., the lowest GAP score), following methods in Dreiss & Malcom23 and considered non-PADUS lands as GAP 4 since their protected status is unknown. Although we designate GAP 4 as “unprotected”, we acknowledge these areas may have local mandates or private land ownership and management that are not captured by PADUS. We calculated the percent of the total land area within the continental US, within sub-national regions determined by the US Global Change Research Program (National Climate Assessment Regions (NCA4)112 and within the identified areas for each of our priorities classified as GAP 1–3.

To identify High Priority NbS Areas that, if lost, would have the greatest negative impact relative to carbon storage, we identified Bird and Carbon Priority Areas with the highest levels of irreplaceable carbon reserves. We accessed high value irrecoverable carbon density from Noon et al.40. Irrecoverable carbon is defined as ecosystem carbon reserves that: (1) would not recover by mid-century if lost, (2) would benefit from human management, and (3) are vulnerable to land-use conversion40. Therefore, losing carbon in these areas would negatively impact our capacity to prevent worse-case scenario climate impacts. We did not include irrecoverable carbon as our original carbon dataset as it only covers areas that are ‘within ecosystems that are within human purview to manage'40 and thus did not give us full spatial coverage to identify areas of priority for carbon or biodiversity across the full continental US.

We clipped the global map of irrecoverable carbon to the continental US and calculated the median pixel value based on this extent (median value, 22 MgC \(\:{\text{h}\text{a}}^{-1}\)). We then extracted all pixel values above the median, creating a layer with the upper 50% of irrecoverable carbon areas in the continental US. We used this layer as a mask applied to the Bird and Carbon Priority Areas, with all data within the mask representing the priority areas with the highest amount of irrecoverable carbon. We then categorized this layer by Bird and Carbon Priority type and calculated total acreages. The resulting map depicts High Priority NbS Areas across the continental US.

“The seven-year-old cacao tree (Theobroma cacao) that I'm inspecting in this photo is part of the Model Cocoa Orchard established by the University of the West Indies' Cocoa Research Centre (CRC), where I work as a food-technology researcher. My colleagues and I use this 1,500-tree orchard in Valsayn, a town in the north of the island of Trinidad, to better understand cocoa production.

My research focuses on the fermentation of cacao beans, a process that is carried out mainly at a small scale on local farms. Cacao trees produce fruit pods, which are harvested and broken open to release the pulp-covered beans. I'm holding one here. The acidity, sweetness and floral flavour vary from pod to pod. It's the pulp that acts as the fuel for the microorganisms that drive the beans' fermentation.

The chemical changes that occur over about a week remove the beans' bitterness and turn them red-brown, but only after roasting do they gain their chocolate flavour. The success of the fermentation process is dependent on climate. And with weather patterns becoming less predictable, the quality of the beans has started to decline. We have started to experiment with manipulating sucrose and water levels at the start of fermentation, and we are also using other techniques to tweak the process.

The pseudogap state of high-temperature superconducting cuprates, known for its partial gapping of the Fermi surface above the superconducting transition temperature, is believed to hold the key to understanding the origin of Planckian relaxation and quantum criticality. However, the nature of the Fermi surface in the pseudogap state has remained a fundamental open question. Here we report the observation of the Yamaji effect, which appears as a peak in the c-axis resistivity at a specific angle of the applied magnetic field, in angle-dependent magnetoresistivity measurements above the critical temperature in the cuprate HgBa2CuO4+δ. The observation of the Yamaji peak is evidence for small Fermi-surface pockets in the normal state of the pseudogap phase. The small size of the pockets, each estimated to occupy only 1.3% of the Brillouin zone area, is not expected given the absence of long-range broken translational symmetry.

Magnetoresistivity field sweeps underlying the θ dependence plots in Figs. 1 and 2. a–c show magnetoresistivity for the magnetic field tilted into ϕ = 0°, 23∘, and 45∘ respectively. T = 85 K.

Source data

a–d, Magnetoresistivity field sweeps underlying the ϕ dependence plots in Fig. 3b, covering approximately 180∘ angular range. θ = 90∘ for all curves, corresponding to magnetic field applied in the plane. Lower panels are the derivative with respect to field, showing a crossover to linear magnetoresistance in all curves. T = 85 K.

Source data

a, Measured Vx and Vy of the lock-in voltage corresponding to θ dependence of magnetoresistance at ϕ = 0∘. The out-of-phase component Vy is much smaller than the in-phase component Vx of the detected voltage. b, Representative field dependence of measured voltage comparing up (dots) and down (line) sweeps of the pulsed field. The two fall on top of each other except for a large spike starting around B ≈ 25 T on the upsweep due to the firing of the insert. Only down sweep data were analyzed and presented in the main text. c, Pulsed field profile of the 75 Tesla Duplex magnet.

a, Planar cross-sections of model Fermi surfaces. The grey curve is the large Fermi surface expected for 1 + p carriers in Hg120132,33. The Fermi surface cross sections were generated with the function \({k}_{\parallel }({\phi }_{k})=[1+\beta \cos (m{\phi }_{k})]{k}_{o}\) following ref. 30. ϕk is the azimuthal angle of the Fermi momentum. m = 4 for planar tetragonal symmetry. β controls the deviation from a circular shape. For the small Fermi pockets ko = 0.15 Å−1 and β = 0, 0.05 and 0.4 for the circle, diamond, and ‘+' shaped Fermi surfaces respectively. b, Calculated Yamaji angles θYamaji as a function of ϕ30, with simple sinusoidal warping. Colors are matched to the corresponding Fermi surfaces shown in panel a. θYamaji was obtained for each ϕ by finding the zeros of the lowest order corrections to an un-warped Fermi surface cross-sectional area30:\(A={J}_{0}(\kappa )+{A}_{2}\cos (m\phi )\), where A2 = β(−1)m/2[(1 + m)Jm(κ) − κJm+1(κ)]. Jm(κ) are the Bessell functions of the mth kind, \(\kappa ={\rm{c}}{k}_{o}\tan (\theta )\), c is the c-axis lattice parameter. Finally, m and ko matches the values used to generate the specific Fermi surface cross-sections in a. The Yamaji condition for the leading term J0(κ) = 0 yields the relationship for the Yamaji peak used in the main text, \({\theta }_{{\rm{Yamaji}}}=\arctan [3\pi /(4c{k}_{o})]\) with ko replaced with kcal. The second term, which accounts for a non-circular cross-section, yields a relatively small \(\cos (m\phi )\) modulation about the first term. Therefore, our experimentally determined θYamaji constrains the size of the pocket with tetragonal (or higher, since the same argument holds for m = 6, 8, …) symmetry to the average Fermi momentum ko. The large Fermi surface has θYamaji ≈ 20∘, grey curve, that is clearly inconsistent with observations.

a, Simulated θ dependence of the magnetoresistivity δρc(θ), with ωcτ = 2.6, for each of the two orthogonally oriented ellipses (red and blue, see inset for schematic of the Fermi pockets color coded to match the curves) and the resultant combined contribution to δρc(θ) of both sets of pockets (grey). The plotted combined δρc(θ) curve includes an additional factor of two for easy comparison. For ϕ = 0∘, δρc(θ) is identical for the two sets of pockets. b, For ϕ = 23∘, δρc(θ) of each ellipse are no longer the same. While the Yamaji peak of the red curve is clearly discernible, the Yamaji effect manifests only as a broad kink in the blue curve. The θYamaji of the two ellipse orientations are displaced such that the Yamaji peaks interfere destructively and is unobservable in the combined δρc(θ) (grey). c, For ϕ = 4∘ the Yamaji peak of the red curve is sufficiently displaced from the kink in the blue curve such that the Yamaji effect is discernible as a small bump in the combined δρc(θ) (grey).

a, Magnetoresistivity δρc as a function θ for ϕ = 0∘, 23∘ and 45∘. b, Simulations for a reconstructed Fermi surface resulting from bi-axial charge-density-wave previously studied at low temperatures (T ≲ 4 K)12,39,40 This pocket has four-fold planar symmetry in agreement with the symmetry of the measured linear slope of magnetoresistivity a1(ϕ) for in-plane fields, but it cannot capture the observed evolution of the Yamaji effect shown in panel a. c & d, Simulations for slight variations of the curvature of the reconstructed CDW pocket, while keeping the enclosed area of the pocket the same. The insets shows a closeup of the reconstructed pocket (reproduced from panel b inset) in blue and the modified pocket in red. Experimentally, the Yamaji peak for ϕ = 0∘ is more pronounced than that for ϕ = 45∘. The opposite is always found for simulations of the CDW pocket.

a, Close up of the Yamaji peak in δρc(θ) at ϕ = 0∘. It is compared to calculations from our model with varying ωcτ shown in panels b–d.

Science under Siege: How to Fight the Five Most Powerful Forces that Threaten Our World Michael E. Mann & Peter J. Hotez PublicAffairs (2025)

Months into President Trump's second term, science and scientists are under attack as never before in the United States. The administration is forcing devastating cuts to previously stable US research investments, dismantling federal science agencies and programmes, ousting independent scientific officials and blatantly disregarding evidence on issues that affect us all, including vaccines, air pollution and fossil fuels.

‘Now is not the time for despair' — how scientists can take a stand against political interference

‘Now is not the time for despair' — how scientists can take a stand against political interference

The scientific community needs to recognize these trends and fight back in every way possible. The timely release of Science under Siege by paediatrician and vaccine specialist Peter Hotez and climate scientist Michael Mann is a welcome addition to the scientific community's arsenal. Both authors work to dispel misinformation in the public and political arenas, and both have experienced personal attacks because of it.

Mann, known for his ‘hockey stick' visual representation of soaring global average temperatures owing to climate change, has faced years of public disparagement and threats to his physical safety. Hotez found himself in the crosshairs of the politicization of public-health guidance, on vaccines in particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic — and had to hire private security. Together, they explore the forces that undermine science in the United States and beyond.

The duo skilfully establishes parallels in the attacks on climate scientists and on public-health professionals. The two fields might seem disparate, but specialists in both share a responsibility to inform the public about the “one-two punch of climate change and pandemics” — the effects of which are mutually reinforcing to “threaten massive loss in human life” — and find solutions.

Who is on RFK Jr's new vaccine panel — and what will they do?

Who is on RFK Jr's new vaccine panel — and what will they do?

In some cases, Mann and Hotez note, the same tactics are used in attempts to discredit their work in both fields — sometimes even by the same people. For example, climate-disinformation messaging morphed over several years from ‘it's not real' to ‘it's actually good for us'. These same tactics were adopted by peddlers of COVID-19 misinformation, who claimed that widespread infection could lead to herd immunity, and caught on much faster, mere months after the virus began spreading.

But who's behind the lies, propaganda and attacks? Mann and Hotez identify five forces — the ‘five Ps' — that drive threats to science and scientists: plutocrats, petrostates, pros (that is, academics and specialists who use their credentials to promote disingenuous, and lucrative, contrarian views), propagandists and the press. Mann and Hotez detail how bad actors continue to propagate misinformation, persecute scientists, undermine science-based decisions from policymakers and the public and threaten global health and safety.

As the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists — a science-advocacy non-profit organization that spends its time fighting these known enemies — I found this thorough naming and shaming resonant and indeed cathartic. I imagine that this exploration of just how pervasive and well-funded these forces are might also bring relief to scientists wondering why their commitment to truth-telling isn't enough.

For years, I thought equity in science was possible. I believed it in meeting rooms to which I had been invited to speak, until I realized that I had not been invited to shape the discussion. I believed it in working groups that applauded diversity, until I noticed that my ideas only landed when echoed by someone else. And international organizations regularly sought me out, but it was hardly ever for a leadership role.

Academia needs a more honest, scientific approach to DEI

Academia needs a more honest, scientific approach to DEI

In 2021, I proposed ways to build healthier collaborations between countries with unequal resources: currently they benefit mainly the wealthier partner (D. Armenteras Nature Ecol. Evol. 5, 1193–1194; 2021). The article resonated with scientists across Latin America, Africa and Asia, who thanked me for exposing these skewed partnerships. But what also stood out to me was that none of the committees and organizations that had so often solicited my input got in touch.

Many scholars from historically overexploited countries (often referred to as the global south) expected that exposing the problem would trigger change. Four years on, I see it clearly: the scientific system was never designed for equity. For people whose privilege stems from geography, institutional reputation and inherited networks, the system works perfectly the way it is. That's why institutions focus only on improved access and optics. They look like they are changing, but the same people retain control.

I still believe in science and in justice. But I no longer think that power can be shared equitably in the current system. In 2023, I was invited to contribute to a global map charting the use of controlled fire in ecosystem management. This meant condensing 25 years of research into a 40-minute questionnaire for a chance to win an artwork made by an Indigenous artisan and, perhaps, be invited to a workshop. It was written in Spanish and framed as inclusive. But it exposed how the system works: extract specialist knowledge at low cost and mostly without giving credit, repackage it into global claims and call it collaboration. I declined.

Decolonize scientific institutions, don't just diversify them

Decolonize scientific institutions, don't just diversify them

In 2025, I was invited to contribute to a project developing a global standard for gathering fire data. It used all the right words: co-production, inclusion and diversity. It cited my work. But I wasn't being invited to co-design or co-lead the project, or even as a peer — only to “contribute regional input”. Time commitment: less than 20 hours. Visibility: none. Influence: symbolic. When I declined, explaining my reasons, I received two replies. One was defensive: “You know I'd never reach out with a symbolic request,” sidestepping my actual concerns. The other was polite, affirming the project's importance but failing to address its asymmetry. Neither academic offered co-authorship or fresh terms. Nothing changed. These weren't bad people. That's the hardest part. They were playing by the rules of a system that rewards extractive collaboration — especially when it's wrapped in the language of equity.

The system doesn't thrive just because of the people at the top. It holds strong because many scientists in less-privileged positions want to be included. Sometimes we are chosen — not for our ideas or our leadership, but because we tick the right box. A woman from Latin America, visible and qualified. But we don't become a peer. Our work is not cited as often. Our students become local guides instead of co-authors. Grants continue to be written without us.

Everyone has dirty ears; the human ear is designed to produce earwax to protect itself from other junk getting in there, among other things. That means that the more you put your precious new AirPods Pro in your ear holes, the dirtier they are likely to get.

So what's the best way to clean out all the gunk? Read below to learn how to clean your earbuds and over-ear headphones, as well as other ways to rehab an old pair.

Looking for headphones? Be sure to check out our guides to the Best Wireless Headphones, the Best Wireless Earbuds, the Best Cheap Headphones, Best Workout Headphones, and the Best Gaming Headsets.

Believe it or not, the best thing I have found to clean earbuds (and phone jacks) is a soft-bristle brush like a toothbrush ($8 for six). Use this dry at first, and with a little bit of distilled and deionized water ($17 per gallon) or isopropyl alcohol ($10 for 32 oz) if anything is too stubborn to get out of the ear holes. Make sure to dry your earbuds with a microfiber cloth after.

If you have something large stuck in your buds, feel free to use a toothpick or loop tool to try to get it out. My favorite tools are these pop-out tools ($4) with metal nibs that let you snag tough wax and gunk.

Most modern earbuds have an IP rating, which means they are relatively dust- and waterproof; you can typically run water over them and wipe them off with a towel to dry them if you have any gunk on the exterior of your buds. For over-ear headphones, I'd try to keep them as dry as possible when cleaning, but using a wet rag or brush to clean them shouldn't be a major issue, as long as you avoid areas like charging ports.

Most brands, Apple included, offer replacement eartips and pads for their headphones, which can really make an older pair feel new again, especially if the foam is collapsed and dirty. I recommend changing pads as soon as you notice extra pressure or a lack of quality sound isolation. Eartips I just replace as they get deformed over time, or as I lose one.

Proton VPN (2-Year)

Windscribe (Free)

Surfshark (2-Year)

There are literally hundreds of VPNs floating around. They all want you to believe they're the best VPN you can buy. All of them say they have the biggest network, or claim they have a no-logging policy. And they all promise your internet traffic is safe on the network of servers they've rented. Only some of them are telling the truth.

VPNs are only growing in popularity due to age-verification laws in the UK and in several states in the US. Even if you don't want a VPN, you might need one. If you're hesitant, I get it. VPN providers have been deep in murky waters for years, constantly caught lying about their practices, handing over user data that was never supposed to be logged, and serving as safe havens for large cybercriminal organizations.

I wanted to find the VPN services that actually work; the ones that keep their promises even in the face of potential prosecution, and the ones that have a proven track record of reliable performance. Some of the picks in this guide aren't conventional, and some of the services I suggest you avoid might be controversial. But these are the top VPNs I'd use day-to-day.

Read our other VPN guides, including how to set up a VPN on your router and how to use a VPN to watch Netflix when you travel abroad.

How Much Do VPNs Cost?

There's a broad range of prices for VPN services, but most providers sit somewhere around $10 per month for a monthly plan. That number changes if you purchase several months at once, and it's even more obfuscated with full security suites, such as those offered by Nord Security and Proton.

Most of the prominent VPN services you'll come across offer multi-month, or even multi-year, discounts. These plans are often the best way to get your foot in the door, but recently, some VPNs have faced class-action lawsuits in regards to their auto-renewal practices. Although a handful of lawsuits have been filed, that doesn't mean these services necessarily engaged in illegal practices.

Free VPNs exist, as well, but you should avoid most of them. Some restrictive free plans from Proton and Windscribe are useful, but you should handle most free VPNs with skepticism.

What Does a VPN Do? And How Does It Work?

VPN stands for virtual private network. A VPN provides a tunnel that all of your internet traffic passes through. Instead of connecting to the servers of your internet service provider, you connect to a server in the VPN's network before connecting to the broader internet. Due to how most VPNs services operate, your browsing data isn't stored, essentially making you anonymous online.

The linchpin in this system is a VPN protocol. Today, nearly all internet traffic is encrypted, but that encryption only happens once you've established a connection with a website. A VPN protocol encrypts traffic before it heads off to the VPN server, which adds some extra security on untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport. It doesn't help much on your personal network unless someone is intruding on it.

Although VPNs are often marketed as security tools, they serve a better purpose for privacy and bypassing geo-restrictions. By anonymizing your traffic through a VPN server, your browsing can't be traced back to you. And, by routing your traffic through a server in another location, you can bypass geo-restrictions online, such as the content libraries available in different countries on Netflix.

VPN Terms and Features, Explained

You'll come across a few of these terms in this guide and as you generally shop for a VPN. Here's what they mean.

Double-hop: Connecting to two (or more) VPN servers in succession. This provides an extra layer of privacy if someone traces your network path, but it will vastly reduce speeds.

Split tunneling: Allows you to choose which apps use the VPN tunnel. Useful if you want some apps (like your browser) to use the VPN tunnel but not others.

Kill switch: A security feature in VPNs that will disable your internet connection if the VPN connection drops. A kill switch can avoid leaking internet traffic in the event of a VPN failure.

IP and domain block list: A list of IP addresses or domain names that are blocked inside the VPN tunnel. Some VPNs offer Domain Name System (DNS) blocking, too, which can block ads served from particular DNS servers.

Static IP: Most VPNs assign you a random IP address, or even rotate the IP address while you're connected. If you need external access to your network with a network-wide VPN, you'll need a static IP address.

Port forwarding: Allows you to forward a port on your private network, bypassing the VPN tunnel. Useful for instances where you need external network access with a network-wide VPN, such as running a media server.

NetShield: A feature specific to Proton VPN that blocks ads and trackers while connected to the VPN. Other services, such as Windscribe and NordVPN, offer similar features.

Dark web monitoring: A feature available in some VPNs, such as NordVPN and ProtonVPN, that will monitor the dark web for your email address or other personal information. You'll be notified if the information shows up on the dark web, or as part of a breach.

DAITA: A feature of Mullvad VPN that will introduce background noise to your connection, combating AI-assisted network analysis. Windscribe, NordVPN, and ProtonVPN have similar features available.

Are VPNs Illegal?

Short of a few exceptions, VPNs are legal around the world. That includes the US, UK, Canada, Australia, the EU, South Africa, and many countries in Central and South America. Countries such as North Korea and Turkmenistan have VPN bans in place, but due to the extreme censorship in those countries, it's hard to verify what laws are on the books (and how they're enforced). You can probably guess the North Korean government's stance on bypassing censorship, though.

For everyone else, the legality of VPNs only comes into play when it comes to what VPN you're using, and what you're using it for. Countries such as India and Russia call for compliance with the government, forcing providers like NordVPN to shut down servers in those regions. And, regardless of what country you're in, engaging in illegal activity while connected to a VPN is still illegal.

Proton

Proton VPN (2-Year)

Proton VPN (1-Year)

Proton VPN Plus is the best VPN you can buy. It's the fastest service I tested across the US and UK. It has a generous free plan if you'd like to try it out first. The features are unmatched, and the pricing is excellent, especially if you bundle Proton VPN with the company's other software (Proton Unlimited). After testing all of these services, Proton is what I personally use now.

What sent Proton over the edge was its commitment to transparency. It has maintained a transparency report since 2017, undergone third-party audits annually since 2022, and open-sourced its applications five years ago. That last bit is huge, as bugs within the application can pose a security risk, and handing those applications over to the open source community can surface those bugs much faster. There are no real compromises here, with features like split tunneling, port forwarding, and double-hop connections.

Proton is a rare example of a VPN service that gets it. Every VPN engages in the same marketing practices, touting their security, speed, and privacy. But Proton puts its money where its mouth is, all while offering a remarkably easy-to-use and feature-rich VPN application.

Windscribe

Windscribe (Free)

Windscribe (Pro, One-Year)

You should generally avoid free VPNs, but Windscribe's VPN service is one of the few worth considering. You get 10 GB of data across 10 server locations and unlimited connections, and you can even unlock more data if you refer friends or post on social media about Windscribe. There are a few similar offers from services like Proton, but Windscribe provides a pleasant on-ramp for subscribing.

You can build your own plan. Unlimited data runs an extra $3 per month, and you can add server locations for an extra $1 per server per month. It's fantastic. Most people don't need VPN servers in Ghana, Cambodia, and Peru, so rather than charge for all those locations, you can pick out your locations piecemeal. If you want everything, that's available at a discounted rate too.

The pricing model is what sets Windscribe apart, but it's an excellent VPN in its own right. It offers additional packet obfuscation to combat network analysis, and it's loaded with features like split tunneling and port forwarding. It's fast, too, dropping just 15.6 percent of my speed when connected in the US. Like the other providers I've included, Windscribe has undergone a third-party audit. But unlike the other options, it's also been taken to court. Windscribe CEO Yegor Sak was personally charged with a crime in Greece in relation to a user's activity on Windscribe-operated servers, essentially tying activity on the network to Sak personally. It was dismissed. VPNs are subpoenaed all the time, but the fact that Windscribe wasn't able to produce logs even when the CEO of the company was facing criminal prosecution speaks volumes.

Surfshark

Surfshark (2-Year)

Surfshark (1-Year)

I've used Surfshark personally for a few years, and I'd still be using it if Proton didn't impress me so much. Surfshark is dead simple to use. It pops up and connects before swiftly getting out of my way so I can get on with my day. If you spring for a two-year plan, it's cheap. You can score over two years for around $50 with the Starter plan.

If you want to dig in deeper, you can. Surfshark is one of the most feature-rich VPNs I've used, sporting the basics like a double-hop connection and split tunneling, as well as an ad blocker and email masking. Like Proton, Surfshark offers other security tools like antivirus and dark web monitoring if you pick up a more expensive plan.

Surfshark loses out just a bit when it comes to privacy, however. It has a no-logs policy, and it maintains a transparency report and a warrant canary, so there's no reason to suspect Surfshark is doing anything underhanded. But it doesn't have open source applications, nor does it offer anonymous payment methods. Those aren't big omissions for the vast majority of users, but if you need the utmost privacy, Proton or Mullvad (below) are better options.

Mullvad

Any VPN worth its salt claims a no-logs policy, but almost all of them keep some logs. Those logs shouldn't have anything to do with your browsing data, and they should be anonymized, but most VPNs need to at least keep logs of information like your email and payment method. But not Mullvad.

Mullvad doesn't do multi-year subscriptions, referral links, or social sign-on. You generate an account number to sign up, and you add time to that account with the payment method of your choice, including a credit card, PayPal, crypto, or cold, hard cash (via mail). If you want to go through the hassle, you can stay fully anonymous in the eyes of Mullvad. If that wasn't enough, Mullvad even claims it was raided by Swedish police and still didn't produce logs.

It's not as fast as Proton, Windscribe, or Surfshark, but it's not bad, either—around a 24 percent drop in the US compared to 19 percent with Surfshark—and it lacks some features like port forwarding. But the pricing is good at roughly $6 a month, depending on exchange rates (Mullvad charges a flat €5 regardless of location).

Mullvad is on the bleeding edge of privacy, too, building RAM-only servers starting in 2022 and introducing defense against AI-guided traffic analysis (DAITA) last year. DAITA protects against AI traffic analysis, introducing network noise and sending consistent packet sizes to obfuscate your encrypted traffic further.

NordVPN

NordVPN (2-Year)

NordVPN (1-Year)

NordVPN has a long history, and it's one of the most prominent VPN services on the market. It comes with one of the largest VPN networks available, enough features to make Surfshark blush, and decent (though not the best) speeds. It's a little more expensive than I'd hoped for, but that's the price you pay for such an extensive network and feature set.

Where NordVPN really excels is in media. Streaming providers like Netflix and HBO Max are privy to how VPNs circumvent geo-restrictions, and a small network means you're more likely to get blocked. The fact that NordVPN has such a large network gives it an edge in streaming and less sensitive online browsing. It really wins with its NordWhisper protocol. The company recommends using its WireGuard-based NordLynx protocol most of the time, but NordWhisper sacrifices a bit of speed to obfuscate VPN traffic further, getting around most blocks.

NordWhisper isn't made for normal streaming environments, but it's great to have on restrictive networks. If you're traveling internationally and using hotel Wi-Fi, for instance, NordWhisper can help circumvent VPN blocks. The company saw a minor breach in 2018 and stirred up controversy in 2022 with a subtle change in wording regarding cooperation with law enforcement. In both cases, it responded quickly and maintained transparency, so contrary to what you may have read, NordVPN is safe to use.

Private Internet Access (PIA) has a long history in the VPN space, and it's maintained a track record of defending user privacy—even in the face of actual criminal activity. In 2016, a criminal complaint was filed in Florida against Preston Alexander McWaters for threats made online. McWaters was eventually convicted and sentenced to 42 months in prison. Investigators traced the online threats back to PIA's servers and subpoenaed the company. As the complaint reads, “A subpoena was sent to [Private Internet Access] and the only information they could provide is that the cluster of IP addresses being used was from the east coast of the United States.” McWaters engaged in several other identifying activities, according to the complaint, but PIA wasn't among them. Despite such a clear view of a VPN provider upholding its no-logging policy, PIA didn't impress me during my tests. It's slightly more expensive than a lot of our top picks, and it delivered the worst speeds out of any VPN I tested, with more than a 50 percent drop on the closest US server. (Windscribe, for context, only dropped 15.6 percent of my speed.)

MysteriumVPN is the go-to dVPN, or decentralized VPN, as far as I can tell. The concept of a decentralized VPN has existed for a while, but it's really gained traction over the last couple of years. The idea is to have a network of residential IP addresses that make up the network, routing your traffic through normal IP addresses to get around the increasingly common block lists for VPN servers. Mysterium accomplishes this network with MystNodes. It's a crypto node. People buy the node to earn crypto, and they're put into the Mysterium network. It's not inherently bad, but routing your traffic through a single residential IP is a little worrisome. Even without the decentralized kick, Mysterium was slow, and it doesn't maintain any sort of privacy materials, be it a third-party audit, warranty canary, or transparency report.

PrivadoVPN is one of the popular options to recommend as a free VPN. It offers a decent free service, with a handful of full-speed servers and 10 GB of data per month. You'll have to suffer through four—yes, four—redirects begging you to pay for a subscription before signing up, but the free plan works. The problem is how new PrivadoVPN is. There's no transparency report or audit available, and although the speeds are decent, they aren't as good as Proton, Windscribe, or Surfshark. PrivadoVPN isn't bad, but it's hard to recommend when Proton and Windscribe exist with free plans that are equally as good.

Functionally, a VPN should do two things: keep your internet speed reasonably fast, and actually protect your browsing data. That's where I focused my testing. Extra features, a comfy UI, and customization settings are great, but they don't matter if the core service is broken.

Speed testing requires spot-checking, as the time of day, the network you're connected to, and the specific VPN server you're using can all influence speeds. Because of that, I always set a baseline speed on my unprotected connection directly before recording results, and I ran the test three times across both US and UK servers. With those baseline drops, I spot-checked at different times of the day over the course of a week to see if the speed decrease was similar.

Security is a bit more involved. For starters, I checked for DNS, WebRTC, and IP leaks every time I connected to a server using Browser Leaks. I also ran brief tests sniffing my connection with Wireshark to ensure all of the packets being sent were secured with the VPN protocol in use.

On the privacy front, the top-recommended services included on this list have been independently audited, and they all maintain some sort of transparency report. In most cases, there's a proper report, but in others, such as Windscribe, that transparency is exposed through legal proceedings.

Matthew Prince may not be a household name, but the world most certainly knows his work.

Prince is the cofounder and CEO of Cloudflare. Launched in 2010, the internet infrastructure company has found itself increasingly in the position of serving as the web's bodyguard. It filters out bad traffic, keeps sites safe, and stops them from crashing when too many people visit. Its tools defend against DDoS attacks. In 2017, Cloudflare made headlines when it dropped white supremacist site The Daily Stormer. (Maybe Prince's name is ringing a bell now?)

Cloudflare's severing of ties with The Daily Stormer marked a momentous shift, one that came after years of claiming a neutral stance. Prince continues to evolve the way Cloudflare works. In July, the company rolled out a new tool tasked with blocking unauthorized AI scraping. It effectively creates a pay-per-crawl model requiring AI platforms to shell out money if they want access to a site's content.

On this episode of The Big Interview, I talked to Prince about publishing, the old internet, and how his ideal version of the future web means that OpenAI just might become the Netflix of content.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

KATIE DRUMMOND: Good to have you here, Matthew.

MATTHEW PRINCE: Thanks for having me.

You should have been warned ahead of time, but you probably weren't. We always start these conversations with some rapid-fire questions. Think of it like a warmup.

Sort of like wind sprints or something.

Exactly. First, what's the most embarrassing thing that regularly shows up in your feeds?

Probably just all the political content. On X it's pretty embarrassing.

What can you teach me to do in two minutes or less? You don't actually have to teach me anything, but you need to commit that you could do it if you had to.

I am pretty good at simple card tricks, so I could teach you a card trick to impress your friends.

Oh, I like that. I like impressing people. Fiction or nonfiction?

I tend to read more nonfiction, but I'm happier when I'm reading fiction. So I try to force myself to read fiction. The trashier the better.

Alright, trashy fiction. What do your haters say about you?

Oh God, people talk about neo-Nazis surprisingly a lot with me because we either kick or don't kick them off our platform. So I think [they say] I am responsible for all the bad things that appear somewhere on the internet.

Inbox zero or inbox chaos?

Zero.

Same. OK, let's jump into it. Are you ready?

I am. Those were fun wind sprints. I enjoy that a lot more than, you know, high school PE.

We do our best. Now, I love to ask people a little bit about where they came from, how they got to where they are. So I'm going to do that before we really get into what's going on with Cloudflare right now.

The original name of Cloudflare was the only thing worse than Cloudflare, because [those syllables] are really hard for English speakers to say. We were going to be Project Web Wall.

Let's go back to where it started. Park City, Utah, where you grew up. You got your first computer. My understanding is you were 7. Were you always drawn to technology, even as a toddler, or was that sort of a lucky accident as far as gifts go?

I got it from my grandmother, who was just with it. Apple had just released the Apple II. There wasn't a ton of access to technology in the way that kids have it today. So everyone else had an Atari. Everyone else had a VHS player. We had a Betamax player. But the computer was really the first time that I dove in and it was like a duck to water. I loved it.

You majored in English, and you minored in computer science. Then you went to law school. What did you think you would end up doing?

I thought I was gonna be the in-house counsel for some cool tech company.

Oh, I like that.

I was good at computers as a kid, and the University of Utah had this incredible computer science program, and they did these continuing education courses and my mom would sign up. And then I'd do all the homework, basically. So by the time I got to college, I thought I was gonna study computer science. I took computer science 101 and I was so bored that an arrogant 17-, 18-year-old me was like, “There's nothing I can learn from this.”

So I switched my major to English literature. This is like '92 to '96. This was right as the internet was taking off. And I knew enough about it that I got hired to be one of the student network administrators on our campus and help build what was one of the first thousand websites. I felt like I was sort of there, but I was also kind of burned out from the whole thing.

I wrote my college thesis on why the internet was a fad.

No.

Yeah. It was pretty embarrassing. I predicted that search engines were gonna become political, that there would be a conservative one and a liberal one. That hasn't happened.

That's interesting considering what's happened with Cloudflare.

When I got to the end, I was pretty good at standardized tests, so I took the LSAT. Didn't know how to really get a job, so I ended up applying to law school, and I went to law school and in '96 being like, “Eh, this internet thing is a fad.”

Somewhere in between I took a year off to basically goof around and be a ski instructor. By the time I actually got to the first day of class, I realized two things: One, the internet was gonna be kind of a big deal. And the second thing was that within about three days of law school I was like, “I'm not sure I'm cut out for this.”

Oh.

I finally found a type of law that I thought was really interesting, which was securities law, basically taking companies public. I spent the summer of '99 working at a law firm in San Francisco. I worked on six IPOs in one summer. It was the dotcom boom. I was like, “This is really fun.”

I bet.

I thought, “I'll go, I'll do this for five years. I'll find a company that's really great, I'll help them get ready for their IPO, they'll hire me as their counsel.” I went back to school thinking that was what was going to happen in March of 2000. Then the bubble burst. The law firm called and said, “Hey, good news, bad news. The good news is you still have a job. Bad news is we don't need any more securities lawyers, but bankruptcy is basically the same thing …”

Oh no.

I just didn't want to do that. So I was crying in my beer with a young law-professor guy named Doug Liman, and he's like, “Hey, my brother's starting a B2B”—what we call a SaaS company today, although we didn't at the time, in the insurance industry, which I knew nothing about—“would you be interested? They'll match your salary and give you this thing called stock.” I was like, “Yeah, that sounds better than being a bankruptcy attorney.” So I did that, and it was a disaster.

That is a journey. There's been a lot written about Cloudflare's origins. But just so that people have a basic understanding, how would you describe the company's original mission, and how has that evolved?

I was super lost. I was working as a bartender. And somewhat to run away from the sort of familial obligation of taking over my father's restaurant business, I applied to business school, and that's where I met my cofounder Michelle. What we saw back in 2009 was that all of the world of software was moving to the cloud. So inevitably that would mean that the security and networking tools, the firewalls of the world, would move to the cloud. So the original idea of Cloudflare was: How can you take a firewall and put it in the cloud?

Makes sense.

The problem that we had was we knew that in order to be a successful business, we'd eventually have to sell to really big banks and health care companies and governments and things like that.

Right.

In order to do that, we had to have something that was valuable in order to generate something that's valuable. We actually had to have data. So being plucky business students, we thought, “Well, what if we made a sort of stripped-down, light version of the service and gave it away for free?”

That would allow us to gather a bunch of data that would be valuable for the firewall, for the big banks and things like that. At some level the whole story of Cloudflare is: If you take a firewall in the cloud and make it free, you create so many different problems. But in the process of solving all of those problems you build what Cloudflare is today, which is more than just a firewall in the cloud.

Tell me how you describe the company today, and then I wanna jump into why you've been in the news so much recently.

If I'm at a dinner party and you come up and ask me, “What do you do?” And I say, “I work for Cloudflare.” And they ask, “What does Cloudflare do?” I don't really want to talk to you much more. I say, “It makes the internet faster and protects it from bad guys,” and everyone's response to that is, “Oh, that's really nice.” And then they walk.

They're like, “Oh, sounds great.”

Yeah, “Thank you for doing that.” If I want to actually engage with someone, what I would say is, “When we wrote all the protocols for the internet in the '60s, '70s, and '80s, we had no idea what the internet was gonna become.”

If you go back and read the original proposal for DNS or BGP or these fundamental kinds of technologies of the internet, like there's a section often on security, and it says, “This section is intentionally left blank.” Right? So no one has actually done the work to do that. And that's true in security. It's true in reliability, it's true in performance. And so now that we know how important this is, how do we go back and redesign all of those fundamental things about the internet?

That's what motivates everyone at Cloudflare; that's what defines our roadmap. When we say we're trying to help build a better internet, that's literally what we try to do every single day.

So let's talk about that better internet in the context of AI. A few months ago your company made major news, especially with people working in media or the creator class, around what you are doing with AI bots and their ability to scrape websites with impunity.

That's how a lot of these AI models were trained in the first place, right? They scrape the internet, pull whatever content they want, and use it to train LLMs. Your company has now taken a major stand to stop that from happening without financial incentives for the creators of that content. Tell us a little bit about where that idea came from.

So, my cofounder Michelle hates history lessons. I, on the other hand, am a recovering adjunct law professor. So …

Oh boy.

Let's just talk about the history of the internet, where we've been, where we are, where we're going, and what the opportunities and what the challenges are. So, the first thing is that there's this sort of mistaken belief that the web has been free. The web has never been free. Somebody has always paid for the web, because journalists like yourself and other folks at Condé Nast, other folks at, you know, all of the different media companies, they deserve to eat.

Agreed.

You know, if you go to a restaurant, they kind of want you to pay your bill. So somehow there has to be money that goes back to the people that are creating stuff, whether it's news or entertainment or anything else.

For the last 25 years, the great patron of the internet has been Google. They created this incredible tool to let you search for things and then it gives you a treasure map and you can click on the links in that treasure map, and that will take you to content that Condé Nast or Meredith or whoever it is [created]. The key was that the traffic that their treasure maps generated then provided tools to turn that traffic into revenue, into dollars, that you could then pay creators with.

Yes.

Like, that's an amazing thing. It has, at the same time, had some perverse effects [since] traffic has never been the best measure of quality in any kind of objective sense. You also had a bunch of publications like BuzzFeed that would literally A-B test headlines to figure out which ones generated the largest cortisol response, the largest stress response, because baiting you into clicking things—regardless of what the quality of the actual content was—was kind of the game.

It became all about SEO.

Again, I think Google has been a massive force for good in the world. The internet would not exist in the form that it is right now without Google's patronage. But that same sort of traffic-is-all-we-care-about [idea] is what led to Facebook, which was what led to TikTok. And we've kind of spiraled down this sort of attention-economy hole where I think all of us feel a little bit wistful for the internet of old, right? So that's kinda where we are today in terms of the content side.

Right.

What's been happening, though, is that the entire industry has moved away from search being the dominant interface of the web. You can actually see this at Google itself. Now, if you run a search it gives you back an answer at the top of the page. It doesn't give you a treasure map. Instead it provides you what they call an AI Overview, which has taken a whole bunch of content, smashed it together, summarized it in various ways, and synthesized it.

And Google is just one piece. Like if you look at Perplexity, if you look at OpenAI, if you look at Anthropic, they're not search engines, they're answer engines.

The difference is that if you just give someone the answer, then they don't generate traffic. They don't follow those links. We have the data on how much of that has changed. The short answer is that in Google's case it's about 10 times harder today, because of AI Overviews, to get traffic for the same amount of content than it was back when Google was just 10 blue links.

And I would say [Google] has been very resistant to the notion that AI Overviews have damaged traffic to publishers.

I think they've been very careful in saying that they're still sending a bunch of clicks to the web, but they've been very imprecise about what parts of the web are benefiting, what parts are hurting.

So what we see is that if you're an ecommerce shop, AI Overviews haven't hurt you as much because, again, people still have to buy the thing. So they're like, “OK, which digital camera is the best digital camera to buy?” And they get an AI Overview that answers that, but they still then have to go buy the digital camera. So they still go to one of the digital camera sellers that's out there, but they're not reading WIRED's description of what digital camera is the best directly.

Right.

I think they very much know that for things that are just purely information-based, the traffic to those things is just falling off of a cliff. But again, they couldn't generate that AI Overview if they hadn't slurped up the data from WIRED, and Ars Technica, and all the different companies out there that are actually doing the work to review the cameras.

I'm still waiting for my check from Google. When is that coming?

Google does send you a check, but they only send you a check—not personally, maybe—if a human has followed a link and then there's an ad that DoubleClick serves. So Google is still supporting the ecosystem, but that support is declining, declining, declining.

As we shift from search engines to answer engines, the future is going to look different than the past, and I think that there are three possible outcomes. The most nihilistic of all is you starve to death and die.

I personally, and other journalists, don't want that.

And not just journalists. Academics, researchers, that whole group. It is terrifying to me how many people out there, sort of the AI maximalist camp, are like, “Why do we need journalists anymore? We have drones.” And I'm like, “You really have no earthly idea what good journalism is.”

Sure, the facts, you can do that. But the real color of someone saying, “Hey, your house just was swept away in the flood. How are you dealing with that?” That really is an incredibly important thing.

The reporting, the storytelling, the investigative work. It is human-led work.

So the nihilistic version is awful and I think unlikely to happen. The second possibility, which I think is frighteningly likely to happen, is what I would call the Black Mirror possibility, which is that journalists and academics and researchers don't go away, but we don't go back to the media of the 1980s. We go back to the media of the 1400s, where every journalist, every researcher, every academic is employed by one of five big families.

But it's not families anymore. It's AI companies. And it's not too crazy to imagine a world where Sam Altman says, “You know what? We're just gonna stand up our own Associated Press.” Right? “Lots of unemployed journalists out there. We're gonna hire them; we're gonna stand up bureaus all around the world.”

If they do that, then Anthropic has to do it, and everyone else has to do it. Then they're feeding the machine that's out there. If that happens, we get back to my college thesis, which [means] there will be a conservative one, and there will be a liberal one, and there'll be a Chinese one, and there'll be an Indian one. Europeans will try to create one and eventually just use the liberal US one.

That's not crazy, but think about how backwards-moving that is. The internet has been this great information equalizer, democratizer. And in this world, all of a sudden, you subscribe to one of the five big AI companies and you get their perspective. It's going to be very difficult if it's thousands of dollars a month for your AI subscription. You're not going to subscribe to two, very few people will. So information in that world gets incredibly siloed, but it's not crazy.

OK. What's the third possibility?

Right now everyone's getting content for free. In the future, I think the AI companies will look less like science labs and look more like Netflix, where what differentiates them is whether or not they have access to unique content, and that unique content is something they will be willing to pay for. That's the day in which not only Google but OpenAI and Perplexity and Anthropic and all the different AI companies—hopefully there are thousands of them—are sending you a check.

Well, I'm waiting. But Cloudflare is doing something very fundamental in helping ensure that third possibility becomes a reality. Tell us a little bit about how that works.

OK, so that third possibility is a market. The one thing that every market has in common is scarcity. You can't have a market if there's no scarcity. Like there's no market for breathable air because in most places there's plenty of breathable air.

Yeah, for now.

We've talked about a lot of dystopian futures, and we can talk about more if you want, but let's just try to figure out …

… let's stick to this one.

So the problem that we saw was that our customers who were publishers, and the entire publishing industry, wasn't creating scarcity. A lot of that was that they didn't have the technical wherewithal to actually identify who the AI scrapers were and block them from taking their content.

We're really good at that. Like that's what we do every day. We built these tools to stop Chinese hackers or Iranian hackers or Russian hackers. But those same tools also identify “that's the Perplexity bot” or “that's the ByteDance bot.” We can give publishers the tools to do that.

If our mission is to help build a better internet, it makes total sense for us to not only build those tools, but then make them available for free to anyone who is creating content online and wants to say, “I don't want you to have my content unless there's some exchange of value.”

There's always been an exchange of value in the search engine world. The exchange of value was that the search engine got your content and in exchange they sent you traffic and then helped you monetize that traffic. As the world moves toward answer engines, we have to figure out what that new exchange of value is, but step one is creating scarcity.

Have companies taken you up on that offer? What's the response been like?

On the content creator, publisher side it has been extraordinary. Everyone from the Associated Press to Ziff Davis and every publisher in between has come to us and said, “We've been waiting for someone to come along.” The most common thing I've heard as I've talked to the CEOs of publishing houses is, “I've gone from being just depressed, like there's nothing I can do, to actually being optimistic.”

I mean, I cannot overstate what a significant step this is.

The music industry on some level is an analogy. The day before Steve Jobs steps on stage and announces iTunes, 99 cents per song, the entire music industry is worth $8 billion. Not revenue, market cap. That's a big number, but for the influence that it had in that world, it was actually relatively modest. Ninety-nine cents a song isn't the business model that ended up winning. It ended up being something closer to Spotify, and there's still record sales. There's Spotify and Apple Music and Tidal and YouTube and TikTok. They're all sending dollars to music creators. Spotify sent $10 billion. So they sent more in cash to music creators and that ecosystem in the last year than the entire industry was worth 18 years ago.

You've gotten a lot of really positive press for this. What's in it for Cloudflare beyond that?

I was my college newspaper editor. My wife and I bought our local hometown newspaper, but not because we're making any money off of it. Because we believe in local journalism. We need journalists, and we need academics, and we need researchers, and we can't have new technology just strangle the business model of that.

Personally, that's my motivation from a company perspective. Like this is an existential threat to us. If the internet stops existing, what's left for Cloudflare to do? So one of the things that is really important to us is a thriving and vibrant internet ecosystem. Even if it didn't contribute a single dollar in revenue to us.

But it's contributing revenue to us already because we're seeing folks like your parent company and others who are saying, “This is important, and we were using someone else and now we're shifting to Cloudflare.”

I want to ask you a little bit about a different aspect of what you guys do. So you have this massive network, right? One hundred and twenty-five countries. You released an outage summary on internet blockages or interruptions around the world and found that there were no government-directed outages in the first three months of this year, but the second three months were a different story. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing?

It's interesting how there's a seasonality to this and that seasonality happens for what is a pretty silly reason in my estimation. There are a lot of countries in the world that believe access to the internet gives students an unfair advantage if they're taking standardized tests.

Oh, really?

So at the end of the school year, you'll see a massive uptick in the internet being turned off in those countries to deny access to students to be able to cheat on the tests. What's depressing about that? First, they've designed tests that you can cheat on so easily just by having access to the internet. Second, we see it being turned off in those countries in poor regions but left on in rich regions. Which is a way that powerful people are helping their own kids but punishing the poorer kids.

But what worries me the most is that it's normalizing the idea that it's OK for the government, for what is a relatively silly reason, to turn off the internet and that they have essentially built the tooling to be able to do that on the back of “we must protect the children.”

That same tooling—whenever there's an election and they want to suppress any kind of other party that might kick them out of power, whenever there's any sort of civil unrest or protests, they can use that same tooling.

That is fascinating. I have to ask, in the context of the US administration right now, have you seen any changes in the online environment since Trump took office?

No is the answer. We had a great relationship with the Obama administration. We had a great relationship with the first Trump administration. We had a great relationship with the Biden administration. We have, so far, had a great relationship with the second Trump administration.

It's in the US's interest for there to be more global internet access. If there is a change, the one place where I think that there has been what we view as a positive change has been that some of the internet blocking or restrictions or what we saw out of the UK where they were trying to force back doors into encryption, some aspects of the Trump administration, the current State Department, have said that's actually a trade issue. So I actually think that the current Trump administration has been more aggressive at protecting the internet than we saw from the Biden administration.

When you think about everything that your company is across, what is it that's waking you up at 3 in the morning right now? What do you worry about?

The business model of the internet is breaking, and if content creators don't have an incentive to create content, if they can't get famous and they can't get rich, they're just going to stop creating content. That's an existential threat. That's the nightmare, the dream that wakes me up.

What makes you excited? What are you optimistic about?

So we, for the first time in human history, have a relatively good mathematical model. To describe the totality of human knowledge, it's not perfect. But if you take all the AI companies that are out there, they have these giant decision trees that they've created. It's the best representation of human knowledge that we've ever had, and it tells us what we know, but it also tells us what we don't know. I analogize it to being like a giant block of Swiss cheese. There's a lot of cheese, but there's a bunch of holes in that cheese.

The thing that actually makes me super optimistic is that if we do this right, creating a set of incentives that reward content creators for filling in the holes, that is a lot better business model and a much healthier business model than the old traffic generation.

My evidence that we're onto something is we've seen a handful of content deals, and the company that has gotten the best deal by far is Reddit. We know from their public filings that last year they got close to $140 million a year from Google and OpenAI.

Hmm.

If you compare that with a similar deal that was done for The New York Times, they got about $20 million. So Reddit got seven times more than The New York Times. Why? Well, maybe it's crazy …

I think I know where you're going, and I'm gonna agree with you, but [$140 million compared to $20 million is] a wildly different number.

Yeah. But 20 minutes ago we both, I think, agreed that we're nostalgic for the quirky internet ...

Oh, I love Reddit.

… and there's nothing that represents that more than Reddit. The New York Times is amazing, but if you have data from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, like how much real difference is there? Basically the facts stay the same between those, whereas Reddit is this unique content, and so we already have some evidence that the business model of the AI-driven web is going to be one that rewards the Reddits of the world more.

All right. I gotta figure out what hole in the Swiss cheese I'm gonna fill.

You know, the scariest meeting I've had in the last little bit was coffee with Anna Wintour. My wife was like, “You have to wear a suit.” And I'm like, “I don't have anything.”

Wait. This is really important. What did you wear, Matthew?

It was in New York and it was a hundred degrees outside, a hundred percent humidity. The only suit I had was this light blue, fall, relatively heavy suit. So, I wore the suit.

Oh boy.

Anna probably rolled her eyes at this. But I also was just a sweaty mess. So I think it was a pretty embarrassing meeting.

This is a shocking visual. I'm sure she thought it went great. The thing about my boss is that she's actually really, really nice. So there you go.

She was incredibly, incredibly lovely, and so thoughtful about the whole content and media industry. So I really appreciated the opportunity to get to pick her brain.

That's really funny.

Even though my sartorial sense is pretty …

Trust me, so is mine. I know the feeling.

Before we end, I wanna play a little game we came up with. It's called Control, Alt, Delete. What piece of tech would you love to control? What piece would you alt, so alter or change, and what would you delete? What would you vanquish from the Earth if given the opportunity?

So, delete. I'd probably say TikTok. Zero protein, very low-value content, I think, is really dangerous and damaging.

Um, control. I feel super privileged in terms of what we do at Cloudflare, so I would love to have significant influence in thinking through what the next business model of the web looks like. I don't necessarily wanna control it, but I would love to at least control making sure that we're rewarding filling the holes in the cheese.

Then, alt. I'm still longing for a home automation system that doesn't suck. Because I showed up at my house in Austin and the light switches didn't work and I couldn't turn the TV on. You know, a smart home that was a little bit smarter.

The primal urge to sit in front of a fire is in our DNA. That might be the reason I've typed “vintage electronic fireplaces” into Etsy's search bar on more than one occasion. There's evidence that fires can lower our blood pressure and induce relaxation as “part of a multisensory, absorptive, and social experience.”

I've sought that elusive object of desire: an affordable freestanding ventless fireplace that can give my apartment the majestic warm glow that only a fireplace can deliver. For those of us who cannot retrofit our homes, change building codes, or persuade a landlord to build a chimney, the options for more than a simulacrum of the crackling fireplace are here.

And going ventless isn't just about cost; there are quantifiable health risks to living with an actual Yule log. It's well established that wood-burning fireplaces negatively impact both indoor quality and outdoor air quality. A 2020 study published in Science of the Total Environment found that “long-term exposure to PAH levels measured in the fireplace room may contribute to the development of cancer.” PAHs are Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that occur during “the incomplete combustion of organic material”—think tobacco, coal, gasoline, and wood. PAHs are among “the 189 hazardous air pollutants covered under the Clean Air Act.”

A 2023 study found that “increasing frequency of wood-burning indoor fireplace/stove usage was associated with incident lung cancer, even among never smokers.” Residential wood-burning fireplaces can increase levels of cancer-causing PAHs in local outdoor air pollution by orders of magnitude. Even though wood is renewable, it is not always eco-friendly.

Could there be an affordable ventless fireplace that won't increase cancer risk or speed up the earth's demise? Possibly. There are two main types of freestanding, no-installation-required, ventless fireplaces on the market: The gel fuel kind that creates a real flame, and LED light models that produce a real flame moving image. I tested one of each, below, to give you an idea of what to expect.

For more warmth, check out our related guides, including Best Space Heaters, Best Smokeless Fire Pits, Best Down Comforters, and Best Heated Blankets.

Realcozy

Amazon

Realcozy

The Realcozy Liberty Farmhouse Mantel LED fireplace is a heavy, made-to-order piece of furniture that required two white-glove professionals to move it into my apartment. They also did the assembly, including adding the optional fire glass rocks to create the ember bed, a decision I immediately regretted. When the fireplace isn't on, the “glass rocks” look more like plastic ice cubes, and at some point I'm going to use my screwdriver to open the 42-inch fireplace insert and remove them.

I loved the wooden design of the Liberty Farmhouse mantel. It is wall-mounted, flush, and looked like it has always been there. The 30-year-old company has multiple mantel designs, everything from corner versions to TV stand options, and in varying sizes and colors. They also come with a remote. The flames look real-ish. Unlike the Lloyd below, where you're dealing with real fire, the Realcozy has stationary LED lights that shine onto a rotating reflector inside, casting realistic, flickering flame effects onto the screen.

With a click of the remote, I can cycle through different colors to illuminate the flame bed, including green and purple. I opted for the more natural reddish-orange.

The Realcozy has a heater, and at 5,000 BTU, the company claims it can heat a 500-square-foot living space. I'm not sure if that's entirely possible, but it did warm up my 200-square-foot dining room during a late-spring cold snap when my apartment's heat wasn't turned on. In the evening, it gave my dining room a lovely fireplace vibe. Still, I felt like something was missing. I thought back to a review I had read and its suggestion of playing crackling fireplace sounds on a loop. I wanted sound. I was surprised to find more than a few fireplace crackling box options on Amazon. The need for fire sounds must also be in our DNA.

I bought the Mseltos Fireplace Crackler Sound Box ($33) to add sound to my fake fireplace experience. The Crackler has a variety of fireplace sounds: hard, mild, weak, soft, super soft, or fiercely crackling, along with crackling with music. And reader, I needed those crackling sounds. While I wish the Realcozy came with sound, its looks, adjustable heater, and remote with built-in timer make the Realcozy my favorite ventless fireplace option. I also don't have to worry about burns, explosions, or high levels of CO2.

Solo Stove

Solo Stove

Home Depot

The Lloyd from Solo Stove pays serious homage to the freestanding mid-century enameled MCM Preway fireplaces that fetch thousands on the vintage marketplace. For less than $1,000 and a few minutes of assembly, the Lloyd may be a solution for those who want a real flicker. The Lloyd comes in five easy-to-love colors and most resembles the OG Malm Zircon. Made of electroplated steel, metal, and glass, the 31-pound Lloyd stands 3.5 feet tall.

The Lloyd uses TerraFlame gel fuel, a proprietary blend of isopropanol and ethanol that has a faint eau de Sterno, reminiscent of the times I've used my Le Creuset fondue pot. It burns smokeless and is virtually emission-free. The Lloyd does not come with an extended lighter, but it needs one. The first time I lit the Lloyd, I used a match and immediately regretted it. While the TerraFlame gel fuel cans are the same size as a scented candle, I underestimated the risks, as the flame was instant, large, and hot. I bought an extended curved lighter that worked perfectly.

There's no denying the cool aesthetic of the Lloyd. It was a true novelty to have a real crackling flame in my apartment—it really brought the room together. I wish there were an option to buy a fake chimney extender to complete the illusion of a real fireplace. I sat on the carpet in front of the fire and planned to use the Lloyd for my next party or date night. There are few things that can instantly do the full ambiance makeover that a fireplace can achieve. My first time using the Lloyd, I didn't let the gel fuel burn out. Snuffing the flame using the magnetic opener was a challenge. I needed oven mitts and metal tongs, and once I put the top on the canister, I couldn't detach the magnetic snuffer and needed pressure with the tongs. This is where the glass shield proved an obstacle. It's also too hot to move.

It's worth noting that back in 2011, the US Consumer Safety Commission put out an executive summary about the risks of pourable gel fuel (not used in the Lloyd) for fire features and gel fuel, including the kind that comes in a can with a metal snuffer, similar to the type used in the Lloyd. There was also a recall of gel fuels back in 2011 due to burns and at least two fatalities. At issue was the consumer's inability to assess risks because the flame seems like a candle and the actual flames are sometimes difficult to see. Most dangerous was the fact that refueling gel into a hot canister can cause an explosion. Explosions also occurred when consumers attempted to snuff out the flame on the cans. There are vapors and flames from the burning of ethanol. And while the summary is over a decade old, Lloyd's user's manual has a warning: “fire and explosive hazard, severe burns or death can occur, and never add fuel to a hot device.” And in regard to the TerraFlame, it comes with a Prop 65 warning: “Gel fuel when burning, may expose you to chemicals including carbon monoxide, which can lead to cancer and reproductive harm.” While I tested the Lloyd Modern Gel Fuel Fireplace, the above warnings apply to any fireplace that uses ethanol-based gel fuel.

And there is no safe option for refueling. After reading the summary, including the dangers of snuffing the flame of a gel fuel can and the possibility of explosion, I've since let the fuel burn out all the way. When the Lloyd's flame is out, that's it—show's over.

A common refrain in the Solo Stove's own reviews, and I found this to be true as well, is that the cans do not last the full three hours. In fact, one of the flames went out 45 minutes before the last one. A TerraFlame six-pack costs $40, making it a $5-an-hour fire experience. The Lloyd isn't a practical heat source. While Solo boasts that the Lloyd brings 9,000 BTUs of heat, it is primarily for aesthetic purposes. I used the Lloyd in a 250-square-foot room and didn't feel space-heater-like warmth. And, before you light your Lloyd, you'll need to open a window.

There are significantly more cons with gel fuel fireplaces than there are with LED light models. For one, the gel fuel models can explode, killing or causing life-changing injury to the user. Biren Law Group posts regularly on TikTok about the dangers they've seen in home fires involving gel fuel. As for LED models, the biggest issue is sound. If you miss the crackle sounds that come with fireplaces, the LED models might be too fake for your liking.

Travis Day regrets being so strict with his ex-partner about never sleeping in the same bed.

According to human design, the New Age “synthesis” of astrology, the I Ching book of Chinese wisdom, Kabbalah, and the chakra system, “everyone should sleep in their own bed at night” to preserve their auras, says the blond 38-year-old Los Angeles County–based surfer, who's been following the practice rigidly for the past five years.

“She was not happy and really hated having to go back to her place,” says Day, now a human design coach with 11,000 followers on Instagram. He didn't know how much the “auric distancing” bothered her, he says, “until she finally expressed it when we were breaking up.”

Human design dictates that people inevitably fall into five archetypal personality categories: “manifestors,” generators, manifesting generators, reflectors, and projectors. The mystical, mechanical inner-discovery system turned Day's life around when he spontaneously received a reading on a beach just outside of LA in August 2020. He was at a financial and emotional “rock bottom” amid the failure of his “beachproof” dog accessory brand, but that initial personality analysis represented “the first time someone actually saw me.”

Day was told that he was projector and that he shouldn't hustle hard but instead follow the intuition of his spleen, the little-understood organ in the upper abdomen that is traditionally believed to be the seat of bad temper.

“For a long time I had depression and talked terribly to myself,” the California native tells me over a Zoom call. “But human design showed me that I actually hated not being me.”

Human design, a philosophy that spans from self-improvement to more extreme beliefs like life being predetermined, alien influence on Earth, and a coming planetary shift, is approaching a high-watermark cultural moment. It might not be long before the phrase, “that's so mani-gen” is as common, in certain circles, as “that's so Leo.” Some human design coaches have more than 100,000 followers on social media, offering people advice on everything from love lives to how to get rich.

There are coaching programs and entire centers dedicated to learning and teaching the practice as retreats are cropping up in wellness hot spots from Puerto Escondido, Mexico, to Sofia, Bulgaria. Readings can cost hundreds of dollars; TikTok creator Kendra Hilty, who went viral after documenting how she fell in love with her psychiatrist, received $3,000 for three months of weekly human design readings, according to The Cut. Even as I'm writing this article, I pass a bookstore in Vancouver, British Columbia, with a human design book prominently displayed in its front window.

The buzz around this radical system has led people to take life-changing decisions like ending their marriages or moving countries after single readings, which can also be conducted with ChatGPT. “You may realize you don't love your partner, you hate your job, you can't stand where you live, and you're dying inside,” Day says. But he tells WIRED there are culty elements in the ecosystem of training connected to this “new astrology.”

In the new season of Love is Blind: UK, contestant Patrick Justus, a human design coach and “splenic projector,” like Day, propels the phrase “trust your spleen” into the zeitgeist; the show has used the slogan in its marketing ads next to Justus wearing an eye mask. “Listening to my spleen is the best way for me to find the love of my life,” he tells one of his first dates on the show.

After several promising dates with singer Aanu Adewole, Justus starts to doubt the message from his spleen, noting it is “silent.” He dumps Adewole after she appears reluctant to sing for him and confesses that if her mother vetoed him she would drop him. “I have to follow my spleen,” Justus tells her. “It breaks my heart to tell you I'm breaking up with you.” (It later emerged that another woman may have been pregnant with Justus' child during the filming of the series and that he had omitted to mention it. In a statement Justus provided to the show for its reunion episode, he said: “2025 has been life-changing as I embrace the joy of becoming a father.”)

Justus' seemingly strict adherence to his human design is not an anomaly. One coach tells WIRED she decided to divorce her husband after doing a reading on a flight to Hawaii, where they were due to start a new life together. To follow the teachings attached to one's human design is to “decondition” from the societal influences that have molded people to be not their true selves. But Redditors report being scared to “decondition” and make the drastic lifestyle changes required to bring them into greater accordance with their design.

Others claim to have gone to extremes in attempts to live fully in accordance with the teachings and what Day describes as “not self-conditioning forces.” These supposedly show up when one is out of alignment with their design and can include frustration, anger, bitterness, or disappointment. The drastic measures some have taken to “self-harmonize” have included moving alone to remote areas. In an Instagram reel, one human design advocate promotes the consumption of “single-ingredient foods” such as polenta to live within their design.

Erin Claire Jones, a human design coach with 172,000 followers on Instagram, says the detail in human design assessments is also part of its appeal.

“I've seen the most skeptical people fall in love with it because it's practical, but it's also so specific,” she says, noting the rise of human design from the extreme fringes toward the mainstream in recent years reflects an increasing collective desire to “learn about ourselves,” warts and all.

Over the past decade Jones has sold 43,000 personalized design guides, mostly for $95 each, conducted sessions with 4,000 people, and trained another 1,500 in how to give readings, en route to publishing the book How Do You Choose? with publisher HarperCollins this year. “Human design is far more mechanical [than astrology] in terms of, ‘Hey, this is how you make decisions.'” Sometimes she observes people and guesses their designs at parties, but she admits to not always getting them right.

Jones, who has blond highlights and well-defined cheekbones, says she has worked with a host of startups and CEOs of small companies to help improve teamwork and boost productivity. She helps people use human design within their own families to help foster more harmonious relations, and also does so herself. “My daughters both have entirely different designs than mine. My husband does too,” she says, explaining that, like many over coaches, she is a projector. “It's been so useful to be like, ‘I'm not expecting either of my daughters to be anything like me.'”

Human design was born in 1987 when Canadian former advertising executive Robert Krakower, a rumored ketamine enthusiast who had been living like a hippie and residing in a dilapidated casita in Ibiza, claimed to have had an intense transcendental encounter with “the voice” over the course of eight days. As origin myths go, his makes Moses at the burning bush sound almost low-key.

Krakower, a bearded mufti headdress-wearer who worked part-time at a local school, was walking with his dog when it picked up a scent and approached an abandoned house, noticing a light beneath the door. He shouted at the door and demanded to know, “Who's there?” he recalled once in a lecture in Germany. Once inside, the heavy smoker said he heard a voice he imagined to come from “a cigar-smoking 155-year-old woman.”

Then Krakower claimed he started gushing with sweat from head to toe. He went back to his nearby home and said “the voice” instructed him to place his Bible, Bhagavad Gita, and Stanford biology textbook together, along with a chessboard and a copper coil. He said he was told to burn a combination of herbs from the shelves and that a series of cosmic revelations ensued, spanning the big bang, the nature of being, the “crystals of consciousness,” and “rave cosmology,” a far-out prophecy he went on to make, predicting alien influence in a prophesied influx of disabled and mute children born in or after 2027.

All of this information would help Krakower—who soon renamed himself Ra Uru Hu, a play on his name Robert, a word from “the voice,” and the moment when he demanded to know who was behind the door—forge the pseudoscientific human design system and the bodygraphs which help uniquely define each person according to a series of numbers in his 1992 guide, The Black Book. “Madness is an interesting thing,” said Krakower, who was a “splenic manifestor” and died in 2011 of a heart attack at age 62. “I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. Like, caught in this incredible, choiceless movie.”

In accordance with Krakower's prophecy, Richard Beaumont, the director of Human Design UK, who worked closely with Krakower for years before his death, has already purchased the domain name Silentbabies.com. “There's going to be a new species coming in February 2027,” he says, sipping a glass of white wine in front of a human design chart over Zoom from his home in the west of England.

“They're not going to be human, but they will come through human women.” (The human design school Krakower founded, the Jovian Archive, sells an online course centered on the alien prophecy for $2,079, and the organization warns of “imitators and unlicensed black marketeers” across the global network of licenses, trademarks, and authorized teachers.) Human design is not a belief system, says Beaumont, who has 38,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel. “This is an endless knowledge … We're not here to interfere with who we are; we're here to decondition.”

Day—who recently founded a “projector only” online community dedicated to “deconditioning” and other activities like singles nights—claims that some leading figures in the movement can be incredibly prescriptive. Last year he won a raffle to attend a retreat hosted by certain high-profile teachers. There, he says, the cultic, controlling tendencies of parts of the community were laid bare.

“I had never seen so many unhappy, angry people,” he recalls. “People get really attached to making it into rules and then saying, ‘This is what you can do, and this is what you can't do based on your design.'” He saw people telling others such things as: “‘You're out of alignment,' ‘you have an open throat chakra, and you're not supposed to do this.'” It's a “fucking Wild West,” Day says of the sprawling human design industry. “If you want to manipulate someone … The easiest thing to do is sell them on inspiration.”

At the same time, he admits that giving human design readings for $250 each has turned his fortunes around; he does at least three readings per week, in addition to offering other services.

Perhaps my fortunes will change, too, if I live more in accordance with whatever my design is, following a recent split which left me soul-searching.

I give Day my time and date of birth and the name of the city where I was born, just like with a Zodiac reading, and he inputs the information into a website that conjures a diamond-shaped “bodygraph” which, he says, reveals a distinct numeric genetic code underpinning my “manifesting generator” personality. “Your mind will say you always need to be looking for love and direction, [but] you're super sensitive to others' frequencies,” fellow singleton Day tells me. Therefore, it is extremely important that I sleep in my own bed each night to preserve my aura.

But I do hope to find love again, so maybe I'll allow a sleepover once in a while.

Authorities around the world can use your cell phone to track your location and potentially access other sensitive private information about you. One possible protection from this data collection is a burner phone. As invasive state surveillance ramps up globally—including new initiatives in the United States to monitor travelers, protesters, and vulnerable populations—privacy tools that were formerly the domain of digital hermits and people involved in organized crime are now more and more appealing to everyone.

Burner phones, which are often “dumb” flip phones, can be loaded with prepaid minutes and offer anonymity when rotated frequently, purchased with cash, and siloed from any connections to you or your digital life. The idea is that cops, or other actors, are unlikely to be tracking a fresh burner phone in real time. But the crucial additional layer of protection that properly used burner phones offer is that even if they are—or they later tie communications from a burner phone to activity they are investigating—they can't use digital ties to establish who was using it.

“Burner phones are used for a very specific, time-limited purpose and then discarded,” says Danacea Vo, founder of Cyberlixir, a cybersecurity provider for nonprofits and vulnerable communities. “They're mostly used to separate your identity from the identity of the device. Anonymity is the goal.”

Using a burner phone may seem like overkill, and it takes money, time, and some know-how to actually use them effectively. But once you understand the concepts, you can apply them to your specific situation to make more informed choices about how to best protect yourself and your privacy. This guide talks about burner phones that meet the strict definition, as well as “alternative” phones, or altphones, that apply many of the same concepts of burner phones but don't offer the same degree of anonymity.

Whether you should be using a burner phone depends on your risk model—the factors and concerns that are specific to you. Every one of us is exposed to a different set of risks that can vary depending on your nationality, citizenship, political views, profession, and much more. For example, lawyers, activists, and journalists may be at higher risk of being targeted by authoritarian governments than, say, an electrician or a stay-at-home mom.

Your risk level and tolerance changes over time—possibly even from one day to the next—and this influences how you communicate with people and the devices you use to do so. When considering using a burner device, think about who you are trying to keep from getting your data or communications.

“Use cases for burners may include: crossing borders, traveling to a risky environment, or participating in or documenting a protest,” says Mohammed Al-Maskati, digital security helpline director at the rights group Access Now. “People should make these decisions based on their risk profile and the threats they feasibly face.”

Even if you conclude that using a true burner phone is right for you in certain situations, keep in mind that you can, and should, still use your regular devices for the vast majority of your digital activity. Unless you are actively hiding your existence or residence, you likely do not need to regularly use burner phones. And that's a good thing, because taking the precautions required to establish the anonymity needed to maintain a device as a true burner phone—even for just one day—is challenging.

“Burner phones are almost impossible to keep anonymous,” says Rebecca Williams, a senior strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union's privacy and data governance unit, who recently organized a community burner phone workshop in Brooklyn, New York. “No burner phone is perfect.”

The hardest—and arguably the most critical—aspect of setting up a burner phone is purchasing the device and corresponding prepaid service in a way that preserves your anonymity. It's not a burner phone, for example, if you purchased it with your credit card, your best friend's credit card, or your neighbor's credit card.

So purchase your burner with cash or consider using a prepaid debit card that you previously purchased with cash. Depending on where you're shopping for your burner phone, these transactions may blend in a bit more than a cash purchase. Keep in mind, though, that for the latter to work you also have to take steps to shield your identity when purchasing the debit card.

Ideally, authorities or other actors will never discover the activity of your burner phone; but realistically, you need to be operating under the assumption that they eventually will. That is the point at which the separation between your identity and the burner phone is tested. But even if you can't perfectly shield yourself, you can make it more difficult to establish a connection.

Every step in traveling to and from the purchase requires the same forethought as buying the phone itself. First, leave your personal phone or any other devices that connect to Wi-Fi or cell service at home. Wear a hat, mask, and generic, unmarked clothing to travel and purchase the device. Make sure to cover identifying features like tattoos. Also, remember not to use a car connected to you or anyone you know to get there since license plate readers and data collected by a vehicle could reveal your travels. Paying for public transit with a credit card or taking a rideshare ride through your personal account could also create a link, particularly if you are planning to buy your device in a low-traffic area, so plan your travel carefully.

You should buy the device in a location where you don't normally shop or visit. Keep in mind, too, that almost all mainstream electronics retailers and big box stores implement extensive surveillance that includes security cameras, but also potentially things like facial recognition scanning. Your mask and neutral clothing can help, but if you can find an independently owned store that sells prepaid phones and may not be monetizing customer data as aggressively as a big company, there may be fewer surveillance records capturing the transaction.

If you're contemplating having someone else buy the burner device for you, consider a couple of things. First, having them purchase the phone for you potentially involves them in whatever you're planning to do with the phone, even if they are otherwise completely unconnected to the activity. Relatedly, you may think that no one knows that you're pals with, say, certain customers you see regularly at your job or an acquaintance from your gym—but if someone is going to all the trouble of tracking your burner phone in a massive haystack of cell phone data, they can potentially figure out your connections to your decoy.

“A good thing about burner phones is they can serve a purpose without compromising a wider network, for example your family. Using one reduces risk not just for the individual, but for the group,” says Cyberlixir's Vo. “They reduce the risk of association.”

In the United States you do not need to show identification or any other documentation to purchase a prepaid phone or SIM card, though some other countries record identity information alongside purchases. Many prepaid cell phones do require activation and a certain amount of setup that salespeople may offer to help you with on the spot. Wait to do the setup later, though.

In books, movies, and television, burner phones are often depicted as old-school flip phones, and this type of phone is a convenient choice because their feature set is so limited, leaving less room for mistakes that could potentially expose your identity. A prepaid smartphone package or Wi-Fi-only device newly purchased with cash can also be a burner phone—but you should only log into purpose-made burner accounts and only use the burner phone on highly trafficked public Wi-Fi. Never join your home Wi-Fi or any other Wi-Fi that could reveal your everyday habits or movements, because this would leave digital breadcrumbs tied to your identity that are routinely used in law enforcement investigations.

Do not turn on the burner phone at all until you are about to use it for its limited duration purpose. Remember that the first time you turn on a cell phone and it connects to the network, the mobile provider starts getting location data based on which cell tower the phone is connected to.

“Do not power the phone on near your home, work, or usual hangouts,” Cyberlixir's Vo says. “Activate and test the phone somewhere far away, preferably in a crowded or busy area where you blend in.”

Keep the phone off and ideally in a faraday bag whenever you are going about your daily life, preventing it from inadvertently generating data about your movements. Only use it for short stints and ideally for one to seven days max. No matter how careful you are, using a burner phone long term will eventually erode its anonymity, because anyone who cares to look could start to see patterns in the cell data over time.

Another important detail: Using a “dumb phone” as a burner phone almost always means that you will not have access to end-to-end encrypted communications software on the device. In other words, part of the necessity of rotating the phones regularly is that authorities would be able to access call records and text messages. Access to end-to-end encrypted communication apps is one potential advantage of taking on a prepaid smartphone as a burner, but you have to weigh the pros and cons for your scenario.

In either case, you should use your burner phone in an extremely, obsessively limited way for its intended purpose and absolutely nothing else. Write down phone numbers that you will contact using the burner phone rather than sending them or saving them in your regular personal devices, and never send your burner phone number to anyone from one of your everyday devices.

When you are done with the burner phone, make sure that you get rid of it in a thoughtful way as well. “At the end of the intended use, consider steps to eliminate information, remove SIM cards and/or memory cards, making sure not to leave a potential vulnerability after you,” says Access Now's Al-Maskati.

Depending on your risk model, it may not be appropriate or even the most practical to use a true burner phone. Instead, you may want to consider using an altphone to separate elements of your digital life.

“There is a lot of confusion, because ‘burner phone' is a generic term,” says Matt Mitchell, CEO of the risk mitigation firm Safety Sync Group. “I usually try to group tactics and advice based on goals. It begins with why a normal phone isn't good for privacy and then a dial on how private you're trying to get. The privacy goals are the dial—from safer hygiene, to more secure operating systems, to straight-up locked-down phones.”

For many people, an altphone or “lighter” burner phone is likely to be a smartphone that allows a wide range of communications and access to privacy-enhancing tools such as encrypted messaging apps like Signal, VPNs, online tracker blockers, and more. This way you can tune your personal privacy dial to keep certain web browsing, software use, media consumption, or communication more private and anonymous than it would be on your normal devices.

“What are you trying to protect? If you're just trying to obscure your phone number from somebody, you can do that in a much lighter way” than using a heavily anonymized device, the ACLU's Williams says. “But if you're really trying to go off grid, you have to do all this other stuff.

An altphone may be a smartphone that you separate as much as possible from your identity, perhaps a phone that you only use for attending protests. Or it could be an old phone you repurpose and use for things like traveling. How you set the privacy dial depends on the use case.

“A repurposed phone can be used for an extended period of time,” Cyberlixir's Vo says. “A repurposed phone already has your traces, even with factory reset. There might be a sales receipt, CCTV log, or someone taking a picture of you talking on the phone. So they are useful for compartmentalizing activities. Work versus personal phone is the most obvious example. Or one for international travel.” Reused devices also retain certain identifiers such as IMEI numbers over time.

Using a smartphone as a second device does have its own considerations. When it comes to mainstream devices, “smartphones do a terrible job at protecting people's privacy and securing their communications,” says Access Now's Al-Maskati. “If people obtain a smartphone to use as a burner, it's best to reset to factory settings, never connect any real accounts (AppleID, Google, social media), and do not sync any other information, as well as disabling unnecessary location and other services.”

You should only use your altphone for its intended purpose—if it's a phone you want to take to protests, for example, it shouldn't be used for texting friends or online shopping. As with a true burner phone, you should avoid using it in the same location that you use other devices—in other words, avoid connecting to the same Wi-Fi networks. Don't turn your altphone on alongside your day-to-day devices and, relatedly, don't carry them all together unless your altphone is in a Faraday bag. Only provide contact information for the altphone to those who need it.

Whether you're using a burner phone or an altphone, though, the bottom line is that there are no guarantees or perfect solutions. And if there is absolutely no room for error, go analogue and don't bring or involve a phone in whatever you're doing.

Waning trust in tech companies has spawned a new C-level role: Chief Trust Officer (CTrO).

According to a recent trends report by Forrester Research, tech companies are struggling to garner the trust of businesses and the public due to missteps following many breakthrough technology advances. The report pointed out that stalkers have adopted Apple AirTags, machine learning teams have been trained on datasets that ignored ethnic differences, and Elon Musk's xAI chatbot Grok posted a series of far-right and antisemitic comments on X.

“Tech vendors have become the first to adopt CTrOs out of necessity,” noted the report written by Vice President and Principal Analyst Jeff Pollard, with Oliwia Berdak, Stephanie Balaouras, Liam Holloway, and Michael Belden.

Although tech companies were early adopters of the CTrO concept, other businesses have followed suit. “Organizations that successfully earn and keep the trust of their customers, employees, and partners experience better business outcomes, more engagement, and competitive differentiation,” the report noted.

“For organizations that refuse to leave trust to chance, chief trust officers have emerged as the role responsible for shaping their firm's destiny,” it continued. “Title inflation and performance theater drive the creation of some C-level roles, but the expansive responsibilities of chief trust officers prove the necessity and value of this role.”

“In today's society, trust is in short supply,” observed Louis Eichenbaum, federal CTO of ColorTokens, a provider of zero trust microsegment solutions, in San Jose, Calif.

“Politicians, news outlets, and even the companies people buy from are often met with skepticism, and for good reason,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Businesses have not always been forthcoming about issues that directly impact their customers. From concealing product flaws and financial instability to downplaying data breaches, a lack of transparency has eroded confidence.”

“This growing distrust has created a challenging environment where customers are reluctant to believe what they're told,” he continued. “To overcome this, companies need leaders who can develop strategies that prioritize honesty and openness. By embedding transparency into every customer interaction, organizations can begin to repair relationships, strengthen loyalty, and ultimately rebuild trust.”

Frank Balonis, CISO and senior vice president of operations at Kiteworks, a secure content communications provider in San Mateo, Calif., asserted that organizations need a chief trust officer because trust has become a critical business asset requiring dedicated strategic oversight across all stakeholder relationships.

“The CTrO ensures the organization proactively builds trust through transparent data practices, ethical AI deployment, and authentic environmental and social initiatives, rather than simply managing compliance or avoiding risks,” he told TechNewsWorld. “By consolidating responsibilities that are often scattered across legal, HR, marketing, and IT, the role creates coherence in trust-building efforts and ensures trust considerations shape major business decisions.”

“Whether as a standalone position or integrated with existing C-suite roles, having executive accountability for trust is now essential in a hyperconnected world where reputations face constant scrutiny,” he said.

In today's highly competitive world, organizations need every advantage they can get, which can include trust. “Part of selecting vendors, whether it is an official part of the process or not, is evaluating the trust you have in that vendor,” explained Erich Kron, a security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, a security awareness training provider in Clearwater, Fla.

“By signifying someone in a high level of leadership as the person responsible and accountable for culminating and maintaining that level of trust, the organization may gain significant competitive advantages through loyalty and through competitive means,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“The chief trust officer role is a visible, external and internal sign of an organization's commitment to trust,” added Jim Alkove, founder of Oleria, an autonomous identity security company, in Seattle.

“It's an explicit statement of intent to your employees, to your customers, to your partners, to governments that your company cares so much about trust and that you've announced that there's a leader responsible for it,” Alkove, a former CTrO at Salesforce, told TechNewsWorld.

Forrester noted that trust has become a revenue problem for B2B software companies, and CTrOs provide a means to resolve issues that could stall deals and impact revenue.

“When procurement and third-party risk management teams identified issues with a business partner's cybersecurity posture, contracts stalled,” the report explained. “These issues reflected on the competence, consistency, and dependability of the potential partner. Chief trust officers and their teams step in to remove those obstacles and move deals along.”

MacKenzie Brown, vice president of the advisory pursuit group at Blackpoint Cyber, a managed detection and response company based in Ellicott City, Md., agreed that trust has a direct impact on the bottom line. “Buyers are doing their research long before they purchase, and any public trust profile will be equally researched and added to the score,” she told TechNewsWorld.

“When questions of cybersecurity, data protection, or regulation are negatively raised, deals get stuck,” she said. “That's why the CTrO role has emerged. It addresses those concerns head-on for the benefit of the business.”

KnowBe4's Kron added that as supply chain events continue to occur, often impacting the reputation of an organization more than a vendor who made an error, customers are becoming much more aware of the trustworthiness and security posture of their vendors.

“Organizations that have betrayed the trust of their customers, even accidentally, stand to lose contracts and sales, even if they were not the party responsible for a breach or some other issue,” he said. “This trust takes a long time to earn back, if it is possible at all, so a poor reputation means poor revenue.”

Trey Ford, chief strategy and trust officer at Bugcrowd, a crowdsourced bug bounty platform based in San Francisco, observed that experience has taught risk management executives that their partners and service providers represent a very real threat to their companies and reputations. “The need for partnership and transparency is now table stakes for technology service providers,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Conflict comes from internal tensions around transparency,” he said, “Companies do not want to share anything less than perfection, which is both unrealistic and dangerous.”

Forrester concluded that while some tech trends come and go, it believes the chief trust officer is here to stay. “Not all organizations will need or opt for a CTrO,” it noted, “but we believe this role is more than a passing trend.”

Ethosphere, a new Seattle startup building voice AI for retail operations, raised $2.5 million in a pre-seed round led by Point72 Ventures. Other backers include AI2 Incubator, Carya Ventures, Pack VC, Hike Ventures, and J4 Ventures.

Founded last year, Ethosphere uses wearable microphones and audio processing software to analyze in-store conversations with customers. Large language models help digest the data and provide feedback to frontline retail workers.

The goal is to help associates improve their performance while giving managers better visibility into what drives sales, CEO Evan Smith said in an interview with GeekWire. 

Smith, who held leadership roles at Starbucks in technology and operations, said that high-performing managers are the biggest driver of retail success. 

“At our core, we're inspired by empowering people to be great in what they do and using AI to give people superpowers,” Smith said. 

Employees wear lightweight, watch-sized microphones during their shifts. Ethosphere's software cleans and transcribes the audio, then uses LLMs trained on the retailer's own training materials to assess how well employees followed the brand's selling approach. Associates get feedback on what they did well and where they can improve; managers see data on who's excelling and who could benefit from targeted coaching.

Ethosphere built its system to capture only the employee's side of the conversation, not the customer's. Retailers work with the company to implement appropriate in-store disclosures. In luxury settings, Smith said the company is exploring opt-in use cases where stylists offer to record conversations as a white-glove concierge perk.

Smith noted that some employees enjoy using the system to get feedback in a new way. 

“The gamification element of this shows up in a much more powerful way than I would have predicted when we started this,” he said.

The CEO said one of the main reasons why people leave retail jobs is the lack of feedback. 

“Feeling seen, feeling heard, and feeling recognized is really a big piece of the puzzle that, in some respects, is missing in retail,” he said. 

Ethosphere isn't naming customers but said it is working with brands in the quick-service restaurant industry, clothing shops, and high-end luxury retailers. The 9-person startup is generating revenue from some customers while working with others on custom pilots.

It's part of a wave of voice AI startups gaining traction and attention from investors.

“In an increasingly busy landscape flooded with theoretical AI, Ethosphere stood out to us with a practical, powerful application that we believe has the potential to directly impact the sales and customer experience,” Sri Chandrasekar, a Seattle-based managing partner at Point72 Ventures, said in a statement. 

Smith, who began his career in education and public affairs, co-founded the company with CTO Ahad Rana, a veteran technologist with experience at AWS, Google, Factual, and AOL. Both held entrepreneur-in-residence positions at Seattle's AI2 Incubator before launching Ethosphere.

Seattle startup Pulumi is making a big bet as it looks to bring the AI coding revolution to cloud infrastructure.

The company on Tuesday debuted Neo, a new AI agent that automates cloud infrastructure tasks at enterprise scale.

Pulumi CEO Joe Duffy said he pulled a third of his 130-person workforce to build Neo, which he described as “an extension of your team,” capable of handling infrastructure provisioning, security, and compliance work that can traditionally take days or weeks.

Neo builds on Pulumi's infrastructure-as-code (IaC) foundation and uses large language models — primarily Claude — combined with enterprise guardrails. It integrates with AI developer tools such as Devin, Cursor, Windsurf, and VS Code via Pulumi's Model Context Protocol server, and lets users adjust its autonomy from human-approved steps to fully automated workflows.

AI has transformed application development, letting developers spin up apps and websites in seconds. Pulumi is betting the same pattern will emerge for complex back-end cloud infrastructure — and it's launching Neo at a time when platform teams are struggling to keep up as developers write more code than ever.

“While developer teams race to adopt AI, platform teams are drowning in managing the infrastructure demands, and a volume/velocity crisis develops,” said Sheila Gulati, managing director at Tola Capital, a Pulumi investor. “Infrastructure provisioning is still manual because of compliance priorities internally. This creates a compounding bottleneck.”

Automating platform engineering tasks will help companies continue making AI investments and avoid being throttled by infrastructure capacity, security, and resilience needs, Gulati said.

Duffy said customer reception has been “mind-blowing.”

“Neo is going to help them keep up and spend more time on strategic tasks, rather than firefighting all the time,” he said.

Early customers are using Neo to remediate thousands of compliance violations or upgrade dozens of Kubernetes clusters with zero downtime. Pulumi says beta users have delivered 10 times more infrastructure, deployed 75% faster, and cut policy violations by 90%.

The company built Neo in partnership with AWS, using the cloud giant's new Bedrock Agent Core service.

Duffy said he expects major competition if Neo gains traction, but he believes Pulumi's IaC foundation gives it a moat.

Founded in 2017, Pulumi now counts more than 3,700 customers including Nvidia and BMW, with more than one million downloads per week of its IaC tool. The company has raised $99 million to date, including a $41 million round in 2023, and is generating revenue in the tens of millions.

The startup recently moved into a new office at Two Union Square in downtown Seattle and opened a subsidiary in Europe as it expands globally.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened an investigation into claims that Tesla's door handles become inoperable in certain situations on Model Y SUVs.

The safety agency's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) revealed the probe on Tuesday, after having received nine reports from owners who were unable to get into their cars. ODI writes that the most common scenario involves parents who exit their car and cannot open the rear doors to remove their children.

In four of those cases, according to the ODI report, owners had to break a window “to regain entry into the vehicle.” 

News of the probe comes a few days after Bloomberg published an investigation into a series of incidents where Tesla owners (and passengers) became stuck inside their vehicles following a crash.

According to a preliminary review by ODI, Tesla's handles can become inoperable if the electronic door locks aren't getting enough voltage from a vehicle's battery system. But ODI also points out in its preliminary report that none of the owners who related this problem to the agency mentioned seeing low-voltage battery warnings. 

Tesla's vehicles do have manual door releases, although they are only on the inside of the car. The door releases can be hard for children to access, and some owners aren't even aware they exist, according to ODI. 

It's possible to restore power to the electronic door locks, according to Tesla's owners manuals, but it's a multistep process that requires an external power source.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Salesforce is increasing its focus on national security. 

The customer relationship management giant announced the creation of a new business unit called Missionforce on Tuesday. It will be focused on incorporating AI into defense workflows in three main areas: personnel, logistics, and decision making, according to a company press release. 

Missionforce will be helmed by Kendall Collins, who joined Salesforce in 2023 and is currently the chief business officer and chief of staff to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.  

“With Missionforce, we'll now bring the best of AI, cloud, and platform technology from the private sector to modernize critical areas including personnel, logistics, and analytics,” Collins said in the press release. “The goal is simple: to help our warfighters and the organizations that support them operate smarter, faster, and more efficiently. There's never been a more important time to serve those who serve.” 

Salesforce has held contracts with the U.S. government for years across federal agencies and multiple branches of the U.S. military including the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force. The company doesn't publicly disclose how many government contracts it has nor how much revenue it makes from them.  

This news is the latest in a wave of tech companies building and offering services specifically for the U.S. government.

OpenAI launched a version of its ChatGPT designed for U.S. government agencies in January. In August, the company announced it struck a deal with the government to give federal agencies access to its enterprise ChatGPT tier for just $1 a year.

Other companies quickly followed suit.  

A week later, Anthropic announced it was giving the U.S. government access to its government and enterprise tiers of its Claude chatbot for $1.  

Google announced “Gemini for Government” in late August which offers their AI services to federal agencies for 47 cents for the first year.

On Tuesday, Google announced a new open protocol for purchases initiated by AI agents — automated software programs that can shop and make decisions on behalf of users —  with backing from more than 60 merchants and financial institutions. Called the Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), the system is meant to be interoperable between AI platforms, payment systems and vendors, providing a traceable paper trail for each transaction.

In a post announcing the protocol, Google executives emphasized their commitment to openness. “We are committed to evolving this protocol in an open, collaborative process, including through standards bodies, and  invite the entire payments and technology community to build this future with us,” wrote Stavan Parikh and Rao Surapaneni, who are VPs at Google and Google Cloud, respectively.

The full specification for AP2 was posted to GitHub in conjunction with the announcement.

The protocol is built for a future in which AI agents routinely shop for products on customers' behalf, and engage in complex real-time interactions with retailers' AI agents. One example in Google's post imagines a chatbot user asking their agent to shop for a bike trip, which triggers a spontaneous time-sensitive bundle offer from a bike shop's agent.

In another example, a user asks for travel and lodging for a weekend vacation, giving only the dates, location and budget. “The agent can then interact with both airline and hotel agents, as well as online travel agencies and booking platforms,” the post explains, “and once it finds a combination that fits the budget, it can execute both cryptographically-signed bookings simultaneously.”

Enabling that kind of transaction is complex, from both a technological and social standpoint. AP2 requires agents to register two separate approvals before a purchase can be made: first the “intent mandate” (essentially telling the AI, “I'm looking for a polka dot neck tie”), which enables the agent to search for a specific item and negotiate with sellers; then the “cart mandate,” which gives final approval for a purchase once a specific item has been found.

The protocol also contains a provision for fully automated purchases, in which the agent is permitted to automatically generate a cart mandate once an item is found. Those circumstances require a more detailed intent mandate, specifying price limits, timing, and other rules of engagement. In either case, the goal is to maintain an auditable trail that can be re-examined in cases of fraud.

In collaboration with cryptocurrency outfits Coinbase, Metamask and the Ethereum foundation, Google also produced an extension that would integrate the cryptocurrency-oriented x402 protocol, allowing for AI-driven purchasing from crypto wallets.

A number of other tech companies are working on their own agentic purchasing systems — most notably Perplexity, which allows for a Buy With Pro service in its agentic browser. The payment provider Stripe also produces software tools for agentic purchasing on its platform, though they are not as comprehensive as AP2.

Like any protocol, the impact of AP2 will depend on its support from other players in the ecosystem — most notably, developers building agentic purchasing systems. But AP2 has already won the support of major financial providers like Mastercard, American Express and PayPal, giving the protocol a significant immediate footprint.

While many robotics companies are building human-sized robots, or working to automate entire factories, MicroFactory is instead trying to think big by building small.  

San Francisco-based MicroFactory built a general-purpose, tabletop manufacturing kit that's about the size of my Siberian Husky's dog crate. This compact factory includes two robotic arms and can be trained by human demonstration, as well as through AI.  

“General purpose robots are good, but it's not necessary [to] be humanoid,” said Igor Kulakov, the co-founder and CEO of MicroFactory, in an interview with TechCrunch. “We decided to design robots from scratch that will still be general purpose but not in human shape, and this way, it can be done much simpler, much easier, in hardware and on the AI side.” 

Rather than selling individual robotic arms, MicroFactory's system comes as an enclosed but transparent workstation, allowing users to watch the manufacturing process in real time. The compact factory-in-a-box is designed for precision tasks like circuit board assembly, component soldering, and cable routing. Users can train the robots by physically guiding the arms through complex motions — a hands-on approach that Kulakov says works faster than traditional AI programming for intricate manufacturing sequences.

“Usually it takes couple hours, but in this way, the robot much better understands what it should do,” Kulakov said. “When you hire people, we still need to spend time, like a week or something, to instruct these people to then supervise their work. A manufacturing company, they already have this time and resources to spend, and it will be much easier to train a model and to make it work in this way.” 

Kulakov's experience with traditional manufacturing helped spark the idea behind MicroFactory.  

He and his co-founder, Viktor Petrenko, used to run bitLighter, a manufacturing business that made portable lighting equipment for photographers. Kulakov said it was difficult to train new employees on how to complete the manufacturing process correctly. When advancements in AI made it seem possible to automate this type of work, they decided to jump on the opportunity.  

Kulakov and Petrenko launched MicroFactory in 2024. It took them about five months to build their prototype. Now the company has hundreds of preorders from customers looking to use the machines for various applications, including assembling electronics and even processing snails to be shipped to France for escargot.  

MicroFactory just raised a $1.5 million pre-seed funding round that included investors like executives from the AI company Hugging Face and investor-entrepreneur Naval Ravikant. The round values the young startup at a $30 million post-money valuation.  

Kulakov said the company plans to use the funding to build and ship out its units. The company is currently converting its prototype into a commercial product that it hopes to begin shipping in about two months.  

The company also plans to make some hires and continue improving its technology, including the AI models running under the hood.  

“Our growth is related to building hardware, so we set the goal to increase it 10x each year,” Kulakov said. “In the first year, we want to produce 1,000 robots, [about] three per day, and we have the capability to do this. Then, [we want to] make more and more productions.”

At its Made on YouTube live event on Tuesday, the company unveiled new generative AI tools for Shorts creators. YouTube is bringing a custom version of Google's text-to-video generative AI model, Veo 3, to Shorts, along with a new remixing tool, an “Edit with AI” feature, and more.

The custom version of Veo 3, called Veo 3 Fast, generates outputs with lower latency at 480p, making it easy to create video clips, YouTube says. And now, users can do so with sound for the first time.

This update is rolling out in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. YouTube plans to expand its functionality to more regions in the future.

YouTube is also bringing new Veo capabilities to Shorts, including the ability to apply motion from a video to an image. For example, you could animate a still image by making the person in it do a dance from a video. The company says this is possible through technology that captures and transfers movement from one subject to another.

Creators can now also use Veo to apply different styles to their videos, such as pop art or origami. Plus, creators now have the ability to add objects like characters or props with text descriptions.

These new capabilities will roll out in the coming months. 

As for the new remixing tool, creators can turn the dialogue from eligible videos into catchy soundtracks for other Shorts. 

“As the world's largest creative playground, YouTube is where trends are born and where you can draw inspiration from. Imagine hearing a line of dialogue that sparks an idea—a funny phrase, a memorable quote, or a one-of-a-kind sound—and you want to remix it into a new sound,” YouTube's Director of Product, Shorts and Generative AI Creation, Dina Berrada wrote in a blog post. “With our new Speech to Song remixing tool, you'll be able to do just that.”

YouTube notes that the feature uses Google's AI music model Lyria 2 to create the soundtrack. Creators will be able to add their own vibe to the song, like “chill,” “danceable,” or “fun.”

The company plans to test this feature soon, it says, and will roll it out to more creators in the United States in the coming weeks.

With the new Edit with AI feature, creators can turn their raw footage into first drafts. It transforms raw camera roll footage into a first draft by finding and arranging the best moments, adding music, and transitions. It can even add a voiceover that can react to what's happening in the video, in either English or Hindi. The idea behind the feature is to give creators a starting point for their Shorts, YouTube says.

YouTube is experimenting with Edit with AI on Shorts and in the YouTube Create app, and will expand the feature in the coming weeks in select markets.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced on Tuesday a raft of new user policies, including a pledge to significantly change how ChatGPT interacts with users under the age of 18.

“We prioritize safety ahead of privacy and freedom for teens,” the post reads. “This is a new and powerful technology, and we believe minors need significant protection.”

The changes for underage users deal specifically with conversations involving sexual topics or self-harm. Under the new policy, ChatGPT will be trained to no longer engage in “flirtatious talk” with underage users, and additional guardrails will be placed around discussions of suicide. If an underage user uses ChatGPT to imagine suicidal scenarios, the service will attempt to contact their parents or, in particularly severe cases, local police.

Sadly, these scenarios are not hypotheticals. OpenAI is currently facing a wrongful death lawsuit from the parents of Adam Raine, who died by suicide after months of interactions with ChatGPT. Character.AI, another consumer chatbot, is facing a similar lawsuit. While the risks are particularly urgent for underage users considering self-harm, the broader phenomenon of chatbot-fueled delusion has drawn widespread concern, particularly as consumer chatbots have become capable of more sustained and detailed interactions.

Along with the content-based restrictions, parents who register an underage user account will have the power to set “blackout hours” in which ChatGPT is not available, a feature that was not previously available.

The new ChatGPT policies come on the same day as a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing titled “Examining the Harm of AI Chatbots,” announced by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) in August. Adam Raine's father is scheduled to speak at the hearing, among other guests.

The hearing will also focus on the findings of a Reuters investigation that unearthed policy documents apparently encouraging sexual conversations with underage users. Meta updated its chatbot policies in the wake of the report.

Separating underage users will be a significant technical challenge, and OpenAI detailed its approach in a separate blog post. The service is “building toward a long-term system to understand whether someone is over or under 18,” but in the many ambiguous cases, the system will default toward the more restrictive rules. For concerned parents, the most reliable way to ensure an underage user is recognized is to link the teen's account to an existing parent account. This also enables the system to directly alert parents when the teen user is believed to be in distress.

But in the same post, Altman emphasized OpenAI's ongoing commitment to user privacy and giving adult users broad freedom in how they choose to interact with ChatGPT. “We realize that these principles are in conflict,” the post concludes, “and not everyone will agree with how we are resolving that conflict.”

It depends. If you're speaking to a doctor or a lawyer, yes, by law they are bound to keep your conversation strictly confidential except in some very narrow circumstances.But it goes beyond those two examples. If I have an NDA with the person I am speaking with on the other end of the line, yes I have the ""right"" to ""force"" the other person to keep our conversation private given that we have a  contractual agreement to do so.As far as OpenAI goes, I'm of the opinion that OpenAI - as well as most other businesses - have the right to set the terms by which they sell or offer services to the public. That means if they wanted a policy of ""all chats are public"" that would be within their right to impose as far as I'm concerned. It's their creation. Their business. I don't believe people are entitled to dictate terms to them, legal restrictions notwithstanding.But in so far as they promise that chats are private, that becomes a contract. If you give them money (consideration) with the impression that your chats with their LLM are private because they communicated that, then they are now contractually bound to honour the terms of that transaction. The terms that they subjected themselves to when either advertising their services or presenting the user with a EULA and/or TOS at the time of transaction.

Here's a thought experiment: you're a gay person living in a country where being gay is illegal and results in a death penalty. You use ChatGPT in a way which makes your sexuality apparent; should OpenAI be allowed to share this query with anyone? Should they be allowed to store it? What if it inadvertently leaks (which has happened before!), or their database gets hacked and dumped, and now the morality police of your country are combing through it looking for criminals like you?Privacy is a fundamental right of every human being; I will gladly die on this hill.

Perhaps they would take in more context naturally - but otherwise it's impossible to act any different.

Now that iOS 26 is available for everyone, iPhone users are breaking off into two camps. One is open to Apple's new look for its entire product ecosystem, dubbed “Liquid Glass” for the translucent “glassmorphic” UI. As is so typical of the internet, the other side of the coin is livid about the change to their devices. Hold off on jumping the gun and retreating back to iOS 18. There are several hidden options that can make your device a little more legible and return the user interface to something more opaque, like on previous iPhone software.

Apple designed its Liquid Glass interface to appear layered, as if the buttons you're tapping on the screen are tangible elements. The effect is as if a glass prism hangs over various design elements, where light refracts and distorts through app icons or menus. This can cause problems with legibility, especially when text in some menus distorts other words underneath it. Apple adjusted the transparency multiple times in beta over the last few months to arrive at the current version that's less glassy and liquidy, but can still be a visual problem at times.

Apple had to deal with similar usability issues back in the age of iOS 7. The iPhone maker rolled out several updates that fixed performance issues and accessibility options to make text more readable. For iOS 26, Apple has several options out of the gate that help reduce the Liquid Glass effect. If you go to Settings, then Accessibility and Display & Text Size, you'll find three settings you can adjust.

“Reduce Transparency” is the closest you can get to removing Liquid Glass altogether. It gets rid of the blur effect on some menus and adds opaque boxes around others. For instance, in Apple Music, the “Now Playing” bar has a white box that takes up the bottom portion of the screen space. If you bring down the Control Center, you won't see nearly the same amount of transparency. If I were most users, I would actually go with the “Increase Contrast” option. This creates a more frosted glass appearance compared to the translucent variety of the regular Liquid Glass. You can see this effect below without these options, with “Reduce Transparency,” and with “Increase Contrast.”

With either option selected, you'll still see the same ripple effect when you swipe from the top left to bring down the lock screen and your notifications. You should also pay attention to new app icon options to really emphasize the new look. If you long-press on the home screen, then hit the Edit button in the top left and then tap Customize, you'll see options for “Clear” or “Tinted” app icons. “Clear” will be incoherent on any lighter background wallpapers, whereas “Tinted” increases the contrast much more. Add in the “Increase Contrast” setting, and your apps will sport less of a 3D effect but still maintain the quasi-glassy look.

I suggest you play around with accessibility settings until you find one that works. Let's face it: whether you love or hate Liquid Glass, most people won't want to move back to older versions of iOS. If you plan to use the new AirPods features on the AirPods Pro 3 or Apple's older earbuds, such as Live Translation and heart rate monitoring, you'll need a device with iOS 26. Want new features to automatically screen incoming calls for spammers and scammers or long-awaited polls in Messages? You'll need to stick with iOS 26.

As for me, I'm already faced with idiosyncrasies of Apple's design. Punching in my code to access my phone is less readable than normal, at least without changing my settings; the odd optical illusion that makes my apps look like they're tilting in the light is unsettling, though to a small degree. I'll accept I won't like everything on the platform as locked down as Apple wants it to be. It will take collective retraining for all of us to accept the changes, as much as we may try to mitigate them.

We may see a U.S.-China deal to keep TikTok alive this week, and details on how that long-delayed agreement could come together are steadily trickling out.

The exact terms are yet to be unveiled, but based on initial public statements from the two countries' representatives, it's likely to include a U.S. spin-off of the highly popular social media app that would be owned by several American investors and would continue to rely on the Chinese algorithm running the platform.

The biggest cog in China-U.S. talks over the TikTok ban was the much-coveted and highly addictive TikTok algorithm. The algorithm is what has made TikTok so successful, and Chinese officials have been reluctant to give that up to U.S. control, leaving onlookers questioning what value the app would have without it.

On the other end of discussions, the U.S. wanted the app's algorithm to be completely severed from China-based parent company ByteDance over worries that it gave China a powerful tool of influence over Americans and their data.

But it seems that particular issue may have been resolved.

Wang Jingtao, deputy head of China's cyber security regulator, told reporters on Monday that the “framework” that the Trump administration bragged about reaching with its counterparts earlier this week will include “licensing TikTok's algorithm and other intellectual property rights,” and that parent company ByteDance would “entrust the operation of TikTok's U.S. user data and content security.”

People familiar with the matter told the Financial Times that TikTok was developing a standalone U.S app and that it would only be partially reliant on the Chinese algorithm. The algorithm would instead be exported to the U.S., where it would be trained by American companies using American user data.

Congress passed a law under the Biden administration to ban the app or force its sale to an American company back in 2024 over cybersecurity concerns. The deal was supposed to go into full effect in January, but Trump has repeatedly pushed the deadline, even though he was the President who initially got the ball rolling on a TikTok ban during his first administration. The deadline was extended three times and is now on Sept. 17, which is this coming Wednesday.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that the U.S. and China had reached “a framework for a TikTok deal” amid trade talks in Madrid, Spain. The finalized details of that agreement are expected to be unveiled after Trump meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday.

Bessent told Reuters on Tuesday that the details on the commercial terms with the new American investors still need to be ironed out, but declined to elaborate on what that means.

If a “magic mushroom” edible ever took you on a psychedelic trip, you might be in for a surprise. There's a high chance that what you ate didn't have any psilocybin—the chemical compound that gives the fungi their “magic.”

In a paper published September 11 in JAMA Network Open, researchers reported that an analysis of 12 magic mushroom gummies and chocolates sold in Portland found no trace of psilocybin. Instead, the edibles contained undisclosed ingredients, including caffeine, cannabis extract, and synthetic psychedelics that haven't undergone regulatory testing.

“We found no evidence of mushroom compounds of any kind coming from any species,” Richard van Breemen, study co-author and a pharmaceutical sciences expert at Oregon State University, told Scientific American.

This unchecked mislabeling may be a product of the excitement around psilocybin's potential use in treating a range of mental health conditions, van Breemen added in a university statement. But the research hasn't advanced enough for experts to confirm that's truly the case.

“Any new drug entity requires years of development to evaluate human safety and efficacy,” he explained. “Premature exposure to these compounds poses significant public health risks due to unknown pharmacology and toxicity.”

Psilocybin in magic mushroom species causes visual hallucinations when consumed in sufficient doses. It's classified as a Schedule I drug, meaning that it “has a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision,” according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Several states have decriminalized psilocybin, with efforts to legalize the drug advancing across the country. A smaller number, Colorado, New Mexico, and Oregon—where the researchers purchased the edibles for research—allow assisted adult use of the drug under strict conditions. However, legal channels are quite expensive, with a recent study reporting the price range from $750 to $1,200.

“A lot of people are very curious about these substances,” Mason Marks, a legal expert on psychedelics at Florida State University who was not involved in the study, told Scientific American. “And if you're in a state, like Oregon, that does not decriminalize them, people might go to these shops and buy these products that are either blatantly illegal or kind of in this gray area.”

Such cheap, accessible edibles were what van Breemen and his colleagues purchased and analyzed for the new study. First, the team sent the samples to a state-licensed facility that certifies drug quality for legal psilocybin centers in Oregon. Surprisingly, the tests revealed that the edibles contained no psilocybin.

Back at the lab, the researchers tried to pinpoint what, then, was in these so-called magic mushroom edibles. By employing some analytical chemistry, they found that the edibles contained many unexpected ingredients, including compounds like tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.

The team did identify psilocin, a naturally occurring compound in psychedelic mushrooms, in two gummies. But if the psilocin had truly come from mushrooms, the researchers would have found other related compounds—which they didn't. That strongly suggests the psilocin was lab-made, they said.

That wasn't all. Some of the brands also had an unlisted addition of “syndelics,” or synthetic psychedelics that mimic natural, psychoactive compounds. Their effects on human health haven't been properly studied, van Breemen added—which makes their hidden presence in these easily accessible edibles ever more alarming.

“Advances in analytical chemistry are needed to detect new syndelics and other adulterants in consumer products,” van Breemen said. The next steps, he added, will be for science “to expose misbranding, to support law enforcement and regulatory agencies, and to assist poison control centers and hospitals as they encounter overdoses caused by unknown compounds.”

The old debate of form over function remains true with iOS 26 and the final version that launched for all iPhones today. There's all but a faint whiff of that long-promised Apple Intelligence, though you'll still find plenty to love and more to complain about with the switch from iOS 18 all the way to the “26” generation.

Remember to set aside some storage on iPhone, as the update will demand a good chunk. iOS 26 showed up as 6GB for me on my iPhone 14 Pro, coming from version iOS 18.6. (Apple is also pushing out iOS 18.7 today.) Our senior editor, Raymond Wong, got the update on his iPhone 16 Pro and noted it was 14.9GB. So your mileage will vary depending on your device and software version.

Along with iOS 26, Apple also released iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and all the rest. The iPhone 17 lineup, from the 17 Pros to the Air, will come preinstalled with the new software update when those new phones launch on Sept. 19. Every Apple product now shares a similar design language centered on the “Liquid Glass” look. The UI is full of semi-transparent windows and bubbles that can distort and contort text and images underneath it, as if you were looking through a convex glass lens. It's a means of separating the controls from the content itself. The changes are both subtle and overt. For instance, the “Search” button on iPhones may blend more into your background wallpaper. In apps like Apple Music, the “Now Playing” bar will display a hint of the album artwork underneath it.

See Apple Products at Amazon

The iOS 26 release may be the most controversial since the drastic changes made to iOS 7 back in 2013. Users didn't appreciate having to watch short animations before getting into their apps. Many complained about the UI hiding useful buttons, making it harder for power users to find the right tools for the job. Despite the controversy, skeuomorphism—where Apple tried incorporating more familiar images and designs, such as the battery image representing battery life—still remains to this day. That brings us to now and the emphasis on “glassmorphism,” emphasizing opaque windows for a pseudo-3D effect.

As somebody who has used multiple versions of the iPadOS 26 and macOS 26 betas extensively during the beta period this past summer, I appreciated some design changes more than others. Apple removing the opaque layer for the menu bar at the top of the Mac screen helps make the screen feel larger without sacrificing functionality. Spotlight has also been beefed up to take actions directly in apps like Messages without having to click on the icon and type out your text to a recipient. The Mac is now more connected to the iPhone than ever with Live Activities, letting you monitor iPhone notifications without unlocking and fiddling with the device. Clicking on those notifications also opens up the iPhone Mirroring, a feature that was introduced in last year's macOS Sequoia. It's not all great, however. There's no more Launchpad available in the dock, and to bring it back you need to muck around in Terminal. Instead, you're granted an “Apps” folder that is overloaded with all your iPhone apps in addition to those you installed on Mac.

macOS 26 also sports a few more minor additions, like the largely ineffectual Game Overlay. All that functionality is now bedecked in the translucent layer of glass, from your app icons to the Control Center. The real innovation was saved for Apple's tablets. The iPad is now far more usable as a dedicated laptop replacement for all your tasks. Apple added the ability to have multiple apps open on-screen at once. You can tile them just by flicking them to the right or left side of the screen. If you want to watch YouTube and type up your notes, it's now easier than the previous Stage Manager or dual-screen solutions.

Apple has fine-tuned Liquid Glass from its initial dev beta into the public beta and again for the final release. The early versions were practically incoherent, especially with text layered over text. Follow-up betas dialed back some of the glass and liquid effect for a more “frosted glass” aesthetic. The latest public betas honed in on the current design, where you can catch a hint of content underneath menus, as if staring into a pool of glassy water. The effect wants to evoke something tangible, like you're doing more than scrolling pixels on a pane of glass. After months of playing with all the various betas, I still would prefer a version of Liquid Glass that matches up to the name.

Regular Apple users who use their iPhone for little more than accessing their camera or their TikTok feeds may not understand the hate, but the most-dedicated iPhone aficionados may grow impatient with the new design. Critics say Liquid Glass distracts you from the functions of each app. Some developers publicly lambasted the new design that sticks important functionality behind hamburger menus (those three horizontal bars that open up drop-down menus). Then again, that's a fact of life for living in Apple's ecosystem. The company is more concerned with devices that focus apps for specific use types.

Inevitably, you'll run up against a single instance where the glass garbles words or distracts you from an important part of a text or email. In that moment, you'll wish to scrap the entire exercise, decry Apple's hubris, and wish to switch back to iOS 18. After those fleeting moments where the raw hate overflows, you'll just keep using your devices the way you always have.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Plagued by Parts Shortage and EV Demand Uncertainty, GM Prepares for Layoffs","https://gizmodo.com/gm-prepares-for-layoffs-2000658946","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:30:54 GMT","

Automotive giant General Motors is preparing for layoffs at its assembly plant in Wentzville, Missouri.

Although the layoffs will be temporary, the majority of the workers at the plant will be affected, according to a letter sent to employees by the plant's executive director and the local UAW representative.

GM's Wentzville plant builds the company's Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon mid-size trucks, as well as the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana full-size vans. The latter two are some of GM's longest-running offerings and were rumored to be due for a complete EV revamp by 2026, but GM walked back on those plans, according to GMAuthority.

The reason for the temporary layoff—expected to last between September 29 and October 19—is a parts shortage.

GM didn't respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo. We'll update this post when we receive a reply.

The parts shortage is only the latest in a string of headwinds for GM, the major one being the Trump administration's attack on the electric vehicle industry that caused the automotive giant to reevaluate its electrification strategy.

One of Donald Trump's first courses of action as President was to initiate the repeal process of an electric vehicle consumer tax credit worth $7,500. Although the current tax credit was passed as part of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, an EV tax credit has existed in one form or another for more than a decade.

The tax credits are set to expire on September 30, plunging the electric vehicle industry into the great unknown.

That unknown caused GM to cut output at a major electric vehicle assembly plant, temporarily lay off workers, and indefinitely delay a shift at a Kansas City assembly plant that was set to produce electric Chevy Bolts later this year, Reuters reported in September.

Back in 2021, GM made a significant commitment to completely electrify its fleet of vehicles by 2035. A major roadblock for that vision has since arrived in the form of Trump-era EV policies.

According to CEO Mary Barra's comments from last week, electric vehicles are still the company's “north star.” Previously floundering demand is now looking up, too: sales of used electric vehicles rose 40% from last year in July, and GM's own electric vehicle sales jumped to an all-time monthly record in August.

The company shared in a press release that although they are expecting strong demand in September as well, sales will “no doubt” be lower after the tax credits end.

“It may take several months for the market to normalize. We will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won't overproduce,” Duncan Aldred, president of GM's North America business, said in the press release.

The upcoming uncertainty is not just a test for GM, but a test for the U.S. at large. While EV demand flutters in the U.S. and Washington repeals key support for the industry, Chinese EV-makers like BYD enjoy government support as they ambitiously expand operations and global influence.

The demand might be slow-coming in the U.S. due to many reasons (one of which undoubtedly is the lack of EV charging infrastructure), but experts believe the future is still very much electric. Goldman Sachs analysts shared last year that they expect electric vehicles to make up 50% of global new car sales by 2035.

The generative AI industry has promised to “disrupt” society, and on that front, it can be said to have succeeded. AI has certainly disrupted many parts of society, including education, social media, and politics. Most of all, it seems to have disrupted the tech industry itself, where what was once a profitable career (software development) increasingly seems to be more of a precarious one, thanks to the rise of so-called “vibe coding”—a form of AI-assisted software development that requires less experience and more automation.

This whole vibe coding thing doesn't seem to be working out for companies, however, as generating code via an LLM prompt at breakneck speed can, predictably, lead to less-than-stellar work. Now, in an ironic twist, it seems that, having dispensed with more skilled coders for the cheap effectiveness of a chatbot-aided code monkey, companies are having to hire additional contractors to fix the AI's screw-ups.

404 Media writes about the rise of an entire new class of coders, dubbed the “vibe coding cleanup specialists,” who can swoop in to fix the problems that AI-generated code creates for companies. The outlet cites one description shared with them by a specialist, who said his particular expertise was to “polish” up codebases that might be a little rough around the edges:

“I've been offering vibe coding fixer services for about two years now, starting in late 2023. Currently, I work with around 15-20 clients regularly, with additional one-off projects throughout the year,” Hamid Siddiqi, who offers to “review, fix your vibe code” on Fiverr, told me in an email. “I started fixing vibe-coded projects because I noticed a growing number of developers and small teams struggling to refine AI-generated code that was functional but lacked the polish or ‘vibe' needed to align with their vision. I saw an opportunity to bridge that gap, combining my coding expertise with an eye for aesthetic and user experience.”

Siddiqi told 404 that he commonly assists companies with “inconsistent UI/UX design in AI-generated frontends, poorly optimized code that impacts performance, misaligned branding elements, and features that function but feel clunky or unintuitive.” Yet another cleanup specialist, Swatantra Sohni, told the outlet that they think AI is being leveraged by people who don't otherwise have the digital skills to build products. The results are predictable:

“Most of these vibe coders, either they are product managers or they are sales guys, or they are small business owners, and they think that they can build something,” Sohni told me. “So for them it's more for prototyping. Vibe coding is, at the moment, kind of like infancy. It's very handy to convey the prototype they want, but I don't think they are really intended to make it like a production grade app.”

It's unclear how widely these services are being offered, but given the rising popularity of vibe-coding amongst small businesses, it seems likely that it would be a growing market. As with many other AI-led industries, humans are still necessary after all.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:tomshardware.com","Nvidia tipped to be TSMC's first 16A customer, ahead of Apple — Feynman GPUs could make full use of GAA transistors and backside power","https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/nvidia-dethrones-apple-to-debut-tsmc-a16","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 10:17:43 GMT","

 

For the first time, an AI GPU will launch on TSMC's bleeding edge. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia will be the first customer to use TSMC's A16 node, a 1.6nm-class process that marries gate-all-around (GAA) transistors with backside power delivery, according to China's Commercial Times. This is no small change in tradition: For more than a decade, Apple has been the one to break in each new process node from TSMC, with its iPhone SoCs serving as the high-volume anchor tenant.

But that tradition ends here. A16's first customer isn't building phones; its chips are designed for AI and other applications with extreme power delivery requirements. As TSMC's first commercial node to integrate backside power delivery — which lifts power rails off the front and routes them through the back of the wafer — the foundry is pitching A16 as the natural progression from its N2 process.

If reports that Nvidia plans to skip this N2 process for its upcoming Feynman architecture in favor of A16 are true, that could make Feynman the first GPU, and the first chip of any kind, to combine GAA and backside power in production. Nvidia has historically waited for process maturity before adopting new nodes. Hopper was on TSMC's 4N, not N5, and Blackwell's data center products use 4NP. Feynman potentially changes that by putting Nvidia at the bleeding edge, ahead of even Apple, suggesting that the company views AI as the driver of its most advanced silicon.

A16 is more than a shrink. It's the first TSMC process to feature both GAA nanosheet transistors and backside power delivery. By shifting power delivery to the backside, signal routing on the front side becomes less constrained, reducing congestion and improving performance. Power reaches the transistors via a shorter, less resistive path, thereby reducing voltage drop and enabling higher frequencies or tighter integration.

TSMC claims that A16 delivers 8-10% higher speed or 15-20% lower power compared to baseline N2, plus a modest 7-10% density gain. The real benefit isn't in the numbers, but rather what they unlock. With more available routing and cleaner power, large chips like GPUs gain new architectural freedom with wider cores, larger caches, more AI engines, and better scaling.

And because backside power delivery frees front-side metal for signals, it simplifies high-density hybrid bonding on the top surface. This makes 3D-stacked cache or vertically integrated SRAM more practical, and eases front-side congestion around wide I/O like HBM physical layers (PHYs), provided the design also employs fine-pitch hybrid bonding and adequate thermal mitigation at the package level.

 




Nvidia's decision to lead with A16 suggests that GPU designs are now pressing against front-side power delivery limits on advanced nodes. Moving power to the backside shortens the supply path and frees front-side interconnect, mitigating IR drop and routing congestion that become bottlenecks. In other words, these factors are turning backside power delivery into an architectural necessity for AI and HPC applications.

It also helps Nvidia leapfrog the competition. AMD is reportedly targeting standard 2nm for its next-gen EPYC and MI400-class accelerators. Intel's 18A node is also expected to offer backside power through PowerVia around the same time. By moving straight to A16, Nvidia avoids this middle ground entirely and could potentially land with a full node advantage over its rivals with a chip based on Feynman architecture as early as 2028.

Naturally, gaining this edge won't be cheap. Wafer pricing for A16 is rumored to exceed $30,000 based on N2 pricing, which far exceeds Apple's typical wafer costs. But for Nvidia, where a single AI GPU can retail for tens of thousands, that premium might be easier to absorb. More importantly, Nvidia is betting that the node's density and efficiency gains will more than offset the cost and lock in the company's lead for the second half of the decade.

Handing A16's debut to Nvidia is a calculated shift for Nvidia. While Apple remains a major partner and is still expected to adopt baseline N2 for its 2026 iPhone 18 chips, Nvidia's AI chips offer faster demand growth and a use case that showcases the A16's strengths. AI chips are power hungry, bandwidth-constrained behemoths sensitive to layout limitations — and A16 has been built to address all these things.

It's also not unthinkable to see this as a hedge against Intel. With its 18A process approaching, which also features a backside power solution, TSMC needs a flagship customer to prove it can execute at the same or higher level. Getting Feynman out the door on A16 before Intel gets any third-party 18A designs will help to reinforce TSMC's leadership.

If Feynman on A16 is a success, it will ultimately set the tone for the next generation of AI silicon. Nvidia will have proven that backside power is not just viable but essential for extreme compute. That could force AMD, Intel, and others to accelerate their own roadmap decisions or risk falling behind on performance.

It may also reshape how packaging and architectures evolve. Designers will need new thermal models and power domain strategies to work with backside power delivery. Still, Nvidia's status as the first to move in this territory will give it a leg-up in tooling and methodology — advantages that are difficult to copy.

Built on a standard CMOS process and packed into three racks, Quantum Motion's silicon spin-qubit machine is ready to be tested.

A UK start-up says that it has built the world's first full-stack quantum computer using the same silicon chip technology used in laptops and phones, and it has already been installed at the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC).

Quantum Motion, a 2017 spinout from University College London and Oxford, unveiled the three-rack system on September 15 as part of a government-backed push to commercialize scalable quantum hardware. Built entirely on a conventional CMOS process, the machine is being pitched as “quantum computing's silicon moment,” which can be fabricated in commercial foundries and dropped into existing server infrastructure.

At least, that's the idea. Unlike superconducting or photonic systems, Quantum Motion's system is built around a silicon spin-qubit processor, housed in a tileable architecture that is designed to scale. The company says that the entire stack, including cryogenics and control systems, fits into three standard 19-inch racks. It also supports existing software frameworks like Qiskit and Cirq, allowing developers to build and run quantum workloads without having to reinvent the tooling.

But for all the talk of standard chips and data center form factors, the company hasn't revealed any data that actually demonstrates performance. There's no disclosed qubit count, no gate fidelities, no coherence times, and no early benchmarks. There's also no confirmation of how — or whether — the system handles error mitigation or connectivity scaling, the key hurdles facing every current quantum platform.

It's also not the first system to show up at the NQCC. Oxford Ionics installed a trapped-ion setup earlier this year, and several other UK projects are contributing hardware and firmware under the national program. What Quantum Motion is claiming is not first-to-ship, but first to build a full-stack quantum machine entirely using standard silicon CMOS manufacturing, and to fit the whole thing into a datacenter-friendly rack footprint.

Most current-gen quantum systems live in fridge-sized enclosures and require bespoke power, plumbing, and thermal integration. Getting that down to three racks, including the dilution fridge, is a notable engineering win. But without published specs or real workloads, it's impossible to know how far the platform goes beyond being a neat demonstration. That's now up to the NQCC, which will validate and test the system in the coming months.

The GPU landscape has been buzzing with fresh offerings from all three major desktop GPU brands: Nvidia, AMD, and Intel. All three major manufacturers have completed their current family of GPUs, so we can expect more variants or refreshes in the future.

With the mid-range offerings from both Nvidia and AMD recently hitting the market in the form of the RTX 5050 and RX 9060, both Team Green and Red now have their eyes set on future architectures and technologies.

With so much excitement around new chips and architectures, what's next for all three companies? We break down everything you need to know about their upcoming plans. We will keep this page consistently updated with the latest information to hand, with accurate sourcing and no rumors.

Currently, the Nvidia RTX 50 series represents the consumer manifestation of the Blackwell architecture, which introduced significant architectural enhancements focused on neural rendering, AI acceleration, and ray tracing performance. Built on TSMC's 4NP process node, the Blackwell consumer GPUs highlighted an uplift in AI-accelerated workloads across desktop and laptop platforms. But it wasn't a huge leap in performance across the board.

Nvidia RTX 50 series GPUs utilize TSMC's custom 4NP process technology, an enhanced variant of the foundry's N4P production node specifically tailored for Nvidia's requirements. This is a continuation of TSMC's 5nm-class manufacturing family, prioritizing mature process reliability over bleeding-edge node adoption, which allows for some degree of cost control.

 




The Blackwell consumer architecture incorporates fundamental architectural improvements over Ada Lovelace, including doubled integer math throughput per clock cycle through fully unified FP32 and INT32 cores. The streaming multiprocessor (SM) design has been completely reengineered, with each SM containing 128 CUDA cores, four fifth-generation Tensor cores, one fourth-generation RT core, and four texture units alongside 256KB register files and configurable 128KB L1/shared memory.

The post-Blackwell era of Nvidia consumer graphics signals a strong shift toward neural rendering-first design philosophy, with three major architectural generations positioned to push the envelope on desktop and laptop GPU capabilities through 2029.

The Rubin, Rubin Ultra, and Feynman architectures plan to incorporate advanced manufacturing processes, next-generation memory technologies, and AI acceleration, which are likely to land in future desktop GPUs.

Nvidia's Rubin architecture is expected to be the first consumer GPU generation manufactured on TSMC's 3nm-class process technology. Projected to debut in late 2026 with the RTX 60 series, Rubin will likely transition from TSMC's 4NP node utilized by Blackwell to the more advanced N3P process, delivering significant improvements in transistor density and power efficiency.

As anticipated, the Rubin consumer GPU, powered by TSMC's 3nm node, might provide approximately 15% increased transistor density compared to the 4nm process used for RTX 50 series GPUs. This transition enables TSMC to deliver a claimed 10-15% performance improvement at equivalent power consumption, or offer a 20-30% power reduction at equivalent performance levels. However, whether or not that will hold will have to be confirmed by Nvidia itself.

Rubin GPUs are expected to debut multiple dies: a flagship (e.g., RB102) for top-end cards (RTX 6090), and cut-down dies (RB103/RB104, etc.) for RTX 6080/6070/6060 series. Consumer variants will likely follow the pattern seen in Blackwell and Ada Lovelace.

Expect the largest die for halo product, and cut-down dies for enthusiast/mainstream cards. Laptop variants will use further cut-down dies or lower TDP (Max-Q) implementations. Since Nvidia is continually shifting die cut-downs between generations, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly which might end up turning into a specific GPU class.

 




Data center Rubin dies are targeting up to 1,800W per AI chip at the highest configuration. However, consumer desktop models will likely be dramatically lower.

To make an educated guess, the projected desktop power demand puts the flagship RTX 6090 likely in the 450–600W range, scaling down to 200W or less for mainstream models. This is an extrapolation from Blackwell and Ada Lovelace scaling, with increased efficiency due to being powered by a 3nm node.

Nvidia has confirmed that Rubin will use HBM4 in the data center. However, memory configurations for consumer Rubin GPUs are expected to utilize faster GDDR7 variants or potentially introduce GDDR7X memory technology, offering substantial bandwidth improvements over current GDDR7 implementations.

Nvidia's Rubin architecture for desktops is anticipated to be available for the consumer GeForce lineup (RTX 60 series). There is no official indication that Rubin is data center-only; Nvidia's executive statements and annual release cadence strongly point toward the lineup's release.

Rubin production is on track for H2 2026, per official Nvidia statements and refuted delay rumors. Consumer cards are expected to be available in late 2026 or early 2027, as of the time of writing.

Following Rubin, there is no official confirmation about the consumer implementation of future architectures announced at GTC 2025, as Nvidia is traditionally an enterprise-first company. However, the architectures (Rubin Ultra and Feynman) may be used in consumer GPUs.

Feynman, like Volta (2017), may remain data center-only, but all current Nvidia statements suggest consumer implementations are planned.

Rubin Ultra, scheduled for the second half of 2027, is slated to be the successor of Rubin. At the data center level, this architecture implements quad-die GPU configurations within single packages, dramatically increasing computational density.

Rubin Ultra's quad-die implementation requires advanced packaging technologies. Whether or not this layout trickles down to consumer GPUs remains to be seen. Consumer implementations will likely utilize cost-optimized packaging approaches while maintaining the performance advantages of multi-die, or chiplet architectures.

 




The gate-all-around field-effect transistor (GAAFET) technology implementation in TSMC's 2nm variant, expected for Rubin Ultra and possibly Feynman, represents a significant departure from FinFET designs, offering enhanced optimization flexibility for either performance or efficiency targets.

Data center implementations of Rubin Ultra are currently planned to have HBM4/HBM4e memory, but it is unlikely that HBM will end up being the VRAM type used in consumer GPUs based on the Rubin Ultra and Feynman architectures.

Feynman is the company's most advanced GPU generation currently planned. Limited official information exists regarding Feynman's consumer specifications, though data center roadmaps provide architectural insights that may apply to consumer implementations.

Feynman will likely utilize either TSMC's 2nm node (N2) or potentially Intel's advanced foundry processes, including 18A or 14A nodes. The architecture will likely incorporate seventh-generation Tensor cores and sixth-generation RT cores. Details on Feynman are still light, with Nvidia expected to reveal further details at future events.

Regarding an anticipated launch timeline, Rubin Ultra may launch in the second half of 2027, while Feynman GPUs are still very far off, so don't expect anything sporting the architecture until H2 2028 / H1 2029, at the very earliest. Be sure to take these dates with a dose of salt, as nothing is confirmed until Nvidia itself says so.

AMD unveiled its RDNA 4 architecture in January 2025, followed by the RX 9000 series of cards in early March. AMD's primary goal this generation was to target the mainstream with GPUs, in quantity, that were both affordable and performed well.

Departing from its iconic ‘XX00' naming style in favor of the ‘X0X0' convention for the mainstream, aligned AMD's branding style with Nvidia. AMD also elected not to introduce any enthusiast-class GPUs with RDNA 4. As such, the RX 9070 XT, which likely utilizes the fully-enabled Navi 48 chip (referred to internally as Navi 48 XTX), represents the most powerful GPU we'll get with RDNA 4.

AMD has confirmed ongoing R&D for post-RDNA 4 architectures in several presentations, emphasizing continuous improvements in compute density and AI acceleration. Codenames are not yet public, but technical documentation references “Next-Gen RDNA” under the “Growth Driver” umbrella.

AMD's discrete GPU strategy beyond the current RDNA 4 (RX 9000 series) generation centers on a significant architectural transition, moving from the established Radeon DNA (RDNA) lineage towards a potentially unified architecture, internally designated GFX13. Crucially, AMD has publicly confirmed the development of an architecture following RDNA 4 during its Financial Analyst Day 2022 and subsequent roadmap updates, though specific branding (RDNA 5 vs. UDNA) remains officially unclarified.

 




While AMD roadmaps historically labeled this successor ""RDNA 5,"" current industry reports suggest a potential rebranding to ""UDNA"" (Unified DNA). This signifies a strategic shift towards a single architecture foundation targeting both consumer gaming (replacing RDNA) and compute/data center workloads (replacing CDNA).

AMD publicly emphasizes the challenge and resource drain of maintaining two distinct architectures (RDNA for gaming, CDNA for compute). A unified UDNA architecture aims to simplify the software stack (particularly ROCm), improve memory optimization consistency, and enhance forward/backward compatibility across the products, from laptops to servers.

AMD aims to streamline development, hardware design, and software optimization by adopting a consistent core Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) design reminiscent of the pre-RDNA Graphics Core Next (GCN) lineage, enabling compatibility across consumer gaming, AI workloads, and professional compute workloads alike.

 




Crucially, UDNA is expected to be fabricated on TSMC's 3nm-class manufacturing node (N3 or N3E). This will represent a substantial leap in transistor density and power efficiency over RDNA 4's 5nm process node.

AMD has publicly stated that improving ray tracing performance is a core focus for future generations. RDNA 5/UDNA is projected to feature significantly redesigned Ray Accelerators, potentially moving more fixed-function hardware into the pipeline to alleviate shader engine burden and dramatically increase ray intersection throughput compared to RDNA 4.

The UDNA architecture may also see AMD shift back from monolithic to a chiplet-based design, optimizing manufacturing yields and enabling finer die cutdowns. AMD already employs a technique allowing it to produce more SKUs from a single silicon design through a technique named asymmetric harvesting. Potentially using this, can expect a range from 96 CUs all the way down to 32 CUs for UDNA, with GDDR7 memory being the VRAM technology of choice.

We expect UDNA to debut in late 2026. Broader availability across desktop segments and mobile variants (RX 10000M series) might arrive in Q1-Q2 2027. However, this remains unconfirmed. We expect to hear official details on UDNA at AMD's 2025 Financial Analyst Day in November 2025.

Intel officially launched its second-generation discrete GPU family, namely Battlemage (Xe2), with the Arc B580 and Arc B570 in December 2024 and January 2025, respectively. Despite some teething issues, these GPUs were surprisingly capable, affordable, and generously equipped with 12GB/10GB of VRAM, capacities that are unheard of in the $250 market.

Intel has officially established its commitment to discrete graphics beyond the current Battlemage generation, with Co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus confirming at CES 2025 that Intel remains ""very committed to the discrete graphics market"" and will ""continue to make strategic investments"".

With the Battlemage (Xe2 architecture) now deployed, Intel's roadmap extends through the Xe3 ""Celestial"" and Xe4 ""Druid"" architectures, representing significant steps in Intel's GPU design and manufacturing strategy.

 




Intel Fellow Tom Petersen confirmed in December 2024 that the Xe3 Celestial architecture has been finalized, with hardware design locked and the development team transitioning to Xe4 development. Intel has not disclosed full architectural details, but Xe3 builds on Xe2's vector engines with projected refinements in compute throughput and cache hierarchies.

Celestial has progressed to pre-silicon validation as of May 2025, with Intel's OEM partners conducting virtual GPU testing for firmware development. Based on Intel's validation timeline, Celestial is expected to enter volume production by late 2025 or early 2026.

Celestial will initially debut as integrated graphics within Intel's Panther Lake mobile processors, likely utilizing Intel's 18A process node. While Intel has not officially disclosed the target process node, its alignment with the Panther Lake CPU platform (built on Intel 18A) suggests a high probability that the initial Celestial variants will utilize the same node.

Intel's focus on AI acceleration suggests higher memory capacities will be prioritized to support emerging AI inference workloads alongside traditional gaming applications.

Discrete Celestial GPUs are not expected until after the architecture debuts in integrated form within Panther Lake mobile CPUs. Based on typical development cycles, volume production of discrete Celestial GPUs might not begin until late 2026, with availability beginning in early 2027. However, this remains unconfirmed until Intel itself offers up more information.

 




For Xe4 Druid, Intel has confirmed hardware work is underway, as Petersen noted, ""The hardware teams are off on to the next thing (Xe4)"". This architecture is projected as a modular redesign, potentially incorporating hybrid tiles for graphics and media, as hinted in Intel's June 2025 leaks on Nova Lake iGPUs using Xe3/Xe4 combinations, though discrete details are absent.

Petersen also noted that Intel's development lifecycles can exceed one year, meaning that it's likely that we won't see this particular architecture materialize for desktop system use for quite some time, so don't hold your breath for Druid until 2026, or beyond.

We will continue to keep this page updated as soon as we hear any official details.

Some believe they were let go because of complaints over working conditions and compensation.

Google has laid off over 200 contractors who worked on improving its AI product offerings, Gemini, and search AI overviews, according to Wired. Some were told it was part of a ""ramp-down"" on the project they were working on, but others believe it was due to complaints made over pay and working conditions. These laid-off contractors join hundreds of other AI-related contractors who have been fired from other major AI firms like xAI and Meta in recent months.

For the first half of 2025, AI growth was everywhere, and all the major companies were spending big to try to get ahead. Meta was offering individuals hundreds of millions to join its ranks, and entire companies were swallowed up in the race to be the first to the next big development in AI technology. But while announcements of enormous industry deals continue, there's also a lot of talk of contraction, particularly when it comes to lower-level positions like data annotation and AI response rating.

In the case of Google's latest firings, the contractors mostly worked at GlobalLogic, a software developer owned by Hitachi. Per the report, workers on the 'super rater' program were required to have either a PhD or a master's, and were tasked with moderating AI responses.

Google seemingly didn't need that expertise any longer, though. It has reportedly been working on developing an AI model for rating AI responses, though it's not clear if that's matured enough to take over what the human raters were doing. The Wired report even cites some workers worried ""they are being set up to replace themselves.""

Instead, many of them believe that it is their complaints over compensation that lead to them being laid off. Wired states that workers ""attempted to unionize"" earlier in the year to no avail. According to the report, ""they allege that the company has retaliated against them."" Two have filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board. For its part, Google said in a statement that GlobalLogic is responsible for the working conditions of its employees.

AI developmental companies have been repeatedly accused of using underpaid human workers to classify AI data and rate responses to improve their services. The company Meta invested almost $15 billion to poach their CEO, ScaleAI, was accused of using low-paid workers in Southeast Asian countries to build out its data annotation services. After Meta bought a 49% stake in the company, over 200 of its staff were cut.

Just a few days ago, xAI also announced it was laying off around a third of its data annotation team, amounting to over 500 workers. However, unlike Google, company messaging suggests this is to pivot towards more specialist AI trainers.

That may mean employment opportunities for some of the AI trainers Google let go, but it does make it clear what a shaky industry this is to get into. The big AI developers don't appear to have a coherent strategy for how to improve their products in the near term and are taking different approaches in doing so.

All the firings come in stark contrast to the major AI developer hiring sprees that companies like Meta went on earlier this year. While low-paid data annotators may have limited employment prospects at the big firms, there is less concern over hiring big names and rising stars for hundreds of millions of dollars.

Although Meta and others have seriously slowed their spending in recent weeks, massive expansion projects in the AI industry continue unabated.

The balance between estrogen and androgens plays a role in blood pressure (BP) regulation apart from the absolute hormone levels alone, according to new data from a review of 14 studies presented at the American Heart Association's Hypertension Scientific Sessions (HYP) 2025.

The recognition of sex-based differences in BP regulation is increasing, but the role of sex hormones in hypertension remains underexplored, said lead author Vyom J. Patel, DO, internal medicine resident at Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, in an interview. “Our study aimed to systematically examine how hormonal status or treatment influences blood pressure, especially in populations undergoing major hormonal shifts like menopause or androgen suppression,” he said.

Patel and colleagues identified 14 studies, including four randomized controlled trials and 10 observational studies. The study populations included postmenopausal women, women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and men receiving antiandrogen therapy.

Overall, women had generally lower BP than men prior to menopause; however, in postmenopausal women, decreased estrogen was associated with increased BP, as was PCOS.

Across the randomized controlled trials, estrogen replacement therapy was associated with a slight decrease in BP in women compared to that in men, whereas use of oral contraception was associated with a slight increase in BP.

In men, antiandrogen therapy was associated with a slight decrease in BP.

“We were somewhat surprised by the variability in outcomes across studies, especially the inconsistent effects of hormone therapy,” said Patel. “This underscores the complexity of hormonal pathways in cardiovascular regulation and highlights the need for more targeted research,” he said.

In practice, clinicians should consider sex and hormonal status when evaluating and treating hypertension, Patel said. “While hormone-based therapies show potential, their effects on blood pressure are modest and context-dependent, so treatment should be individualized,” he added.

The main limitations of the current study were the small number of high-quality randomized trials and the variability across study designs, Patel told Medscape Medical News. “Future research should focus on larger, well-controlled trials that explore specific hormone types, delivery methods, and patient subgroups to better understand who might benefit from hormonal interventions,” he said.

Ongoing studies of the physiologic effects of sex hormones on cardiovascular health are essential for risk-factor modification, said Sabrina Islam, MD, MPH, associate professor of medicine in the cardiology section at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, in an interview.

The current study is important because it examined several populations, including postmenopausal women, men receiving antiandrogen therapy, and women with increased androgen hormone expression, said Islam, who was not involved in the study.

The interplay between sex hormones was intriguing, Islam told Medscape Medical News. The study's attention to the importance of the balance between the hormone levels in addition to the absolute hormone levels emphasized the role of hormonal regulation in the management of high BP, she said.

The study findings highlight the importance of taking sex hormone levels and interactions into account when managing BP, said Islam. “Higher estrogen levels and lower androgen levels appear to allow for lower blood pressure values, although the relationship and absolute levels at which these relationships are noted are inconsistent,” she said.

Further exploration of the relationship between sex hormone levels and BP may help increase the understanding of potential adverse interactions and the need for closer surveillance and may reveal potential therapies in hypertension management, Islam added.

The study received no outside funding. Patel and Islam had no financial conflicts to disclose.

Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) had a more than twofold increased risk for incident sepsis than matched control individuals without T2D. This risk was especially pronounced in men and individuals aged 60 years or younger.

“People living with type 2 diabetes experience double the risk of incident sepsis, but the disparity is more marked in those ≤ 60 years. Modifiable risk factors include smoking and hyperglycemia, but prevention of chronic complications and comorbidities is also imperative,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by W.A. Davis, Medical School, University of Western Australia in Fremantle, Australia. It will be presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2025 Annual Meeting in Vienna, Austria, on September 15-19, 2025.

CT is associated with a modest increased risk for spontaneous pregnancy loss and congenital abnormalities, according to new research published in Annals of Internal Medicine.

In a retrospective observational study, women who underwent CT once up to 1 month before conception had an 8% higher risk for miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or stillbirth than those who did not undergo CT. The figure rose to 14% with two screenings and to 19% with three or more screenings over the same timeframe. 

The study findings “reinforce the importance of minimizing unnecessary radiation exposure, particularly in women planning pregnancy, considering alternative imaging modalities such as ultrasounds and MRIs when appropriate, and upholding rigorous justification protocols for imaging in reproductive-age patients,” said Dushyant Sahani, MD, professor and chair of the Department of Radiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, who was not involved in the study. “These findings are notable, especially in light of longstanding concerns about ionizing radiation and reproductive health.” 

Researchers analyzed data from more than 5 million pregnancies and 3.5 million live births between 1992 and 2023 in Ontario, Canada. Of these, 687,692 had a CT. The median time when women underwent CT was 4 years prior to their conception date. Women were aged 16-45 years (mean age, 29). 

The risk for spontaneous pregnancy loss increased the closer the CT occurred to conception: Those who underwent CT 1-2 months before conception had a 24% higher risk than those who did not. Women in whom CT was performed near the abdomen, pelvis, or lower spine had a slightly higher risk than those screened near their heads. 

CT exposure increased the risk for congenital abnormalities within the first year of life by 6% with one screening, 11% with two screenings, and 15% with three or more screenings. Risks were similar between those who received CT of their abdomen region and of the head, suggesting that the tests may not be the only factor leading to the abnormalities, the researchers said. 

The researchers found that women who underwent CT were more likely to have a comorbidity, including endometriosis (2% vs 9%), pelvic inflammatory disease (2.0% vs 1.4%), thyroid disorders (6.1% vs 4.4%), and hypertension (3.7% vs 1.6%). 

“The concern is that inherently patients who have had CT scans and those who haven't are different in some ways that we can measure and some ways that aren't measurable,” said Camille Simard, MD, MSc, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of General Internal Medicine at Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and lead author of the study. But the findings “lead us to think that there's potentially an association between CT scan before pregnancy and spontaneous pregnancy loss and congenital anomaly.” 

But Simard said she and her colleagues are “in no way suggesting” that clinicians avoid using CT when indicated. 

Amir A. Borhani, MD, associate professor of radiology and surgery at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, who was not involved in the study, said the research should remind clinicians to be more judicious when deciding to order a CT. 

“Some of the clinicians out there are way too comfortable with ordering a CT scan; many times, it's not really indicated,” Borhani said. “I think there is a new culture of ordering CT scans just to cover everything in terms of liability or to look for rare things.” 

This study was funded by Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Canadian Venous Thromboembolism Research Network, the Ontario Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Long-Term Care. Simard, Borhani, and Sahani reported having no disclosures.

Women with a history of successfully treated preterm labour who delivered at term faced a higher risk for preterm birth during the subsequent pregnancy than those who delivered at term without any such history.

""Screening for women at risk of preterm birth is important in the management of their pregnancies, and the identification of risk factors could enable the use of specific interventions that might prove helpful,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Thibaud Quibel, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Poissy-Saint-Germain-En-Laye Hospital, Poissy, France. It was published online on September 09, 2025, in Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica.

The case-control nature of the study may have introduced uncontrolled confounding biases. Cervical length measurements were not obtained for asymptomatic women with previous preterm labour who delivered at term. Healthcare providers were not blinded to cervical length results.

No funding information was provided for this study. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Treatment delays were significantly longer for adult patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) than for those with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), new research showed. Additionally, initiating antihypertensive therapy within 60 minutes increased the odds of discharge by more than sevenfold in patients with ICH.

“The only plausible explanation for delays in ICH treatment compared with AIS treatment is that medical and stroke teams are attuned and trained to meet specific targets for AIS but not for ICH,” the investigators wrote.

“The success of timely administration of IVT should be easily replicated in patients with ICH since antihypertensive agents are equally accessible and, in fact, more commonly used in emergency departments than IVT,” they added.

The study was led by Kara R. Melmed, MD, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York City. It was published online on September 3 in Stroke.

The study was limited by missing data for certain variables and included only academic Comprehensive Stroke Centers, which may not represent all hospitals and patient populations. Additionally, the exclusion of transferred patients and in-hospital stroke events may have created selection bias. The lack of data on early withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment or team perceptions of poor outcomes may have influenced treatment timing decisions. Moreover, the study did not assess long‐term functional outcomes, limiting conclusions about disability.

Several investigators reported having financial ties with various organizations, including pharmaceutical companies, and one reported having a pending patent on stroke wearables. Full details are provided in the original article.

A real-world cohort study showed no difference in efficacy between denosumab and bisphosphonates in treating inpatients with hypercalcemia of malignancy.

“Prospective randomized trials are warranted to confirm these findings.…Until such data are available, our results support the flexibility of selecting any of these agents based on individual patient characteristics and institutional protocols,” study author and presenter Jovan Milosavljevic, MD, of the Albert Einstein School of Medicine, New York City, said.

The study was presented at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) 2025 Annual Meeting.

The study was retrospective and included a small number of patients treated with denosumab. The finding of superiority of denosumab over zoledronic acid was not a primary endpoint.

Among patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), the likelihood of developing pituitary adenomas was higher at younger ages and declined with time. Other key risk factors identified were a history of primary hyperparathyroidism, non-missense MEN1 pathogenic variants, and being a woman.

""[The study] findings could assist clinicians in better informing patients about their individual risk and in guiding personalized PA [pituitary adenoma] screening strategies,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Nuria Valdés, MD, PhD, Hospital Universitario Cruces, Bilbao, Spain. It was published online on September 08, 2025, in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.

This study was retrospective in nature, and findings were derived from a single national registry. Data obtained from referring physicians rather than a centralised core centre may have led to variability and inconsistencies. Advances in MRI technology during the study period may have influenced microadenoma detection rates.

This study did not receive any funding. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Individuals who are simultaneously taking certain antidepressants and beta blockers had a decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) and an increase in their risk for bradycardia, according to new data presented at the American Heart Association's Hypertension Scientific Sessions (HYP) 2025.

“Patients with both cardiovascular and psychiatric conditions often require beta blockers and antidepressants together, but their interactions can alter drug levels significantly, which is why we aimed to systematically quantify these pharmacokinetic effects,” said lead author Inshal Jawed, MD, of Dow Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan, in an interview.

Some serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme, which plays a key role in metabolizing certain beta blockers, and this inhibition may lead to higher plasma concentrations of the drugs and a greater chance that patients will experience adverse events or exaggerated therapeutic effects, the researchers noted.

In a meta-analysis, Jawed and colleagues identified 65 adults older than 20 years with concurrent depression and hypertension who were taking both beta blockers and antidepressants such as SSRIs/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), duloxetine, or bupropion.

The researchers examined data on drug plasma concentrations, clearance, and area under the curve (AUC) to assess the effects of the drug interactions. Overall, the patients on antidepressants and beta blockers showed a 15%-20% decrease in systolic BP and a 25% increased risk for bradycardia. 

On a molecular level, for the interaction between SSRIs and CYP2D6-dependent beta blockers, the AUC increased by 2.55-fold, the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) increased by 1.94-fold, and the half-life increased by 1.94-fold, but there was no change in the time to reach peak concentration of the drug (Tmax).

For the interaction of nebivolol with antidepressants, the AUC increased by 2.76-fold, Cmax increased by 1.67-fold, and half-life increased by 1.80-fold. The effects were even greater for the OH-nebivolol metabolite; AUC increased by 2.59-fold, Cmax by 1.48-fold, and half-life by 2.15-fold, with no significant difference in Tmax. Clinicians should assess drug interactions, dose adjustments, and implement monitoring to ensure optimal outcomes, the researchers concluded.

“We expected interactions, but the magnitude, particularly between the nebivolol and the S enantiomers of beta blockers, was striking,” Jawed told Medscape Medical News. The findings reinforced that these combinations can meaningfully change drug exposure, she added.

However, atenolol and nadolol were not affected by antidepressant medications, the researchers wrote.

In practice, “clinicians should be cautious when prescribing CYP2D6-metabolized beta blockers with SSRIs or other CYP2D6 inhibitors,” Jawed told Medscape Medical News. “Dose adjustment and close monitoring are key, while beta blockers less reliant on hepatic metabolism may be safer alternatives,” she said.

Study limitations included a small population of only 65 participants, which may prevent generalizability, said Jawed. “Larger, prospective clinical studies are needed to confirm these pharmacokinetic changes and assess their impact on real-world patient outcomes.” 

Hypertension and depression are both common in the population and often coexist, and patients should be closely monitored when co-administering these two categories of medications, particularly when adjusting medication dosages, said Sabrina Islam, MD, MPH, associate professor of medicine in the section of cardiology at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, in an interview.

“The key takeaway is that CYP2D6-dependent beta blockers can be upregulated by medications such as SSRIs/SNRIs, which can in turn lead to increased side effects of these medications, including bradycardia and hypotension,” said Islam, who was not involved in the study.

The study findings were not unexpected, but the results can help guide clinical practice by highlighting the two beta blockers (atenolol and nadolol) that have the least interaction with SSRIs/SNRIs, Islam told Medscape Medical News. These drugs can be considered in cases of intolerance to the CYP2D6-dependent beta blockers, she said.

The results were limited by the possible biases inherent in a systematic review, and additional prospective and controlled studies are needed to assess the conclusions, Islam noted. However, studies such as this one are essential not only in educating the healthcare community about the importance of team-based care but also in illustrating the need for discussion among members of the healthcare team, she added.

The study received no outside funding. Jawed and Islam had no financial conflicts to disclose.

Three months of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy reduced fatigue and improved cardiovascular markers in people living with HIV and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), with benefits similar to those observed in individuals without HIV infection.

“Treatment of OSA in PLWH [people living with HIV] can improve fatigue and markers of cardiovascular health, consistent with the effect of PAP treatment of OSA in non-PLWH populations. Therefore, clinicians treating PLWH should consider routinely screening for OSA and, if found, encourage treatment,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by David L. Berry, BS, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep Medicine & Physiology, University of California, San Diego. It was published online on August 26, 2025, in the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes.

Protocol adjustments during the COVID pandemic required reliance on self-reported adherence to PAP instead of objective data. Additionally, the pandemic may have discouraged participation of people living with HIV who had greater comorbidities, potentially affecting the study's generalizability.

This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through its institutes. Some authors reported receiving funding, advisory board fees, consulting fees, and research support from the NIH, the American Heart Association, and other organizations outside the present work.

Vitamin supplements known to potentially slow the progression of intermediate age-related macular degeneration do not seem to have a similar effect on geographic atrophy, an advanced form of the dry or non-neovascular form of the disease, according to an analysis of two pivotal trials.

The study looked at data from the phase 3 OAKS and DERBY trials of pegcetacoplan, which led the FDA in 2023 to approve the drug for geographic atrophy. Led by Robyn Guymer, MBBS, PhD, of The University of Melbourne in Melbourne, Australia, the researchers focused on the effect of a formulation of micronutrients, named for the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), which have been shown to slow the progression from intermediate to advanced age-related macular degeneration and vision loss, most recently with the formulation known as AREDS2 which added lutein and zeaxanthin to the original.

“In the post hoc analysis looking at the AREDS vitamins in the robust dataset that was the OAKS and DERBY geographic atrophy studies, there's no effect on growth toward the fovea, no effect on overall geographic atrophy growth, and no effect on the efficacy of pegcetacoplan or the incidence of exudative age-related macular degeneration,” Guymer said.

The growth of geographic atrophy lesions toward the fovea is a critical factor in evaluating potential vision loss because the fovea is the central part of the macula in the back of the eye that produces the sharpest vision and has the densest concentration of rods and cones. The AREDS2 study group earlier this year reported patients taking oral supplements had slower progression of geographic atrophy lesions toward the fovea, although it found no overall effect on geographic atrophy growth, Guymer said. Those researchers performed a post hoc analysis of both the original AREDS and AREDS2 studies.

The new analysis included 1259 untreated eyes with geographic atrophy, 518 of which were on AREDS or AREDS2 supplementation and 741 were not on the nutrient therapy. The 24-month results in these untreated eyes were virtually the same, but the supplement eyes had a slightly greater (34 µm) overall growth of geographic atrophy (P = .1244).

In a subgroup of 226 untreated eyes in patients on the AREDS or AREDS2 formulations and 290 eyes without supplements, the analysis found a slightly increased growth — 13 µm growth toward the fovea with the supplement group (P = .04951) after 24 months.

In treated eyes, the analysis found supplements did not appear to alter the effectiveness of pegcetacoplan after 24 months: 18 µm slower growth in 169 eyes with supplements vs 234 eyes without (P = .4985) in the group on monthly pegcetacoplan, but a 34 µm greater growth in 179 eyes on supplements vs 227 eyes not on supplements in the group treated every other month (P = .2324).

Guymer said, the AREDS2 analysis and her group's study were not identical. “The AREDS group had a cohort that were randomized regarding supplements; our study was not randomized regarding supplements, so we cannot be sure there are other confounders not considered in these data,” she told Medscape Medical News.

The AREDS2 group also used only color fundus photography to evaluate lesion growth, “where the center of the fovea would not be as easy to identify,” while the OAKS and DERBY trials used multimodal imaging consisting of optical coherence tomography and fluorescein autofluorescence. Two more differences: the AREDS studies used a single grader to evaluate imaging, while OAKS and DERBY used two graders, she added, and the AREDS studies used yearly evaluations compared with monthly evaluations in OAKS and DERBY.

“I think it shows in both studies no benefit to growth of geographic atrophy lesions, as everyone is showing this and this was what was in the original AREDS data as well,” Guymer said. “Whether it makes a difference in growth toward the fovea, people will have to weigh up this new evidence and decide the relative merits.”

David Eichenbaum, MD, retina specialist with Retina Vitreous Associates of Florida in Tampa, Florida, said the more frequent image review, more graders, and the multimodal imaging used in OAKS and DERBY may explain the differences between the two studies' findings.

“The data from OAKS and DERBY is probably more robust and certainly more modern than the data from AREDS and AREDS2,” Eichenbaum told Medscape Medical News. The first AREDS study was published in 2001; AREDS2 was published in 2013. “I would not definitively conclude that micronutrients have a significant effect on geographic atrophy growth,” he said.

A prospective study of how AREDS micronutrients affect geographic atrophy with modern imaging, frequent monitoring, and at least two masked graders would be needed to better answer this question, he said.

A limitation of Guymer group's analysis is its post hoc nature, Eichenbaum said, but its strength compared with the AREDS analysis are the study population size, frequency of follow-up and data collection, and the addition of fluorescein autofluorescence imaging.

The OAKS and DERBY trials were funded by Apellis Pharmaceuticals. Guymer and Eichenbaum disclosed having relationships with Apellis Pharmaceuticals.

The eyes of infectious diseases experts and pediatricians may be turned to Florida as the state proposes to roll back certain vaccination requirements for schools and day care centers. 

On September 3, 2025, the Florida Department of Health initiated rule changes to the Florida Administrative Code (FAC) to remove requirements for childhood immunizations in Florida law that are not required for school entry by Florida Statute, a media spokesperson for the Florida Department of Health told Medscape Medical News.

“The proposed changes include the removal of the hepatitis B, varicella, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines from the immunization requirements,” the spokesperson told Medscape Medical News. “All other vaccinations required by Statute for school entry in Florida remain in place, unless updated through legislation. This includes vaccines for poliomyelitis, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus,” the spokesperson said.

“Medical freedoms are the focus, and these vaccines will remain available to families throughout Florida,” the spokesperson told Medscape Medical News. “The update does not limit access to vaccines and instead removes the state mandate for the stated vaccines in Rule 64D-3.046, FAC, and parents are encouraged to consult with their healthcare providers when making healthcare decisions for their children,” the spokesperson said.

The rule change is not effective immediately, and the department anticipates that the rule change will not be effective for approximately 90 days, according to the spokesperson.

The latest changes in vaccination protocols for children do not appear to reflect the general public's opinion about school vaccines; recent data from a survey conducted by KFF and The Washington Post showed that approximately 80% of parents in Florida and nationally in fact support school vaccination requirements.

The American Medical Association issued a statement that opposed Florida's planned elimination of vaccine mandates, and urged the state to reconsider, given the potential for a spike in illness, disability, and death that could result from increased rates of vaccine-preventable diseases.

In addition, infectious disease commentator Katelyn Jetelina, PhD, noted in a recent post in Your Local Epidemiologist that looser vaccination requirements in Florida may result in fewer pediatrician visits in the state overall. For some families, school vaccination requirements are the nudge needed for an office visit that then provides opportunities for screening for developmental delays, vision or hearing problems, undiagnosed asthma or allergies, and first signs of child abuse or neglect, Jetelina wrote. “Many families delay care until it becomes necessary, and kindergarten is a well-documented trigger: Epidemiologists consistently see a sharp spike in vaccine uptake at age 5,” she noted.

The potential ripple effects of ending required school vaccination would extend through communities and impact all ages, Rana Alissa, MD, president of the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a press release following the announced plan to rollback the requirements. “Removing policies that keep our children healthy creates unnecessary confusion and fear,” Alissa said. “Schools are tight-knit networks of children, educators, and families, making it easy for contagious diseases to spread. Widespread childhood immunization helps keep children and teachers focused on learning, keeps caregivers at work instead of at home with sick children, and allows families to safely participate in community activities,” she added.

In addition, lower pediatric vaccinations that could result from removing the requirement would put infants, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals of all ages at increased risk for infectious diseases, Alissa said in the statement. Lower vaccination rates would promote the spread of disease more easily in all public spaces, from Florida's popular theme parks to doctors' waiting rooms, she said.

This transcript has been edited for clarity.

Hi. I'm Art Caplan. I'm at the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City.

The FDA recently cleared, for the first time, a blood test for Alzheimer's. This is very exciting news that has made many headlines. I think we have to exercise caution, care, and make sure patients and the families of patients with Alzheimer's, or worrying about Alzheimer's, really understand what this test is and is not.

This test is not a predictor of who's going to get Alzheimer's before symptoms have appeared. It is not intended to do that. If you think that your relative is exhibiting signs of Alzheimer's or has received a diagnosis of Alzheimer's, this blood test will confirm, through looking for amyloid plaques — the things that gunk up the brain in Alzheimer's — that they have gotten into the bloodstream. 

It can test for their presence and help confirm that what may be behavioral change, forgetfulness, or whatever the symptoms are, really is in fact Alzheimer's. It's exciting because I'm not sure current tests to confirm Alzheimer's are as accurate, but they're definitely more expensive. They often involve an MRI, trying to look at the brain and see if plaques are there. A blood test, I think, will be better as a way to confirm that Alzheimer's really is the correct diagnosis. 

That said, there are different tests online promising to predict — some using a blood test — whether you're going to get Alzheimer's. Those I'm pretty leery of. The FDA hasn't really cleared those. They're out there, I would say, in the wild, wild west. The best way to tell if somebody is developing or at risk for Alzheimer's, as some forms are genetic, is with markers.

For other risk factors, it's difficult right now to say whether or not they're going to lead to Alzheimer's. Even though you may see plaques in the brain before symptoms appear, there are many people who show those plaques who don't get Alzheimer's. 

For pretesting, there probably need to be symptoms. You probably need an experienced person to do the testing, the neurologic examinations, and the clinical diagnosis that they think Alzheimer's is present.

Now we have a cheaper blood test that looks accurate, and, happily, that can help confirm what leaves many people worried, in doubt, or uncertain — sometimes even the clinician.

This is a step forward, and I think it's a positive step. I think it's one that can be used responsibly and ethically, but we have to make sure that people understand what we really have is a confirmation of the presence of the disease.

Hopefully, when that begins to get confirmed, other interventions and steps will start to appear that slow the progress of the disease, and they can then be used with confidence when we have this kind of accurate, confirmatory test.

An illusion is when we see and perceive an object that doesn't match the sensory input that reaches our eyes. In the case of the image below, the sensory input is four Pac Man–like black figures. But what we see or perceive is a white square-i.e., the illusion.

In a new study published in Nature Neuroscience, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, working with teams at the Allen Institute, identified the key neural circuit and cell type that plays a pivotal role in detecting these illusions-more specifically, their outer edges or ""contours""-and how this circuit works.

Hyeyoung Shin, Ph.D. (now with Seoul University), Hillel Adesnik, Ph.D., and their team discovered a special group of cells called IC–encoder neurons that tell the brain to see things that aren't really there as part of a process called recurrent pattern completion.

""Because IC–encoder neurons have this unique capacity to drive pattern completion, we think that they might have specialized synaptic output connectivity that allows them to recreate this pattern in a very effective manner,"" said Shin. ""We also know that they receive top-down inputs from higher visual areas. The representation of the illusion arises in higher visual areas first and then gets fed back to the primary visual cortex; and when that information is fed back, it's received by these IC–encoders in the primary visual cortex."" This is like a manager telling an entry level worker to complete a task: Instructions come from a higher-level and are then executed by lower-level staff. In this case, the instruction would be to see or perceive something that isn't really there.

In the context of the brain and vision-using the above shape diagram-higher levels of the brain interpret the image as a square and then tell the lower-level visual cortex to ""see a square"" even though the visual stimulus consists of four semi-complete black circles.

Shin, Adesnik, and their team made the discovery by observing the electrical brain activity patterns of mice when they were shown illusory images like the Kanizsa triangle. They then shot beams of light at the IC-encoder neurons, in a process called two-photon holographic optogenetics, when there was no illusory image present. When this happened, they noticed that even in the absence of an illusion, IC-encoder neurons triggered the same brain activity patterns that exist when an illusory image was present. They successfully emulated the same brain activity by stimulating these specialized neurons. 

The findings shed light on how the visual system and perception work in the brain and have implications for diseases where this system malfunctions.

In certain diseases you have patterns of activity that emerge in your brain that are abnormal, and in schizophrenia these are related to object representations that pop up randomly. If you don't understand how those objects are formed and a collective set of cells work together to make those representations emerge, you're not going to be able to treat it; so understanding which cells and in which layer this activity occurs is helpful.""

Jerome Lecoq, Ph.D., associate investigator, Allen Institute

Researchers with the Allen Institute's OpenScope program-which allows external scientists to propose experiments that can be done using the Institute's cutting-edge tools and equipment-conducted some of the experiments that were part of this study. Their work showed for the first time that the brain activity ""feedback loop"" from higher-order levels of the brain communicating to lower visual areas (where the IC-encoders neurons were) happens in mice.

""OpenScope provided access to unique brain-wide electrophysiological recordings to the team at Berkeley. With six Neuropixels probes distributed across the brain, they could see the feedback loops in action with millisecond resolution in real time,"" said Lecoq. 

The study findings change the paradigm of vision and perception as a passive process where we simply receive and ""take in"" information from the world around us to an active one where our perception of reality is interpreted and constructed by a series of complex brain calculations that then influence what we actually see. Our vision is less like a camera that simply views the world as it is, and more like a computer monitor that shows us a scene or image based on complex computations and interpretations of data based on past experiences.

The latter implies there is much more room to negotiate or manipulate what we actually ""perceive.""

This article is based on a poster originally authored by R. Pinto-Lopes, M. Kerr, B. Boyle, G. PJMullan, and K Thompson.

Intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO) is characterized by an excessive presence of methane-producing archaea in the gastrointestinal tract and is associated with symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, and constipation.1

Hydrogen and methane breath tests (HMBTs), both conducted in-clinic and as send-out tests, are commonly utilized for diagnosis. These tests typically involve a challenge procedure, wherein a glucose or lactulose substrate is ingested, with IMO diagnosed based on a breath methane peak exceeding 10 ppm at any point during the assessment.2

However, these evaluations necessitate patient preparation and are constrained by the limited number of breath samples collected during the testing process.

The study discussed here evaluates the OMED Health® Breath Analyzer for its capacity to accurately measure breath methane and hydrogen.

Preliminary data illustrating its potential for diagnosing and longitudinally monitoring treatment responses in IMO within a real-world context is presented.

The OMED Health® Breath Analyzer is a handheld device designed to measure hydrogen and methane concentrations in exhaled breath in real time.

Utilizing metal oxide sensor (MOS) technology, along with diffusion and PTFE membranes, the device minimizes interference from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and condensation, thereby ensuring stable and reliable measurements (Figure 1).

Data is recorded and displayed through a companion smartphone application (Figure 2).

Hydrogen and methane concentrations from participant breath samples were measured using two methods: a gold-standard in-clinic HMBT instrument (Gastrogenius™ Breath Monitor) and the OMED Health® Breath Analyzer.3

Each participant provided three breath samples, spaced three minutes apart, in the following order: in-clinic instrument, OMED Health® device, in-clinic instrument. To account for variations in absolute gas concentrations between samples, the two readings from the in-clinic instrument were averaged (AVG HMBT) and utilized for comparison.

A subset of participants was evaluated for IMO (n = 24) and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO; n = 14) using the in-clinic HMBT instrument and the OMED Health® device. IMO was defined as any methane reading exceeding 10 ppm during the test, while SIBO was defined as a greater than 10 ppm increase in hydrogen within 65 minutes of lactulose ingestion (EU criterion).

This case study presents a patient diagnosed with IMO, initially treated with herbal antimicrobials followed by antibiotic therapies. Breath data was collected using the OMED Health® Breath Analyzer to monitor treatment responses over time.

Figure 2. The OMED Health Breath Analyzer and companion mobile app provides a direct, real-time readout of breath hydrogen and methane levels. The companion mobile app also supports the breath sampling protocol, records breath measurements and facilitates the logging of food/drink and the tracking of symptoms and lifestyle.

A total of 243 breath samples were collected from 54 participants, with complete data available for hydrogen and methane measurements from both devices. This data facilitated a direct comparison of hydrogen and methane concentrations between the OMED Health® Breath Analyzer and the gold-standard in-clinic HMBT instrument.

Results demonstrated comparable error distributions for both gases. A slight positive bias was noted in OMED hydrogen readings relative to the in-clinic HMBT (Figure 3A); however, this did not impact the diagnostic accuracy of the device.

Diagnostic results for IMO and SIBO derived from the OMED Health® Breath Analyzer were compared against those from the in-clinic HMBT instrument, revealing greater than 90 % concordance.

The confusion matrix (Figure 3B) illustrates the number and proportion of matched and unmatched outcomes. High concordance was observed, with only one false positive for IMO and one false negative for SIBO identified.

Patient A was diagnosed with Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth (IMO) on May 7, 2024, presenting a daily average methane level of 23.6 ± 1.79 ppm. Following the initiation of herbal antimicrobial therapy on June 13, methane levels decreased from 35.7 ppm to 2.64 ppm over a two-week period.

Subsequent continuous, non-fasting monitoring revealed a rebound in methane levels, resulting in a second IMO-positive diagnosis on July 16, with an average of 24.3 ± 3.79 ppm.

A follow-up course of antibiotics successfully reduced methane levels from 32.8 ppm to 3.56 ppm within two weeks, after which the patient reported a negative result for IMO. By September, methane levels remained consistently low at 3.07 ± 0.94 ppm. These findings are summarized in Figures 3C and 3D.

Longitudinal sampling is increasingly recognized for its ability to facilitate real-time analysis and establish personalized baselines, thereby supporting a transition from static to continuous monitoring in clinical care.

This approach is exemplified by the evolution from fingerstick blood sampling to continuous glucose monitoring in diabetes management. When applied to breath analysis, the OMED Health® Breath Analyzer enables efficient detection and real-time monitoring of treatment responses in gastrointestinal conditions such as IMO.

In the study discussed here, the device demonstrated over 90 % diagnostic concordance with the gold standard in-clinic Hydrogen Methane Breath Test (HMBT) for both IMO and Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO), underscoring its potential clinical utility.

Beyond IMO, breath methane monitoring shows promise in broader contexts, including gut motility, inflammatory regulation, and metabolic health.4

These findings emphasize the value of at-home breath testing conducted under clinical guidance to ensure accurate interpretation and optimized treatment outcomes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Artificial intelligence detects mild depression through micro-movements in facial muscles","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250916/Artificial-intelligence-detects-mild-depression-through-micro-movements-in-facial-muscles.aspx","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:53:00 GMT","

Depression is one of the most common mental health challenges, but its early signs are often overlooked. It is often linked to reduced facial expressivity. However, whether mild depression or subthreshold depression (StD) (a mild state of depressive symptoms that does not meet the criteria for diagnosis but is a risk factor for developing depression) is associated with changes in facial expressions remains unknown.

In light of this, Associate Professor Eriko Sugimori and doctoral student Mayu Yamaguchi from the Faculty of Human Sciences, Waseda University, Japan, have now investigated changes in facial expression in Japanese undergraduates using facial data and artificial intelligence. The study was published in the journal of Scientific Reports on 21 August 2025.

""As concerns around mental well-being have been rising, I wanted to explore how subtle non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions, shape social impressions and reflect mental health using artificial intelligence-based facial analysis,"" says Sugimori.

The researchers asked 64 Japanese university students to record short self-introduction videos. Another group of 63 students then rated how expressive, friendly, natural, or likeable the speakers appeared. At the same time, the team used OpenFace 2.0, an artificial intelligence system that tracks micro-movements in facial muscles, to analyze the same videos.

The results revealed a consistent pattern. Students who reported subthreshold depressive symptoms were rated by their peers as less friendly, expressive, and likable. Interestingly, they were not judged as more stiff, fake, or nervous. This suggests that StD does not make people appear overtly negative but rather tones down their positive expressivity.

Artificial intelligence analysis revealed specific patterns of eye and mouth movements, such as the inner brow raiser, upper lid raiser, lip stretcher, and mouth-opening actions that were more frequent in participants with StD. These subtle muscle movements were strongly linked to depression scores, even though they were too fine for untrained observers to pick up on.

The researchers note that their study was conducted with Japanese students, an important consideration given that cultural norms influence how people express emotions.

""Our novel approach of short self-introduction videos and automated facial expression analysis can be applied to screen and detect mental health in schools, universities, and workplaces,"" says Sugimori.

The proposed approach could be used in mental health technology, digital health platforms, or employee wellness programs to monitor psychological well-being efficiently.

""Overall, our study provides a novel, accessible, and non-invasive artificial intelligence-based facial analysis tool for early detection of depression (before the appearance of clinical symptoms), enabling early interventions and timely care of mental health,"" concludes Sugimori.

Life-saving opportunities to prevent suicide among autistic people are being missed because systemic barriers make it difficult for them to access NHS support during times of mental health crisis, according to new research.

Autistic people experience poorer mental and physical health and live shorter lives than the general population. They are significantly more likely than non-autistic people to die by suicide. Recent estimates suggest that one in three autistic people has experienced suicidal ideation and nearly one in four has attempted suicide.

In a study published today in Autism, researchers from the University of Cambridge and Bournemouth University found that of more than 1,000 autistic adults surveyed, only one in four reached out to the NHS the last time they experienced suicidal thoughts or behaviours.

Among those who did not seek NHS support, the most common reasons were that they believed the NHS could not help them (48%), that they tried to cope alone (54%), or that they felt there was ""no point"" due to long waiting lists for mental health services (43%). Many participants commented that the NHS's limited range of mental health services was not suitable for ""people like us"".

Just over a third (36%) of participants who did not seek NHS support reported previous negative experiences with the NHS, while a similar number (34%) said they had had bad experiences specifically when seeking help for suicidality – and more than one in 10 (12%) said they had been turned away or had a referral rejected.

One in four participants (25%) said they feared consequences such as being sectioned. Others highlighted practical barriers, suggesting they could not face trying to get an appointment with their GP (34%). No participants said they didn't want to be stopped.

This study also corroborates findings that certain gender groups may experience even greater barriers to accessing NHS support. Analysis by the team at Bournemouth and Cambridge showed that among the participants, cisgender women and those who were transgender or gender-divergent were more likely to have had negative experiences, while transgender and gender-divergent autistic people were especially likely to fear that they would not be believed by NHS staff.

Co-lead author Dr. Tanya Procyshyn from the Autism Research Centre at the University of Cambridge said: ""Our findings make it clear that autistic people do want support when they are struggling with suicidality, but many have been let down by a system that they experience as inaccessible, unhelpful, or even harmful. Without urgent reform to make services trustworthy and better suited to autistic people's needs, preventable deaths will continue.""

This study offers new insights on significantly higher suicide rates among the autistic population, a stark reality recognized by the Government's inclusion of autistic people as a priority group in the 2023 Suicide Prevention Strategy. The authors note that policy commitments must lead to meaningful service changes, such as autism-informed training for healthcare professionals, alternatives to phone-based appointment booking, and flexible, autism-adapted mental health services. They stress that these changes must be co-designed with autistic people to ensure acceptability and rebuild trust.

Co-lead author, Dr. Rachel Moseley from the Department of Psychology at Bournemouth University, said: ""We know from other research that healthcare professionals don't receive sufficient training to help them work effectively with autistic people. Our work shows that when faced with autistic people in crisis, clinicians often overlook these signs, or react in a way that causes further damage. For these reasons, it's imperative that the government takes steps to address inequalities that prevent autistic people from accessing healthcare that could save their lives.""

Professor Sir Simon Baron-Cohen, Director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge and the senior author on the team, added: ""There is a mental health crisis in the autism community, with one in four autistic adults planning or attempting suicide. This is unacceptably high. Although the UK Government has finally now recognized autistic people as a high-risk group in relation to suicide, the essential changes that could prevent these unnecessary deaths are not materialising fast enough.

""We are glad that Autism Action, the charity that funds a number of our suicide prevention studies, is translating the research into policy and practice, but we need to see a massive injection of funding into support services to avert multiple future tragedies.""

The research was instigated by the charity Autism Action as part of its mission to reduce the number of autistic people who think about, attempt and die by suicide.

It is unacceptable that our health service fails autistic people at the time of their greatest need. Autistic people want help but barriers in the form of inaccessible systems, poor attitudes and lack of training are preventing this, and in one in ten cases people are being turned away or rejected.

The recently published Learning from Lives and Deaths report, focused on people with a learning disability and autistic people, highlighted that a lack of access to the right support is a massive factor that leads to premature deaths. We know a better system is possible – the Government must now lead the way to save lives.""

This article is based on a poster originally authored by Hsuan Chou, Amy Craster, Kayleigh Arthur, Billy Boyle, Matt Kerr, Eli F. Kelley, Glenn M. Stewart, Courtney M. Wheatley, Jesse Schwartz, Catlin C. Fermoyle, Briana L. Ziegler, Kay A. Johnson, Paul Robach, Patrick Basset, Huw Davies, Amine Khider, and Bruce D. Johnson.

Ultramarathon running induces significant physiological stress, particularly in the pulmonary and metabolic systems.1 While blood-based biomarkers have been utilized to monitor these changes, repeated blood sampling can be invasive, uncomfortable, and impractical in field settings.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath offer a non-invasive alternative for assessing systemic metabolic and physiological responses.

Previous studies have demonstrated alterations in breath VOC profiles following ultramarathon events, suggesting their potential as biomarkers of exercise-induced stress and adaptation.2

To explore this, the associations between breath VOCs and changes in lung function in a cohort of elite athletes participating in the 2019 Ultra-Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB®) were investigated.

Thirty-two healthy participants in the 2019 UTMB ultramarathon (171 km, approximately 10,000 m ascent) underwent assessments 24–72 hours before and 1–4 hours after the race.

Tests included blood sampling, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide measurement, transthoracic ultrasound, breath VOC collection (ReCIVA®, Owlstone Medical), and submaximal cycling to assess lung diffusion (DLco/DLno, Dmco, Vc).

Clinical and respiratory parameters were measured using portable devices following ATS/ERS guidelines. Breath samples (n = 48 from 24 subjects) were analyzed pre- and post-race without fasting requirements.

Data was analyzed in Python using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and Spearman's correlation; coefficients greater than 0.7 were considered strong, while those between 0.5 and 0.7 were deemed moderate.



Figure 1. The Owlstone breath collection system includes: CASPER – a filtered air supply unit, which provides air scrubbed of background VOCs to patients via the ReCIVA, ReCIVA – a reliable and reproducible non-invasive breath sample collection unit, which preferentially collects alveolar breath fraction identified using pressure tracing and selected for with two pumps, and lastly Breath Biopsy Collect – which connects to and operates the ReCIVA, enabling collection of specific breath fractions and monitoring patient breathing in real-time.

Post-race clinical data revealed a modest decline in pulmonary function, with significant reductions in vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), as expected following exhaustive exercise.3 Correlation and network analyses highlighted strengthening associations between respiratory parameters post-race (see Table 1).

 Given the close relationship between respiratory muscle strength and lung function, correlations between MEP and spirometric measures such as FVC and FEV1 were anticipated.

However, despite declines in absolute values, the post-race strengthening of these associations suggests that exhaustive exercise enhances the coupling between expiratory effort and lung function.

Correlations emerging only in post-race measurements illustrate that muscle strength may become a dominant determinant of expiratory flow, as evidenced by the correlation between FEV1 and MEP, and highlight the tight integration of systemic metabolic responses, including correlations between blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and lactate, glucose and FEV1, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) with creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB).

Table 1. Correlation analysis between clinical variables in pre- and post-race samples. All variables here are at least moderately correlated (r >0.5) with each other. FVC – Forced Vital Capacity, VC – Vital Capacity, FEV1 – Forced Expiratory Volume in one second, MIPS – Maximal Inspiratory Pressures, MEPS – Maximal Expiratory Pressure, BUN – Blood Urea Nitrogen, Glu – Blood glucose, cTnI – Cardiac Troponin I, CK-MB – Creatine Kinase-MB isoform.

Unless indicated within a correlation coeffcient, all correlations presented are moderate (0.5-0.7). Image Credit: Owlstone Medical Ltd

Given the increased post-race correlations between respiratory function and metabolic parameters, we further investigated associations between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and respiratory measures.

A total of 63 VOCs were found to change significantly (p < 0.05) between pre- and post-race samples, with several being gut-derived, including 2,3-butanediol, which showed a significant increase in post-race samples.



Figure 3. Correlation with clinical metadata between FEV1 and VOC 2,3-butanediol in post-race samples. Image Credit: Owlstone Medical Ltd

Notably, 2,3-butanediol demonstrated a positive correlation with both VC (r = 0.53) and FEV1 (r = 0.63), but only in post-race samples, as shown in Figure 3. As a product of anaerobic glucose fermentation by gut microbiota, this compound's emergent association with respiratory parameters may reflect increased gut–lung axis activity following exhaustive exercise.

While the mechanisms underlying this correlation remain to be fully elucidated, previous work has suggested that altered gut barrier integrity or shifts in microbial fermentation activity during exercise could be contributing factors.4,5 The potential of breath VOCs, such as 2,3-butanediol, to enhance our understanding of physiological adaptation to exercise warrants further investigation.

These findings indicate that exhaustive exercise not only modifies lung function but may also impact microbial metabolism, as evidenced by the emergence of post-race correlations between respiratory parameters and gut-derived VOCs such as 2,3-butanediol.

This study represents the first demonstration of correlations between exhaled breath VOCs and clinical respiratory variables within the context of an ultramarathon.

Collectively, this data underscores the potential of breath-based biomarkers for monitoring physiological strain and recovery, with significant implications for performance optimization and athlete health assessment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","GLP-1 drugs may offer cost-effective treatment for people with knee osteoarthritis and obesity","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250916/GLP-1-drugs-may-offer-cost-effective-treatment-for-people-with-knee-osteoarthritis-and-obesity.aspx","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 05:38:00 GMT","

A new study led by investigators at Mass General Brigham finds that adding novel weight loss GLP-1 drugs semaglutide and tirzepatide to usual care represents a cost-effective treatment strategy for people with knee osteoarthritis and obesity, with tirzepatide providing greater health benefits at lower cost compared to semaglutide. The research comes as patients and providers seek to balance the benefits of weight loss and pain relief against the expense of these novel agents. Results are published in Annals of Internal Medicine. 

Weight loss can relieve joint pain, but semaglutide and tirzepatide are expensive and most insurance plans don't cover weight loss medications. This means that many patients can't afford these medications. This is why a formal economic analysis is valuable. It gives payers and policymakers the data they need to make informed coverage decisions and improve access to these weight loss treatments. Our goal is to ensure that payers and policymakers have the evidence they need to make informed decisions about coverage.""

Elena Losina, PhD, senior author, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital

The study was funded by Arthritis Foundation and National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. The investigators used OApol, a validated and widely published computer simulation model, to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the two GLP-1 drugs as well as two other common weight loss interventions: bariatric surgery and lifestyle modifications. They found that tirzepatide offered somewhat better value than semaglutide and would be the preferred option between the two drugs for most patients. For eligible and willing patients, bariatric surgery, which provides sustained benefits, may be the best option from a clinical and economic perspective.

Limitations of this analysis include its reliance on data integrated from multiple sources. In addition, conducting this study required researchers to make assumptions about the duration of time patients would remain on these medications, which may affect the findings.

""Osteoarthritis substantially reduces quality of life due to debilitating pain and limited mobility. Obesity has been shown to shorten life expectancy,"" said Losina. ""Offering these drugs to patients with knee osteoarthritis and obesity improves both measures.""

These chemical compounds are highly stable and linger in the environment. Thanks to their water-, oil- and stain-repellent properties, they are widely found in everyday items, such as non-stick pans, waterproof clothing, food containers and fire-fighting foams. Their widespread use has harmful effects; they can enter the human body during pregnancy via the placenta and continue to build up through breastfeeding, food, drinking water, polluted air, or contact with products containing them.

Due to their impact on health, these chemical compounds have become a focus for concern and research.

They have been linked to endocrine disruption, increased cholesterol, and effects on the liver and development. They can build up both in the body and in the environment. So, exposure to PFAS can be regarded as chronic. What is more, they take years to degrade. This reinforces the need for biomonitoring studies such as ours.""

Anne San Román, co-author of the study

This joint study by the University of the Basque Country (EHU) focuses on children, as they are a particularly vulnerable group. Exposure at an early age can cause harmful effects at lower doses than in adults and increase the risk of future diseases.

The analysis, carried out on the plasma of 315 minors, detected 18 different compounds among the 42 studied, with detection rates ranging from 70% to 97% for the most common ones. ""The data obtained show that we are highly exposed. It is difficult to know whether the levels of PFAS found in children's bodies are high or low because this issue has not been studied sufficiently in order to specify safe limits for humans, but their presence is already a cause for concern and it is important that this type of research be expanded to better understand their effects and find ways of minimising them,"" explained Professor Nestor Etxebarria.

Regarding the effects of PFAS on health, the study assessed the potential risks to the liver and development and concluded that, in general, there is no evidence of immediate danger. ""We have no evidence of worrying concentrations of PFAS in the population studied. However, this does not mean that the risk will decrease in 10 years' time. What does not appear worrying now could be worrying in the future, because it is still unknown whether they could be responsible for future diseases,"" pointed out Etxebarria and San Román. They added that current methods for assessing risk have significant limitations, as they are based primarily on studies conducted on animals, which reduces their accuracy when extrapolated to humans. So they warned of the need to adjust risk assessment methods and conduct more people-centred studies to obtain more realistic data.

The study is part of the INMA (Childhood and The Environment) project, launched in 2006 with the aim of analysing the impact of environmental pollutants on child development. The EHU research analysed children's exposure to PFAS over time by examining blood samples collected by the INMA project between 2011 and 2022 in the Gipuzkoa cohort. Specifically, in the Goierri and Urola districts, areas characterised by a strong presence of the iron and steel industry. ""We analysed the plasma of the children at three key stages of development: at the ages of 4, 8 and 14. This enabled us to assess the evolution and trends in PFAS levels as children grow up, and to confirm that PFAS concentrations decrease with age."" As Etxebarria and San Román went on to explain, ""in early childhood, too, levels are mainly related to maternal exposure (through the placenta and breastfeeding), while in adolescence, environmental factors become more important"".

Furthermore, research shows that the presence of PFAS varies according to age. They observed that compounds regarded as classic, such as PFOA or PFOS, which began to be regulated in 2006, predominate in younger children. By contrast, adolescents have higher levels of emerging PFAS, probably because these compounds began to be used more widely when they were older, and replaced compounds that had already been regulated. San Román and Etxebarria highlighted the fact that ""the data most likely reflect the exposure typical of each period. That is why it is so important to repeat these studies periodically to capture the changes that are taking place and to be able to study the consequences they have on our bodies"".

Based on the data obtained, the research team concluded that current regulations have not been entirely effective, since, despite the restrictions imposed on some PFAS, the restricted compounds are still present in children. Furthermore, they believe that the regulations need to be updated to include emerging compounds, the presence of which has been demonstrated. In this regard, they highlighted the need for further studies on the toxicity of the most recent PFAS, the danger of which has not yet been clearly established.

Nestor Etxebarria is professor of chemistry in the Department of Analytical Chemistry and deputy director of the Research Centre for Experimental Marine Biology & Biotechnology in Plentzia (PiE-EHU). He leads the IBea research group, which focuses on the development of non-targeted analytical methodologies and their application to environmental and ecotoxicological problems. He lectures on the Degree Course in Chemistry and coordinates the Master's in Environmental Contamination and Toxicology.

Anne San Román, a chemistry graduate who completed the above-mentioned Master's, is currently a pre-doctoral researcher. This article is part of the thesis she is writing up in the field of Environmental Pollution and Toxicology. Etxebarria is supervising San Román's PhD work, which is being carried out as part of a collaboration between the Biogipuzkoa Health Research Institute, the Gipuzkoa Department of Public Health, the Research Centre for Experimental Marine Biology & Biotechnology in Plentzia (PiE-EHU) and the Ibea research group.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Targeted breath biomarker analysis of VOCs using TD-GC-MS","https://www.news-medical.net/health/Targeted-breath-biomarker-analysis-of-VOCs-using-TD-GC-MS.aspx","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 14:59:35 GMT","

This article is based on a poster originally authored by Darren Barrington-Light, Mircea Martiniuc, and Laercio Pires Fernandes Jr.

The Breath Biopsy® technique is emerging as a powerful method for developing novel non-invasive disease biomarkers and applications in precision medicine. Gas chromatography (GC) coupled with mass spectrometric (MS) detection remains the gold standard for the identification and quantification of the diverse breath metabolome.

Typical discovery workflows depend on untargeted analysis, which has significant limitations regarding robust compound identification (ID), translatability, and cross-study comparisons. Conversely, targeted analysis offers higher confidence data but is currently restricted to small panels of compounds, such as carbonyls.1

Large-scale targeted analysis, as described in the study presented here, will bridge the gap between the two approaches, enabling the development of the Breath Biopsy VOC Atlas®, Owlstone Medical's expanding repository of breath-related volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and extensive metadata, thereby accelerating the advancement of breathomics applications.

Sample collection was performed using Owlstone Medical's ReCIVA® Breath Sampler in conjunction with the CASPER® Portable Air Supply to minimize ambient contamination, as previously outlined by Arulvasan et al.2

Approximately 1.25 L of breath was collected onto each sorbent tube. Deuterated internal standards (n = 36) were injected into all calibration standards and sample tubes.

Samples (single tube) were analyzed on a thermal desorption (TD) unit (Markes TD100xr) coupled to a GC-MS (Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Q Exactive mass spectrometer) system, following the Breath Biopsy OMNI® method.

The target list comprised of 200 compounds derived from breath, based on previously published work.2,3

A solution containing 36 deuterated internal standards (IS) was injected into all calibrators, check standards, and unknowns.

Processing methods, view settings, and report templates were created and executed in Chromeleon CDS due to its compliance, audit trail functionality, and capability to control and operate high-resolution accurate mass (HRAM) instruments in a networked environment.

Following this method, approximately 96 MB of data was generated per sample, with each full sequence producing around 6 GB.

Annually, data acquisition across Owlstone Medical has reached 5 to 6.6 TB, reflecting the substantial volume of HRAM data generated through routine operations.

The management of instruments and data handling was streamlined by utilizing Chromeleon CDS, version 7.3.2 MUb, deployed as a lab-wide enterprise solution within a cloud environment.

This scalable, centralized infrastructure ensured efficient data processing, secure storage, and enhanced accessibility to support scientific workflows.

Thermal desorption analysis is destructive; therefore, known instrument and sample injection failure modes (e.g., failed sorbent tube pressure test) were implemented to prevent the analysis of samples expected to be unsuccessful.

In cases of more severe failures, acquisition halts, and relevant users were notified via email, facilitating rapid resolution.

Patient-derived samples generate vital data and are often irreplaceable, making reinjection impractical or impossible. Consequently, proactive management of out-of-specification (OOS) conditions is essential.

To preserve sample integrity and avoid invalid analyses, the system was configured to stop runs when OOS conditions are detected, either within the system itself or in preceding injections.

The identity of each deuterated and target peak was confirmed using Composite Scoring, achieving high-confidence (Tier 1) identifications.4

This process combines mass accuracy (≤ 5 ppm), fragment ion coelution (≤ 0.01 min), and ion ratios (20% window) in comparison to authentic standards analyzed in each analytical sequence.

Furthermore, in-house HRAM libraries containing over 1,000 entries can be searched within the software to assist in the identification of compounds not present in the target list.

IS correction and compound-specific linear regression with weighting (typically 1/Amount2) enabled direct quantitation of each target compound over linear dynamic ranges between 20 and 4,000.

The quantitation ranges are established to cover or exceed previously measured breath concentrations, reducing the requirement for reanalysis of out-of-range samples.

Integrated tools for dataset tabulation and visualization facilitated the creation of customizable, sequence-wide plots and tables with interactive elements to enhance data analysis.

A method validation and verification study was conducted using two cohorts of breath samples. The complete analytical workflow was applied, including all elements of intermediate precision, along with significant instrument maintenance between the sample cohorts. Precision across the entire workflow was rigorously assessed.

An analytical workflow was developed entirely within Chromeleon software, encompassing the following:

The output of this work was a fully integrated, compliance-ready quantitation workflow for the targeted analysis of breath biomarkers.

Produced form materials originally authored by Darren Barrington-Light and Laercio Pires Fernandes Jr from Thermo Fisher Scientific, and Mircea Martiniuc from Owlstone Medical Ltd.

Owlstone Medical is developing a breathalyzer with a focus on non-invasive diagnostics for cancer, inflammatory disease and infectious disease, the company aims to save 100,000 lives and $1.5 B in healthcare costs.

The company's Breath Biopsy® platform has introduced a new diagnostic modality making it possible to discover novel non-invasive biomarkers in breath using a platform with the potential to transition to point-of-care. The award winning ReCIVA Breath Sampler ensures reliable collection of breath samples.

Breath Biopsy is supporting research into early detection and precision medicine with applications in cancer and a wide range of other medical conditions. Highly sensitive and selective, these tests allow for early diagnosis when treatments are more effective and more lives can be saved.

IntroductionApplications of AI in emergency medicineBenefits of AI in emergency careChallenges and limitationsConclusionsReferencesFurther reading

Artificial intelligence is transforming emergency medicine by enhancing triage, diagnosis, and resource management, while also facing challenges related to ethics, bias, and regulation. This article explores its applications, benefits, and limitations in real-world clinical care.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science, mathematics, and related disciplines to create algorithms that can perform tasks conventionally restricted to human intelligence. AI algorithms utilize data-driven analysis, probabilistic modelling, and iterative optimization to learn, solve problems, and make decisions.1

The emergency patient journey and where artificial intelligence is making or can make an impact. AI: artificial intelligence; ED: emergency department; EMD: emergency medical dispatch.1

Unprecedented computational power, widely available and open-access electronic health data, as well as algorithmic breakthroughs, are rapidly transitioning AI from a conceptual technology to an integrated component of modern healthcare.1 Despite projected growth of the global AI healthcare market, its incorporation into clinical practice remains limited due to the relative nascency of this technology and lack of standardization.2

In emergency medicine, AI has gained traction not only in clinical decision support (CDS) but also in digital twin modeling of patients, predictive analytics for emergency department (ED) flow, and integration with prehospital emergency medical services (EMS).3,8,9

Additionally, recent primers emphasize the importance of familiarizing nonexpert clinicians with AI principles, terminology, and limitations to support safe and informed adoption.11

AI-driven triage algorithms can analyze large datasets without bias and with significantly greater depth than conventional models, enabling clinicians to prioritize patients more effectively compared to traditional methods.5 In fact, machine learning models consistently demonstrate superior discrimination and performance capabilities for predicting emergency outcomes like hospital admission or intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and conditions like stroke, sepsis, and myocardial infarction.4,5

Medical imaging and the interpretation of these images are among the most mature applications of AI, as numerous deep learning algorithms have been trained to analyze X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, and ultrasound images.1 For these applications, AI technologies have successfully detected abnormalities like intracranial hemorrhage, fractures, and pneumothorax with high accuracy to support clinicians and reduce conventional diagnostic delays.1 Explainable AI (XAI) methods are increasingly being incorporated into these models to enhance clinician trust by making diagnostic outputs more interpretable.7,11

AI-powered CDS systems have also been developed to integrate real-time data from electronic health records (EHRs) and provide timely recommendations.1 For example, AI models have been used to analyze electrocardiograms (ECGs) to predict impending cardiac arrest. Machine learning-assisted alerts have also been shown to improve the time to antibiotic administration.1 More recently, scoping reviews highlight that CDS tools in emergency departments have been used to improve sepsis management, diagnostic accuracy, and disposition planning.3 Published case examples include Duke's “Sepsis Watch” system and Viz.ai for subdural hematoma detection, which illustrate real-world clinical adoption.11

AI-based predictive analytics can mitigate ED crowding by forecasting patient arrivals and anticipating surges. This application of AI allows hospitals to transition away from a reactive to a proactive staffing model that ensures the optimal allocation of limited resources like beds.1,6

AI-powered symptom checkers and chatbots can simultaneously guide patients in self-assessing the urgency of their condition. Emergency dispatchers can also utilize natural language processing to recognize conditions, such as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, faster and more accurately, despite limitations in first-responder knowledge.1 EMS applications include AI-driven decision support for ambulance routing, prehospital risk stratification, and remote monitoring to improve patient outcomes before hospital arrival.6,11

Another emerging domain is the use of digital twins, virtual patient models that simulate disease progression and treatment response, which could help personalize emergency care interventions and optimize resource use.9

AI algorithms can rapidly process and synthesize vast quantities of data, thereby leading to faster and more precise assessments.4 This significantly reduces conventional image interpretation delays, with some AI models demonstrating performance superior to that of human specialists in specific tasks.1

AI can provide several benefits to the existing public health infrastructure. By accurately predicting patient volume, AI can enable hospitals to better manage patient throughput, reduce system inefficiencies, alleviate overcrowding, and shorten patient wait times.6 These predictive tools also support disaster preparedness and surge capacity planning, strengthening system resilience.4,5

For administrative purposes, AI can automate routine and time-consuming tasks using ambient listening technologies and generative AI-based clinical summaries. The adoption of AI into these aspects of healthcare has the potential to reduce clinician burnout, as well as improve both patient satisfaction and provider well-being.1,4 Furthermore, AI can facilitate continuous quality improvement by identifying patterns in adverse events and enabling evidence-based policy development.7,11

Despite its future promise and validated benefits, the integration of AI into emergency medicine is associated with numerous technical, ethical, and legal challenges that must be addressed to ensure its safe and equitable deployment.1,4,6

A foundational principle of machine learning is that models are only as good as the data on which they are trained. Thus, models trained on historical health data containing latent biases, such as societal inequities or non-generalizable sampling designs, could learn and amplify these biases at scale.6 Unfortunately, these underrepresented are often the exact patient subpopulations like women, racial minorities, and other marginalized groups that would benefit the most from AI integration.2

A significant practical barrier, especially in developing and underdeveloped regions, is the difficulty of integrating novel AI systems into existing, often fragmented, hospital intelligence technologies (IT) infrastructure. The lack of data interoperability between different EHR systems makes it difficult to seamlessly integrate AI solutions, which could increase the complexity and associated costs of implementation.1 Even in advanced settings, CDS systems face challenges in workflow integration and clinician adoption, which can limit their real-world impact.3,11

AI models require access to massive datasets of sensitive patient information, which carries significant risks to patient privacy and data security.6,7 This is compounded by the “black box” problem, in which the internal decision-making processes of complex deep learning models are opaque and not readily interpretable. Explainability and transparency are therefore critical to support clinical accountability and medico-legal decision-making.7,11

Regulatory concerns are increasingly important: AI tools classified as software as a medical device (SaMD) fall under U.S. FDA oversight, requiring evidence of safety, effectiveness, and lifecycle monitoring.11

Both automation complacency, which reflects an over-reliance on AI, as well as selective adherence to only accept advice that confirms pre-existing beliefs, represent practical and ongoing challenges in clinical-AI interactions.1

AI represents a transformative force in emergency medicine with the potential to accelerate and improve the accuracy of patient triage, diagnoses, and resource management, thereby leading to a more efficient and resilient global emergency care system. Nevertheless, the naivety and inherent limitations associated with AI emphasize the importance of using this technology as a tool to augment and empower human clinicians, rather than replace or undermine them. Future directions include broader evaluation of digital twins, real-world validation of CDS systems, EMS-focused AI interventions, and clinician education for nonexperts, which will be key to realizing AI's full potential in emergency medicine.1,3,8,9,11



The role of digital twins in transforming emergency medicine.9

As these technologies continue to advance and become more readily accessible, policymakers, regulators, and healthcare leaders must collaborate to create robust ethical and legal frameworks that provide clear guidance on data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and legal liability.

This article is based on a poster originally authored by Elizabeth Crone, Agnieszka Smolinska, S. Lam, I. Elisia, Crista Bartolomeu, G. Krystal, Billy Boyle, Max Allsworth, Matt Kerr, Lara Pocock, and Renelle Myers.

In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified outdoor air pollution and its primary component, particulate matter, as carcinogens and significant contributors to lung cancer.

A recent report from the Global Burden of Disease estimated that 387,000 lung cancer deaths in 2013 (24% of all lung cancer deaths) were attributable to outdoor air pollution. Additionally, air pollution is associated with an increased risk of mortality from ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infections.

Notably, the particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) was identified as the fifth-ranking risk factor for mortality in 2015.

Despite the acknowledged significance of air pollution exposure as a risk factor for major causes of death at the population level, the effects of particulate matter exposure at the individual level remain inadequately understood.

Controlled exposure studies serve as a valuable approach to elucidate the impacts of particulate exposure and explore acute inflammation. Lung inflammation, a response to pollutants, releases volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath, which may act as non-invasive markers for assessing inflammation.

The study discussed here aimed to identify breath markers associated with acute lung inflammation induced by exposure to 2.5 µm particulate matter (PM2.5) in healthy individuals.

The study recruited 20 healthy individuals (10 males and 10 females, aged 18-45), all of whom were non-smokers.

The study employed a double-blinded crossover design. Participants underwent two separate exposure sessions in the UBC Air Pollution Exposure Lab booth: 300 μg/m3 of PM2.5 from a diesel engine and filtered air (sham), with a minimum spacing of six weeks between exposures.

Participants were randomized and blinded to the order of exposure. Figure 1 presents a representative flowchart of the study design.



Figure 1. Study design diagram. The orange arrows represent the sampling points for exhaled breath (i.e. before the exposure, immediately after the exposure, and 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours after exposure). In the case of respiratory droplets, the sampling will take place at 3 time points (before exposure, 3 hours after exposure, and 24 hours after exposure). Image Credit: Owlstone Medical Ltd

For each exposure, breath samples were collected using Breath Biopsy® at seven time points: baseline before exposure, immediately after exposure, 30 minutes post-exposure, 1 hour post-exposure, 3 hours post-exposure, 6 hours post-exposure, and 24 hours post-exposure.

Respiratory droplet samples were obtained at three time points: baseline before exposure, 3 hours post-exposure, and 24 hours post-exposure. Blood samples were collected at four time points: baseline before exposure, 1 hour post-exposure, 3 hours post-exposure, and 24 hours post-exposure.

Samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), with both untargeted and targeted analyses conducted.

Figure 3. ANOVA Simultaneous Component Analysis of Targeted VOC Data in Exhaled Breath Following Exposure 1: Sham and Exposure 2: Diesel. (A) Score plot of the first principal component (PC1), explaining 35.16 % of the variance, across seven time points. This plot highlights the temporal response of VOCs to sham (Exposure 1) and diesel, PM2.5 (Exposure 2) exposures. Key VOCs such as decane, hexadecane, 1-propanol, p-xylene, 3methylthiophene, and hexane have significant loadings on PC1, indicating their strong association with exposure effects. The importance of the VOCs contributing to the exposure effect is shown in A1. (B) Score plot of the second principal component (PC2), explaining 30.03 % of the variance, over the same time course. This plot shows further differentiation between the exposures, with VOCs like pentanal, heptanal, and decanal contributing significantly to the observed variance. The importance of the VOCs contributing to the exposure effect is shown in B1. Image Credit: Owlstone Medical Ltd



Figure 4. ANOVA Simultaneous Component Analysis of Untargeted VOC Data in Exhaled Breath Following Exposure 1: Sham and Exposure 2: Diesel. (A) Score plot of the first principal component (PC1), which explains 44.02 % of the variance, across seven time points. This figure captures the primary response of VOC profiles to the sham (Exposure 1) and diesel (Exposure 2), with VOCs such as VOC472, VOC235, and VOC186 contributing heavily to this variance. The importance of the VOCs contributing to the exposure effect is shown in A1. (B) Score plot of the second principal component (PC2), explaining 17 % of the variance, depicting additional differences between the exposures over time. VOCs such as VOC33, VOC310, and VOC229 are highlighted for their significant loadings on PC2, indicating their potential role in distinguishing the exposure effects. The importance of the VOCs contributing to the exposure effect is shown in B1. Image Credit: Owlstone Medical Ltd

Data analysis indicated a significant effect of exposure type, along with a notable interaction between post-exposure time and exposure type.

Targeted analysis revealed a significant increase in inflammation-related compounds in individuals exposed to PM2.5 compared to controls. Furthermore, 12 VOCs significantly increased in the breath of the PM2.5 group, with levels diminishing in samples collected 24 hours post-exposure.

The study presented here demonstrates that a distinct breath VOC profile can be detected in individuals exposed to PM2.5, suggesting that breath VOCs may serve as indicators of acute airway inflammation and assist in assessing respiratory diseases related to air pollution.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Scientists find a smarter way to activate the immune system against cancer","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250916/Scientists-find-a-smarter-way-to-activate-the-immune-system-against-cancer.aspx","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:57:00 GMT","

Scientists have developed a smarter way to activate the immune system against cancer, potentially making treatments safer and more precise.

The research focuses on a powerful pathway inside our cells known as STING. When triggered, STING acts like an internal alarm system, sending out signals that summon the body's immune system to attack.

Drugs that activate this pathway have shown promise in cancer therapy, but until now, they faced a major problem: if switched on in healthy tissues, they can cause harmful and sometimes dangerous side effects.

To solve this problem, researchers from the University of Cambridge designed a two-part 'prodrug' system, made of two harmless components that only activate when they meet in a tumour.

One component of the drug was 'caged' so that it remains inactive until it encounters a tumour-specific enzyme called β-glucuronidase, which is rarely found in healthy tissue. When the caged component meets this enzyme inside a tumour, it is unlocked and reacts with the second component.

Together, the two pieces form a powerful STING activator, switching on the immune system only where the cancer is located. The molecules are designed to recognise and stick to each other efficiently, so the reaction happens quickly and selectively inside tumours.

""This is like sending two safe packages into the body that only unlock and combine when they meet the tumour's unique chemistry,"" said Professor Gonçalo Bernardes from Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, who led the research. ""The result is a strong immune-activating drug that appears only where it is needed.""

Laboratory experiments showed that the two drug components have almost no activity on their own. But when they met in tumour conditions, the active compound formed and successfully triggered STING at very low concentrations. In zebrafish and mouse models engineered to produce β-glucuronidase, the drug became active almost exclusively in the tumours, sparing vital organs such as the liver, kidney, and heart. Their results are reported in the journal Nature Chemistry.

This level of precision represents a major advance for STING-based therapies, which have previously struggled to distinguish between healthy and cancerous tissues. By using a simple chemical design, the Cambridge team achieved targeted activation of the immune system without relying on complex or artificial reactions.

Beyond cancer, the researchers believe this method could inspire a new class of precision medicines. The concept of safe, separate components that only form active drugs at the disease site could be applied to other illnesses where strong drugs must be delivered safely.

This discovery is exciting not only for cancer treatment, but also as a new way of thinking about how we make medicines safer and more precise.""

ATLANTA – U.S. Soccer has named Toni Pressley, a long-time professional player and former U.S. youth international, as the new head coach for the U.S. Under-18 Women's National Team.

“We are excited to have Toni join our coaching team,” said U.S. Soccer Head of Youth Women's National Team Development Tracey Kevins. “The U-18 age group is a key milestone for our young female players, offering both top talents and late developers a crucial step on the pathway to our senior Women's National Team. Toni has lived the experience our players will be having and will be well-equipped to assist our players in maximizing their potentials.”

As part of an integrated Women's Youth National Team coaching staff headed by Kevins and guided by U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes, Pressley will work closely with U.S. U-19 WNT head coach Carrie Kveton and U.S. U-20 WNT head coach Vicky Jepson in the cycle to prepare teams for the bi-annual FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup tournaments.

“I'm truly honored and excited for the opportunity to represent the U.S. Soccer Federation in a coaching capacity,” said Pressley.“As someone who came up through the program as a youth player, I have a sincere appreciation for what it means to wear the crest and how important these years are in the lives of our young players. Getting to work with Tracey Kevins and all of my fellow YNT coaches is a full-circle moment that I'm deeply grateful for. I look forward to contributing and evolving in an environment that fosters both learning and growth.”

Pressley comes to U.S. Soccer after a two-year stint as an assistant coach at UMF Afturelding in Iceland's second division. She also coached Afturelding's Under-16s and Under-20s. She finished her pro career in 2023 at Breiðablik in Iceland, capping a 12-year post-college playing career that included stints in the NWSL with the Washington Spirit, Western New York Flash, Houston Dash and Orlando Pride. She also played in Russia with Ryazan VDV and in Australia with Canberra United.

During the summers while she was in college, Pressley played for the Boston Renegades and the Washington Freedom Futures in the W-League. She was drafted in the second round, 13th overall, by the Philadelphia Independence of WPS, but the league folded before the seasons began.

Pressley was a key player on the USA's FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup Team in 2010, partnering in the center of the defense with current U.S. Women's National Team star Crystal Dunn (who would help lead the USA to the 2012 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup title two years later). Pressley, who also played for the USA at the U-17, U-18 and U-23 levels, finished her U-20 international career with 23 caps and two goals. She finished her U-23 WNT career with eight caps and one goal. She had five caps at the U-17 WNT level.

Pressley will be the second head coach for the U.S. Youth Girls' and Women's National Teams program (Katie Schoepfer was the first) to have played for the USA in the age group in which she is coaching – she had three U-18 WNT caps. She is the first head coach in YNT history to have represented the USA in a youth Women's World Cup. She is also the first Black head coach in the YNT program's history.

Pressley holds “B” coaching licenses with both UEFA and U.S. Soccer. Before coaching professionally, Pressley gained experience coaching both girls' high school and club soccer in her home state of Florida. Pressley was a star at Florida State University from 2008-2011, playing in 96 matches for the Seminoles and earning All-American honors.

The hiring gives U.S. Soccer full-time head coaches for the U-15GNT (Vanessa Mann), U-16/U-17GNT (Ciara Crinion), U-17/U-16WNT (Katie Schoepfer), U-18WNT (Toni Pressley), U-19/U-20WNT (Carrie Kveton) and U-20/U-19WNT (Vicky Jepson) with only a U.S. U-23 WNT head coach still to be hired.

The hiring of full-time coaches for each of the age groups is part of the continuing focus on the U.S. Way philosophy which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

U.S. Soccer on Tuesday named Toni Pressley, a long-time professional player and former U.S. youth international, as the head coach for the U.S. Under-18 women's national team.

ATLANTA – U.S. Soccer on Tuesday named Toni Pressley, a long-time professional player and former U.S. youth international, as the head coach for the U.S. Under-18 women's national team.

“We are excited to have Toni join our coaching team,” U.S. Soccer head of youth women's national team development Tracey Kevins said in a statement. “The U-18 age group is a key milestone for our young female players, offering both top talents and late developers a crucial step on the pathway to our senior women's national team. Toni has lived the experience our players will be having and will be well-equipped to assist our players in maximizing their potentials.”

As part of an integrated women's youth national team coaching staff headed by Kevins and guided by USWNT head coach Emma Hayes, Pressley will work closely with U.S. U-19 WNT head coach Carrie Kveton and U.S. U-20 WNT head coach Vicky Jepson in the cycle to prepare teams for the bi-annual FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup tournaments.

“I'm truly honored and excited for the opportunity to represent the U.S. Soccer Federation in a coaching capacity,” Pressley said. “As someone who came up through the program as a youth player, I have a sincere appreciation for what it means to wear the crest and how important these years are in the lives of our young players. Getting to work with Tracey Kevins and all of my fellow YNT coaches is a full-circle moment that I'm deeply grateful for. I look forward to contributing and evolving in an environment that fosters both learning and growth.”

Pressley comes to U.S. Soccer after a two-year stint as an assistant coach at UMF Afturelding in Iceland's second division. She also coached Afturelding's U-16s and U-20s. She finished her pro career in 2023 at Breiðablik in Iceland, capping a 12-year post-college playing career that included stints in the NWSL with the Washington Spirit, Western New York Flash, Houston Dash and Orlando Pride. She also played in Russia with Ryazan VDV and in Australia with Canberra United.

During the summers while she was in college, Pressley played for the Boston Renegades and the Washington Freedom Futures in the W-League. She was drafted in the second round, 13th overall, by the Philadelphia Independence of WPS, but the league folded before the 2012 season began.

Pressley was a key player on the U.S.'s FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup team in 2010, partnering in the center of the defense with current U.S. Women's National Team star Crystal Dunn (who would help lead the USA to the 2012 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup title two years later). Pressley, who also played for the USA at the U-17, U-18 and U-23 levels, finished her U-20 international career with 23 caps and two goals. She finished her U-23 WNT career with eight caps and one goal. She had five caps at the U-17 WNT level.

Pressley will be the second head coach for the U.S. youth girls' and women's national teams program (Katie Schoepfer was the first) to have played for the USA in the age group in which she is coaching – she had three U-18 WNT caps. She is the first head coach in YNT history to have represented the USA in a youth Women's World Cup. She is also the first Black head coach in the YNT program's history.

Pressley holds “B” coaching licenses with both UEFA and U.S. Soccer. Before coaching professionally, Pressley gained experience coaching both girls' high school and club soccer in her home state of Florida. Pressley was a star at Florida State University from 2008-2011, playing in 96 matches for the Seminoles and earning All-American honors.

The hiring gives U.S. Soccer full-time head coaches for the U-15 GNT (Vanessa Mann), U-16/U-17 GNT (Ciara Crinion), U-17/U-16 WNT (Schoepfer), U-18 WNT (Toni Pressley), U-19/U-20 WNT (Carrie Kveton) and U-20/U-19 WNT (Vicky Jepson) with only a U.S. U-23 WNT head coach still to be hired.

As Olivia Moultrie approaches her 20th birthday on September 17, the Portland Thorns midfielder has already cemented her place in history by becoming the highest-scoring teenager in NWSL history. At just 19 years old, Moultrie reached this milestone after scoring her 14th career goal during a 1-1 draw with the Chicago Red Stars on Sunday.

The goal came in the 12th minute when Moultrie sent a stunning 20-yard free kick over the head of the Red Stars goalkeeper, giving her team an early lead. This goal not only helped secure a crucial point for Portland but also pushed Moultrie past Jaedyn Shaw, the former record-holder, who had previously scored the most goals by a teenager in the league. Shaw, now with Gotham FC, made her mark this weekend as well, scoring in her debut match with her new team.

Moultrie had tied Shaw's record last month, but this goal was the one that put her ahead, showcasing her growth and consistency as one of the league's brightest young talents. Shaw, now 20, has also enjoyed a promising career trajectory, which has included an impressive start with North Carolina Courage and a strong debut at Gotham FC.



The goal against Chicago was Moultrie's fourth of the current season, bringing her closer to her career-best single-season tally of seven goals, achieved in 2024. Moultrie first made waves in the NWSL when she debuted at just 15 years old, becoming the league's youngest player to make an appearance. A year later, at 16, she set another record, becoming the youngest-ever goal scorer in NWSL history.

On the international stage, Moultrie earned her first cap for the USWNT in 2023 and has since added two goals to her tally in nine appearances.

With Portland's playoff hopes alive, the Thorns (8-6-6, 30 points) remain in the top four of the standings, but the San Diego Wave, with the same record, are nipping at their heels. Portland currently holds a slight advantage over San Diego, leading them by just two in goal differential.

Moultrie's remarkable performance on the field continues to inspire, and the future of both her and Shaw looks incredibly bright as they both chase even bigger achievements in the years to come.

Pressley is coming off a successful pro career.

 This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here. 

Maybe the national team turned a corner in last week's 2-0 win over Japan.

Maybe the change to a 3-4-2-1 formation unlocked the lively and innovative play that had been missing in the team's first year under coach Mauricio Pochettino. Maybe Pochettino and his players have finally found the chemistry and coordination that was so obviously missing.

And maybe, just maybe, the U.S. really can make a deep run in next summer's World Cup, the first to be played in the U.S. in 32 years.

Maybe.

Or maybe not.

One game can't totally erase the dysfunctional and dispassionate performances that have marked much of the brief Pochettino era, one which included four consecutive losses at home and two losses in as many games with Mexico.

Nor can it make up for a player pool that has seemingly grown thin and ever-changing or speed the learning curve for a successful club coach who has struggled with the transition to the international game.

It's clear Angel City didn't want to upset fans by letting Alyssa Thompson transfer to Chelsea, but the move was a massive win for both player and team.

But it can buy the team and its coach some time.

“Touch the right buttons and we start to perform,” Pochettino said last September, shortly after he took the U.S. job. Just now, however, is he finding those buttons. 

The win over Japan clearly lifts a huge weight off Pochettino and his players, but the reprieve may be temporary. If the U.S. regresses in friendlies with Ecuador and Australia next month, the angst and despair that have hovered over the team most of the year will return.

What it all means is Pochettino and the USMNT have reached a fork in the road. And the path they take will likely shape U.S. Soccer's future for years, if not decades.

A World Cup the federation has been pointing to for years is just nine months away and much is riding on the U.S. team's performance. A deep run in the tournament will engage and ignite the country, open the wallets of deep-pocketed sponsors and do more for the sport in the U.S. than any event since the last World Cup held here. That one led to the formation of MLS, which has grown into the largest first-tier professional league in the world, and the establishment of the U.S. Soccer Foundation, which has invested more than $100 million at the grassroots level, impacting nearly 100 million kids.

The coherent performance against Japan — albeit a young, inexperience Japanese “B” team — brought hope that a successful path, the longest one at the fork in the road, is still open.

But three days before beating Japan, the U.S. was thoroughly outplayed by South Korea in a 2-0 loss — the team's sixth loss in 14 games this year — that raised alarm. According to The Athletic, the performance dropped the U.S. to 48th in the world in the Elo Ratings, a results-based formula for measuring all men's national teams. It was the lowest ranking in 28 years for the Americans.

If the USMNT follows the South Korea path in the World Cup, its tournament run could be short, ending in the first two rounds and likely stunting both interest and investment in soccer in the U.S.

 Soccer 

Alejandro Zendejas and Folarin Balogun score for the Americans, who were playing a Japanese team of primarily national reserves on Tuesday night.

With just three international breaks remaining before the World Cup, there is reason for both hope and concern.

Pochettino's lineup choices remain as unsettled as his tactical approach — although the Japan game may help settle that. As Stuart Holden, World Cup midfielder turned Fox Sports analyst, noted, the change to a three-man backline solved many problems.

Against Japan, Holden said, the center backs played with noticeable confidence and aggression. The formation also freed wingbacks Max Arfsten and Alex Freeman to be more creative and allowed attackers Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun, the team's game-changers, to be more impactful.

There was much to like in the new approach and for the first time in his tenure, it seemed as if Pochettino had finally found a game plan that suited his players, with Balogun among those who benefited most: his goal, off an assist from Pulisic, was his first for the U.S. in nearly 14 months while his start was his first under Pochettino.

The other goal went to Alex Zendejas, who was called up for the first time this year despite having one of the best two-year runs of any USMNT attacker, scoring 16 goals and contributing 15 assists to help Mexico's Club América to three straight Liga MX titles.

Another player who stepped up when given the opportunity was Seattle Sounders midfielder Cristian Roldan, who played an inspired 90 minutes, leading all players with 83 touches.

Pochettino welcomed the result but continued to argue it wasn't the most important thing.

“It's the process,” he told reporters.

“When you are strong in your ideas and your belief, it's about never giv[ing] up.”

 Soccer 

In the wake of Son Heung-min joining LAFC, here's a look at the 10 most significant signings in MLS history.

So which team is the real national team? The one that beat Japan or the one that was humiliated by South Korea? And what will the USMNT's destiny be in the World Cup? A long, profitable run that changes the trajectory of soccer in the U.S. or a short, disappointing one that sets the sport's progress back years?

The October games with Ecuador and Australia could go a long way toward determining that. There's a lot riding on the answer.

More than 1.5 million people registered for the chance to buy World Cup tickets in the first 24 hours of the tournament's initial presale lottery, according to FIFA. Online applications came from 210 countries, FIFA said, with the three host countries — the U.S., Mexico and Canada — leading the way.

The presale draw, which began last Wednesday and will end Friday at 8 a.m. Pacific time, is the first phase of ticket sales for the tournament. After a random selection process, successful applicants will be notified via email starting from Sept. 29 and will be given a date and time slot to purchase tickets, starting at $60, beginning Oct. 1. When fans enter the window won't affect their chances of winning.

Subsequent ticket sales phases will begin in October. Further details on the timeline and products are available at FIFA.com/tickets.

...

It's the timeless hypothetical hovering over American men's soccer.

What if our best athletes played the sport?

U.S. men's national team and Crystal Palace center back Chris Richards isn't offended by it. “I understand it. I truly do,” he said. “I just think it's very unrealistic.”

Salivating for the shortcut to a dominant USMNT, the mainstream sporting public often wonders aloud if NBA or NFL superstars could have conquered soccer instead, and if their next-generation clones are the answer. But that's missing the point.

“I think the argument gets lost pretty quickly when it's about, like, ‘If LeBron James was our center midfielder … ' It's not really about that,” said former MLS and USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, who noted that Lionel Messi is 5-foot-7.

Indeed, peel off the literal layer of the question, and there's the socioeconomic connotation that Richards and Martino both address.

“I just think because of how accessible basketball and football are, our best athletes don't really choose soccer over any other sport,” Richards said.

In addition to the inner-city accessibility of basketball, Martino highlighted its economic appeal. “It's upward mobility, it's a life-changing possibility, and it's the stakes of if it doesn't happen, what? What happens in your life?”

The life-changing potential of a career in football or basketball has dramatically expanded in the era of college athletes being paid. Name, Image and Likeness compensation plus schools directly sharing revenue with athletes — funneled overwhelmingly to football and basketball players — has reinforced the stature and draw of those sports.

Could that ultimately limit the ceiling of the U.S. men's national team, preserving that hypothetical as no more than a fantasy?

In Hoover, Alabama, where Richards is from, football is a religion.

“Every Friday night we were going to high school football games, that was like the fun thing to do. That's why I was kind of devastated that I wasn't allowed to play football growing up because of how big Hoover was when it came to that,” he recalled.

His father, Ken, played basketball at Birmingham-Southern College and then four years overseas. Chris was hooping from third grade until the end of his sophomore year in high school. He was about 5-foot-6 and, having fallen in love with soccer on an Olympic Development Program trip to Argentina, exclusively focused on it that summer entering junior year.

Richards has always been a Crimson Tide football fan but he also loved the University of North Carolina basketball team — he remembered touring their facilities during an official visit — and that was partially why he committed to the school for soccer. He ultimately never suited up for the Tar Heels, signing with FC Dallas instead.

Fellow USMNT defender Alex Freeman also opted not to follow his former professional athlete father's footsteps when soccer became his focus at 14. Alex “played a little bit of everything” growing up, consumed a lot of college football and hoops, and there was “a little bit of pressure” from Green Bay Packers legend Antonio Freeman toward football. But in the end it was up to Alex, and it was an easy decision.

“Soccer was always my love,” he said.

Richards, 25, and Freeman, 21, have taken different professional paths to the national team. Although Richards signed a homegrown contract with FC Dallas in 2018 he never appeared for their first team, heading to Bayern Munich on a loan that led to a transfer when he was 18.

Instead of being a freshman at UNC, Richards was beginning his professional career with one of the biggest clubs in the world. He remembered accidentally opening mail from his youth soccer club indicating that his family — among the many hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis — was behind in payments to the club, and telling himself then: “I need to make it. Whatever I do, I need to make it.”

With Bayern, before NIL burst the dam of dollars flowing to college athletes, Richards was in a unique financial position compared to his friends in the States.

“I remember coming home I guess the first Christmas and like I had friends who were playing college sports, whether it was football, soccer, basketball, they were like, ‘Oh, yoooo, can you lend me a few dollars?'” he said with a chuckle. “I feel like a big man, you know.

“I didn't even think about it until now. But like, yeah, I guess it makes sense. I was legally allowed to make money playing professional sports when they were still going to college.”

Freeman, on the other hand, has remained in MLS for the first chapter of his professional journey, enjoying a breakout 2025 with Orlando City and attracting serious European interest. The timing of a possible transfer is uncertain — Freeman should be in the mix for the World Cup squad even if he stays in MLS until next summer — but the move seems inevitable. It wouldn't be a surprise to see him eventually land where Richards is today: starting in the Premier League, by far the richest league in global soccer. Freeman isn't bothered by the money he may have missed out on in college football or basketball, which can now easily eclipse the earnings of homegrown players in MLS and most American players in general.

Per the MLSPA website, his 2025 base salary is $104,000. While there's a lack of transparency around exactly how much college athletes are earning, that figure is below the estimated range for Power 4 conference football starters at essentially every position in 2025. And Georgia football head coach Kirby Smart told Yahoo Sports' Ross Dellenger prior to the approval of the House settlement — which ushered in direct revenue sharing and was supposed to better regulate payments from boosters via collectives — that there were some high school athletes being paid more than $20,000 a month to stay committed to their school.

But Freeman keeps the disparity between soccer and other domestic sports in perspective, eyeing a future abroad.

“There's more money in Europe. But obviously as a young player myself, signing as a homegrown, I feel like you're signing for the process, being able to eventually make that step,” he said. “People can get attracted to the money, but it's obviously about making that process, to be able to go to the best teams in Europe and everywhere.”

He acknowledges that college is now a more appealing avenue for elite athletes in this new era of compensation and that “some sports get paid more than others,” but he doesn't think he would have made a different decision about which one he chose.

Richards admits the new landscape of college sports could've made it a tougher call today.

“Potentially. I did love basketball to a point, but I just didn't really know what avenue I could go through. I remember hearing about my dad playing overseas, but I never thought about myself playing overseas for basketball,” he said. “I feel like in America, you're thinking NBA, you're thinking NFL and things like that. And if I knew that I could have been making a few million, I would have went crazy in basketball, or even being a kicker for the football team. Those guys are definitely making money as well.

“It would have been a lot tougher to quit basketball if I knew that two years later, I'd be a freshman in college making more than some of my favorite athletes are making overseas.”

Martino was also a hooper until early in high school. He idolized Allen Iverson and at one point dreamed of being in the NBA just as much as being a No. 10 for Boca Juniors.

Outside of his TV analyst role for Turner Sports, he's stayed involved in soccer as an entrepreneur. After an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Soccer presidency in 2018, Martino has remained dedicated to raising the level of accessibility and participation in soccer through the proliferation of spaces for unstructured play, normalizing soccer on concrete. This was already a challenge — Martino emphasized that soccer lacks “an offering that is commensurate with or competitive with basketball” — and it's now being compounded.

“There's two problems that are happening that I think is going to exacerbate this issue of us not casting the widest net for potential in these communities where maybe American football or basketball becomes the draw,” he said. “One is, yeah, the carrot being bigger earlier, right? So now all of a sudden, if the NBA is where the commitment pays off financially, it starts happening at a younger and younger age, of course that's going to turn heads towards that lifestyle, that possibility.”

Richards believes the impact college athletes being paid will have on participation is “huge.”

“Why wouldn't you go to college? Why wouldn't you play that sport? I think it's insane [money],” he said. “Props to the kids, but I think definitely parents are going to be pushing their kids in general into playing certain sports, because you can make money before even becoming a professional.”

And that pressure to pick even earlier is what concerns Martino. “The bigger problem is the hyper specialization of having to make that choice at a younger and younger age,” he said.

“The money is now reinforcement for a 9, 10, 11, 12-year-old who's talented at multiple sports and chooses basketball. But the problem is before that even becomes something that's a conscious decision, these kids are being forced to pick a sport because that's what the privatization and the professionalization of the youth sports industry is driving home to parents.”

Culturally, according to Martino, it's not a mutually exclusive dynamic. His mission is a co-existence with basketball on the blacktop, taking advantage of the existing infrastructure to surge participation.

“The day that you are seeing soccer look like basketball, show up next to basketball and be as pervasive and prolific in urban areas as basketball is the day our men will win a World Cup,” he said.

That's not the expectation next summer, but a deep run definitely is. It's supposed to inspire America's youth and remind them that the USMNT on the World Cup stage is an unparalleled sporting opportunity.

“We're not playing for the Boston Celtics, or we're not playing for the Green Bay Packers. We're playing for the country,” Richards said.

“It's amazing to know that you can represent your country at such a young age,” Freeman said.

But will that patriotism and chance for global exposure resonate enough to overcome the newfound financial pull of the hardwood and the gridiron for a consequential amount of elite athletes? Don't discount the power of what will be the biggest sporting event in history, but Martino maintains that to capitalize on that excitement and ensure participation trends sustainably in the right direction, it is investment in the grassroots infrastructure that will be key.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

For the first time, clubs will not only be paid for releasing players for the football showpiece but also for qualifiers. 

The move is part of a new agreement between FIFA and the European Club Association (ECA), signed in March 2023. The aim is to make the system fairer and more inclusive, ensuring clubs around the world benefit from their players' involvement in football's biggest tournament.

This is almost 70 per cent more than the $209 million shared after the 2022 tournament in Qatar.

“The enhanced edition of the FIFA Club Benefits Programme for the FIFA World Cup 2026 is going a step further by recognising financially the huge contribution that so many clubs and their players around the world make to the staging of both the qualifiers and the final tournament,” according to FIFA President Gianni Infantino. 

“A record USD 355 million will be distributed to clubs for the release of their players, and this reinforces our solid collaboration with the European Club Association and clubs worldwide as we all look forward to a groundbreaking and globally inclusive edition of the FIFA World Cup next year.”

Backing Infantino is ECA president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the experienced sports administrator who also serves as president of Paris Saint-Germain, the reigning UEFA Champions League winners.

""At ECA, we are pleased to have collaborated with FIFA to support the development of this innovative new FIFA Club Benefits Programme,” he told FIFA Website.

“It will ensure even more clubs across the world are rewarded for releasing players and highlights exactly how ECA's Memorandum of Understanding with FIFA supports the ongoing growth of the global club game. 

""Clubs play a pivotal role in the success of national team football and this initiative recognises every element of it, from early development through to release for the most important games. 

“We look forward to continuing to work closely with FIFA, and the global football community, to ensure we keep driving growth and development of international football.""

In the 2022 FIFA World Cup staged in Qatar, a total of USD 209 million was distributed to 440 clubs across 51 FIFA Member Associations from all six confederations. 

The next edition of the tournament will take place from June 11th to July 19th, 2026, in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

ZURICH (AP) — Hundreds more soccer clubs will get shares of a $355 million FIFA fund from its multi-billion 2026 World Cup revenues for releasing players to men's national teams.

FIFA said on Tuesday the program which has shared a total of hundreds of millions of dollars among clubs whose players were selected for each World Cup finals tournament since 2010 will now include all players who took part in qualifying games.

Eritrea and Russia — which has been suspended from international soccer since 2022 — did not play qualifying games among FIFA's 211 member federations.

“This new approach means that any club that releases a player for a FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier will now be directly compensated,” FIFA said in a statement.

FIFA previously agreed on a $355 million allocation for the 2026 edition in the United States, Canada and Mexico as part of a renewed working agreement with the European Club Association (ECA).

That was an increase from $209 million paid to clubs worldwide from each of the past two editions, played in Qatar in 2022 and Russia in 2018.

FIFA said 440 clubs across 51 member countries got payments from the 2022 program, which were calculated as a daily rate for as long as players were involved with their squads at the tournament. Manchester City got the biggest payment with almost $4.6 million.

More than 900 clubs across all 55 UEFA member countries got payments from a similar European program that already includes qualifying games for national team competitions played for four years through 2024.

FIFA created its “club benefits program” with $40 million of revenue from the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as part of a deal with the ECA which was created two years earlier.

FIFA is set to distribute a record $355 million US (about $488 Cdn) to clubs around the world as part of an expanded Club Benefits Programme (CBP) tied to the 2026 World Cup, soccer's world governing body announced on Tuesday.

Clubs that release players for World Cup qualifiers will be compensated for the first time ever, irrespective of whether the player plays at the final tournament.

The initiative marks an increase of nearly 70 per cent from the $209 million US paid out after each of the past two editions, played in Qatar in 2022 and Russia in 2018.

It's part of a renewed memorandum of understanding between FIFA and the European Club Association (ECA) signed in March 2023, aimed at creating a more inclusive and equitable system for global club football.

""The enhanced edition of the FIFA Club Benefits Programme for the FIFA World Cup 2026 is going a step further by recognizing financially the huge contribution that so many clubs and their players around the world make to the staging of both the qualifiers and the final tournament,"" FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement.

World Cup 2026 ticket presale fiercely competitive for fans

The CBP was first introduced for the 2010 World Cup, and 440 clubs from 51 FIFA member associations received payments under the 2022 program.

The payments were calculated as a daily rate for as long as players were involved with their squads at the tournament. Manchester City got the biggest payment from the 2022 program with almost $4.6 million.

With the 2026 edition set to include compensation for qualifiers, the number of benefiting clubs is expected to rise significantly.

ECA Chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi called the program ""innovative.""

""Clubs play a pivotal role in the success of national team football,"" he said. ""This initiative recognizes every element of it, from early development through to release for the most important games.""

The 2026 World Cup runs from June 11 to July 19 in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. A record 48 national teams will participate in the competition.

Soccer is on the rise in the United States, with New York as the epicenter of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
In a sports hotspot traditionally ruled by football, basketball and baseball, soccer is in the midst of a rise in popularity. The U.S. hosted the Club World Cup this summer. They will co-host the World Cup with Canada and Mexico next year. The New York area — MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ — is the host of the final match for both tournaments.
The World Cup's arrival signifies a pivotal time for soccer in the U.S. According to a recent report by For Soccer, the Club World Cup drew 2.5 million spectators. The tournament averaged 39,557 in attendance per game. Over 81,000 filled MetLife for the final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain in July.

When the Premier League Summer Series returned later that month, 82,566 packed MetLife for a match between Manchester United and West Ham. And during the Premier League's opening weekend, NBC platforms, which broadcast six games, averaged a viewership of 850,000 — a 4% increase from the 2024 record high.
It's a growing sport in a growing market — one that John Parker and David Gass, the co-founders of Kickback Soccer Media, are tapping into.
Kickback Soccer is an American soccer media company focused on producing in-depth digital soccer content. The company combines traditional soccer coverage with conversations aimed at engaging with fans.
A new era of sports media
Parker and Gass have both worked in soccer for years.
Parker, the organization's CEO, has worked as a GM of Soccer Champions Tour at Legends, an operating partner at Striker Partners, and co-founded For Soccer. Gass co-hosts the Soccerwise podcast and has worked in and around Major League Soccer for more than a decade.
Part of the challenge with starting a company like Kickback, Gass said, was tapping into a heavily saturated American sports market. They went digital, following a model similar to Jomboy Media's video-driven enterprise. Their company launched with three properties — Soccerwise, Kickback Committee, and First Touch. They're constantly adding new shows and newsletters.
“One of the things, being a soccer fan, especially in the US, is there isn't really traditional coverage,” Gass said. “So [Jomboy] is the only blueprint, because that's the only thing that you could mimic. We can't restart NBC or Fox and make them care about soccer in a valuable way and not a gimmicky way. I think that's what we can build and what we're capable of building. And I think that's where our fans are.”

Kickback has also partnered with the social media platform Bluesky, and aims to further establish it as the home for soccer conversation.
New York City's soccer culture
New York has quickly become the epicenter of soccer in the United States.
Parker, who lives in Greenpoint, quoted MLS commissioner Don Garber, who last year told the Athletic that “America has become the ATM for the soccer world.”
“You can go to Midtown,” Parker said, “And you can go to the Serie A office. You can go to the Bundesliga office. You can go to the La Liga office. You could go through all of the leagues, all of the clubs, everybody is set up in Manhattan to find ways to sell soccer to Americans, to sell soccer to New Yorkers.”







Added Gass, who was born and raised on Long Island: “You can find anything in New York, right? If you are the biggest fan of X niche thing, there's going to be one comic book shop or one area of the city where people connect with that.”
Where Parker and Gass both feel there is work to be done is bridging the gap between the fans and the business community. When Gass was growing up, he'd travel to the city's different boroughs to watch international and men's league games.
Having MLS clubs in the area — New York City FC and New York Red Bulls — creates surface-level excitement, Gass added. Events like the Club World Cup and next year's World Cup will make more people see how popular and connected the sport is.






“There's a very different fan community here than a business community,” Parker said. “I hope that we can be a part of an attempt to actually bring them a little closer together.”
Impact of the 2026 World Cup
Gass said he's drooling over next summer's World Cup and the opportunities it brings to grow the game.
“The reason I love this sport is I love the global nature of it,” he said. “Having a 48-team World Cup across three countries is everything I've ever dreamed about.”
He explained that Kickback's plans for the next year are largely built around getting more people into the sport. The World Cup gives them leverage to tap into a market of new fans. This will involve a series of videos — which Gass calls “First Touch” — like explainers and entry-level content. The company plans to combine this with 24/7 coverage of the tournament.






The company has big plans, including live shows, events and longer features. They want to cover the tournament from every angle.
“For me,” Gass said, “It's an excuse to cover anything I want, because nothing's not connected to this World Cup with 48 teams across the world. Any little soccer story that you've ever wanted to tell or talk about or delve into, it's connected to this tournament.”
“I think people don't fully grasp how big this thing is going to be,” Parker added. “‘94 was great, but we didn't have the digital era. Soccer had not taken the hold it's taken in this country, we didn't have these modern stadiums across the country. The sheer scale of this thing is bigger than anything we've ever experienced on the planet.”

The company has big plans, including live shows, events and longer features. They want to cover the tournament from every angle.
“For me,” Gass said, “It's an excuse to cover anything I want, because nothing's not connected to this World Cup with 48 teams across the world. Any little soccer story that you've ever wanted to tell or talk about or delve into, it's connected to this tournament.”
“I think people don't fully grasp how big this thing is going to be,” Parker added. “‘94 was great, but we didn't have the digital era. Soccer had not taken the hold it's taken in this country, we didn't have these modern stadiums across the country. The sheer scale of this thing is bigger than anything we've ever experienced on the planet.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Can European champions PSG cope with strain of injury crisis?","https://thescore.com/fra_fed/news/3346560/amp","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:42:30 GMT","

There is the sense that the new season gets up and running for real this week for Paris Saint-Germain as they begin their defence of the Champions League title amid doubts as to how much longer their squad can handle being pushed to the limit by a crowded calendar.

PSG host Atalanta on Wednesday for their first game in Europe, three and a half months after their stunning 5-0 destruction of Inter Milan in last season's final in Munich.

Luis Enrique's team will also entertain Bayern, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United in the league phase, with trips to Barcelona, Bayer Leverkusen, Athletic Bilbao and to Lisbon to face Sporting on the horizon too.

Those are tough games, although PSG's poor start in last season's Champions League has shown that they might not need to be at their very best immediately.

The French champions lost three of eight league phase games last season, but still won Europe's elite club competition for the first time following a dazzling run of form from the turn of the year.

The concern now, however, is that last season's exertions could catch up with them and seriously jeopardise their chances of retaining the trophy.

The Parisians played 65 games during 2024-25, in a season spanning 11 months. That included 17 matches in the Champions League and seven in the Club World Cup, where their marathon campaign concluded with a 3-0 loss to Chelsea in mid-July.

Three weeks later they were back for pre-season training, and a week after that they started the new campaign against Tottenham in the UEFA Super Cup.

Fast forward a month and PSG -- who won the Super Cup on penalties -- have won their first four games in Ligue 1 but it looks like the recent efforts are beginning to catch up with them.

Ballon d'Or favourite Ousmane Dembele and Desire Doue are out for several weeks with muscle injuries suffered playing for France, while Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Lee Kang-in and Lucas Beraldo came off hurt in Sunday's 2-0 victory over Lens.

""It happens to everyone. It is a bit of a difficult time for us because we have a lot of players injured,"" said Luis Enrique, the coach with his own arm in a sling after fracturing a collarbone in a cycling accident.

""I am calm about it and I hope we will manage to overcome it.""

It is not solely luck that PSG avoided serious injuries last season, owing much to the coach's management of the squad.

Nineteen PSG players played more than 1,000 minutes in 2024/25, the same number as Real Madrid and Barcelona for example.

But the Club World Cup, often played in searing heat and involving numerous long journeys across the United States, had to take a toll.

PSG used 19 players in that competition, while Chelsea fielded 27 -- the French side looked rinsed in the final and were torn apart.

If they do go to the latter stages of the Champions League again, PSG are looking at playing at least 55 games this season, including the FIFA Intercontinental Cup in December.

And there is a World Cup coming at the end of the season, where a large bulk of PSG's players will be present.

The year is set to be even more intense for Achraf Hakimi, who played more minutes than anyone else for PSG last season -- he will also feature heavily for Morocco as they host the Africa Cup of Nations in December and January.

Hakimi has no natural understudy at right-back at PSG, who surprisingly opted not to add significant depth to their squad in the transfer window, signing only one new centre-back in Illia Zabarnyi, while Lucas Chevalier replaced Gianluigi Donnarumma in goal.

""Injuries to high-profile players are only one visible part of the workload crisis facing professional football and are not surprising,"" said global players' union FIFPro last week.

""The impact is not felt just by the players but increasingly also by clubs, national teams, fans and national competitions.""

Yet despite the concerns, there is huge excitement at PSG as they put their title on the line in Europe.

""It is a special moment. We know how difficult this competition is, but we are relaxed about it and we are hoping to put in a good performance in our first game,"" said Luis Enrique.","{'href': 'https://thescore.com', 'title': 'theScore.com'}","soccer"

The 23rd edition of the most televised sporting event in the world is already in the making, and many are wondering how to get a coveted ticket to any of the tournament's 104 matches.

To purchase tickets for a World Cup game, fans must either buy a premium package or register for a draw. FIFA will then grant randomly selected applicants the opportunity to buy tickets.

Here's how it works:

FIFA, the event's governing body, announced that there will be three draw periods.

Later, closer to the tournament, any remaining unsold tickets will be up for grabs. FIFA also announced that it will launch an official resale platform.

Alternatively, fans can buy hospitality packages, which are now available without the need to be selected in a raffle. Hospitality packages include preferred seating, refreshments, and access to VIP lounges. Hospitality package tickets start at $1,400 per person.

There are also Venue Series packages that include entrance to all games scheduled in a single venue. The Venue Series packages start at $8,000. The Venue Series package for the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey is selling for $68,150.

Ticket prices will vary depending on proximity to the field, favorable vantage point, and the tournament stage of the match. The closer to the final match, the more expensive the tickets will be.

Expect prices per ticket to range from $60 to over $5,000.

The World Cup is in 2026. The global tournament is set to run from June 11 through July 19, 2026.

Mexico's team will play in the inaugural match, set to be held in Mexico City. The opposing team has yet to be announced.

Only the classification matches involving the host nations —Mexico, Canada, and the United States— have already been assigned dates and venues.

Team USA is scheduled to debut on Friday, June 12, in Los Angeles at SoFi Stadium. After that, the U.S. team will play on Friday, June 19, at Seattle's Lumen Field, and then return to Los Angeles for a match on June 25.

Additional match dates for Team USA will be announced as the tournament progresses, depending on their performance in the group stage and whether they advance to the knockout rounds.

The World Cup final is slated to take place at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium. The venue sits in the borough of East Rutherford, 8 miles west of Manhattan.

For the first time, clubs will not only be paid for releasing players for the football showpiece but also for qualifiers. 

The move is part of a new agreement between FIFA and the European Club Association (ECA), signed in March 2023. The aim is to make the system fairer and more inclusive, ensuring clubs around the world benefit from their players' involvement in football's biggest tournament.

This is almost 70 per cent more than the $209 million shared after the 2022 tournament in Qatar.

“The enhanced edition of the FIFA Club Benefits Programme for the FIFA World Cup 2026 is going a step further by recognising financially the huge contribution that so many clubs and their players around the world make to the staging of both the qualifiers and the final tournament,” according to FIFA President Gianni Infantino. 

“A record USD 355 million will be distributed to clubs for the release of their players, and this reinforces our solid collaboration with the European Club Association and clubs worldwide as we all look forward to a groundbreaking and globally inclusive edition of the FIFA World Cup next year.”

Backing Infantino is ECA president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the experienced sports administrator who also serves as president of Paris Saint-Germain, the reigning UEFA Champions League winners.

""At ECA, we are pleased to have collaborated with FIFA to support the development of this innovative new FIFA Club Benefits Programme,” he told FIFA Website.

“It will ensure even more clubs across the world are rewarded for releasing players and highlights exactly how ECA's Memorandum of Understanding with FIFA supports the ongoing growth of the global club game. 

""Clubs play a pivotal role in the success of national team football and this initiative recognises every element of it, from early development through to release for the most important games. 

“We look forward to continuing to work closely with FIFA, and the global football community, to ensure we keep driving growth and development of international football.""

In the 2022 FIFA World Cup staged in Qatar, a total of USD 209 million was distributed to 440 clubs across 51 FIFA Member Associations from all six confederations. 

The next edition of the tournament will take place from June 11th to July 19th, 2026, in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

ZURICH (AP) — Hundreds more soccer clubs will get shares of a $355 million FIFA fund from its multi-billion 2026 World Cup revenues for releasing players to men's national teams.

FIFA said on Tuesday the program which has shared a total of hundreds of millions of dollars among clubs whose players were selected for each World Cup finals tournament since 2010 will now include all players who took part in qualifying games.

Eritrea and Russia — which has been suspended from international soccer since 2022 — did not play qualifying games among FIFA's 211 member federations.

“This new approach means that any club that releases a player for a FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier will now be directly compensated,” FIFA said in a statement.

FIFA previously agreed on a $355 million allocation for the 2026 edition in the United States, Canada and Mexico as part of a renewed working agreement with the European Club Association (ECA) signed more than two years ago.

That was an increase from $209 million paid to clubs worldwide from each of the past two editions, played in Qatar in 2022 and Russia in 2018.

FIFA said 440 clubs across 51 member countries got payments from the 2022 program, which were calculated as a daily rate for as long as players were involved with their squads at the tournament. Manchester City got the biggest payment with almost $4.6 million.

The highest-earning clubs will earn a lower overall share this time because the pool of eligible teams has widened due to FIFA expanding the men's World Cup to 48 teams from 32, and qualifying games now also included.

More than 900 clubs across all 55 UEFA member countries got payments from a similar European program that already includes qualifying games for national team competitions played for four years through 2024.

FIFA created its “club benefits program” with $40 million of revenue from the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as part of a deal with the ECA which was created two years earlier.

 This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here. 

Maybe the national team turned a corner in last week's 2-0 win over Japan.

Maybe the change to a 3-4-2-1 formation unlocked the lively and innovative play that had been missing in the team's first year under coach Mauricio Pochettino. Maybe Pochettino and his players have finally found the chemistry and coordination that was so obviously missing.

And maybe, just maybe, the U.S. really can make a deep run in next summer's World Cup, the first to be played in the U.S. in 32 years.

Maybe.

Or maybe not.

One game can't totally erase the dysfunctional and dispassionate performances that have marked much of the brief Pochettino era, one which included four consecutive losses at home and two losses in as many games with Mexico.

Nor can it make up for a player pool that has seemingly grown thin and ever-changing or speed the learning curve for a successful club coach who has struggled with the transition to the international game.

It's clear Angel City didn't want to upset fans by letting Alyssa Thompson transfer to Chelsea, but the move was a massive win for both player and team.

But it can buy the team and its coach some time.

“Touch the right buttons and we start to perform,” Pochettino said last September, shortly after he took the U.S. job. Just now, however, is he finding those buttons. 

The win over Japan clearly lifts a huge weight off Pochettino and his players, but the reprieve may be temporary. If the U.S. regresses in friendlies with Ecuador and Australia next month, the angst and despair that have hovered over the team most of the year will return.

What it all means is Pochettino and the USMNT have reached a fork in the road. And the path they take will likely shape U.S. Soccer's future for years, if not decades.

A World Cup the federation has been pointing to for years is just nine months away and much is riding on the U.S. team's performance. A deep run in the tournament will engage and ignite the country, open the wallets of deep-pocketed sponsors and do more for the sport in the U.S. than any event since the last World Cup held here. That one led to the formation of MLS, which has grown into the largest first-tier professional league in the world, and the establishment of the U.S. Soccer Foundation, which has invested more than $100 million at the grassroots level, impacting nearly 100 million kids.

The coherent performance against Japan — albeit a young, inexperience Japanese “B” team — brought hope that a successful path, the longest one at the fork in the road, is still open.

But three days before beating Japan, the U.S. was thoroughly outplayed by South Korea in a 2-0 loss — the team's sixth loss in 14 games this year — that raised alarm. According to The Athletic, the performance dropped the U.S. to 48th in the world in the Elo Ratings, a results-based formula for measuring all men's national teams. It was the lowest ranking in 28 years for the Americans.

If the USMNT follows the South Korea path in the World Cup, its tournament run could be short, ending in the first two rounds and likely stunting both interest and investment in soccer in the U.S.

 Soccer 

Alejandro Zendejas and Folarin Balogun score for the Americans, who were playing a Japanese team of primarily national reserves on Tuesday night.

With just three international breaks remaining before the World Cup, there is reason for both hope and concern.

Pochettino's lineup choices remain as unsettled as his tactical approach — although the Japan game may help settle that. As Stuart Holden, World Cup midfielder turned Fox Sports analyst, noted, the change to a three-man backline solved many problems.

Against Japan, Holden said, the center backs played with noticeable confidence and aggression. The formation also freed wingbacks Max Arfsten and Alex Freeman to be more creative and allowed attackers Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun, the team's game-changers, to be more impactful.

There was much to like in the new approach and for the first time in his tenure, it seemed as if Pochettino had finally found a game plan that suited his players, with Balogun among those who benefited most: his goal, off an assist from Pulisic, was his first for the U.S. in nearly 14 months while his start was his first under Pochettino.

The other goal went to Alex Zendejas, who was called up for the first time this year despite having one of the best two-year runs of any USMNT attacker, scoring 16 goals and contributing 15 assists to help Mexico's Club América to three straight Liga MX titles.

Another player who stepped up when given the opportunity was Seattle Sounders midfielder Cristian Roldan, who played an inspired 90 minutes, leading all players with 83 touches.

Pochettino welcomed the result but continued to argue it wasn't the most important thing.

“It's the process,” he told reporters.

“When you are strong in your ideas and your belief, it's about never giv[ing] up.”

 Soccer 

In the wake of Son Heung-min joining LAFC, here's a look at the 10 most significant signings in MLS history.

So which team is the real national team? The one that beat Japan or the one that was humiliated by South Korea? And what will the USMNT's destiny be in the World Cup? A long, profitable run that changes the trajectory of soccer in the U.S. or a short, disappointing one that sets the sport's progress back years?

The October games with Ecuador and Australia could go a long way toward determining that. There's a lot riding on the answer.

More than 1.5 million people registered for the chance to buy World Cup tickets in the first 24 hours of the tournament's initial presale lottery, according to FIFA. Online applications came from 210 countries, FIFA said, with the three host countries — the U.S., Mexico and Canada — leading the way.

The presale draw, which began last Wednesday and will end Friday at 8 a.m. Pacific time, is the first phase of ticket sales for the tournament. After a random selection process, successful applicants will be notified via email starting from Sept. 29 and will be given a date and time slot to purchase tickets, starting at $60, beginning Oct. 1. When fans enter the window won't affect their chances of winning.

Subsequent ticket sales phases will begin in October. Further details on the timeline and products are available at FIFA.com/tickets.

The former USMNT attacking midfielder enjoyed one of the more remarkable careers in American soccer history

As far as the Vietnamese media were concerned, there were only two players who took the pitch at the 2005 U20 World Cup. The first was a 17-year-old from Rosario, Argentina, then of Barcelona's academy, named Lionel Messi. The second was an 18-year-old from Dallas, Texas, then of Plano East high school, named Lee Nguyen.

The two would, of course, have vastly different careers. Messi, the Inter Miami star, won eight Ballons d'or (and counting), and has claimed every major trophy in football. Nguyen's journey was more complex, one that covered four countries and numerous barriers broken. But in the streets of Ho Chinh Mi City, the two experience a similar state of notoriety.

Messi has the fame associated with being the greatest footballer of all time. Nguyen, meanwhile, is still recognized - his playing career now over - as perhaps the best player of Vietnam descent to ever kick a ball. He played in the Vietnamese league for three years, and MLS for eight more. Toss in a European and college stint, and his journey has been captivating - if not as successful as Messi's magnificence.

“When I reflect back on it, or when people ask me about my career, and where I played - it's crazy to think about the journey and the path that I took,” Nguyen told GOAL. “It's been a great experience, and I have stories to look back on that I'm proud of.”

You think? There are tales throughout his career of a very good footballer drawn towards a country that was simply desperate to have him - at times, to a fault. Nguyen still recalls agents pestering his father at all hours, call after call, with offers to play football far and wide. 

He reflects on the “different” experience of playing in the V-League, having fans try to tear his shinpads off before games, just as a memento.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner just met in the US Open final, their third consecutive clash in a major championship match. When will the top two players in the PIF ATP Rankings be back in action?

Alcaraz returns to competition this coming weekend in San Francisco at the Laver Cup, where he will play for the second time. Last year, the Spaniard helped Team Europe to glory with victories against Ben Shelton and Taylor Fritz.

The new World No. 1 is then scheduled to compete the following week in the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships, the ATP 500 event held in Tokyo. Alcaraz will be making his debut in the tournament.

That same week, Sinner is scheduled to play in the China Open, the ATP 500 event in Beijing. The Italian won the title in 2023 and reached the final last year.



Both men will then be in the same draw again at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, the penultimate ATP Masters 1000 of the season.

Alcaraz is in control in the battle for ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours with Sinner. The Spaniard is in pole position to earn the accolade for the second time (also 2022).

We're counting down the days to the Laver Cup in San Francisco—starting Friday, September 19—by looking back at memorable moments from competitions past. On the way to Team Europe's Laver Cup comeback victory in 2024, Alexander Zverev denied Frances Tiafoe a hero's moment for the third year in a row.Frances Tiafoe was integral to Team World's first two Laver Cup triumphs in 2022 and 2023 by delivering the clinching victory in the first title and six points in the second.But Alexander Zverev, who also knows first-hand what it takes to guide a team to Laver Cup glory, assured that the American wouldn't have that euphoric moment for the third year in a row.

As the crowd in Uber Arena found full voice in support of its man, Zverev's game rose to the occasion.

David Coulthard on McLaren team orders

Trailer: F1 Memory Box with David Coulthard

Fred Vasseur has shared more thoughts on Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari adaptation two thirds of the way into his first season in red.

Ferrari team boss Fred Vasseur remains “convinced” that Lewis Hamilton will get back to his best at Ferrari sooner rather than later, admitting the squad might have “underestimated” the changes the Briton has experienced so far this year.

After two lengthy stints at McLaren and Mercedes, Hamilton made a blockbuster move to the Scuderia for the 2025 season – aiming to help end their championship-winning drought and get back to the top step of the podium himself.

It has been a mixed campaign for the seven-time World Champion so far, with highs including his Sprint pole position and victory at the Chinese Grand Prix, and lows including early Qualifying exits and point-less races.

Vasseur, though, is not concerned, underlining the various factors Hamilton has been getting used to in an appearance on F1's Beyond The Grid podcast.

“I don't know if we underestimated the importance of the change,” said Vasseur. “Probably, because he spent 10 years at McLaren, then 12 with Mercedes, but it was a kind of continuity – two teams based in the UK with the same engine, same environment.

“[Joining Ferrari] is a complete change for him, in his life, the culture of the team and everything. To do it in three test days in the winter period is quite difficult – and I think also the expectation was huge.

“We have to put everything in place, and it's taking time. We have to also manage expectations and manage the noise around the team.”

Making reference to F1's incredibly tight field in 2025, Vasseur continued: “The comments [about performances] are positive or negative for plus or minus one-tenth of a second, or plus or minus a click of front wing that you did or not – it's always marginal.

“If we are not able to put everything together from the preparation of the weekend, the adaptation to the simulator, blah, blah, blah, until Sunday, you can miss one-tenth there or one-tenth there. This is making a huge difference in terms of pure results.”

Moving forward, Vasseur stressed the importance of support – in both directions – as driver and team look to end the current season in a competitive way and approach F1's upcoming rules reset in a good place.

“It's up to us to support him when he is struggling, and we also need to push him when he's struggling,” said Vasseur. “Spa and Budapest were difficult for him, but he can be sure that he has the full support of everyone in Maranello to recover, to be back.

“I'm really convinced that he will do it. We have to be supportive with him every single day, and I will be supportive every single day with Lewis.

“It's a matter of support and mentality. He's fully committed, he's pushing like hell. He's trying to get the best from everybody, and he will always have my support for this.

“He's a champion, he's doing very well, and he has the pace. The other characteristic is to try to get the best from the people around you, extra motivation, and extra push. For sure, this characteristic is there.”

Red Bull and Ford are gearing up for F1's all-new regulations in 2026 – with Max Verstappen playing his part.

Red Bull team boss Laurent Mekies and Ford CEO Jim Farley have underlined the importance of four-time World Champion Max Verstappen when it comes to the success of their new power unit partnership.

Ahead of overhauled regulations coming into play next season, Red Bull Powertrains have been working in collaboration with Ford to develop engines that will be used by both Red Bull Racing and sister outfit Racing Bulls.

With current supplier Honda heading to Aston Martin, Mekies described the decision to make an engine from scratch as “the sort of crazy stuff Red Bull does” and likened the challenge to climbing Mount Everest.

As work continues at pace, Farley and Mekies – who appeared together at the recent Italian Grand Prix – both pointed to Verstappen as being a key part of the process on and off the track.

“I think this is one of the most important pillars or foundation for the PU's (power unit) success,” Farley told Sky Sports News.

“Talking to Max… we at Ford really have grown our respect for Max watching him this year. The way he has provided stability – without drama – in an environment where we're all just trying to do our jobs. I can really see that in his eyes today versus last year.

“I think it's one of the great things about Laurent and his team, that they all have this deep commitment to each other.”

Opening up on just how involved Verstappen is, Mekies added: “Max is doing a lot more than just asking for the numbers. You would be surprised. Max is giving so much to the projects also outside of the car.

“He's not just asking the numbers, he's testing the car in the simulators, he's working with engineers on both sides of the fence to understand how do we develop these 2026 cars? Where do we try to get the power? Where do we try to get the downforce?

“So, that's how central to the project he is. He certainly wants a fast car next year, and he's doing everything he can in the car and outside the car to help us give him that.”

The award-winning Formula 1 Exhibition will opens its doors at the world-renowned Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre in November.

The award-winning Formula 1 Exhibition will make its long-awaited Asia-Pacific debut when it opens its doors at the world-renowned Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre in Australia on 29 November 2025.

Following hugely successful runs in Madrid, Vienna, Toronto, London, Buenos Aires, and most recently Amsterdam – where the show was extended due to overwhelming popular demand – Melbourne will become the eighth city to host the critically acclaimed show after the recently announced F1 Exhibition in Oberhausen, Germany.

Known for its headline sporting and cultural events, Melbourne has been a hub for Formula 1 since 1996. The Australian Grand Prix remains one of the highlights of the season, and with a long-term agreement in place, F1 will continue to race at Albert Park for years to come.

F1 Exhibition will pay homage to Australia's rich motorsport heritage, with the show celebrating former World Champions Jack Brabham and Alan Jones, past race winners Mark Webber and Daniel Ricciardo, as well as current title contender Oscar Piastri.

The show will offer fans the ultimate immersive experience, with exclusive archive content, interviews with some of the sport's biggest icons and historic memorabilia. Other highlights include F1 cars from different eras, interactive installations that showcase the technology behind Formula 1, and a dedicated room paying homage to Australia's racing history.

Fans will also get a chance to race around the iconic Albert Park circuit in state-of-the-art F1 driving simulators.

The Melbourne edition will start with Once Upon A Time In Formula 1, a gallery of previously unpublished photos, films, artefacts and numerous interviews with F1's most famous personalities, taking visitors through some of the most popular and defining moments in the sport's history.

Guests then move onto the Design Lab which gives a rare insight into the development of an F1 car and shows how the teams design and produce new components for their cars. The room takes fans inside an F1 factory, and features contributions from Pirelli, Williams, McLaren, Red Bull, Mercedes, and Kick Sauber.

Drivers and Duels tells the stories of legendary drivers and rivalries, with highlights including the Hall of Fame, which features over 60 helmets and the most iconic race suits from Formula 1's 75-year history. Revolution By Design explores the sport's groundbreaking innovations and the future of F1, with contributions from Lotus, McLaren, Ferrari, Mercedes, Honda, and F1 ACADEMY's Managing Director Susie Wolff, plus more.

Visitors then enter Survival, where previously unseen remains of parts of Romain Grosjean's burnt out Haas car – including the steering wheel and a tyre – and his boots and gloves from his dramatic 2020 crash in Bahrain will be displayed. The show then reaches its climax at The Pit Wall – a cinematic and immersive experience that allows fans to relive the greatest moments in Formula 1 history.

True courage would have meant calling for peace, for coexistence, for the humanity of both Israelis and Palestinians, even if it risked boos instead of applause, writes Israeli activist Hen Mazzig.


							By 

	Hen Mazzig



As a queer Jew, son of refugees from Iraq and Tunisia (Berber) who has dedicated my life to fighting antisemitism, I read Hannah Einbinder's Emmys-night comments with sadness and fear. When the Hacks actor signed a pledge to boycott Israeli film institutions and used her platform to declare “Free Palestine,” she no doubt believed she was doing something bold, even righteous. But what she did wasn't brave, it was populist. And it was dangerous.There is nothing risky about parroting the most popular slogan in Hollywood. Wearing a pin or signing an open letter won't cost you jobs or red carpet invites — if anything, it buys you applause. But for millions of Jews, it comes with a cost: our safety.The claim that anti-Israel rhetoric is separate from antisemitism collapses under the weight of reality. Jews are attacked on the streets of New York, stabbed in Europe, shot in synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway — by people who believe the same conspiracy theories anti-Israel activists spread.A Jew being punched in Los Angeles doesn't care that his attacker says it's “about Israel.” He cares that there is a fist in his face.Just this past May, a gunman opened fire outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., during a reception hosted by the American Jewish Committee, killing a Jewish woman and her partner. Witnesses say the shooter shouted, “Free Palestine.” Hannah Einbinder did not condemn it. Instead she repeated it onstage.Hannah should know there is no such thing as a “good Jew” who can launder antisemitism. The “good Jews” trope — the ones who sign boycott pledges or reassure progressives that this isn't about hatred — are always used as cover. They are never enough. And at the end of the day, the people demanding “good Jews” don't actually believe there is anything good about being Jewish.That is why Einbinder's words sting so deeply. She is not just a comedian with a platform — she is a Jewish comedian. When she singles out Israel, the one Jewish state in the world, home to half of global Jewry, she is telling millions of us that the single most unifying part of our identity is illegitimate.But the truth is that according to a Pew Research survey in 2021 more than 80 percent of American Jews say they are pro-Israel. Add to that the half of the world's Jews who live in Israel, and it becomes clear: Zionism is not a fringe ideology. It is the consensus of the Jewish people — the belief that we have a right to live freely and safely in our ancestral homeland after centuries of exile and persecution.To oppose Zionism is not merely to challenge a government policy. It is to challenge Jewish existence as a free people. You can criticize Netanyahu and his government's actions and policies — I know I have, and still hold this truth.Words have consequences. When celebrities make it trendy to vilify Israel, it fuels the climate that leads to Jewish schools under police guard, synagogues set on fire and children beaten on their way to class.True bravery would have been using that Emmy stage to call for the release of the 48 hostages still held in Gaza and end of the war. True courage would have meant calling for peace, for coexistence, for the humanity of both Israelis and Palestinians, even if it risked boos instead of applause.Hannah Einbinder had a rare moment when the world was listening. She could have built a bridge. Instead, she burned one.

The 'Butch Cassidy' and 'All the President's Men' actor, Oscar-winning director and Sundance founder was ""always about breaking the rules,"" he said.


							By 

	Stephen Galloway



Robert Redford, the Hollywood golden boy and Sundance Film Festival founder who starred in such movies as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Way We Were and All the President's Men — and who won an Academy Award for directing Ordinary People — died Tuesday. He was 89. 


	Redford died in his sleep at his home outside Provo, Utah, his longtime publicist, Cindi Berger, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter.




	The actor-producer-director, a four-time Academy Award nominee and honorary Oscar recipient, was one of the few truly iconic screen figures of the past half-century, the avatar of a certain kind of all-American ideal who nonetheless took a dyspeptic view of his country in several notable dramas including Downhill Racer (1969), The Candidate (1972), Three Days of the Condor (1975) and All the President's Men (1976).

	He brought his good looks, ineffable charm and romantic appeal to heroes as well as antiheroes, from one of the outlaws in Sundance Kid to the Nixon-toppling journalist Bob Woodward in All the President's Men to the well-meaning but naive political contender Bill McKay in Candidate. His sheen often contrasted with the jaundiced view of his pictures, particularly in the '70s films that remain among his best; but he could use his appeal to equal and devastating effect in romance, notably opposite Barbra Streisand in The Way We Were (1973).


	Behind the California-kid surface was a darker and more complicated figure. The very definition of a Hollywood star, he nonetheless saw himself as an outsider and spent much of his time living away from the epicenters of the industry — including at the Utah skiing resort that he turned into the Sundance Institute and the Sundance Film Festival.

	











	He bestrode two worlds, his biographer, Michael Feeney Callan, wrote in 2011: “His life [was] peripatetic. He engaged [in] careers on the East Coast and West. It may not be a coincidence that his arts laboratory — his ‘great experiment' [Sundance] is not too many miles from Promontory Summit, where, in 1869, the golden spike was hammered that joined the East Coast and West on the transcontinental railroad.”


	Born in Santa Monica on Aug. 18, 1936, Charles Robert Redford Jr. grew up poor in a heavily immigrant part of town, his family scraping by on the earnings of his father, a risk-averse milkman who later became an accountant. “[He] worked brutal hours,” Redford, an only child, remembered in a 2014 interview with THR. “I didn't see much of him when I was a kid.”


	His mother, Martha, a homemaker, “was the strong member of the family. She was very outgoing. She always had a smile; she was very, very adventurous. Risk was not a big issue for her. She came from Texas, and she carried that kind of robust, jocular goodwill. She saw things in a positive light. She also felt that I could do anything, and she was very supportive of anything I might try.”


	Redford rebelled against his father's cautiousness and indeed against all expectations, even after the family moved to the more upscale Van Nuys. “I was always about breaking the rules,” he said. “I wanted to be away from Los Angeles because I felt it was going to the dogs. I was just getting more and more anxious about wanting out. I didn't want to be wherever I was. And I felt a certain suffocation. I felt things were closing in around me, and it made me anxious. I wanted to be free.”

	











	His dream was to follow in the footsteps of the great artists who had made Paris their hub; he didn't consider a career as an actor until later, after dropping out of the University of Colorado following his mother's death in 1955, when he took months off to travel around Europe. He was deeply affected by his experiences in Spain, Italy and France. “It was the first time I developed any kind of a political view,” he said, “because I couldn't care less about politics when I was growing up.”


	He became a passionate environmentalist and supporter of Native American and LGBTQ rights and remained that way throughout his life. In 2018, he published on the Sundance website a lament about the state of America titled, “A Brief Statement About Big Things.”


	“Tonight,” he complained, following the news of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court, “for the first time I can remember, I feel out of place in the country I was born into and the citizenship I've loved my whole life.”


	After returning to the U.S., he studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and then found work in theater and television. He became a young father and had four children with his first wife, Lola Van Wagenen, whom he had met when she was a 17-year-old student at Brigham Young University. One son, Scott, died at 2 1/2 months old from sudden infant death syndrome in 1959, leaving Redford guilt-ridden even though there was nothing he could have done, and his other son, Jamie, died in October 2020 of bile-duct cancer in his liver.

	











	He is survived by his daughters, Shauna and Amy; his second wife, Sibylle Szaggars, whom he married in 2009; and seven grandchildren.


	He made his onscreen debut in a 1960 episode of ABC's Maverick. Three years later, he earned an Emmy nomination for his work on an installment of the ABC anthology series Alcoa Premiere and starred in a memorable Broadway production of Neil Simon‘s Barefoot in the Park (directed by Mike Nichols), which he later filmed alongside frequent collaborator Jane Fonda.


	“You feel that he is somehow better than most other mortals,” she wrote in her 2005 autobiography, My Life So Far. “You want Bob to like you, so you are loath to do or say anything that might make him think less of you.”


	After the play, Redford turned down a number of high-profile roles, including the lead in Nichols' The Graduate (1967). “I was suddenly Mr. Focus,” he told Callan. “Eleanor Roosevelt and Noël Coward dropped by. Natalie Wood came backstage. Bette Davis summoned me to her suite at the Plaza.” Ingrid Bergman gave him advice he took to heart: “Do only good work.”


	Redford's early movies also included his debut, Tall Story (1960), and Inside Daisy Clover (1965), which won him a Golden Globe as best new star. He was a star, but not a superstar. That changed in 1969 when he appeared as the Sundance Kid opposite Paul Newman, taking a role that had been offered to Jack Lemmon, Warren Beatty and Steve McQueen.

	











	“The studio didn't want me,” he recalled. “It all depended on Paul, and I met him and he was very generous and said, ‘Let's go for this.' He knew I was serious about the craft. That's what brought us together, and we became friends, and our friendship turned out to be very similar to our relationship in both Butch Cassidy and The Sting” — the 1972 follow-up to Butch Cassidy that won the Oscar for best picture.


	Many critics dismissed Butch Cassidy. Pauline Kael in The New Yorker called it “the bottom of the pit” (prompting a furious letter from director George Roy Hill, which began: “Listen, you miserable bitch”). But the picture was a massive hit and has come to be seen as a classic.


	“The effects of Butch Cassidy were far-reaching for Redford,” wrote Callan. “In February 1968, [Redford had] been sleeping in hotel hallways in Grenoble … to save money. Two years later, in February 1970, he was a national icon on the cover of Life magazine.”


	He followed Butch Cassidy with Downhill Racer (1969), Jeremiah Johnson (1970) and The Candidate, about a U.S. Senate contender who is the perfect front man but then seems lost when he faces the prospect of governing. “What do we do now?” he asks in the movie's famous last line. Years later, Redford toyed with making a sequel, to be written by Larry Gelbart. “The truth is so awful,” he told Maureen Dowd of The New York Times in 2003, “but in its own horrible way, it's entertaining.”

	











	With Downhill Racer, he became a producer and through his Wildwood Enterprises developed All the President's Men, based on the Watergate book by Woodward and Carl Bernstein. (Curiously, Redford had met President Nixon as a teenager and said he got “a creepy vibe” from him.)


	He had met Woodward and Bernstein in Washington before their book was finished and paid $450,000 for the film rights, then was disappointed in William Goldman‘s script, which he heavily rewrote with director Alan J. Pakula after turning down Bernstein and Nora Ephron's adaptation.


	The drama, also starring Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, was a monument to dramatic realism, so serious in its attempt to capture the truth that the production took bags of trash from the real-life Post offices and used the papers on the set. Pakula shot an astounding 300,000 feet of film, which was reduced to 12,300 in the final, 2-hour, 18-minute movie.


	The film almost had a different ending: “Pakula,” notes Callan, “wanted to show TV footage of Nixon's resignation and the famous defiant farewell wave on the steps of the helicopter on the White House lawn.” Redford resisted. “I told Alan again and again, ‘This isn't about Nixon. It's about journalism.'” They compromised by showing a teletype machine ticking away, announcing Nixon's decision.


	Four years after President's Men, Redford tried his hand at directing with Ordinary People (1980), based on Judith Guest's novel and adapted by Alvin Sargent. It was an intimate family drama that Pakula regarded as subliminal autobiography. “When I read it,” he noted, “I said, ‘Oh, I get it.' The novel is about parental tyranny … Bob is moving some furniture here. He is co-opting the novel's dysfunctional family for his father's or his own and investigating himself at a critical time.” Redford denied that.

	











	The finished picture, wrote critic David Thomson, “came as an impressive surprise to the public and the Academy. It was observant, heartfelt and full of anguished performances. And it was appreciated that Redford was concentrating on the script and the actors and directing with stylistic restraint and professional anonymity. The surprise now may be that Ordinary People won best picture and the Oscar for best director when Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull was among its rivals.”


	Redford's other films as a director included The Milagro Beanfield War (1988), A River Runs Through It (1992), Quiz Show (1984) — for which he received another Oscar nom — The Horse Whisperer (1998), The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000) and The Conspirator (2010).


	None of his later movies as an actor equaled those of the late '60s and '70s, even though many were hits. They included The Natural (1984), Out of Africa (1985) — another Academy Award best picture — and Indecent Proposal (1993). In all, Redford's naturalism was so convincing, his acting so skilled, it almost disguised his talent; he never won an acting Oscar.


	Producer Sherry Lansing remembered how he took Indecent Proposal‘s most memorable moment — when his character, billionaire John Gage, offers a young man $1 million to sleep with his wife — and tossed it off with brilliant casualness, as if throwing the line away. This was a man for whom there was not much difference between $1 and $1 million, any more than there was any difference between lust and love. Everything about him was revealed in that line — not least the actor's intelligence in choosing not to play it melodramatically.

	











	Lansing also saw a more sensitive side to Redford than he revealed to those who didn't know him well. After a stupendous table reading just before the shoot, in which the actor blew everyone, including co-stars Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore, away, Lansing was summoned to see the star. “I thought he was going to tell us he didn't like something in the script,” she recalled. “But he said, ‘I want out. The kids are wonderful. But I'm not. It's their movie.' ” He was so insecure about his performance, he was ready to leave the film. Only the deft intervention of his CAA agents kept him onboard.


	He was a perfectionist who was as critical as himself as of others. “I was born with a hard eye,” he told THR. “The way I saw things, I would see what was wrong. I could see what could be better. I developed kind of a dark view of life, looking at my own country. When I was a kid, I was told to be a good sport. It wasn't whether you won or lost; it was how you played the game. I realized that was a lie.”


	He was notoriously unpunctual and often took months or even years to commit to a project, only to insist on changes and then sometimes pull out. He avoided darker, more dissolute characters, even though he was also drawn to them. Dan Melnick, the late Hollywood executive and producer, cautioned 20th Century Fox that Redford would never agree to play the alcoholic lawyer in The Verdict (1982) no matter how much he insisted he would. Melnick was right; Redford dilly-dallied until he was fired by producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown and replaced by Newman.

	











	Redford's later films included Spy Game (2001) and the Marvel superhero movies Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). Despite his advocacy for indie film, he preferred studio movies and only later embraced independent vehicles such as All Is Lost (2013) and A Walk in the Woods (2015). 


	He kept working steadily, even relentlessly, playing news anchor Dan Rather in Truth (2015) and a widower who falls for his neighbor (Fonda) in Our Souls at Night (2017), all the while maintaining his involvement with Sundance; indeed, he only stepped down as the public face of that organization in 2019. That was almost two decades after the Academy had awarded him an honorary Oscar and slightly more than two years after President Obama had given him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. His final onscreen appearance came this year in an uncredited cameo on the AMC series Dark Winds, on which he was an executive producer.


	Redford announced his retirement from acting just before the release of The Old Man and the Gun (2018). By then, Thomson argued, he had “lost the intriguing edginess he had in the '70s. He's not the only member of his generation to shift from sunlight to sunset.”


	If he had lost some of his edge, he had not lost his perfectionism. “When I started to direct, I wanted total control of the story,” he told THR. “I didn't want to be dependent on anyone. But then you add producing to that, and then you add Sundance, and pretty soon you're adding all these layers. Was all that other stuff worth it? That's an open question.”

No spoilers here, but Matt Reeves said the follow-up film delivers another mystery and new things for Pattinson to do: ""The things that it does for his character, for Batman and for Bruce, have never been done before.”


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	The signal is not quite in the sky but will be shining very soon.


	On the heels of a report this summer in Puck that Matt Reeves was just about to deliver a sequel script for The Batman: Part II, the veteran filmmaker confirmed Sunday that he did indeed hand it over and now the team is gearing up for another go in Gotham City. 




	“We're getting ready. We're basically entering prep. We'll be making the movie in the spring,” Reeves told The Hollywood Reporter while walking the carpet at Sunday's Emmy Awards at L.A.'s Peacock Theater where he was part of the nominated team representing The Penguin. “It's been a journey that is taking longer than I would've wanted for a lot of reasons, a lot of personal reasons, but most important reason is getting it to a place where I just felt like it was the best script we could possibly write.”

	That long journey Reeves noted refers to time that has passed since The Batman came out on March 4, 2022, launching a new era for the DC hero. It went on to become a blockbuster hit grossing $772 million worldwide, and executives at Warner Bros. and DC were reportedly eager to get a sequel script from Reeves and writing partner Mattson Tomlin. With pens down and the studio on board, Reeves also confirmed that Batman himself, Robert Pattinson, has read the script and is ready to slip back into the suit.

	But how exactly do they get the script to Pattinson and maintain the top secret nature of the story? As it turned out, they relied on a high tech strategy that Bruce Wayne would have no trouble with but Pattinson did. 


	“So, Benito, who's my assistant, he goes and seeks out a very, very high security pouch that has a code on it that then we have to send separately,” Reeves revealed of the locked gadget. “And then [Rob] was like, ‘I can't open it.' I said, ‘I know, here's the code.' He opened it, and then we had a FaceTime after he read. It was very exciting.”


	Though he didn't reveal any specific plot points, Reeves did share that this new installment will be similar in a sense to the detective story featured in The Batman. “Obviously because of what the first movie was and what this movie is, which is so much a detective story, the idea of trying to protect the secrets of the movie is super important because it's a mystery,” Reeves continued. “It would be an extra level of heartbreak if that part of it started getting out.”


	So no spoilers here, but what would Reeves did say is that Batman fans should be ready for something new. Even Pattinson loved it. “He's Batman, and if he doesn't like it, not good,” Reeves explained. “I was super excited. I thought that he really would [like it] because the things that it does for his character, for Batman and for Bruce, have never been done before in this way. I had a feeling that he would respond in this way, but the fact that he did was incredibly encouraging.”

Like Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter and Troy Donahue, he was discovered (and given a studly stage name) by talent agent Henry Willson.


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Trax Colton, who starred opposite Jayne Mansfield in It Happened in Athens after being discovered (and renamed) by the same talent agent who did the same for Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter and others, has died. He was 96.


	Colton died Aug. 30 of natural causes in Monte Nido, California, his son Ryan Morelli told The Hollywood Reporter. “I couldn't have scripted a better parent,” he said. “He was the most generous, greatest father ever.”




	New Jersey-born Louis Morelli was driving in a convertible on Olympic Boulevard going to meet a friend for lunch in Beverly Hills when another car driven by talent agent Henry Willson pulled up next to him.

	Willson asked him if he would be open to a screen test, and Morelli said he would be, even though he had never done any acting.


	With a new name and a contract at 20th Century Fox, Trax Colton showed up as a party guest in the comedy The Marriage-Go-Round (1961), starring Susan Hayward, James Mason and Julie Newmar.


	He was then given second billing as a Greek shepherd named Spiridon Loues who aims to compete as a marathon runner in the first modern Olympics — the 1896 Summer Games — in It Happened in Athens (1962).


	On the comeback trail, Mansfield played a glamorous Greek actress, Eleni Costa, who in a publicity stunt says she will marry the winner of the race.

	











	While the movie was being made, THR's Mike Connolly wrote that Colton “looms as the studio's new “combination of Rudolph Valentino-Ty Power” as the star of a potential Blood and Sand remake at Fox. Fellow columnist Dorothy Kilgallen, meanwhile, suggested the actor “may be our next matinee idol.”


	However, when the expensive Happened in Athens failed at the box office, Colton and Mansfield were released from their contracts, and he never made another film again. “Trax Colton was handsome and ingratiating, but acting was not his métier,” Eve Golden wrote in her 2021 book, Jayne Mansfield: The Girl Couldn't Help It.


	The second of four kids of Italian immigrants Angelo and Caterina, Morelli was born on May 26, 1929, in Highland Park, New Jersey. When he was 12, he played the violin in an orchestra, and he could handle the guitar and piano as well.


	Morelli had worked as a car salesman and studied dentistry before he came west and had his encounter with Willson, who famously helped launch the acting careers of Roy Fitzgerald (Hudson), Arthur Gelien (Hunter), Marilyn Louis (Rhonda Fleming), Merle Johnson (Troy Donahue), Francis McGowan (Rory Calhoun), Krekor Ohanian (Touch/Mike Connors) and Robert Moseley (Guy Madison).


	After It Happened in Athens, Colton screen-tested but failed to get the part of the sleazy manager of Joanne Woodward's showgirl character in The Stripper (1963). Robert Webber went on to play the role. His son Ryan said he would appear on an episode of ABC's Combat! in the '60s.

	











	Colton, who spoke several languages, earned his law degree in 1969 and practiced until the early 2000s. Despite his slim acting résumé, he was still getting fan mail until his death.


	Survivors include another son, Todd; his grandchildren, Ronan and Quinn; and his brother, Frank. His wife of 48 years, Maureen, died in 2017 of a brain aneurysm at age 70.

She was in 'Little Women,' 'Imitation of Life,' 'Les Misérables,' 'David Copperfield,' 'Anthony Adverse' and 'All This, and Heaven Too.'

	Marilyn Knowlden, the busy child actress of the 1930s and '40s who appeared in Little Women with Katharine Hepburn, Imitation of Life with Claudette Colbert, Les Misérables with Fredric March and in three other Oscar best picture nominees, has died. She was 99. 


	Knowlden died Monday of natural causes at an assisted living facility in Eagle, Idaho, her son Kevin Goates told The Hollywood Reporter.




	During a career in Hollywood that spanned just 1931-44 but included more than three dozen pictures, Knowlden collaborated with Colbert, Hepburn, Irene Dunne and Norma Shearer as her onscreen moms in Imitation of Life (1934), A Woman Rebels (1936), Show Boat (1936) and Marie Antoinette (1938), respectively.

	“A special relationship can develop with the actress who plays a child's mother, even if that bond is temporary,” she told author Nick Thomas in 2016.

	Another highlight for Knowlden included a turn as a younger version of Ann Sheridan's character in the classic Michael Curtiz-directed Angels With Dirty Faces (1938), starring James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart.


	Her other best picture nominees were George Cukor's David Copperfield (1935), where she portrayed Lewis Stone's piano-playing daughter alongside Freddie Bartholomew; Mervyn LeRoy's Anthony Adverse (1936), starring March and Olivia de Havilland; and Anatole Litvak's All This, and Heaven Too (1940), starring Bette Davis and Charles Boyer. None of her movies won the top Oscar, however.

	











	Knowlden always worked as a freelancer, never under contract at any studio.


	“Well, my father was very much in control of my career, and he didn't want me to be under contract,” she told Danny Miller in a 2018 interview for Cinephiled. “I think one of the reasons is that if you're a child under contract, you have to go to the studio school, and there goes your normal life. I think he was very happy to have things the way they were.”


	An only child, Knowlden was born on May 12, 1926, in Oakland, California. When her dad, San Francisco attorney Robert Knowlden Jr., had a business trip to Hollywood in 1931, he brought his wife, Bertha, and her with him.


	“On the second day there, just for fun, my father decided to call some of the studios,” she recalled. “I had been doing some little acting things in Oakland, and my teacher there had told my father that she thought I should be in the movies, so he thought he'd give it a try.”


	Her fast-talking dad reached Paramount head of casting Fred Datig, who arranged for an interview that day. The part of Paul Lukas' and Eleanor Boardman's daughter in the early talkie Women Love Once (1931) was discussed, but Datig thought Knowlden was too young. However, she showed she was capable of handling many pages of dialogue.


	Plus, Boardman “much preferred the idea of a 4-year-old in the part since she didn't want people to think she was old enough to have an 8-year-old!” she said. And so, the blue-eyed Knowlden was hired the next day. (Her dad eventually put aside his law practice to serve as her full-time agent.)

	











	Hours after she learned she got the job, Knowlden was in a car with her folks when it was involved in a crash in front of the Vitaphone Studios lot in Los Feliz. On the scene was actress Dolores Costello, the wife of John Barrymore, who escorted Knowlden to her dressing room and cared for her. (While she was just bruised, her mom suffered three broken ribs and a broken collarbone in the accident.)


	During production on Women Love Once, director Edward Goodman took Knowlden to another soundstage to visit The Marx Brothers, then at work on Monkey Business (1931). “I loved that and ended up playing a duet with Chico on the piano,” she said. “He told me, ‘I'll play this note and you play these notes when I nod to you.'”


Women Love Once would prove to be the first of her six films released in 1931, followed by The Cisco Kid, Husband's Holiday, Susan Lenox — that one with Clark Gable and Greta Garbo — Wicked and Once a Lady.


	She acted with Hepburn for the first time in 1933 in Morning Glory and Cukor's Little Women, and in A Woman Rebels, she got to use a bow and arrow.


	“Miss Hepburn promised me a dollar if I could hit a bull's-eye,” she told Miller. “At the end of the film, she signed an autograph for me that says, ‘To Marilyn — Hoping that her archery improves. Affectionately, Katharine Hepburn.' I cherish that to this day, especially since I found out later how rarely she would give her autograph.”

	











	She and Rochelle Hudson shared the roles of Jessie Pullman in John M. Stahl's Imitation of Life and Cosette in Richard Boleslawski's Les Misérables (1935).


	It got to the point where Knowlden hardly had to audition. “I went on very few cattle calls,” she said. “Usually I would just go on interviews where they were already seriously considering me for a part.”


	She even had a doll in her likeness made of her.


	Her résumé included two films with Shirley Temple, As the Earth Turns (1934) and Just Around the Corner (1938), plus The World Changes (1933), Rainbow on the River (1936), The Way of All Flesh (1940) and Broadway Rhythm (1944), her final feature.


	One movie she didn't get was Gone With the Wind (1939), though she was in the running to play Scarlett O'Hara's youngest sister, Carreen. “I so wanted to be in that movie!” she said. “But I lost the part to Ann Rutherford.”


	Knowlden graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1943, then earned a scholarship to Mills College in Oakland. She married serviceman Richard Goates in 1946, went with him to China and Japan and worked for the Armed Forces Radio Service.


	Later, she wrote music, lyrics and scripts for several musicals; returned to acting in plays and musicals in San Diego County including Arsenic and Old Lace, Sorry, Wrong Number and My Fair Lady; and published her autobiography, Little Girl in Big Pictures, in 2011.


	In addition to her son Kevin, survivors include her daughter, Carolyn, and another son, Brian; her grandchildren, Jessica, Maureen and Shelisa; and 12 great-grandchildren.

""I'm excited for people to hear it,"" says Matt Cameron of the legendary rockers' unreleased album.

	A final Soundgarden album is coming, but we're not likely to hear anything from it this year, and certainly not before the Seattle band's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction on Nov. 8.

	“There's not a set release date or anything as of yet,” drummer Matt Cameron, who will become a two-time inductee after getting in with Pearl Jam during 2017. “There were a couple schools of thought, like, ‘Hey, let's put out a single.' I think eventually we decided we want to make sure the whole thing is completed before we start releasing singles. I'm excited for people to hear it.”

	Cameron, who announced his departure from Pearl Jam on July 7, is understandably excited about his Rock Hall distinction. “It's a huge honor,” he acknowledges. “I haven't really wrapped my head around it, and it's not lost upon me that it's pretty real to get in there two times. I'm feeling great about everything.” He has happy memories about the 2017 ceremony, including David Letterman's induction speech for Pearl Jam as well as watching Yes perform and meeting original drummer Bill Bruford, one of his heroes. “Overall it was a pretty amazing time,” Cameron recalls. “It wasn't really too stressful for me other than to make sure the performance was dialed in, because it was a big TV event. But other than that, it was a great evening.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Getting into the Rock Hall with Soundgarden, however, will mean something different to Cameron, who joined the group in 1986 and was part of all of its recordings.


	“They're both huge honors, of course,” he says. “For me, personally, I helped build Soundgarden from the ground up, and I helped create the sound, I think, a little bit more than I did with Pearl Jam, which was definitely more of an established thing that I came into. So in that sense (Soundgarden's induction) is a little more meaningful for me as an artist and musician and songwriter to go in with a band that I helped (to) establish itself.”


	And while Soundgarden hails from a decidedly alternative scene that hasn't always given credence to established institutions such as the Rock Hall, Cameron says that “there was never really a reluctance to acknowledged this honor. I think we're always happy to be recognized by any established entity in the music industry…It felt like even from the early days, fellow musicians noticed what we were doing, and the music industry definitely took notice, so…it was nice to be recognized by the Grammys and whoever else.”


	Soundgarden's induction follows two previous nominations, in 2020 and 2023. The group finished sixth in the fan vote with 233,205.


	Cameron is sending the Yamaha drum kit that he used to record the first three Soundgarden albums, as well as his first Keplinger snare drum. Soundgarden is planning to perform at the ceremony in Los Angeles — which will be aired live via Disney+ — but has not yet announced how the late Chris Cornell's vocals will handled. “I think that's above my pay grade,” says Cameron, who last December performed at a benefit concert for Seattle Children's Hospital — billed as Nudedragons — at which guitarist Kim Thayil and bassist Ben Shepherd were joined by Seattle vocalist Shaina Shepherd (no relation). He did, however, reveal that original bassist Hiro Yamamoto, with whom he recently performed in Seattle, will be involved in the ceremony, while an inductor is still being determined.

	











	“It's just been really exciting to gather up all these people we worked with over the years that helped us create the band, create our legacy, and it's going to be a really great night,” the drummer predicts.


	In the meantime, Cameron, Thayil and Shepherd are working to finish the eight remaining songs they started working on with Cornell before he committed suicide after a performance in Detroit during May of 2017. “We're definitely over halfway done with it,” Cameron says. “Kim is in the process of finishing his guitar parts; he wants to make sure they get exactly the way he wants them.” 


	Soundgarden — whose most recently release, 2012's King Animal, was its first new album in 16 years — began working on the material back in 2015; finishing them was delayed until legal issues between the band and Cornell's widow Vicky Cornell could be settled.


	“Emotionally it's been extreme highs and extreme lows,” Cameron says of working on the material. “Hearing (Cornell's) voice on these powerful hard rock songs is the most empowering thing in the world for me. Then I listen to his voice soloed up when I'm working on stuff, or if Kim or Ben is working on something, and it all comes back to the fact that he's not with us and he left us in a way that has so many questions. It's been gut-wrenching but at the same time very empowering.”


	The Soundgarden album is just one of the endeavors Cameron's been up to since, and before, announcing his departure from Pearl Jam — which he says was amicable. “I definitely gave them a lot of notice,” he notes. “I've spoken with Jeff (Ament) and Stone (Gossard) a little bit…It's been fine. Hopefully we'll get back together at some point and have a beer or something.” 

	











	He maintains, as he did in his original announcement, that “I'm at a point in my life where I want to redirect my time and energy in a way that is a little bit based on what I want to pursue as an artist at this point.” That includes a new band, Is This Real?, in which he's serving as frontman and guitarist; it began as a Wipers tribute but is “also recording original music I've been writing over the years,” with an album of mostly original material I've been writing over the years” expected in the near future.


	He and Thayil, meanwhile, continue to work in the all-star 3rd Secret (with Nirvana's Krist Novoselic, Void's Jon “Bubba” Dupree and others), with hopes of possibly taking that band on the road.


	“I was having some issues with (Pearl Jam's) three-hour shows and constant touring and stuff,” Cameron adds. “That's definitely an art form unto itself, to be able to do those types of shows…I'm at a point now where I want to do a face-melting 70-minute set, and that's kind of what I'm focusing on right now.”

According to MIDiA Research's latest report, it's harder to get a consumer aged 16-24 than any other age group to take steps to consume a song off of social media. 


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


A new study by MIDiA Research concludes that the link between social media virality and a rise in streams or fandom is more tenuous than some might believe. In a global survey of music discovery habits involving 10,000 participants across various platforms, MIDiA's latest report — released Tuesday (Sept. 16) — found that “social media is just one part of a wide and diverse discovery ecosystem” and that the landscape of music discovery on social platforms is fragmented. Discovery is not all coming from TikTok.


	In fact, the study found that YouTube was the leading source for finding new music, with 52% of participants across a wide range of ages choosing the platform. Streaming services followed, with 40% of participants using them as their main source of music discovery. TikTok trailed at 37%. However, when broken out by age group, MIDiA found “clear demographic divides at the extremes, with younger audiences skewing towards TikTok and older audiences towards radio.”


	MIDiA's report notes that only 12% of all consumers fit the category of being 16–24-year-olds who say they mainly discover music on TikTok, and that the music industry's near-singular focus on TikTok marketing is “neglect[ing the other] 88% of the population.” However, it should be noted that 16–24-year-olds are often the most engaged and sought-after age group of fans — and the ones most likely to drive cultural trends.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The report goes on to explain that getting the 16–24 age group to take action after hearing a song on social media is often more challenging than for older groups. “Simply being exposed to music on social media matters little if consumers do not stream the music they hear or, better yet, discover the artists behind it,” the report notes. “After hearing music on social media, consumers aged 16–24 are less likely than 25–34-year-olds to take almost every step.”


	Here is a breakdown of what MIDiA calls “The Discovery Funnel,” moving from the top (easier next steps) to the bottom (more intensive next steps). It measures what actions consumers took after hearing music on social media in the past month, by age group:


	MIDiA further points out that “song-to-artist discovery is a weak link,” noting that “almost half of consumers (48%) did not stream music they heard on social media in the last month and fewer than a third became fans.”


	Another challenge for those pushing music on TikTok in hopes of off-platform success: the report finds that only 33% of consumers have ever used its most popular features, such as “Add to music app.” Participants in the 16–24 age bracket are less likely than 25–34-year-olds to have used any of TikTok's music features (e.g., add to music app, share, presave, TikTok Shop for merch, in-app artist experiences, fan spotlight and more). Specifically for “Add to music app,” which is the central link between TikTok song discovery and off-platform listening, only 30% of 16–24-year-olds had used it, compared to 38% of 25–34-year-olds.


	“When TikTok users discover artists, they are more interested in following their content than in listening to their music on streaming platforms. TikTok is driving more TikTok consumption rather than streaming consumption,” the report notes, adding that close to three-quarters of users who follow artists on TikTok do not explore the artist's music off platform.


	There may also be a link between frequent music exposure on social media and a listener's disinterest in finding the song again on streaming platforms, where artists earn significantly higher royalties. MIDiA found that 28% of 16–24-year-olds (compared to 24% of all consumers) say they “hear [a given song] enough on social media,” and 22% of 16–24-year-olds (compared to 18% of overall consumers) say they “hear too much music on social media,” which keeps them from going to streaming services.


	In an attention economy, where consumers have finite time to spend listening to music as well as pursuing other entertainment options, it's also troubling that 18% of users of all ages say that they do not want to stream a song they hear on social media because they “do not want to interrupt [their] social media session.” MIDiA concludes that the funnel from “social to streaming is not only breaking but actively driving activity back to the social platforms, often in competition with streaming.”


	Still, despite the challenges of converting social media users into real fans, not all discovery is happening on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. Forty percent of all consumers say that streaming services themselves remain their main place to find new music — the second most common choice behind YouTube (52%). Within the streaming platform, artists not only get paid more for streams than on social media platforms, they also have a chance to sell merchandise or concert tickets for additional cash.

Coachella returns to Indio, Calif., over two weekends, April 10-12 and 17-19, 2026.

	Katie Bain



	Musical Christmas has come exceptionally early, with Coachella dropping its 2026 lineup on a seemingly unremarkable Monday night (Sept. 15) in September.


	This surprisingly early Coachella talent announcement includes its regular roster of pop superstar headliners, with Sabrina Carpenter, Justin Bieber and Karol G taking top billing among dozens of other genre spanning acts.

	











	And as always, there's a long list of electronic artists playing the festival. The name in the biggest font is Anyma, whose mention is floating at the bottom of the poster in a position that in previous years has been reserved for artists including Travis Scott, Calvin Harris and Swedish House Mafia, all of whom played the mainstage in their respective years. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Meanwhile Boys Noize, who's been opening for Nine Inch Nails on their current Peel It Back tour, will play alongside the industrial lords as Nine Inch Noize. Major Lazer will play Coachella for the first time in years and Kaskade, Disclosure and Solomun will also get big looks, with their names on the lineup's upper levels.


Dance acts typically play across most of Coachella's myriad stages, composing the entire daily lineups for the club-focused Yuma tent, getting marquee spots in Sahara and often also playing on the Outdoor Stage, the Mojave and Gobi tents and occasionally the mainstage as well.

	











	Additionally, the Quasar stage that debuted at Coachella in 2024 and hosts extended b2b sets typically announces its lineups (which in the past two years have been different for each weekend of the festival) much closer to the event in April, as does the the Do Lab stage, an electronic music nexus that's been a Coachella staple since the festival's earliest years. 


	Coachella returns to Indio, Calif., over two weekends April 10-12 and 17-19, 2026. These are all the electronic artists currently on the lineup.

The Scottish DJ is pursuing arbitration against Thomas St. John, who denies wrongdoing. 


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Calvin Harris is taking legal action against his longtime financial adviser for allegedly duping him into investing $22.5 million in a doomed real estate project “to simply steal” funds from the star DJ.


	The allegations are revealed in new court documents filed Friday (Sept. 12) by Harris (Adam Wiles) against Thomas St. John, the Scottish music producer's financial adviser of over a decade. Harris filed a petition to enforce a temporary injunction in his ongoing arbitration against St. John, and in the process, publicized the details of that private arbitration, which has been taking place behind closed doors since June.


	Harris' June 28 arbitration demand, obtained by Billboard, levels more than a dozen civil claims against St. John and a group of alleged co-conspirators, including breach of contract, fraud and malpractice.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Out of necessity, Mr. Wiles surrounds himself with professionals, including TSJ, in whom Mr. Wiles placed his trust to ensure his earnings are protected, his investments are smart, and his family and future are secure,” reads the arbitration demand. “However, instead of acting in Mr. Wiles's best interests, TSJ and the other respondents completely and absolutely breached that trust.”


	According to the documents, St. John bought a tract of land in Hollywood in 2021 with plans to develop a recording studio and creative office space. Harris says St. John later became strapped for cash and took advantage of their relationship to sign $22.5 million over to the project in the DJ's name in 2023.


	Of this $22.5 million investment, $10 million was in the form of a loan, which St. John allegedly never paid back. The other $12.5 million was an equity stake in the real estate project — but Harris says this investment “has been, at best, a complete boondoggle, and, at worst, a complete fraud.”


	“Mr. Wiles has not received a single penny in return for that investment, and, indeed, respondents have not even started developing or building the project,” reads the arbitration demand. “In fact, shortly after Mr. Wiles purportedly made this $12.5 million investment, TSJ … distributed over $11 million dollars to himself.”


	Harris says he has “no idea what exactly happened” with his money. According to the petition, St. John has since shifted the focus of his real estate project away from a recording studio and toward a residential development.  


	In early August, retired judge Michael R. Wilner was appointed to oversee the dispute as an arbitrator. Harris and St. John agreed on a temporary injunction that freezes certain assets while the matter is litigated, leading Harris to file the court petition on Friday seeking to confirm and enforce this injunction.


	A lawyer for St. John, Sasha Frid, says in a statement provided to Billboard on Monday (Sept. 15) that his client “denies any wrongdoing” and that Harris “actively pursued” an investment in the Hollywood real estate project.


	“Unhappy with the pace of the project, he chose to pursue private arbitration to assert his discontent,” says Frid. “It's no secret that due to interest rates and other market factors real estate projects are taking longer to build. But the development is very much viable and expected to have a $900+ million valuation when completed.”


	Reps for Harris did not immediately return a request for comment.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Marc Weinstock is leaving Paramount as its President of Global Marketing and Distribution. The news comes as Josh Goldstine is finaling a contract to be named in the new role. Weinstock is responsible for propelling the Skydance co-produced Top Gun: Maverick as Paramount's highest global grossing title at $1.49 billion worldwide and Tom Cruise's highest. Paramount had no comment. 


	Weinstock joined Paramount in February 2019 as President of Worldwide Marketing & Distribution and, in 2022, was elevated to oversee the studio's unified global marketing and distribution team. He had previously been head of marketing at Megan Ellison's Annapurna. 

	











	During his run at Paramount, Weinstock ushered the successful rollout of twenty #1 films. Those include, of course, Top Gun 2, which was also at the time of its release the No. 1 Memorial Day opener as well as 2022's highest grossing movie of the year. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	He was also behind turning originally conceived Paramount+ movie, Smile, into a new theatrical global horror franchise, which became the studio's third-most profitable film for the studio in the past decade and spawned a sequel. 


	He was at the studio for all three Sonic the Hedgehog films, which have now collectively grossed over $1.2B in worldwide box office gross, with the most recent installment, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, earning a franchise-best global gross. 


	As the first major studio to return to theaters with a full theatrical release schedule, Weinstock oversaw the release of six #1 films in 2022, one of the most successful years in the studio's history, including Top Gun: Maverick and Smile, among others.

	











	Weinstock has been recognized for his innovative marketing campaigns at Paramount, kudos including 2025 Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50, highlighting impactful marketing heads across major global brands; and the Adweek 50 of 2025 spotlighting leaders in advertising, marketing, media and technology. 


	Among his innovative campaigns were Scream and Scream VI, which reignited fan excitement for the franchise with stunts including Ghostface's journey to NYC, which was captured by a grassroots Scream Cam Live stunt; an unforgettable viral moment leading up to the launch of Smile with the creepy “Smile lady” who materialized at major sporting events; the launch of the Mean Girls marketing campaign with a wildly popular TikTok rollout that had never been done before; and bringing big comedies back to theatres with the successful debut of The Naked Gun, which recently surpassed $100M at the worldwide box office.


	Under Weinstock's leadership, Paramount's marketing team has also tapped into the ever-growing creator space, recognizing early on that, with the continuing emergence of TikTok, Instagram and Snap influencers, the essential need for Creator Marketing to catapult a movie to a great global opening. In response, Weinstock's marketing division carved out an in-house team that identified top tier talent in the creator space, cultivated those relationships, and engaged them across all Paramount titles through custom social content and innovative activations. Cruise embraced this passionately during the promo tour for Mission: Impossible Final Reckoning.


	Other big pics for Weinstock include A Quiet Place: Day One which opened to nearly $100M globally, setting a franchise record for the biggest worldwide opening, and grossed over $261M at the global box office. Over Memorial Day of this year, Mission: Impossible–The Final Reckoning boasted a franchise-best global opening. 


	As President of Annapurna Pictures, Weinstock helped secure a distribution and marketing deal with MGM. He previously held senior marketing leadership roles at 20th Century Fox and Sony Pictures, overseeing campaigns for films including Logan, Hidden Figures, The Revenant, The Martian, Deadpool, The Amazing Spider-Man, 21 Jump Street, Men in Black 3, Skyfall, and American Hustle.

Huge loss.  Marc was EXCELLENT in this role and Paramount employees, campaigns and filmmakers benefited from his steady hand of leadership.  With this whole merger THIS was the headline I was hoping we wouldn't see.

Agreed. Marc is the BEST! A bad sign of things to come….

A big loss for Paramount.

					By Greg Evans 

NY & Broadway Editor


Refresh for updates...In a statement, Jane Fonda is paying tribute to Robert Redford – the two were frequent co-stars (Barefoot in the Park, The Chase, The Electric Horseman and Our Souls At Night) – and lifelong friends.


	“It hit me hard this morning when I read that Bob was gone,” Fonda said in the statement provided to news outlets. “I can't stop crying. He meant a lot to me and was a beautiful person in every way. He stood for an America we have to keep fighting for.”


	Meryl Streep also honored her Out of Africa co-star, saying in a statement, “One of the lions has passed. Rest in peace my lovely friend.”

	











	Streep's was just one of many tributes to the Hollywood and indie film icon that began arriving with news of Redford's death today at 89, and will no doubt continue throughout the day.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Tom Rothman, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, said in a statement, “In addition to being a titanic acting and directing talent, as an early board member of the Sundance Institute, I saw first-hand the Sundance Kid's passionate commitment to indie film and young artists. Robert Redford truly gave back. The entire scope of American film would have been much poorer without him. An amazing legacy of an amazing man.” 


	The Sundance Institute said in a statement, “We are deeply saddened by the loss of our founder and friend Robert Redford. Bob's vision of a space and a platform for independent voices launched a movement that, over four decades later, has inspired generations of artists and redefined cinema in the U.S. and around the world. Beyond his enormous contributions to culture at large, we will miss his generosity, clarity of purpose, curiosity, rebellious spirit, and his love for the creative process. We are humbled to be among the stewards of his remarkable legacy, which will continue to guide the Institute in perpetuity.”


	On The View today, moderator Whoopi Goldberg started the show by sharing news of Redford's death with an audibly surprised audience, then led a panel discussion about favorite movies from the actor's career. Among the many films mentioned, Goldberg noted a favorite Twilight Zone episode from 1962 titled “Nothing in the Dark,” in which Redford played the personification of death. Behar praised the romance classic The Way We Were, as well as Three Days of the Condor.












	“I was really struck by his work on climate change,” co-host Sunny Hostin said. “He knew that it would be a problem before many people were paying attention. That says something about caring for the world that he would leave behind.”


	Also remembering Redford today was Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who wrote on social media of Redford's impact on the state with the Sundance Film Festival: “Decades ago, Robert Redford came to Utah and fell in love with this place. He cherished our landscapes and built a legacy that made Utah a home for storytelling and creativity. Through Sundance and his devotion to conservation, he shared Utah with the world. Today we honor his life, his vision, and his lasting contribution to our state.”


	President Donald Trump, told of Redford's passing while speaking to reporters before his visit to the UK, said, “Robert Redford had a series of years where there was nobody better. There was a period of time when he was the hottest. I thought he was great.”


	Hillary Clinton also paid tribute to Redford, writing on social media that she “always admired Robert Redford, not only for his legendary career as an actor and director but for what came next. He championed progressive values like protecting the environment and access to the arts while creating opportunities for new generations of activists and filmmakers. A true American icon.”


	Others also weighed in:


	Directors Guild of America President Lesli Linka Glatter: “With Bob's passing, we have lost an incomparable director, actor, and independent film icon. Bob's masterful directorial debut in 1980 with Ordinary People, for which he won the DGA Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Feature Film, not only catapulted his career as a director, but also showcased his ability to rouse powerful, resonant performances from his actors,” said DGA President Lesli Linka Glatter. “He proved himself a master time and time again with such modern classics as The River Runs Through It, Quiz Show, for which he earned a DGA Award nomination in 1994, and Lions for Lambs.


	“Bob was also a passionate advocate,” Glatter continued, “always searching for ways to support filmmakers and bolster the craft of storytelling. His establishment of the Sundance Institute over 40 years ago embodies his legacy of giving back – shaping the landscape of independent filmmaking and paving the way for more diverse voices to be heard. And through his decades-long stewardship of the Sundance Film Festival, he advanced a showcase where independent film could truly thrive. He was a strong believer in film preservation through his service on the Board of Directors for The Film Foundation. He was also deeply involved in the DGA's political action committee and in helping steer its legislative efforts. A member since 1979, the entire DGA community mourns Bob's passing and is forever grateful for his efforts in supporting generations of new filmmakers. We will miss him dearly.” 


	“Our film, Coda, came to the attention of everyone because of Sundance,” wrote Marlee Matlin on X. “And Sundance happened because of Robert Redford. A genius has passed.”


	“What a career, what an actor, what a sad loss,” wrote Piers Morgan.


	Film at Lincoln Center called Redford “a true icon of the silver screen, a tireless champion of up-and-coming film artists…” 


	Deadline will update this post as more tributes arrive…

His best films were among the latter where a refective Reford came to the forefront and added immensely to the films.  He showed every actor that their talent became more formidable as they matured and he was a guiding light to all actors in that respect.  

He will be missed for his contributions to budding directors and actors at Sundance and deserves all praise for his life's collective work in the  field of acting and entertaining millions of Americans.  

A star was just dimmed in Hollywood in his passing…RIP, Mr. Redford…

He epitomized what was GOOD and RIGHT with America. “The Natural” is one of the greatest baseball movies ever made. And my generation can still shed a tear after seeing Redford as Hubble, whose love for Barbara Streisand's Katie was doomed yet will endure forever.
The word “icon” IS Mr. Redford.

I'm afraid to watch The Way We Were now. I know that the ending will hit even harder.

What an amazing life and incredible career and a wonderful person. Rest in peace.

EXCLUSIVE: Hasbro entertainment president Olivier Dumont has left his role after two years.


	Dumont is being replaced by Kim Boyd, who takes on a slightly different job than Dumont as President of Licensing and Entertainment for Hasbro. Boyd will have several direct reports including L.A.-based execs Zev Foreman, Head of Film, and Gabe Marano, Head of TV, whose roles are otherwise not impacted by the changes.


	Boyd has been with Hasbro for 20 years, starting out as associate brand manager of the Marvel division and working her way up to this newly-created post.

	Dumont was promoted to the Hasbro President Entertainment role in August 2023. This came after the toy giant sold eOne to Lionsgate for $500M but kept hold of an “asset lite” entertainment division that included kids mega brands like Peppa Pig and My Little Pony, along with the Transformers One animation and the Dungeons & Dragons TV series. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Dumont was previously eOne's President of Family Brands for 13 years and was the CEO of PJ Masks studio Frog Box.


	On LinkedIn, he said: “What makes me proudest isn't just the shows or films we delivered, but the everlasting memories we created for children and families all over the world. From Peppa Pig to PJ Masks, Transformers to My Little Pony, I had the joy of working with visionary creators, partners, and colleagues to bring these beloved brands to life in new and meaningful ways.”


	Dumont said the team at eOne swelled from 20 to more than 200 under his watch, “and the results just followed as we collectively built two $1B+ brands.” 

	











	He said he will “explore new opportunities to build, lead and create” for his next role.

					By Erik Pedersen 

Managing Editor


	Let's put our heads together and start a new tour up.


	Two-time Oscar nominee Michael Shannon and his musical partner Jason Narducy today revealed the dates for their long-planned tour celebrating the 40th anniversary of R.E.M.‘s classic album Lifes Rich Pageant. See the itinerary below.


	Following the duo's template for this year's tour that marked 40 years of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band's album Fables of the Reconstruction, the pair and their band will track Lifes Rich Pageant all the way through. That means crowds can expect to hear the singles “Fall on Me” — as gorgeous and moving as anything R.E.M. did — and “Superman” along with clutch deeper cuts including “Begin the Begin,” “I Believe,” “Swan Swan H” and more.

	











	“It dumbfounds and delights me that we continue our crusade through this astounding catalog of music from one of Americaʼs most influential and unique bands,” said Shannon, who scored Oscar noms for his work in Nocturnal Animals and Revolutionary Road and an Emmy nom for George & Tammy. “Now we find ourselves at a summit, Life's Rich Pageant, and weʼre all pinching ourselves in disbelief to be so lucky. The most strange and beautiful adventure.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Shannon, who co-stars in the upcoming Nuremberg, and Narducy played a show Metro in Chicago in July 2023 to mark the 40th anniversary of R.E.M.'s lauded debut album Murmur, which included a guest appearance from the group's bassist Mike Mills. It evolved into the duo's first tour, which played most of the same venues they'll hit next year.


	The 2026 tour for Lifes Rich Pageant — never an apostrophe and never an explanation — will kick off February 11 in Denver and run through March 16 in Bloomington, IN. A Los Angeles stop is set for February 19 at the Bellwether, and it'll hit Brooklyn on March 7. Most of the 22 dates are one-nighters, but there will be two shows each in Chicago and two in R.E.M.'s hometown of Athens, GA. The latter is where R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, Peter Buck, Bill Berry and Mills made an ultra-rare reunion to perform “Pretty Persuasion” with Shannon and Narducy and their band.

	











	Here is the full itinerary for the Lifes Rich Pageant tour, along with the poster:

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


	If Ricky Gervais‘ time hosting the Golden Globes taught us anything, it's that The Office creator is no fan of off-topic acceptance speeches.


	Gervais warmed to his theme again on Monday after the 2025 Emmy Awards, during which Hacks star Hannah Einbinder said “f**k ICE and free Palestine” after collecting her prize for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.


	In the hours after Einbinder's remarks went viral, and other stars like Javier Bardem made comments about Gaza on the Emmys red carpet, Gervais posted a throwback to his 2020 Golden Globes monologue on X/Twitter.

	“They're still not listening,” Gervais wrote alongside a laugh cry emoji and a quote from the Globes, in which he said: “If you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a political platform to make a political speech. You're in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.”


	The post was later removed from Gervais' X/Twitter account, with critics claiming that he had rethought his intervention in the context of the war in Gaza. Gervais also un-shared a post directly commenting on Einbinder's remarks.


	During a backstage Emmys press conference, Einbinder said she had an “obligation as a Jewish person to distinguish Jews from the state of Israel.” Responding to a video of the comments posted by Variety, one X/Twitter cited another quote from Gervais' Globes monologue in which he said: “If ISIS started a streaming service, you'd call your agent, wouldn't you?”

	











	Gervais retweeted the comment from @bronzieonx, but on Tuesday morning, removed the retweet. He has, however, shared other old posts about his Globes monologue, including a video clip posted in August that contains the “don't use it as a political platform to make a political speech” rant.

He is They and hasn't learned anything

He's always been completely unself-aware and self-important but maybe someone pointed out that he's using his own soapbox to do exactly the same thing.

Ricky Gervais is still alive?

Quite alive genius. His world tour is sold out. Quite alive and Quite loved. Have a nice day.

it was quite quick it was no speech

He's not wrong

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","R.I.P. Robert Redford, beloved leading man and Sundance founder","https://www.avclub.com/robert-redford-dies-sundance-the-sting","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:50:00 GMT","

Robert Redford, the Oscar-winning actor and director whose championing of independent film changed American cinema, has died. Redford died in his sleep outside the mountains of Provo, Utah early Tuesday morning, according to The New York Times. He was 89 years old. 

Redford could've just stopped as a drop-dead handsome movie star, appreciated by critics and adored by audiences. And beyond that, his directorial debut was a massive hit that earned four Oscars. But then his nonprofit Sundance Institute snowballed into the defining American indie film festival, and Redford's legacy only grew.

Redford was born in Santa Monica on August 18, 1936 and grew up in Los Angeles, but he began acting on the other coast. After dropping out of the University of Colorado—where he'd gone to play baseball and party—he trekked around Europe before landing in New York, where he attended acting classes and found success on Broadway. He appeared in plenty of plays and TV shows during his early career, even earning an early Emmy nomination in 1963, and began parlaying that success into big-screen roles. 

His first was in Tall Story, where he reprised his Broadway role, and he'd do the same for his early starring success Barefoot In The Park. Jane Fonda, who starred alongside Redford in both, also made her film debut in Tall Story after appearing in the play. He and Fonda would go on to collaborate a few more times, but no scene partner helped define Redford's screen presence like Paul Newman. With director George Roy Hill's Western Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid and his even more successful crime caper The Sting, Redford and Newman's jocular yet emotionally loaded chemistry drove both to unprecedented heights. The two films combined earned 17 Oscar nominations, 11 wins, and nearly $2 billion, adjusted for inflation. 

But these were just a drop in the bucket compared to the resume that would make Redford one of the defining faces of ‘70s film. Piling on the box office success were The Great Gatsby, and a string of team-ups with filmmaker Sydney Pollack: Jeremiah Johnson, The Way We Were, The Electric Horseman, and Three Days Of The Condor. The latter political thriller—combined with the following year's gripping All The President's Men, in which Redford played Bob Woodward to Dustin Hoffman's Carl Bernstein—would place Redford at the forefront of one of the cynical decade's defining genres. Throughout, Redford worked to undermine and complicate the “leading man” simplicity that was so often associated with his chiseled features.

Redford's acting career after this era was more sporadic, yet with critically acclaimed performances in every following decade until his retirement: The Natural and Out Of Africa (a Sydney Pollack reunion) in the ‘80s, Sneakers in the ‘90s, Spy Game in the ‘00s, and All Is Lost and his David Lowery collaborations in the ‘10s. This space allowed for Redford to focus on his burgeoning Sundance Institute and directorial efforts.

As a filmmaker, Redford made a splash early. His debut, the crushing family drama Ordinary People, won Redford his sole non-honorary Oscar and allowed him (and star Mary Tyler Moore) to break away from Hollywood's expectations. That film, centered on the accidental death of a family's son and the trauma it has left, was in some ways personal to Redford, whose first child died at five months from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. “We were very young,” Redford said in 2011. “I had my first theater job, which didn't pay much. We didn't know anything about SIDS, so the only thing you think is that you've done something wrong. As a parent, you tend to blame yourself. That creates a scar that probably never completely heals.”

While his directorial work had more late-stage ups and downs than his acting oeuvre, Redford continued to show a steady hand with grounded material: A River Runs Through It, Quiz Show, and The Horse Whisperer all garnered Oscar nods.

But outside that Hollywood establishment would exist one of Redford's own: Sundance. From the incubating lab at the Sundance Institute to the premium Sundance TV channel, and of course, the Sundance Film Festival, Redford's multi-layered support of independent film from his Utah abode has helped set in stone the machinations of American indie film. “Premiering at Sundance” once meant traveling from obscurity to the beating heart of the film world. A “Sundance movie” developed a connotation of both intrigue and, eventually, derision. These ideas have cooled over time as other festivals have begun taking up some of the space once fully dominated by Sundance, but Redford's investment in artists (as founder, public face, and frequent master of ceremonies) inarguably changed the course of the film industry.

Redford is survived by his wife Sibylle Szaggars, his children Shauna Jean Redford and Amy Hart Redford, and seven grandchildren.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Slow Horses widens its spotlight (and turns down the emotional drama) in season 5","https://www.avclub.com/slow-horses-season-5-review-apple-tv-plus","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

“I want what I always want,” Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman), perpetually the smartest guy in the room, plainly tells the head of MI5 (James Callis' Claude Whelan), perpetually the dumbest, in the closing minutes of the upcoming season of Slow Horses, “…to be left in utter fucking peace.” The more things change, the more they remain the same on this show. And there's a certain comfort in knowing that whatever is thrown at the outcast agents employed at Slough House—new threats include a racist demagogue, a mass shooter, a group that's bombing penguins at the London Zoo, and another that's causing car hoods to burst into flames in the name of climate change—the Apple TV+ series always goes back, essentially, to the same playbook: The city faces catastrophe, Lamb & co. are told to not mettle, they do anyway, and then save the day with seconds to spare. Toss in some smart shit-talking and narrative go-tos, like immediately following tragedy (say, a massacre during an ugly election) with a heavy dose of silliness (say, a jackass annoyingly and joyously dancing to Robert Palmer's  “Simply Irresistible” on his way to work) and you have a show with the twisty, spycraft storytelling bones and comedic chemistry to keep audiences coming back for more.

Now, is it incredulous that everyone still underestimates the Slow Horses time and city-saving time again? Sure. But that is part of the baked-in charm of this series, which, to be fair, does throw the occasional fatal curveball to keep audiences on their toes and the stakes high by killing off an endearing character like Marcus Longridge (Kadiff Kirwan) in season four. Speaking of, that season is a tough act to follow. The series felt like it got notably deeper last year, with River Cartwright (Jack Lowden) dealing with some screwed-up daddy issues and Lamb, of all people, showing the slightest hints of compassion. “He always gives the impression that he doesn't care, and he probably cares more than most,” Oldman said of his character in an interview with The A.V. Club about that standout batch of episodes. 

At first, this season of Slow Horses struggles to live up to its last. The familiar banter and caustic put-downs from Lamb are still there and firing as fast and as amusingly as ever. But the juice of this particular tale (which is based on London Rules, the fifth novel in Mick Herron's series) feels, while certainly timely, with a politician played by Ted Lasso‘s Nick Mohammed vowing to “Make London Londerful Again,” thinner and, dramatically, less emotionally complex. Some of that is bound to happen when you take characters who have mostly been on the back burner and move them closer to the front, like Roddy Ho (a very funny Christopher Chung), that aforementioned dancing idiot/Slough House hacker who finds himself at the center of some international payback. He is exactly the kind of guy who'd say Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia “taught me a lot about women” and refer to himself as “Dragon Slayer, the Human Tripod, the True King Of Gondor” in front of MI5 top brass (Kristin Scott Thomas' Diana Taverner).



Similarly, Lamb's meek, longtime—and long-suffering—secretary Catherine Standish (Saskia Reeves) and not-so-meek agent Shirley Dander (Aimee-Ffion Edwards), who's still beating herself up over Marcus' death, also get more to do, teaming up to try and thwart an assassination. Even last season's Silent Hoodie Guy (Tom Brooke's J.K. Coe) moves a bit into the spotlight, becoming the reluctant partner of River and saying actual human words out loud—to the point that the latter begs, “Just fucking shut up, okay?” This many seasons in, the show needs to do some of this maneuvering so as not to drive home the same central characters' issues and burn out. It's just that they—again, understandably—don't hit like, for instance, River's bond with his dementia-addled grandfather (played by Jonathan Pryce), a relationship that largely fades into the background this time around.  

But that doesn't make any of this less delightful to watch, maybe just less fulfilling. And, on that note, it's worth singling out creator (and Emmy winner) Will Smith, who's leaving the show and managed to deliver five consistently entertaining seasons of TV in only three-and-a-half years. “Right now, we're at DEFCON shit, fuck, bollocks, and scramble,” Lamb spits out in the back half of this season. And no doubt, the Slow Horses will be in that very specific, precarious spot soon enough, with the season ending, per usual, with an energetic teaser of the next that's hard not to get excited about.     

Slow Horses season five premieres September 24 on Apple TV+

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell's twee Big Bold Beautiful Journey depends on chemistry","https://www.avclub.com/a-big-beautiful-journey-review","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:02:37 GMT","

Oh, to be great-looking, charming, and avoidant of relationships out of reluctance to hurt the other person because you consider yourself broken. It's a problem most prevalent in Movie World, nearly as debilitating as being great-looking, charming, and prone to solitude; together, these hang-ups may be insurmountable for A Big Bold Beautiful Journey. Not within the movie, mind. There, it seems pretty obvious that Sarah (Margot Robbie; avoidant of relationships) and David (Colin Farrell; prone to solitude) may be capable of overcoming their flimsy psychological issues. The film itself, however, risks irreparable harm through its series of screenwriterly excuses for not kissing right away. It's a romantic fantasy so delicate of spirit that seemingly no one has had the heart to tell it when it's dithering over absolutely nothing.

Who wants to bear that bad news, though, when the fantasy elements of A Big Bold Beautiful Journey are depicted with rare sweetness? This measured tone comes courtesy of director Kogonada, who made the Linklater-ish walk-and-talk Columbus and the thoughtful sci-fi picture After Yang. If not for some swearing designed to introduce a little irreverence into the proceedings, the story of Sarah and David could be a PG affair. (Columbus is the rare indie that went out unrated seemingly to avoid that half-extinct MPAA designation, rather than something harsher.) It's not even really a story, per se, but a series of mild, emo adventures crossing the deadpan magical realism of Charlie Kaufman with those scenes in Annie Hall where the characters stroll through scenes of their childhood.

Sarah and David meet at the wedding of unnamed mutual friends, introduced as fellow residents of an unnamed mutual city. They flirt, in a melancholy fashion, and go their separate ways, until a pair of suspiciously interactive GPS systems bring them back together. They've been set up, somehow, through a mechanism that the movie has the good sense not to belabor. David and Sarah have both obtained last-minute cars from the same strange, empty-warehouse rental company staffed with Kevin Kline (so restrained it may take a moment to register that it's him) and Phoebe Waller-Bridge (so shticky it's impossible to mistake her for anyone else), who insist on including GPS, in case their phones crap out. Once they've been manipulated into eventually sharing a single car (and, in poor Farrell's case, made to suffer the humiliation of saying the film's title aloud), the GPS guides the pair through the scenic countryside to a series of stand-alone doors.

One magically transports them to David's high school, during his teenage years. One whisks them into an art museum that Sarah used to visit. They learn about each other's pasts, which are convincing to a point. Somehow, the doors only ever need to show scenes that contribute directly to the characters' psychology, specifically as it affects romantic relationships. Despite that wedding invitation, Sarah and David rarely show each other, or even mention, things like friends, or non-immediate family, or workplace acquaintances. Or jobs. Do jobs exist this world?

Well, maybe not. For long stretches, that spareness works for a movie that isn't spending much time in the actual world. It's more of a lucid dream, and though Kogonada doesn't lean too heavily on the weirdness of genuine dreaming, he's well-suited for this tidier imitation. When David is back in high school, he's a teenager again, even though he's still played by an unaltered Farrell; Sarah is there alongside him, even though she shouldn't be. The director takes these adventures as opportunities to employ his favored frames within frames. One driving conversation between Sarah and David is covered entirely from outside-car vantages, including striking shots from behind that peer into each front seat subject from the opposite backseat window. A song and dance scene pointedly breaks through the proscenium. And, of course, what are all those doors if not neatly geometrical compositional tools?

The various door sequences do their best to defy screenwriting rules in a way that's unusual for a big-budget, big-studio, big-star production—especially one that seems at least faintly aware that awards-season bounty will not be reaped. At times, the movie's whimsy seems to aspire to something more like L.A. Story or the aforementioned Annie Hall than the manic catharsis-grabs of Everything Everywhere All At Once. One particular sequence featuring Robbie on her own seems like a guaranteed tearjerker, and it may have that effect on some audiences. But Kogonada gives the characters (and audience) a little space; it seems against his nature to push too hard.

Then again, maybe that's demanding too little from the director of After Yang, where the delicate tone is matched with a series of thought-provoking science fiction questions. (It may simultaneously ascribe too much credit to the many prodding soundtrack choices in his new film, even if the chosen Wilco, Bright Eyes, and Mitski tunes are pretty ones.) A Big Bold Beautiful Journey is more of an old-fashioned Hollywood romance, where two big bold beautiful stars coming off of career hot streaks radiate in each other's presence. This is not an unpleasant experience, not least because it's become a rare one. Farrell gets to use his real accent, and, well, Robbie doesn't, but most people know her as Barbie or Harley Quinn anyway. They're so naturally charming, so easy to like with their little notes of sincerity or cynicism, and so especially welcome in this gentle context, that they almost provide cover for how little of value this movie has to say about anything. Mostly, it preaches the value of coming to terms with the past in order to remain emotionally open to new experiences. (Here's a new experience for Sarah and David: gainful employment! Or even just a nice hobby!)

No one mentions whether that openness can perhaps be enhanced via superhuman big-screen-ready charm. Genuine loneliness doesn't seem compatible with this movie's glossier version of the Kogonada aesthetic, so sun showers, scenic overlooks, and stars will have to suffice. Is A Big Bold Beautiful Journey a piece of wannabe creativity with a yawning hollowness at its center, or an A-list romance with some welcome aesthetic sensitivity? Like the outcome of a first date, it will ultimately be determined by chemistry.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Donald Trump files $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times","https://www.avclub.com/donald-trump-new-york-times-defamation-lawsuit","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:29:58 GMT","

President Donald Trump's ongoing campaign against the media and free speech continues with a new defamation lawsuit against The New York Times. The lawsuit accuses the outlet of running articles ahead of the 2024 election that were “specifically designed to try and damage President Trump's business, personal and political reputation.” Defendants listed on the suit include the NYT, four of its reporters, and Penguin Random House, which published a book by two of the reporters called Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father's Fortune And Created The Illusion Of Success. The suit seeks $15 billion in damages, “which exceeds the entire market cap of The New York Times Company,” per CNN. 

The lawsuit contains a laundry list of complaints regarding several articles and the book. For instance, it argues that Lucky Loser inaccurately states that The Apprentice executive producer Mark Burnett made Trump famous, when he was actually already “a mega-celebrity and an enormous success in business.” The filing also takes issue with the outlet's endorsement of Kamala Harris: “I view it as the single largest illegal Campaign, EVER,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, noting that the endorsement “was actually put dead center on the front page of The New York Times, something heretofore UNHEARD OF!”

Of course neither an endorsement nor its placement fit the definition of defamation. But Trump has seen some success in bullying media entities into accepting “his view.” He sued ABC, which settled and forced George Stephanopoulos to apologize. 60 Minutes didn't apologize when Trump sued the show, but CBS also paid out a hefty settlement and Paramount is installing a right-wing ombudsman to monitor CBS News for “bias.” But perhaps the buck will stop with The New York Times. In a statement, a spokesperson for the outlet said,  “This lawsuit has no merit. It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics. We will continue to pursue the facts without fear or favor and stand up for journalists' First Amendment right to ask questions on behalf of the American people.”

Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, once appeared on Bravo's “Summer House,” long before her life was tied to politics and activism. In a resurfaced TikTok clip, Erika can be seen in season 3 of the Bravo series, which aired in 2019, going on a date with housemate Jordan Verroi.

All roads lead to @Bravo #charliekirk #erikakirk #summerhouse 

The moment showed cast members Carl Radke and Jordan reacting to the newcomer. “She's beautiful and happens to be religious,” Carl said in a confessional. Jordan added that Erika had “beautiful blonde hair, her smile, her radiance,” and said she carried “outward beauty and inner beauty.”

Although her appearance was brief, Erika later revealed in a 2019 Instagram post that she turned down the opportunity to become a full-time cast member. At the time, she was completing her juris master in American Legal Studies at Liberty University School of Law.

“To the one's that sent me insane amounts of encouragement & prayer as I silently pursued this degree and made my own career sacrifices (like turning down being a cast member for @bravotv Summer House & other various TV show opportunities),” she shared.

A post shared by E. (@mrserikakirk)

Erika didn't pursue reality TV, but she went on to meet conservative activist Charlie Kirk in 2018. The couple married in 2021 and welcomed two children together.

Charlie was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University after being shot in 2025 at the age of 31. In her tribute, Erika shared a powerful statement, standing next to the empty chair where her late husband once recorded his podcast.

“The movement my husband built will not die — I refuse to let that happen,” she said, vowing to continue his work through Turning Point USA. “The cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry.”

“The evildoers responsible for my husband's assassination have no idea what they have done,” she said. “They killed Charlie because he preached a message of patriotism, faith and of God's merciful love.”

“If you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before, you have no idea,” she continued. “You have no idea what you just have unleashed across this entire country and this world, you have no idea, you have no idea the fire that you have ignited within this wife. The cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry.”

Patricia Crowley, who was known for her roles in “Please Don't Eat the Daisies” and “Dynasty,” has passed away at the age of 91, The Hollywood Reporter reports. 

She died from natural causes in Los Angeles, her son Jon Hookstratten, who serves as the Executive VP of Administration & Operations for Sony Pictures Entertainment, announced. Crowley tragically passed two days before her 92nd birthday.

She is survived by her husband, television producer and executive Andy Friendly, with the two having gotten married in 1986. She is also survived by her two children, five grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Crowley was previously married to sports and entertainment attorney Ed Hookstratten.

Fans spoke highly of Crowley's impressive career, paying tribute after her passing.

“What a wonderful career she had Patricia Crowley brought so much charm and talent to every role. A true Hollywood gem,” one fan wrote.

“Patricia Crowley's talent and grace will always be remembered! Her iconic roles brought joy to many,” another fan commented.

“Grace, grit, and generations of screens, Patricia Crowley didn't just act, she anchored eras. What a legacy,” a fan said.

“Sad news to wake up to. Condolences to Patricia's family,” one fan wrote.

Crowley's acting career seemed written in the stars as she decided to follow her sister to New York City and went on to attend the High School of Performing Arts. She made her Broadway debut in 1950 in “Southern Exposure.”

Crowley starred in numerous different projects throughout her career, but one of her most well-known roles was Joan Nash in Please Don't Eat the Daisies. The sitcom ran from 1965 to 1967, in which she portrayed a newspaper writer who was married to a college professor, and the couple had four boys. Oh, and you can't forget about the family's Old English sheepdog named Ladadog.

“I thought the writing was very intelligent and very sweet,” she told Pioneers of Television of Please Don't Eat the Daisies in a past interview.

Crowley went on to have a recurring role in the sixth season of the ABC primetime soap Dynasty, starring as Emily Fallmont in 1986. Her time on Dynasty came to an end when her character was hit by a taxi and died.

She also won the Golden Globe for New Star of the Year for her performances in Forever Female and Money From Home in 1953.

She also had stints on The Twilight Zone, Friends, The Love Boat, General Hospital, and Beverly Hills, 90210, along with so many others. Her final onscreen appearance was in 2012 in the film Mont Reve.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Legendary Actor Robert Redford Passes Away","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/legendary-actor-robert-redford-passes-away/","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:56:15 GMT","

Legendary actor, turned director, and then activist Robert Redford has passed away at the age of 89. He's known for such iconic films as “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “The Sting,” and “All The President's Men.” More recent audiences will know him from “Captain America: The Winter Soldier.”

According to The New York Times, Redford passed away at his home in Utah on the morning of September 16. Cindi Berger, the chief executive of Rogers & Cowan PMK, announced his passing in a statement. His cause of death was not given. 

Redford began his acting career in the 1950s. He has over 80 acting credits, leaving behind a substantial legacy. As a result, fans are paying tribute to the beloved actor and director. One person said on X, “RIP Robert Redford. Your performance in The Twilight Zone as a warm and gentle personification of Death brought me to tears.”

Someone else wrote, “RIP Robert Redford. So many wonderful movies, but The Natural is easily my favorite. First watched it as a boy and loved it ever since. He was a true great.”

Another fan wrote on the platform, “RIP Robert Redford…was not ready for that.” 

Another long-time fan stated, “When I was a kid, I accidentally walked onto the set of A River Runs Through It. I didn't know who Robert Redford was, but I thought, ‘Why would anyone wear all black in this heat?” I remember he was small, and had red hair. RIP Robert Redford.”

The Indie Wire account also paid tribute to his legacy. They wrote, “Robert Redford, the golden-haired leading man whose progressive politics informed his choices over a 60-year career, died on Tuesday morning at his home in Utah. He was 89.”

Saying Redford is a screen legend is an understatement. His career began as a Broadway actor when he accepted a role in 1959 for “Tall Story.” Following that, he made TV appearances in “Maverick,” “Rescue 8,” and the film version of “Tall Story.” 

According to IMDb, his big break came in 1967 when he starred in “Barefoot in the Park.” Two years later came “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.” Of course, he's also known for “The Great Gatsby,” “A Bridge Too Far,” and several other films. His directorial debut came in 1980 with “Ordinary People,” which won the Academy Award for Best Director. He later won an honorary Oscar in 2002.

Jamie Lee Curtis grew emotional during a taping of Marc Maron's “WTF” podcast, tearing up as she discussed the impact of a recent shooting that had shaken her. The interview took place only days after the incident.

Curtis sobbed as she reflected on the death of Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old activist and Turning Point USA co-founder who was fatally shot on September 10 at a Utah college. Curtis and Maron recorded the episode only days after the assassination.

“I'm going to bring something up with you just because it's front of mind,” Curtis said, before mistakenly referring to Kirk as “Charlie Crist,” which she explained was a slip of the tongue linked to Kirk's “deep, deep belief” in religion.

Curtis admitted she disagreed with many of the victim's views in life, but spoke compassionately about his humanity. 

“I disagreed with him on almost every point I ever heard him say, but I believe he was a man of faith, and I hope in that moment when he died, that he felt connected with his faith,” she said through tears. “I still believe he's a father and a husband and a man of faith.”

The actress also addressed her concern about videos of the shooting being circulated online. “I know there is a video of his assassination. I know people who've seen it,” Curtis said. “We as a society are bombarded with imagery. We don't know what the longitudinal effects of seeing those towers come down over and over again, or watching his execution over and over again. I don't ever want to see this footage of this man being shot.”

Other Hollywood figures echoed her call for empathy and compassion in the wake of the tragedy. Jimmy Kimmel urged his followers to set aside anger and remember the human cost of violence. “Instead of the angry finger-pointing, can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human?” he wrote on Instagram. “On behalf of my family, we send love to all the children, parents and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence.”

Erika Kirk, widow of the late Charlie Kirk, paid a moving tribute to her husband following his assassination at Utah Valley University.

Sharing a carousel of photos on Instagram, she expressed her grief and reflected on the deep bond they shared. “The sound of this widow weeping echoes throughout this world like a battle cry,” Erika wrote. “I have no idea what any of this means. But baby I know you do and so does our Lord.”

“Rest in the arms of our Lord baby as he blankets you with the words I know your heart always strived to hear, ‘well done My good and faithful servant,'” she added.

Legendary actor, director, and activist Robert Redford has died at the age of 89, as reported by The New York Times on 16th September 2025. The Hollywood icon, celebrated for classics like “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “The Sting,” and “All the President's Men,” also found a new generation of fans through his role in “Captain America: The Winter Soldier.”

Redford's family story began in 1958 when he married historian Lola Van Wagenen. Together, they had four children: Scott, Shauna, James, and Amy. 

Their first child, Scott, was born in 1959 but tragically died of sudden infant death syndrome at just 2 months old. The loss left a lasting mark on Redford, shaping how he approached life and fatherhood.

Shauna, their eldest daughter, was born in 1960 and grew up largely outside Hollywood's spotlight. Two years later, James “Jamie” Redford was born in 1962, following in his father's creative footsteps as a filmmaker and philanthropist. 

In 1970, their youngest child, Amy, arrived, later becoming an actress and director.

Jamie inherited his father's creative spirit, focusing on documentaries like “The Kindness of Strangers” and “Happening: A Clean Energy Revolution.” 

He also became an advocate for organ donation after surviving two liver transplants. Tragically, Jamie died in 2020 at age 58 from bile-duct cancer, reopening the grief of Scott's death decades earlier.

Redford, who divorced Van Wagenen in 1985, leaned on his daughters and second wife, artist Sibylle Szaggars, for strength after Jamie's passing. Sibylle, whom he married in 2009, brought renewed love and creativity into his later years.

While Redford's Hollywood career soared with classics like “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “The Way We Were,” and “All the President's Men,” he credited fatherhood with grounding him. His children and grandchildren now carry on his artistic legacy.

Shauna, 63, became an artist and raised two children, Mica and Conor. Jamie, before his passing, raised two kids with his wife, Kyle: Dylan and Lena. Amy, 53, built a career in film and is raising three children, including twins.

Redford's grandchildren are following creative paths of their own, from filmmaking to the arts. Dylan has pursued studio art and appeared in the documentary “The Big Picture,” while Lena has worked in film and voice acting.

Even as he turned 89, Redford described family as the anchor of his life. Despite enduring the heartbreak of losing two sons, he has continued to cherish his role as a father, grandfather, and husband. His bond with his children and grandchildren ensures his passion for storytelling, art, and activism lives on through them.

As Redford once said, Sundance and the legacy he built are now in the hands of his children and their children. His story is proof that behind the Hollywood icon is a family man who found his greatest meaning in love, resilience, and the ties that endure through generations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Sofia Vergara Rushes to Emergency Room & Misses the Emmy Awards","https://entertainmentnow.com/agt/sofia-vergara-misses-emmy-awards-health-scare/","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 12:30:35 GMT","

Sofia Vergara missed the 2025 Emmy Awards after an unexpected health scare. The “America's Got Talent” judge revealed on September 14 that she was rushed to the ER with a swollen eye allergy just before the ceremony.

“Didn't make it to the Emmys but made it to the ER,” the “Griselda” star, 53, wrote in a lighthearted Instagram caption alongside a carousel of photos, including a close-up of her red, swollen eye. “Sorry, I had to cancel! Craziest eye [allergy] right before getting in the car!”

A post shared by Sofia Vergara (@sofiavergara)

In addition to the close-up, Vergara shared videos from the hospital, including one of her moaning in pain while lying in bed and another rinsing her eye at a sink. The actress, who underwent her second knee surgery in July, tried to keep the moment humorous, adding emojis to her post.

The comments on her Instagram filled quickly with encouragement. “Oh no! Get well soon,” wrote “America's Got Talent” host Terry Crews, while Snoop Dogg sent a string of praying-hands emojis. Though she wasn't nominated, Vergara had been slated to present at this year's Emmys.

According to a September 9 press release, she was part of a starry list of presenters that included Elizabeth Banks, Angela Bassett, Jason Bateman, Kristen Bell, Sterling K. Brown, Jennifer Coolidge, Colman Domingo, Tina Fey, Mariska Hargitay, Jude Law, Sarah Paulson, Sydney Sweeney, Jesse Williams, and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

Vergara wasn't the only name absent. “Euphoria” star Eric Dane, who revealed his ALS diagnosis in April, was also set to present but did not attend. His “Grey's Anatomy” costar Jesse Williams took the stage alone to present the Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series award.

The 2025 Emmys, hosted by comedian Nate Bargatze, still brought out Hollywood's biggest stars. 

Stephen Colbert earned one of the evening's most memorable moments when “The Late Show,” which CBS had canceled in July, won Outstanding Talk Series. 

And history was made when Owen Cooper, 15, became the youngest male actor to win Supporting Actor in a Limited/Anthology Series for “Adolescence.”

 At the same time, Tramell Tillman became the first Black actor to win Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his role in “Severance.”

Among the winners were HBO Max's “The Pitt” for Outstanding Drama Series, Apple TV+'s “The Studio” for Outstanding Comedy Series, and “Adolescence” in the Limited/Anthology category. Notable acting wins went to Noah Wyle (“The Pitt”), Britt Lower (“Severance”), Seth Rogen (“The Studio”), Jean Smart (“Hacks”), Jeff Hiller (“Somebody Somewhere”), Hannah Einbinder (“Hacks”), and Cristin Milioti (“The Penguin”).

That Kogonada is neither a writer nor editor credited on his third feature is the first worrying road sign on this “Big Bold Beautiful Journey,” roles he maintained on both the coolly observed, intellectual romance “Columbus” and the cozy, ruminative AI sci-fi “After Yang.” 

His latest film, a drawn-out, time-hopping romance between Colin Farrell and Margot Robbie as script-y stick figures trapped by a sentient rental car into literally driving down the memory lane of their most formative episodes, features both embarrassingly earnest writing and nonsensical, incoherent editing. Perhaps someone could have asked the film's director to step away from the camera and in on either front.

 








Related Stories Radu Jude Bids You Welcome to His ‘Dracula' on October 29 with a Spooky Special Message What Hollywood Really Wants: The Audience You Already Built 

Pairing Kogonada with screenwriter Seth Reiss' (“The Menu”) disaster-bound dump truck of cliches feels like an insult to and an underestimation of the Cannes-crowned filmmaker's prior proven bona fides: It's not a drama, it's not a comedy, it's not a romance, but it's kind of a musical at one point? That much I know is true.

 










Less discernible human characters than the shapes of people who look like them, David (Colin Farrell) and Sarah (Margot Robbie) are strangers who meet at a mutual friend's wedding they are both attending stag. That the wedding takes place in a hotel called La Strada and on a very rainy day tells you that we are in a fanciful la-la land of cutesy cinematic references and a world in which a contrived meet-cute congeals around coincidences and pastels. Robbie, styled in a newsboy cap and oversized red coat, looks like she just came back from a semester abroad living in Soho, Londontown.

The costumes and production design are all Jacques Demy by way of Anthropologie, color-popped to impose personality on the personality-less (and with Bright Eyes and Mitski on the soundtrack to reinforce the indie tweeness). Beyond just looking cheap and CW-adjacent, the styling only reinforces the level of artifice and unwillingness to go deeper than skin or sickly cotton-candy-sweet surfaces. 

David and Sarah, across nearly two testing hours that unfold at the pace you imagine being forced to relive your life's most painful moments on the road to rediscovering your inner manic pixie dream child would, aren't revealed to have any dreams of their own beyond the failed quest for love. (Though David's pasted-on childhood fondness for musicals implies something adjacent to character development here.)

 










They are, rather, cut-outs of rom-com archetypes: David is a sad, lonely man whose father (Hamish Linklater) recently died, and Sarah is a self-confessed serial cheater whose mother (Lily Rabe, Linklater's wife and a welcome respite, given her increasing likeness to her mother, the late Jill Clayburgh) died when she was a college freshman screwing her professor.

Back up a bit, though the connective tissue is missing here: In the opening sequence, David's parked car gets the dreaded yellow boot due to unpaid parking tickets, a note pasted curbside directing him to an ominous rental car company that turns out to be operated out of a warehouse by an asleep-at-the-wheel Kevin Kline and cloyingly smirky Phoebe Waller-Bridge. It's the car David takes to the wedding, and the car whose GPS, when David eventually offers Sarah a ride, that promises them both a “big bold beautiful journey,” a phrase they are meant to say back to it like some kind of greeting-card-tailored, reverse “there's no place like home.” Said car then takes them on said journey, where each stop is outfitted with a portal-like door that allows them to enter into past milestones: break-ups, significant deaths, soul-shifting encounters with art.

The most charming sequences allows the 49-year-old Colin Farrell to dust off his song and dance skills in a performance, as his adolescent David self, in a school production of “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.” Sarah stands up from the audience to fill in the lyrics after David, confronting his then childhood girlfriend, grinds the performance to an auditorium-freezing halt. There's another stridently mawkish sequence in which David and Sarah both re-experience their most wounding breakups — David with a woman he was engaged to (played by Sarah Gadon) and Sarah with a cableknit-sweater-clad Billy Magnussen, whom she left and ghosted in the middle of the night — in tandem.

 










The problem here is that David and Sarah learn or glean nothing meaningful or revelatory in rehashing old traumas; much like filmmakers, they're observing the material as if moving slides on a Kodak wheel rather than actually engaging with them. Whereas in a movie like “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” Joel and Clementine replayed and relived the past to understand where they've gone wrong in the present, David and Sarah's only lesson learned here is that they apparently belong together romantically after all, despite his mopiness and tendency toward shutting people out, and her lifelong allergy to monogamy and bohemianism. It's unfortunate, too, that the actors seem to have an allergy to each other in the sparks department, with about as much chemistry as that between two walls that happen to be facing each other.

“A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” suffers from the fact that Kogonada, who got his start crafting online video essay analyses of his favorite films and TV shows before debuting with “Columbus” at Sundance 2017 and taking “After Yang” to Cannes in 2021, has no personal stamp on the project. This film is like a splotchy watercolor of vaguely blotted emotions next to the pointilist emotional precision of his prior two films. 

 










Reiss' script was a Black List find that either wasn't reworked enough by committee or so sanded down in the studio churn that all personality was drained in the process. Cinematographer Benjamin Loeb (“Pieces of a Woman,” “Dream Scenario,” “Mandy”) shoots the film more like a cheery extended ad campaign for the AI-powered vehicle driving the characters toward catharsis, and there's certainly nothing romantic about a movie that features multiple moments of cringe-in-your-seat Burger King product placement.

“A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” is miscalculated as a romance and a fantasy, and while I'm loath to blame a craftsman as intelligent as Kogonada entirely for the outcome, he did, after all, agree to direct this lousy script. A big, bold, beautiful bore indeed.

“A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” opens in theaters from Sony Pictures on Friday, September 19.

Tributes are pouring in for Robert Redford, the great actor, director, and Sundance Film Festival founder who died September 16 at the age of 89. One of the most moving comes from his costar Jane Fonda, who appeared in five movies with him: 1960's “Tall Story” (Redford's first movie — he went uncredited), 1966's “The Chase,” 1967's “Barefoot in the Park,” 1979's “The Electric Horseman,” and 2017's “Our Souls at Night.”

In a statement provided to IndieWire, Fonda said, “It hit me hard this morning when I read that Bob was gone. I can't stop crying. He meant a lot to me and was a beautiful person in every way. He stood for an America we have to keep fighting for.”

The Sundance Institute said in a statement about its founder, “We are deeply saddened by the loss of our founder and friend Robert Redford. Bob's vision of a space and a platform for independent voices launched a movement that, over four decades later,has inspired generations of artists and redefined cinema in the U.S. and around the world. Beyond his enormous contributions to culture at large, we will miss his generosity, clarity of purpose, curiosity, rebellious spirit, and his love for the creative process. We are humbled to be among the stewards of his remarkable legacy, which will continue to guide the Institute in perpetuity.” 

 










Tom Rothman, chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, told IndieWire in a statement, “In addition to being a titanic acting and directing talent, as an early board member of the Sundance Institute, I saw first-hand the Sundance Kid's passionate commitment to indie film and young artists.   Robert Redford truly gave back. The entire scope of American film would have been much poorer without him. An amazing legacy of an amazing man.” 

Other tributes came from Marlee Matlin, who recognized on X the incredible impact that Redford's Sundance Film Festival had on allowing smaller human dramas to flourish. “Our film, CODA, came to the attention of everyone because of Sundance. And Sundance happened because of Robert Redford. A genius has passed. RIP Robert.”

Colman Domingo wrote on X, “With love and admiration. Thank you Mr. Redford for your everlasting impact. Will be felt for generations.”

Robert Redford has passed away. He was part of a new and exciting Hollywood in the 70s and 80s. Hard to believe he was 89.

Robert Redford, the golden-haired leading man whose progressive politics informed his choices over a 60-year career, died on Tuesday morning at his home in Utah. He was 89.

The New York Times announced his death. In a statement provided to the outlet, Cindi Berger, the chief executive of the publicity firm Rogers & Cowan PMK, said he died in his sleep but did not provide a specific cause.

Born in Santa Monica, California, Redford studied painting at the University of Colorado on a baseball scholarship. He began his acting journey at the American Academy of Dramatic Art and debuted on Broadway playing a baseball player in 1959 in “Tall Story.”

He played roles in television, theater and film, breaking out in 1966 with a trio of well-received movies, “Inside Daisy Clover,” “This Property Is Condemned” and “The Chase,” opposite ingenue Jane Fonda, who also costarred in romantic comedy “Barefoot in the Park,” in which Redford reprised his role from Broadway, as well as “The Electric Horseman” and 38 years later, Netflix romance “Our Souls at Night.”

 










“It was fun to kiss him in my twenties and then to kiss him again in my almost-eighties,” Fonda said at the Venice Film Festival.

Redford's charm and golden boy aura made him perfect for roles like “The Great Gatsby” and “The Way We Were,” but cost him others like “The Graduate,” for which his friend Mike Nichols refused to cast him, telling Vanity Fair he wasn't right because he could “never play a loser.”

In “The Way We Were,” Katie (Barbra Streisand) tells Hubbell (Redford) that everything seems to come easy for him. That image stuck to the star. “I started as an actor in the theater playing a lot of character parts,” Redford told Oprah. “And suddenly, I found myself in this place where it felt like I was getting locked into a kind of a stereotype, and it did bother me,” he says. “And then I would hear, ‘Well, but that's easy for you.' Or, ‘You look like somebody who's educated in the East,' which I wasn't. ‘And came from an elegant background,' which I didn't.”

Redford worked hard to establish himself outside of that trope in a range of genres, from sports films (“The Natural,” “Downhill Racer”) to Westerns (“Jeremiah Johnson”). He held his own against major stars, including Paul Newman in “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” and Best-Picture winner “The Sting” (Redford's only acting Oscar nod), Streisand in “The Way We Were” and Meryl Streep in Best-Picture winner “Out of Africa.”

 










Redford also pursued politically-charged movies, and helped to get made “The Candidate” and “All the President's Men,” another Best Picture winner. In 1974, Redford was the first performer since Bing Crosby in 1946 to have three films in the year's top ten grossers. And each year between 1974 and 1976, exhibitors named Redford as Hollywood's top box-office star.

Redford's closest collaborator over the years was Sydney Pollack, who he first met as an actor on 1962's “War Hunt.” Pollack went on to direct Redford in seven movies: “This Property is Condemned,” “Jeremiah Johnson,” “The Way We Were,” “Three Days of the Condor,” “The Electric Horseman,” “Out of Africa,” and, less successfully, their final film, “Havana.” “I was his actor; he was my director,” Redford once said.

Redford paid attention on set, and enjoyed taking control as a director on a total of nine features. He scored with his debut in 1980: “Ordinary People” took home four Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Timothy Hutton for Best Supporting Actor and Alvin Sargent for Original Screenplay. Redford also directed, with varying critical and box-office success, “Quiz Show,” “A River Runs Through It,” “The Milagro Beanfield War,” “The Legend of Bagger Vance,” “Lions for Lambs,” “The Conspirator,” “The Horse Whisperer,” and “The Company You Keep.”

 










Finally, Redford's significant legacy was The Sundance Institute. Founded in 1979 at Redford's Provo Canyon ski resort in Utah's Wasatch Mountains, Sundance for the next 40 years pursued its unwavering help-the-filmmakers mission to provide a support system for independents. The Institute mounted mentor workshops that eventually led to a place to showcase the work: the Sundance Film Festival. (The name comes from the character Redford played opposite Newman in William Goldman and George Roy Hill's Oscar-winning 1969 buddy Western “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.”) 

At a 2013 fundraiser in Los Angeles, Redford restated his original goal: “To create opportunity for new artists to have a voice and focus on a category that was DOA at that time, independent film.”

Over the decades, the Sundance Film festival morphed from a classics and good-for-you granola film showcase to a vital hub in indie distribution, serving as a gatekeeper and exhibition platform for filmmakers and a farm system for emerging talent heading for Hollywood. The festival grew with the burgeoning indie film movement, evolving into one of the most influential forces in American cinema.

Its first breakout came in 1989, the year that twenty-six-year-old writer/director Steven Soderbergh introduced “sex, lies and videotape,” which was scooped up by Bob and Harvey Weinstein and entered in competition at Cannes, where it won the Palme d'Or. People remembered what a zero-to-sixty festival rocket launch looked like. After a long search for a new home, the festival will relocate to Boulder, Colorado in 2027. Its 2026 edition will be the last to take place in Utah.

 










Quentin Tarantino's “Reservoir Dogs,” Sally Potter's “Orlando,” Richard Linklater's “Slacker” and Kevin Smith's “Clerks” are among the films that launched careers at Sundance, along with myriad talent from Tilda Swinton, Edward Burns and Ashley Judd to Kerry Washington, Sam Rockwell, and Jennifer Lawrence. And every year a selection of Sundance entries moves into Oscar contention, from features to documentaries. 

While he stopped directing, Redford kept acting through his eighties, often threatening to retire, shining in such films as the solo survival tale “All Is Lost” (winning the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor), and two films for David Lowery, “Pete's Dragon” and con-man romance “The Old Man & The Gun,” opposite Sissy Spacek. He even worked for Marvel Studios, playing Alexander Pierce, the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. in “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” (2014) and “Avengers: Endgame” (2019).

His final on-screen credit was a cameo in the AMC series “Dark Winds,” which he also produced, playing an unnamed chess player.

Redford accepted an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2002; in 2014, Time named him the “Godfather of Indie Film” in the magazine's “Most Influential People in the World” round-up. And In 2016, Redford accepted the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 

 










He is survived by his wife, Sibylle Szaggars Redford, daughters Shauna Schlosser Redford and Amy Redford, and seven grandchildren.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Coachella 2026 Lineup: Sabrina Carpenter, Justin Bieber, Karol G, the Strokes, and More","https://pitchfork.com/news/coachella-2026-lineup-sabrina-carpenter-justin-bieber-karol-g-the-strokes-and-more/","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 04:57:04 GMT","

The 2026 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival lineup has been unveiled. Sabrina Carpenter, Justin Bieber, and Karol G are heading to the desert next year as the festival's headliners, topping the two-weekend bill in Indio, California, on April 10-12 and 17-19. Also slated to perform are Young Thug, the xx, Turnstile, David Byrne, FKA twigs, Addison Rae, Ethel Cain, and dozens more. See the full lineup and festival poster below.

Rounding out the Coachella 2026 lineup are: Alex G, PinkPantheress, Iggy Pop, Giveon, Little Simz, Devo, Blood Orange, Geese, Dijon, Wet Leg, Oklou, Black Flag, Disclosure, Sexyy Red, Katseye, Moby, Joyce Manor, Lykke Li, CMAT, Wednesday, Model/Actriz, Ceremony, Bedouin, Lambrini Girls, Fakemink, Jane Remover, Drain, and the Rapture.

Plus, there's a billing for Nine Inch Noize (presumably a collaboration between Nine Inch Nails and Boys Noize) and the bottom of the poster lists “The Bunker Debut of Radiohead Kid A Mnesia.” (A representative for Radiohead confirmed to Pitchfork that the band does not plan to be physically present at Coachella.) In addition, Anyma is an additional headliner, and he'll be presenting his Æden project.

Passes go on sale this Friday, September 19, at 1 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

As rumored, Carpenter returns to the desert after making her debut in 2024, now promoted up the billing after the whirlwind success of her albums Short n' Sweet and Man's Best Friend. She is set to close out 2025 with a string of dates, including residencies in New York and Los Angeles. She also has a smattering of South American festivals booked in the months leading up to Coachella.

This will be Bieber's first-ever headlining set at Coachella. Although he's been a guest performer joining other artists onstage—Ariana Grande, Daniel Caesar, Chance the Rapper, and Tems and Wizkid—four times at the festival, Bieber has never actually performed at Coachella as a billed artist before. This set will also mark his first live concert in over three years, with his last show taking place in September 2022. Bieber is coming armed with his guest-heavy records Swag and Swag II, both of which came out this year.

This is also Karol G's second stop at the Indio festival, following the Colombian superstar's 2022 debut appearance. Her latest album, Tropicoqueta, came out last June, and, as things stand, the Coachella set is scheduled to be her first full live show behind the album. In early September, she performed at Corinthians Arena in São Paulo, Brazil, as the halftime act at the NFL game between Kansas City Chiefs and the Los Angeles Chargers.

Last year's Coachella headliners were Lady Gaga, Green Day, Post Malone, and Travis Scott, with Green Day and Scott both squeezed in on the Saturday night. Others on that bill included Charli XCX—who brought out Billie Eilish, Lorde, and Troye Sivan—and Clairo, who got a Bernie Sanders introduction, but not the visa-beleaguered FKA twigs or Massive Attack, who turned down a slot after lamenting the festival's environmental impact.

Is Jens Lekman for real? Funnily enough, it's the very intensity of the Swedish singer-songwriter's earnestness that raises the question. Even when grounded in autobiography, his stories are gaudily and perhaps implausibly embroidered. His music is delectable, but in the way of an absurdly fancy galette that looks almost too good to eat. Even for the sweetest tooth, it can be an acquired taste: Piling his pastry with the most sumptuous orchestral toppings, then adding thick dollops of syrupy crooning, he comes on strong. I'll never forget when the milkman at a coffee shop where I worked arrived while Night Falls over Kortedala was playing and groaned, “What is this, Neil Sedaka?” Or the mix of confusion, concern, and dawning horror on my partner's face when she walked in during a schmaltzy patch of his new album Songs for Other People's Weddings. In that moment, she may have been lost to Jens forever.

But it's a taste that, once acquired, can't easily be sated—that lacquered fruit, that heavy cream, those sharp observations curlicued in frosting. It might actually be an anti-taste: uncoolly garrulous, glorying in chintz, scoffing at moderation. Mariachi horns, beatnik spoken-word interludes, Disney movie piano themes, soothing spa flutes, smoldering Sergio saxophones, country boot scoots, theme-park medieval motifs, and strings splashing everywhere in champagne-glass towers: There is nothing Lekman won't try to wring a few more drops out of the oldest subject. If all his music is about love, then Songs for Other People's Weddings gets to its beating heart, though glazed in the fine layers of truth and fiction that make him one of a kind.

Some 20 years ago, not long after Lekman's sampledelic twee pop first broke out, he took up a sideline as a wedding singer. It started as a lark: He put a song called “If You Ever Need a Stranger (To Sing at Your Wedding)” on his debut album. Some fans called his bluff. But it became a lifeline when streaming started gutting recording artists' revenue. This reality breaks into the fizzy orch-pop paradise of “A Tuxedo Sewn for Two” when the wedding singer makes a mordant remark about Spotify to two guys standing before a urinal, uncomfortably stitched into a single suit.The song also features references to Plato's Symposium and The Human Centipede and finally breaks down into a saloon ditty with a gin-and-juice kicker. Welcome to the anything-goes world of Lekman, whose music inhabits a kind of heart-shaped Schrödinger's box—a presentation so frou-frou that it seems like some kind of gimmick. The trick is that it's not.

Lekman had long corresponded with author David Levithan, who co-wrote the 2006 novel Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, before they collaborated on songs for a novel, also called Songs for Other People's Weddings, about a fictional but familiar wedding singer. But then, rather than just recording the songs he wrote for the book, Lekman went further, delving into the characters' POVs to create a Sinatra-inspired standalone musical. Appreciating the resulting album isn't contingent on the book—it's pure Lekmanalia. But it's contingent on how much pleasure you can stand. If the record has a defect besides the preciousness that Lekman, to his devotees, turns into an indispensable virtue, it's the whopping length. My nervous system just can't endure 17 tracks of uncut Jens at once; it's a giddy squee! sustained for 80 minutes. But it has variety and inspiration throughout, and it works great when taken in two chunks, one spinning a relationship together and the other gently tugging it apart.

The story traces the arc of the romance between J, the Lekman proxy, and V. They meet at a wedding where all the guests are dressed as songs (he's “Raspberry Beret,” she's “Crazy in Love”), and after taking a pill that tastes like hairspray, they fall into the playful connection that will define their intimacy. It's about being in love while also being love's outsider, both participant and observer, a split that blurs the line between life and music—as Lekman adores doing. When V moves overseas, seeking space, J starts booking gigs just to be near her. Throughout, V is powerfully sung by Matilda Sargren, whom Lekman recruited through a youth orchestra in his hometown. V has the last word on their relationship, and J learns that his music's purpose is not to bottle permanence but to celebrate connection, however fleeting.

The music has as many moods as love does: now light and irrepressible, now crackling with an erotic charge, then turning tentative or questioning, cozy or desolate. Duets peel off into monologues; what was joyous returns as profound. Lekman's storytelling is exceptionally detailed and funny, kind of like a Swedish David Sedaris, and his wedding-singer avatar gives him a chorus of toothsome characters and milieus to weave through J and V's evolving dynamic. “GOT-JFK” kicks off an ingenious suite set at a performance-art wedding in Brooklyn; later J finds himself at a singles table in Leipzig with “two sisters who look like Patty and Selma from The Simpsons/An elderly man whose lungs sound like a broken whistle/And a man who's the embodiment of a full blown incel.” We come to realize that Lekman's side hustle, rather than taking away from his songwriting, must inestimably feed it.

His band, including Owen Pallett on three songs, has built the songs into many-jointed contraptions, lovingly detailed and buffed to a blinding shine. On “The First Lovesong,” Lekman's voice starts out surprisingly low and croaky, like late Leonard Cohen or Stephin Merritt, but it's just a fake-out for the exquisitely soaring chorus. “Candy From a Stranger” puffs and pulses like expensive perfume on a hot dancefloor, while “Speak to Me in Music” fumes like an '80s cocktail bar. There are shades of INXS on “With You I Can Hear My Own Voice,” Tori Amos with a touch of gospel on “I Want to Want You Again,” where a backup vocalist adds a strange little cowboy voice to Sargren's centered lead. There's Princely electro-funk on “Wedding in Brooklyn,” while the magic-lantern oscillations of “For Skye” might have come from the prompt “Beach Boys 1990 but it's Steve Reich.” The most heartbreaking moments are often doused in the most joie de vivre, especially the full-on trance anthem “On a Pier, on the Hudson.”

It's fitting that Songs for Other People's Weddings grew out of letter writing, as Lekman treats his music as an epistolary form—an exchange, not a one-way conduit. One of his best albums took the form of a pen-pal exchange with Annika Norlin. The Tracey on “Become Someone Else's” was Tracey Thorn, answering her gentle rebuke of him on her song “Oh, the Divorces!”—my favorite secret portal between two artists' catalogs. At concerts, he used to sign his name in the air when he got to the “yours truly, Jens Lekman” part of “A Postcard to Nina.” To treat every song as a letter means that you're always considering who you're writing to, whether it's a certain person or the composite creature of your audience. You collect people's stories, but you give them back better than they were—brighter, smarter, more caring and insightful. This is why we Lekmanites are so devoted, and why the role of wedding singer seems so symbiotic with his songwriting. For art or for hire, it seems, it's all the same to him: “If we're gonna talk about love, let's talk about music.”

Correction: A previous version of this review stated that David Levithan is the sole author of the novel Songs for Other People's Weddings. It was co-written by Levithan and Jens Lekman.

In the 2000s, there was an extremely popular manga called Nana, where nothing all that important happened. It was a melancholic comedy about two new friends in their early twenties, both named Nana. They spend most of their time in Tokyo hanging out at bars, rocking Vivienne Westwood, working jobs, playing music, and balancing on and off romantic relationships. It was a detailed and messy character study that felt like falling in deeper with a friend group with every new issue.

I sometimes get a similar feeling when I listen to the new-age cloud rap of Dolo2000. The Southern California rapper and producer has been dropping casually dreamy tapes and loosies full of fragmented everyday situations—hitting parlays with his friends, smoking weed, going to shows—like a Curren$y raised on SoundCloud. His new album, Let's Meet At Junes, continues to open up his world with foggy scenes that capture a snapshot of being young, fly, and a little aimless in Los Angeles.

A lot of Dolo's vignettes on Let's Meet At Junes drift from bad dates to empty hookups to getting drunk at parties while carrying a general sense of malaise. With a lowkey sing-rap usually caked in various kinds of effects, only some of the lyrics are super clear, but the ones that do cut through form images so sharp it's almost like you're there. On the standout “at_the_club_its_so_meaningless,” with his melodies only lightly warped, he describes a night out of going through the motions. “Kinda sad that I see you less,” he says, longing for someone, which, combined with the spacey beat, makes you picture him sitting alone at the bar of a loud club while his friends go out and mack on the dancefloor. The vocal effects of “secretlab” are a lot heavier, with overlapping smothered ad-libs like a Black Kray record from a decade ago, making the loose crumbs on his mind (his Undercover sweater, letting go of a relationship) sound surreal.

The songs that don't work are the ones where the lyrics come off as one long blur. For example, his vocals on “kanji's castle” are overly blunted, an effect I'm not usually against, but it's unstylish, like a pilot's announcement from the cockpit. (Though I do get a kick out of how plainly he disses retired NBA loudmouth Kendrick Perkins—get his ass.) “break no promise xoxo” is the album's most cliché track, marked by undercooked dating talk and murmurs of “percocet and lean” that feel straight out of one of those Duwap Kaine deep cuts you pretend don't exist. The beat picks up the emotional slack, though, with a Friendzone-ish glassiness that hammers home the soul-searching. By and large, Dolo's mostly self-produced instrumentals— which resemble everything from the etherealness of Japanese RPG video games of the 2000s (Persona 4, specifically) to the electronic funk of Metro Zu—go a long way in setting the figuring-his-shit-out mood.

But it's the small moments that really make Let's Meet At Junes feel so lived-in. Killing time playing his favorite Call of Duty map on the plugg-coated “gaspack.” The scraps of dialogue sprinkled throughout “guancho guancho man,” where Dolo's melodies are basically chipmunk'd. And the most scenic of them all is “still_the_same,” a glimpse at the slow fade out of a relationship. Going from communication issues to a breakup to Dolo making the bad decision to hit her up after-party only to realize that nothing has changed, it's brought to life by raps that amplify the confusion and the jittery footwork bounce of the beat. Like a lot of his best music, it could be an entire chapter in a graphic novel of its own.

Swedish producer, DJ, and vocalist Oli XL brings a certain glitzy ambition to his glitchy creations, the kind that can translate the ambiguous atmospheres of left-field electronic music for relative newcomers. There's an earnest fervor around his work; in fan Q&As, he fields nerdy, in-the-weeds questions about the minutiae of his process and inspirations. Acolytes have clamored for Oli's debut project on Warp Records for years (single “Go Oli Go!” came out way back in 2021), circulating the tongue-in-cheek hashtag “#FreeOli” as he's navigated what he terms “contract hell” with the label. Following a surprise drop in August, the record is free: Lick the Lens — Pt. 1 (which anticipates an eventual Pt. 2 later this year) offers chic, indie-tronic glamor and the irrepressible fizz of a kid winning the science fair.

It's been a long, atomized six years since Oli's year0001 imprint Bloom put out 2019's Rogue Intruder, Soul Enhancer, a perceptive set of zero-gravity breakbeat meditations that drew on Basement Jaxx, Laurel Halo and Beck. Since then, pandemic-induced school closures gave legions of young DAW warriors an excuse to polish, share, and export their productions; Oli's Stockholm peers now sell out world tours with their polarizing aura; one of the UK's biggest acts went viral by cooing into the void over Adam F. Oli has said Lick the Lens' mini-album format was inspired by K-pop, a choice that might scan as gimmicky in an earlier era of IDM, but hardly registers as such in 2025's online hodge-podge, a decade removed from PC Music's emergence. Still, it hints at a tension in appraising these songs: Behind their glossy surface aesthetic, do they work as communal pop, introverted electronica, both, or neither?

The answer, like the music, is hard to pin down. “HOODIE MUSIC” plants its hands in its pockets: Oli proclaims his own insularity (“I'm shy!”) while delirious post-dubstep chords buoy the track in the absence of percussion. With a somewhat muted presence as a vocalist, Oli doesn't quite attempt the art-school cheek of, say, the Copenhagen scene, or the koan-style writing of the drainers. Instead, he's frank and understated. Think of him as the quiet tinkerer who lights up when you ask about his favorite plugins. As he works queasy lines in between james K's gossamer melodies on “DRIFT REGALIA,” you worry he might float away into the ether like his giggly samples, heart-flutter kick patterns only briefly steadying things.

Lick the Lens — Pt. 1 prefers communicating through rhythmic uncertainty and antsy sound selection rather than more obvious structural ideas, often leaving big emotions only half-resolved before switching gears. If Actress had sought pop notoriety like so many acclaimed 2010s experimentalists, it might feel like this; for a more recent comparison, Oklou's opaque wisps of rave euphoria on choke enough come to mind. “CONSPIRACY GIRL,” with Valeria Litvakov, stutters in place for a moment of Sweet Trip-style daydreaming, eager to subside without any fanfare once it's given you something to ponder. The closest Oli gets to a song with a beltable chorus is on the Chanel Beads-featuring highlight “LOVE & POP,” which keeps its catharsis diffuse. Spunky vocal hooks (“I think I'm glued onto your back now…”) billow out behind an airlock, while impish IDM beat tricks occupy the bulk of the mix.

Oli's elated technical sugar-rush drowns out most residual apprehension, and he's assisted by a roster of other artists (five feature credits across 25 minutes) who quickly toggle in and out of view. This feels like social music, despite how pressurized and headphone-forward it is; you might imagine a group of people passing around a laptop at a party, each dragging and dropping fragments of themselves into the tracks. Oli and Ecco2k's pixie voices trade off seamlessly on “NOSEBLEED MELODY,” just a few effects-knob twitches apart, as a limber trip-hop loop broods underneath them to steal gulps of their helium. “MUTE THE WORLD” twinkles and lurches around an interpolation of Simian Mobile Disco's “Hustler,” perhaps in tribute to an earlier era of alternative-minded dance pastiche.

“[My music isn't] supposed to exist together with anything going on in this boring world,” Oli XL told CRACK magazine in 2020, expressing a desire to detach from the zeitgeist and dive into his personal rabbit holes. The space he constructs on Lick the Lens — Pt. 1 feels like a mini-world unto itself—lively, meticulous, a little claustrophobic. Edits and reworks of the new material will surely proliferate throughout the SoundCloud solar system for the next six years. Maybe the Warp association ended up slowing his career down, but with Lick the Lens, Oli's joined a long lineage of acts on the label—Prefuse 73, Rustie, FlyLo—making analogues of pop glutamate with the slanted sound-design tools of their respective eras. The dream is to scratch the right sensory itch, crafting jagged keepsakes you can share with the ones who get it.

When the sun sets in the Pacific Northwest, indigo skies push up against a treeline of prickly Douglas firs and spacious hemlocks. The region's oft-sung-about grayness turns neon, swirling together in a piercing hue of evergreen and dark blues. “It's pretty much a beware color,” Neko Case explains, having spent her formative years in Tacoma, Washington. “It's also one of the most beautiful colors.”

She revels in that scenery a little longer with Neon Grey Midnight Green, her long-awaited eighth album that translates the phenomenon into sound. When Case released 2018's Hell-On, she was brushing the ashes of her former house into a pile following a devastating fire. In the ensuing seven years since, the singer-songwriter rebuilt her home, fine-tuned her recording studio, wrote her debut memoir, The Harder I Fight the More I Love You, reacquainted herself with the New Pornographers for two albums and then some, and started penning a musical adaptation of Thelma & Louise. It's proved to be the longest gap between Case's solo albums, but she remains the same wayward musician and untamed lyricist, letting it rip straight from the soul.

Neon Grey Midnight Green is drunk on the magic of love and embracing the power of aging into yourself with each decade. Soundtracking Case's words are windswept arrangements and contagious melodies where baritone guitar, violin swells, and steady percussion crumple up feelings of dread and anxiety. It's an album that blossoms with awe. Case herself sounds overcome, a musician reinstilled with faith that the world can surprise her. When she unintentionally ends “An Ice Age” with the titular lyric and vocal melody of the Flaming Lips' “Do You Realize??,” her eyes glitter as if to ask: Are you seeing this, too?

Although it's her first entirely self-produced album, Neon Grey Midnight Green was a group effort behind the scenes. “I've always been producing my albums, but I didn't want to pretend that I was the only person doing it before,” Case told me. “This time, I just needed people to know that, yes, women can do this by themselves. And while that's true, it's fucking lonely. I never became a musician to do things by myself.”

So Case called longtime friends to play the parts she had in mind, and she hired an arranger, a composer, and 20 string players to replicate the volume of a full orchestra. “I was a sloppy crying mess at the end of the day,” she recalls. “I wanted there to be real people on every instrument and leave the sounds of people's sleeves brushing the chair or people taking breaths. I wanted all of that to celebrate the organism that is people making music together.” As a songwriter who's open about how tethered she feels to nature, Case allows the album to breathe and morph. At times, it feels like you're sitting on a rock, watching the birds and bugs crawl out from their hiding spots. “I know I can't burn this bright forever,” Case calls out at one point on “Wreck.” While that's true of everyone, listening to clarinet swirl in circles around her and a harp trickle from above, Neon Grey Midnight Green posits that maybe she will. In a way, she already has been.

As summer began winding down, Case got comfy on the couch and hopped on Zoom to discuss Neon Grey Midnight Green, the relentless loss of loved ones since her last album, how crucial observing nature is to appreciating her place in life, and more. Read a truncated version of the interview below.

Neko Case: I absolutely refused to be overtaken by despair. I wanted to remind people of their own power, that they still matter, and that resisting this weird, mechanized, grinding machine our world is turning into is important. These songs aren't about that on the nose because I like leaving them open-ended for listeners to fit themselves into the picture. So, if it brings them joy or replants them on their feet or makes them feel less alone, that's the hope: to help people feel a connection.

I also wanted to celebrate specific musicians, because music helps further that connection, and they helped me with my own. That's our greatest power as humans: our psychic connection to each other. Not the woo-woo concept, but instinct. It's worth practicing our animal connection with other people, what our gut tells us to do, and what you're fighting for in this world. It will make you feel simultaneously smaller and more powerful than before. I want to remind people of the trillion possibilities before them on a road that falsely feels like it's the only one.

It's both musicians who passed and those who are still living. During the course of making this record, people started passing away very unexpectedly. Like Donny Gerrard, who is an incredible vocalist in Mavis Staples' band and in the band Skylark. One of my first memories is hearing “Wildflower,” where his particular voice is incredible. I didn't know him well, but we've met each other over the years and worked together. He was quietly singing on things like Elton John albums that we all worship because that's the caliber of musician he was. I was surprised his death hit me so hard because we weren't close, but his kindness and presence throughout my whole life via music felt huge. Then my dear friend Dallas Good passed away suddenly, not long after Donny, and he was like family to me. I didn't know what to say about it, which I guess is why you have to make music.

Yes, absolutely. Grief gives you incredible gifts if you're willing to look it in the eyes, accept it, and feel it. Some things are private and you wanna keep it to yourself, but you don't wanna shortchange what the person meant to you either. This is the first interview I've done where I've had to try to do this, so I apologize if I'm not making sense.

My friend Kim Shattuck, from the Muffs, passed away from [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis], which was horrible. She was a huge influence on me and a beacon to look up to, as a friend, tourmate, and role model. My friend Dexter Romweber died, who was a very kind, loving, and chaotic person with a ton going on and who ended up shaping me. Dexter was in my favorite band [in Flat Duo Jets and Dex Romweber Duo] for as long as I can remember. Then Peter Moore, who mastered all my albums, died from cancer, and he was such a good friend and a kind mentor for many things. I still don't fully understand mastering, but he made it understandable for me [laughs].

My friend Diane Butler passed away, and she was the embodiment of a music lover. She was the other side: There's the musician, and then there's the person who's there to enjoy the music. Together, we completed a circuit. She ran a rescue farm for horses and other animals with her partner, and she let herself cut loose for live music. I've never met anybody who wasn't a musician who took such joy in music the way she did and showed it to that extent. And, besides that, she was a very, very, very dear friend.

It's weird to talk about everyone because some of them still don't feel gone. It takes years to understand someone is no longer physically here. So many people died during the making of this record, which maybe is just the age I'm at, but I don't feel like they're gone. Community, real community, is one of the few precious things we have left that makes a neighborhood feel like a specific place. It's where you hang out, where you take your little brother to their first concert, where you meet your life partner. When you're in a community and realize how it makes your city it, you can feel what a sacred place that is. It's always about the people.

I think it's not just sitting there waiting for things to come to you. I think it's curiosity, in the manner of going out of your comfort zone and inquiring how people are doing. Or starting a conversation with somebody who's in a very different age group than you at the supermarket. Or asking somebody if they need help. Or taking part in your community, no matter how big it is. It's just responding to someone else's humanness.

One of those things in the rock'n'roll pantheon mythology is that women are supposed to be flattered when they're a muse for a song. But they didn't ask to be made into this subject. There's so much more for women to be. I always think about Bob Dylan songs and I'm like, What an asshole. Well, I like Bob Dylan a lot, and I think he's one of the greatest songwriters of all time, but take “Sara.” That's the mother of your children and you're totally putting her on a pedestal and objectifying her, and then in the next song it's horrible shit about her. You have this platform, and she doesn't. You're just skewering her in front of people. And what can she do?

I've had friends who've had men write songs about them and they're horrible fucking people. And then the men make a million dollars off the song they wrote about them, you know? It's gross. So I think I'm always in the back of my mind going, Yeah, don't do me any fucking favors [laughs]. I wrote my own fucking song; thanks. Not that that's ever happened to me….

Well, maybe. Or I'm not really a muse-y person, perhaps.

Because I was unsupervised for so long, people weren't telling me what my relationship with nature should be. So I formed a pretty organic relationship with it, which really helped me access my human animal instincts. It made me very receptive to my role as an observer. I'm always trying to notice as much as possible. Granted, my memory is not the greatest, so I'm not always remembering everything. I'll come up with phrases that try to encapsulate the scene, and I think it made me a better observer than I might have been if I was told how to feel about nature. That's the thing: I was never told that I'm separate from nature. I felt like I reacted to it and it reacted to me.

That's why I get offended by people talking about aliens. Why be interested in something so stupid when this little tiny spider was born three days ago and in its DNA is the pattern for one of the most physically complex and incredibly strong things? After three days of existing in the world, it can do that. Of course I don't think life in other galaxies on other planets is stupid, but just the way that we view what is and isn't possible. Sometimes it's slightly racist, too, like when people decide that the Mayans didn't come up with their calendar because they got it from visitors from outer space. Like, no, they fucking didn't. They were fucking brilliant. Stop with your shit.

I love checking out the planets and hearing what they're made of, but why can't a yellow leaf be as incredible as figuring out if Pluto is a planet or not? There's room for both of those things, obviously. My feelings are hurt when people don't consider things like that. A good example is being in a cab on the way to Heathrow in London and looking at the cement divider between the lanes, seeing plants growing out of the cement, and wondering which are invasive, which are natural to the British Isles, and why could that plant grow through the concrete while others didn't. Wondering about the world at this level, which is a huge level—the one that made us all. It feels lonely sometimes to feel so much wonder and not have anyone to talk to about it.

I called my friend Tom Hagerman, who is an incredible arranger and plays in Devotchka. After giving him the bed tracks, we discussed what I wanted and how to achieve it. He's a great arranger who structured the strings in reaction to other parts I wrote. When I met with him in Denver, and the conductor, we took half a day to reduce his suggestions until it fit just right. Tom has interesting taste and is willing to go darker, more than others would be, which is why I asked him to bring that to the album. The contrast helps me hear the songs even better.

When I was younger, I thought people my age were really old, that your body doesn't work anymore, that you're done by then. It's absolutely not true. I love seeing people around me, especially the women I know, changing the narrative of what it means to be 50 and older, or even 40 and older. Menopause is like adolescence. All your chemicals change and you don't recognize yourself for a while, but then you come out of it with more self-confidence and less capacity for bullshit. It's so freeing. There's so much more room in your brain to do other things that you wanted to do. So there's part of me that wants to tell people how great it is to be 54 years old.

People ahead of me, like my stepfather who's 76, have nice things to say about their age, too. My biological father killed himself around the age that I am now. One of the reasons is that he was let go from his job for being too old, but he still knew everything from the ground up, had the old analog skills to complete tasks, and worked in the computer age. But he felt like there was no use for him, so he drank himself to death. Now, people are changing that narrative, even women I know who are going back to school to become healthcare professionals or lawyers. There's so much to live for, and I want to be a good advertisement for that, you know? Like, come on over! It's great over here!

You can play music as long as you want to. Don't believe the music industry myth that you're lucky to be here. You don't have to leave. You don't have to think I'm not attractive anymore. Who fucking cares? Like yeah, you still are, and then you can be angry that you even have to think about your attractiveness. A lot of those worries get released with age. Sure, sometimes I can't think of the word for fork while I'm holding one [laughs], but otherwise my generative brain is stronger and more nimble than it's ever been. I can't wait to try more things, and I want everyone to feel that way. I want everyone to feel so useful or nimble that they can pivot if what they're doing isn't deemed useful anymore and not take it personally. Like I said earlier, I just want to remind everyone what their power is and how much they have.

I sang that with my friend Richard Reed Parry, who was also a very close friend and colleague of Dallas. We didn't meet until after Dallas passed away, but we bonded over our love of the Everly Brothers and other things. Dallas also loved Mickey & Sylvia, who wrote “Love Is Strange,” so I thought it would be appropriate to end the record with a little Mickey & Sylvia, Everly Brothers moment.

The clicking is a Japanese toy of mine that's solar-powered. Dallas loved cats, and it's two little cats nodding their heads back and forth. So he would've loved that a Japanese cat toy was making the percussion. I worry about not doing people who've passed away justice. But you know what? I also know those people, and they'd be like, It's fine [laughs]. It does sound like an unusual clock. I should film the little toy on my desk at the studio and then post it somewhere because they really are cute.

Robert Redford, an Oscar-winning actor and director whose passion for activism led to the formation of the Sundance Institute and its formidable film festival, died this morning at his Utah home. He was 89.


	Redford's publicist, Cindi Berger, confirmed his death to Rolling Stone, but did not specify a cause. “Robert Redford passed away on Sept. 16, 2025, at his home at Sundance in the mountains of Utah — the place he loved, surrounded by those he loved,” Berger said. “He will be missed greatly. The family requests privacy.”


	“One of the lions has passed,” Meryl Streep, who starred with Redford in 1985's Out of Africa, said in a statement. “Rest in peace my lovely friend.”


	A heartthrob with a soulful spirit, Redford could easily play dreamboats who captured the collective imagination — he was a wholly credible Jay Gatsby — but there was also within him a dogged determination to seek out riskier projects that challenged him as an actor and subverted his golden-boy visage. After becoming a star in the 1970s thanks to hits that ran the gamut from expert escapism (The Sting) to topical political thrillers (All the President's Men), Redford shifted toward directing, winning Best Director for his 1980 debut, Ordinary People, before going on to helm a string of critically acclaimed dramas such as A River Runs Through It and Quiz Show. And through his nurturing of the Sundance Film Festival, he helped boost the careers of fledgling filmmakers such as the Coen brothers, David O. Russell, and Quentin Tarantino. But wherever his passions took him, he remained a Southern California kid who resisted the trappings of his lifelong stardom.

	











	“There was nothing at the end of the rainbow for me here,” Redford told Esquire in 2013 of his hometown. “Hollywood was not a place I dreamed of getting to. I never could take seriously the obsession people have about being a celebrity or getting to Hollywood — I was born next door.”

	











	Born in Santa Monica in the summer of 1936, Charles Robert Redford Jr. moved with his family to Van Nuys, California, as a boy. An unfocused student — biographer Michael Feeney Callan claimed that during Redford's high school graduation, he “sat at the back of the assembly hall, reading Mad magazine” — he went to the University of Colorado Boulder for baseball. But the arts soon occupied his time, as well as partying. Redford was kicked out after a year: “One of the reasons I was asked to leave was that I was having too much fun ,” he admitted to ThinkProgress in 2012. “ I spent too much time in the mountains, and I didn't spend enough time studying.”

	He traveled around Europe and then set his sights on New York to focus on acting, working in theater and on television. He appeared on Perry Mason, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and a TV adaptation of The Iceman Cometh, earning an Emmy nomination in 1963 for his performance in The Voice of Charlie Pont.


	By the mid-Sixties, Redford was starting to land steady film work, winning a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer – Male in 1966. One of his first major movie successes was in the adaptation of Neil Simon's play Barefoot in the Park, as the uptight newlywed Paul Brattera, a role he originated on Broadway. But he cemented his stardom with 1969's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, one of the most popular of the revisionist Westerns, which starred Redford alongside Paul Newman, who would remain one of his closest friends until his death in 2008. The two men played wisecracking outlaws who seemed to be thumbing their nose at the romantic, rose-colored notion of the Old West, and in his role as the Sundance Kid, Redford articulated his resistance to mythmaking that would become a central tenet of his career.


	He parlayed that success into a string of well-liked films, including the Western drama Jeremiah Johnson and his smash reunion with Newman, the Best Picture-winning heist film The Sting. But Redford always bristled at Hollywood fame, wanting to be sure he was still making worthwhile movies and not just star vehicles. “I started to get uncomfortable. I felt I wasn't free to do other things,” he would later say. “So I'd go to Warner Bros. and say, ‘I'd like to make a film about the election process — about how we elect somebody based on cosmetics rather than substance — and call it The Candidate.' They'd say, ‘If you do this larger film, we'll let you make it.' That allowed me to make small films within the studio system.”

	Indeed, a movie like 1972's The Candidate, in which he plays a blank slate of a senatorial hopeful, has only proved more prescient in its indictment of the American political system, and he followed it up with other films critical of the U.S. government, including All the President's Men (about the Watergate cover-up) and Three Days of the Condor (a thriller about a CIA conspiracy). His willingness to look critically at his homeland had stemmed from being challenged by Parisians while he was studying art in France in the late 1950s. “[I was] beginning to realize that there was mythology about my own country given to me — and that there was a wonderful country there, which I still believe there is — but it was a different one than the sloganeering that was going on about the country,” Redford told Democracy Now!. “And I began to see the other side of it and think. And I felt that there was a story to be told — there are really a series of good stories about what's the story beneath the story you were given about your own country.”


	Redford tried his hand at directing for 1980's Ordinary People, a chronicle of an emotionally distant family demolished by tragedy, which went on to win four Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Picture. Over the next several decades, he would continue to direct, often focusing on social and political issues such as the corrosive power of television (Quiz Show), American foreign policy (Lions for Lambs) and the shortcomings of our legal system (The Conspirator).


	In subsequent years, he continued to act, playing handsome, sensitive figures in 1980s dramas such as The Natural and Out of Africa, but he also invested his time in spreading the word about environmental issues and developing the Sundance Institute, which he launched in the early Eighties as a way to shepherd new filmmaking talent. “I thought I'd like to put something back,” he once explained, “because I had been taken with a Native American policy: When you take something out of the land, you want to put something back. So I decided to think for a while about what I could do that might generate some opportunity for somebody else.” The institute and the Sundance Film Festival have served as an incubator for promising careers for generations now, the festival remaining the annual kickoff of prestige cinema each January in Park City, Utah.


	But Redford still delivered powerful performances, most notably in the nearly silent 2013 survival story All Is Lost, in which he appeared alone onscreen as his character battles to stay afloat in a damaged boat in the middle of the ocean. But in late 2016, he hinted that he'd be retiring from acting after finishing two films: Our Souls at Night and Old Man and the Gun. In an interview with his grandson Dylan Redford, he noted, “Once they're done then I'm going to say, ‘OK, that's goodbye to all that,' and then just focus on directing.” He also expressed a desire to return to an adolescent love: painting. “At this point in my life, age 80, it'd give me more satisfaction because I'm not dependent on anybody,” he said. “It's just me, just the way it used to be, and so going back to sketching — that's sort of where my head is right now.”

	In 2002, Redford won an Honorary Oscar, and in 1994 he was bestowed the Golden Globes' Cecil B. DeMille Award for his body of work. Redford's career stands as a testament to forging one's own path, and the independent filmmakers he ushered into the world are an extension of that philosophy of questioning the cinematic status quo. 


	In a 1994 conversation with Interview, Redford proclaimed that, as a director, he preferred nuance and ambiguity to the simplicity of Hollywood commercial fare. “The art of making a film and its content are far more interesting to me than the result or impact,” he said. “Of course, you hope it has impact. In fact, I think more broadly now about what an audience requires, but I want an audience to be fascinated by the process of finding an answer, or finding out there isn't one.”

	Over the course of his nearly seven decades in Hollywood, Robert Redford extended his multigenerational influence across various sectors of the entertainment industry. The actor, who died today at the age of 89, appeared in more than 50 films, racked up an extensive list of television appearances in the Sixties, and shaped films as both a director and producer. Filmmakers, actors, and film fanatics alike are already feeling the weight and impact of his absence.


	“It hit me hard this morning when I read that Bob was gone,” Jane Fonda shared, via the New York Post. “I can't stop crying. He meant a lot to me and was a beautiful person in every way. He stood for an America we have to keep fighting for.” Fonda and Redford acted alongside each other in Barefoot in the Park. The actor was a lifelong activist whose films often amplified social and environmental causes and indicted the political system, including 1972's The Candidate and 1976's All the President's Men.


	“Robert Redford has passed away,” author Stephen King wrote on X. “He was part of a new and exciting Hollywood in the 70s and 80s. Hard to believe he was 89.” In the early Eighties, Redford launched the Sundance Institute, which put a spotlight on emerging filmmakers and storytelling that was essential, though at times overlooked. “Our film, CODA, came to the attention of everyone because of Sundance,” actress Marlee Matlin wrote on X. “And Sundance happened because of Robert Redford. A genius has passed. RIP Robert.”

	“Bob's vision of a space and a platform for independent voices launched a movement that, over four decades later, has inspired generations of artists and redefined cinema in the U.S. and around the world,” Sundance Institute spokeswoman Tiffany Duersch said in a statement, via NBC News. “Beyond his enormous contributions to culture at large, we will miss his generosity, clarity of purpose, curiosity, rebellious spirit, and his love for the creative process.”

	











	“Your art stands the test of time,” Rita Wilson wrote on Instagram. “Your love of young filmmakers and artists gave us Sundance Film Festival. You showed us the importance of nature. As a director we were able to see your art from behind the camera. You will be remembered always. And you will be missed. May your memory be eternal.” Sharing an old image of Redford, actor Colman Domingo wrote, “With love and admiration. Thank you Mr. Redford for your everlasting impact. Will be felt for generations. R.I.P.”

	Meryl Streep said in a statement via The Independent, “One of the lions has passed. Rest in peace my lovely friend.” Streep appeared alongside Redford in Out of Africa in 1985. They later reunited for Lions for Lambs, released in 2007.


	Filmmaker James Gunn shared a tribute on Instagram, writing, “I grew up with his movies: his quiet, unforced performances and ever-present grace. He was THE movie star, and will be greatly missed. Rest in Peace, Robert.” Gunn shared a list of his 10 favorite Redford films, including Three Days of the Condor, All the President's Men, The Natural, All Is Lost, and Ordinary People. Sharing a still from The Way We Were on Instagram, Rosie O'Donnell shared, “We will never be the same. Goodnight, Bob. What a legacy.”


	Antonio Banderas also paid tribute to Redford. On Instagram, the actor wrote, “Robert Redford leaves us, an icon of cinema in every sense. Actor, director, producer, and founder of the Sundance Festival. His talent will continue to move us forever, shining through the frames and in our memory. RIP.”


	On X, Ron Howard described Redford as an “artistic gamechanger,” adding that he was “a tremendously influential cultural figure for the creative choices made as an actor/producer/director & for launching the Sundance Film Festival which supercharged America's Independent Film movement.”

	“His commitment to meaningful cinema and his body of work, the scripts he choose [sic] to be a part of as an actor are deeply inspiring for many and surly for me,” Life of Pi actor Adil Hussain said on Instagram. “He didn't flow with the mainstream mania … He stood his ground firmly … He vehemently avoided Binary Story telling … He was a remarkable Artist … God bless his soul and rest in Peace dearest Robert Redford you have done enough for Humankind through cinema.”


	Fiction author and screenwriter Attica Locke shared a photo of a letter she received from Redford in May 2000, not long after she became a fellow at the Sundance Institute's Feature Filmmakers Lab in 1999. “The real reward for me in terms of Sundance is to know it has meant something to the artists,” he told her. “I'd be happy to help in any way I can. It is a good project.” In her caption, Locke wrote, “He and his institute changed my life. He walked a true artist's path. Including not only a willingness to speak out about the world but a belief that it is an imperative part of the artist's journey to use your voice. He walked his talk. And he reached out hand for those coming after him. I will carry that legacy forward.”

Luigi Mangione appeared today in New York state court in Manhattan as part of a pretrial court appearance for charges brought against him in the Dec. 4, 2024, murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione, who has pleaded not guilty to all state and federal charges against him, had his last state court appearance in February.


	During the appearance, Mangione's terrorism charges were dismissed, with Judge Gregory Carro ruling the evidence as “legally insufficient.” Mangione will still face second-degree murder charges in New York. And though his lawyers, led by attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo, wanted to have the state indictment entirely dismissed because of the simultaneous federal case against him, Carro ruled that any claim of double jeopardy is too premature.


	Mangione's motion to delay the state case was also denied. Pretrial hearings will begin on Dec. 1.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Carro ruled that state prosecutors placed too much emphasis on the phrase “revolutionary anarchism” in Mangione's writings. Carro writes: “Not only does this stretch the import of a two-word phrase beyond what it can carry, but it ignores other, more explicit excerpts from defendant's writings in which he states that his goal is to spread a ‘message' and ‘win public support' about ‘everything wrong with our health system.' Therefore, the court finds that the People failed to establish an intent to ‘influence” or ‘affect' government.”

	











	Carro went on to talk about how difficult the word “terrorism” is to define and said he does not believe the employees of a company constitute a “civilian population.” He added, “While the defendant was clearly expressing an animus toward UHC, and the health care industry generally, it does not follow that his goal was to ‘intimidate and coerce a civilian population,' and indeed, there was no evidence presented of such a goal.”

	











	In previous filings, Friedman Agnifilo argued that the multiple legal cases violate the double jeopardy clause. If the state case is not thrown out, she has asked Carro to dismiss terrorism charges against Mangione and suppress evidence obtained during his arrest at an Altoona, Pennsylvania, McDonald's on Dec. 9. His legal team claims the arrest violated his constitutional rights in an illegal search and seizure. (In his ruling, Carro revealed that in addition to a letter to the FBI a letter from Mangione addressed to his family was found.)

	In turn, the prosecution, led by Joel Seidemann, has asked the judge to force Mangione's team to reveal whether they will be providing psychiatric evidence of any “mental disease or defect” he may have in pursuit of an insanity defense. Carro today told the defense that they must comply with the prosecution's request.


	Inside the courtroom today, Mangione arrived in tan prison garb, shackled. He was mostly quiet with his head down, occasionally speaking to members of his legal team. In contrast to his last state court appearance, he did not have a bulletproof vest. As he was led out, he glanced briefly at his supporters sitting in the back row.


	About two dozen members of the public entered the courtroom to observe the hearing; most were women, with a handful of them wearing green (the color has become a symbol of support for Mangione, a reference to the Luigi character in Nintendo's Mario Bros. franchise). One woman who was in court, dressed in a bright green leopard dress with green socks and black heels, spoke with Rolling Stone after the appearance. She asked to be identified as Lena NW, and said she had flown in from Los Angeles and slept outside of the courthouse overnight in order to attend the hearing. “The terrorism charges were dropped so I was glad to hear that, but it's all still very scary and unusual for him to have both New York state and a federal charge against him for the same crime,” Lena says.

	Mangione, 27, faces multiple charges in federal court, as well as New York state and Pennsylvania state courts. One of the charges in federal court makes him eligible for the death penalty, and because of this, his legal team is fighting to get his federal trial pulled ahead of his New York state trial date.


	During Mangione's federal court appearance in April, Friedman Agnifilo revealed New York State prosecutors had told her they'd “inadvertently” listened to calls between Mangione and his legal team. Friedman Agnifilo also filed paperwork claiming that the state prosecution violated Mangione's rights under HIPAA by obtaining access to confidential, privileged information from his health insurance provider. Carro said today he has not made judgments about the legality of the Aetna subpoena, but he said state prosecutors cannot use anything from it.

	











	Additionally, Friedman Agnifilo criticized New York State prosecutors for publishing in filings excerpts from a notebook they say Mangione used as a journal to plan Thompson's murder. The notebook was allegedly found on Mangione when he was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, five days after the shooting. In the filing with the notebook excerpts, state prosecutors argued that the terrorism charges against Mangione are appropriate because, they claimed, his intent was to “violently broadcast a social and political message to the public at large.” 


	Federal prosecutors have also filed legal motions claiming Mangione “poses a continuing danger” because he has “sought to influence others.” A footnote in these filing links to a conservative website, which claims Shane Tamura, who opened fire in the NFL's Manhattan office, was following in the footsteps of Mangione. Mangione's legal team responded on Sept. 5 saying Mangione “condemns these very acts of violence that the Government is attempting to attribute as being inspired by him.”

	A Pennsylvania court has requested he appear in person for firearms-related charges on Nov. 7, although Mangione is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. His next federal court date is on Dec. 5 in Manhattan.


Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Mangione's New York state trial was expected to start Dec. 1. That is the date his pretrial hearings are scheduled to begin.

	During Cardi B‘s civil trial over claims the rapper physically assaulted a security guard, footage from the court room battle was quickly memeified thanks to Cardi's viral witness-stand interrogation.


	Along with her memorable testimony, the Grammy-winning artist was also caught on camera dozing off as the trial was underway. When appearing on The Jennifer Hudson Show in an episode aired Monday, Cardi addressed the caught-on-camera clips and fully admitted to catching a few Z's in the courtroom.


	“I'm not even going to lie, I was,” said Cardi on the talk show. “I had a long night! I'm in the middle of an album rollout. I was so sleepy, I was trying to fight it.” She added that despite trying a breathing exercise, she couldn't stay awake. 


	When host Hudson asked how she was feeling post-trial, Cardi replied, “I'm so overwhelmed.” She continued, “I'm in the middle of an album rollout, and I have to go to court. And then, when I get to court, I realize that it's going to be on national TV, being televised. It's like, ‘You've got to be kidding me' … I missed my kids' first day of school.”

	











	Earlier this month, Cardi won her civil trial over claims she assaulted a security guard during an argument on the fifth floor of a Beverly Hills medical building seven years ago, with all 12 jurors unanimously agreeing Cardi did not swing at Emani Ellis or scratch the plaintiff's face.

	While the rapper asked her supporters not to “bother” Ellis following the verdict, Cardi warned that she won't be so forgiving going forward. “The next person who tries to do a frivolous lawsuit against me, I'm going to counter-sue, and I'm gonna make you pay, because this is not OK,” she said outside the courthouse in Alhambra, California. “I am not that celeb that you sue, and you think it's going to settle. I'm not gonna settle. Especially when I'm super completely innocent. I know I got a little reputation, but I swear to God, I'm innocent.”


	Cardi's highly anticipated sophomore album, aptly titled Am I the Drama?, is set to release Sept. 19 with star-packed features from Janet Jackson, Selena Gomez, Megan Thee Stallion, Lizzo, Kehlani, Tyla, and more.

	“We are, all of us, drawn to monsters,” declares Claire Danes to start the The Beast in Me teaser, which dropped Monday. “We flirt with death to prove we're truly alive.”


	The creepy 40-second teaser captures Danes as Aggie Wiggs and Matthew Rhys as Nile Jarvis in a montage of eerie mystery scenes, filled with death investigations, blood, and … a peeping Tom? The upcoming show, set to premiere on Nov. 13 on Netflix, will follow Danes as a grieving author who has receded from public life. Her character soon finds a subject in a new neighbor, once a suspect in his wife's disappearance.


	“At once horrified and fascinated by this man, Aggie finds herself compulsively hunting for the truth – chasing his demons while fleeing her own – in a game of cat and mouse that might turn deadly,” reads a synopsis of the series.


	The show is being executive-produced by writer and showrunner Howard Gordon of Homeland fame. In an interview with Netflix's Tudum, Gordon revealed the title of the show was taken from a Johnny Cash song.

	











	“It's not as simple as it might initially seem. It really is about all of our complicity,” he said in the interview. “Whether it's Monica Lewinsky or Amanda Knox or Nile Jarvis or whatever, sometimes we are quick to make assumptions. But when we are forced to look at it from another angle, do we have the humility and the compassion to listen and to revise the narrative?”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q='unidentified+flying+objects'","Leaked UFO video raises big questions: Alien tech or foreign drone test?","https://www.floridatoday.com/story/opinion/2025/09/14/uap-video-alien-tech-drone-test-or-military-cover-up/86076327007/","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 05:23:12 GMT","

Buried in all the news this week was another congressional hearing on UFOs.

For some reason, our government now prefers the acronym UAP, which stood for Unidentified Aerial Phenomena until they changed it again Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. So, in other words, an unidentified flying object or UFO, right?

The highlight of this week's congressional hearing was a leaked military video purportedly taken by a U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper Drone showing a hellfire missile striking sphere-like object in the skies off the coast of Yemen and having little to no effect.

Having lived on the Space Coast for 24 years, I've long wondered what the military and people at NASA know about UFOs and have been surprised at the lack of information made available to the public regarding the possibility that we are not alone.

After watching the video, I was dumbfounded. Is this the smoking gun, the proof that so many have longed for? Was this finally proof that an alien invasion was imminent?

I sought out some experts in the field.

Author, researcher and filmmaker Mike Ricksecker, who's been featured on the History Channel's “Ancient Aliens and The UnXplained” shows, called the release of the video footage an ""astonishing revelation.""

But he had questions similar to mine.

""First of all, why was the drone firing upon the sphere?"" he said. ""Did someone authorize the firing of the missile or was this simply automatic by the drone?""

I spoke to a family member who served several tours in Afghanistan and he told me there is a chain of command and permission needed before a Hellfire Missile is fired.

""Was there any attempt at communication? Was there some sort of perceived threat and, if so, what was that threat?"" Ricksecker added.

""I believe those are the most pertinent questions, but upon seeing this footage we also have to ask ourselves, what sort of technology could cause this result? The Hellfire Missile was designed for anti-armor attacks and is able to destroy any known armored vehicle in the world, and it lost. The target, while it seemed to lose a few bits and veered from its course momentarily, rebounded almost immediately and kept going. That's not a known technology we have here on Earth ... unless something else is being hidden from us, militarily or otherwise.""

Was it finally time to build my bunker in the backyard? Were the monsters really due on Maple Street?

Not so fast, says Adam Frank, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester whose research delves into Theoretical Astrophysics, and in particular the hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic evolution of matter.

Frank said there are way too many unknowns to make any sort of scientific declaration based on what he described as a ""grainy video with blobs on it that comes with a predigested story.""

""If you really want to know what it is, you've got to do a proper investigation of it,"" he said. ""That means knowing what time of day is it? What instrument is being used? Where is the sun when this is happening? Right now that can't be answered. We're just given this thing and we're told it's an amazing mystery.""

The other thing to take into account, Frank said, was that the object was not moving very fast since Hellfire Missiles are used mainly to attack stationary or slower-moving objects like tanks and helicopters.

But the biggest takeaway from my discussion with Frank was something I hadn't noticed on the video or even considered. The missile never detonated.

""It's not like you see the missile hit whatever the thing was and explode in a giant explosion and then the thing propagates away from it like in one of those science fiction movies,"" Frank said.

""It looks like it's a glancing blow right which means that the targeting wasn't that great. What you see is the missile's trajectory changes like it it clearly knocks into something and it diverts the path. You see it move, so this is not some kind of super alien technology which is impervious to anything, it kind of behaves like you might expect something to behave if it got a glancing blow from a fast moving object.""

OK, so maybe it's not from outer space. But what the heck is it?

Florida Congresswoman and chair of Declassification of Federal Secrets Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, wants to know as well. She has been calling on the government to be more transparent when it comes to these types of things.

""From Roswell to the coast of Jacksonville, the sightings of UFO's have rarely been explained by the people who have first-hand accounts of these situations,"" she said last year.

""This is largely due to the lack of transparency by our own government and the failure of our elected leaders to make good on their promises to release explanations and footage and mountains of classified documents that continue to be hidden from the American people.""

I've only recently come across the term “Peer State Adversary,” meaning a country with similar technology as ours that is adversarial. We used to call them enemies. Anyway, more likely than an alien spacecraft, the object on the video could be a drone operated by one of those adversarial countries. And if that's the case, Frank explains, the military would have good reason to keep tight-lipped about it.

For example, Frank said, what if a country like China or Iran was testing the camera-spoofing technology of an experimental drone? Our military leaders would not want to tip their hand and reveal to those nations what we know about them.

OK, makes sense.

“As somebody who studies the possibility of life in the universe professionally, I would love if we found aliens,"" Frank said. ""That would answer the question I've been interested in my whole life. But there's just nothing there to be able to make that giant leap without the right kind of scientific evidence.""

I gotta admit being relieved after speaking with Frank. The bunker can wait, for now.

Chinese social media was abuzz with speculation over the weekend after footage appeared to show missiles being fired at unknown objects in the night sky.

Local media reports were unable to identify the intended targets, which they called ""unidentified flying objects"" (UFO), but bright flashes caught on camera pointed to successful interceptions by the Chinese military in the eastern province of Shandong.

China's ongoing military buildup is one the most opaque in the world, with much of the tender process kept secret and its true defense spending still a big unknown despite publicly stated figures. On paper, it has the second-largest budget in the world behind the United States.

The Chinese government has placed a premium on the secrecy of its top military programs. It recently tightened the rules around so-called state secrets to govern what members of the public are permitted to share online—after images of its newest aircraft carrier continually appeared on social media sites in the West.

However, the lack of transparency in China fuels speculation surrounding unusual events—especially those potentially involving the military—where official explanations are often withheld or delayed and an information vacuum leads to the spread of disinformation, including about extraterrestrial life.

The Chinese Defense Ministry did not respond to an emailed request for comment outside of office hours.

Footage shared by residents in the coastal city of Weifang showed a flaming projectile tearing through the sky at approximately 9 p.m. local time on Friday. The unknown object collides with another moving object arriving from the opposite direction, exploding in a bright flash of light.

Residents described hearing a thunderous noise that rattled their windows, a local news outlet said, while one man filming on his cellphone said a ""missile"" had been launched.

CCTV footage shared to Weibo, China's largest social media website, appeared to show at least two suspected missiles launched five minutes apart from the same site and following a similar trajectory before exploding in the sky.

It was not immediately clear what the missiles had impacted. A spokesperson for Weifang city's emergency management agency said he was not aware of the incident. The provincial Emergency Management Department in Shandong did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

On Weibo, where the trending topic generated over 150 million views as of Tuesday, speculation by netizens ranged from an alien UFO to an unauthorized drone or incoming meteorite.

While Chinese officials have yet to clarify the incident—and may never—the probability that it was part of a military training event, specifically an air defense drill, remains high.

On September 11, China's Maritime Safety Administration issued navigational warnings for two live-fire areas in the southern Bohai Sea, off the coast of Weifang and near the city's Weibei artillery test range. The firing exercise was scheduled to last from 4 p.m. on September 12 to midnight on September 14.

""Flying this slowly, it must be a drone,"" one Weibo user wrote.

""The military is conducting training. No need to make a fuss,"" another said.

A third netizen said: ""We weren't supposed to know about it.""

A fourth added: ""Awesome, no matter what it is. A 100 percent interception rate.""

Did China successfully engage a UFO or is there a different explanation?

Did China successfully take down a UFO?

Buckle up because we have a wild video to share.

As we've discussed many times before, there are few things on the internet that spark interest in the way UFO coverage does.

People are fascinated by the topic, and the fact we have so few actual answers is a major reason for the intrigue.

That now includes some wild footage out of China.

CCTV footage out of China that is going viral online appears to show an object getting obliterated by air defense systems in Shandong, China.

Newsweek reports local media wasn't able to identify the object that was hit, but the video shows a clear impact from a missile.

Check out the video below, and we'll then break it down. Make sure to send me your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.

Newsweek further reported very little information has come out about the incident from last Friday, but it's believed that multiple missiles were fired from an air defense system.

Now, does this mean a little green alien got vaporized by a Chinese SAM? No. It could have been a drone, it could have been a military test or something else. I find it really hard to believe it was a meteor as some are speculating online.

That would require the missile to likely punch out to a much higher altitude than what is seen in this video. Is it possible, in theory, a SAM could take down a meteor? Maybe, but I'd be *HIGHLY* skeptical.

The reality is that we don't know what the object is, and probably won't find out because China's government is notoriously secretive. The dirty communists don't like telling the world anything.

What we do know is the United States government recently made public a video that is way more troubling. Congress released a video showing a missile striking an unknown object…..and then failing to destroy it.

What do you think is the truth behind the video? Let me know at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.

 by Marshall Griffin | Sep 16, 2025



Southwest Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison is accusing the federal government of “actively blocking” information on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), formerly referred to as UFO's.

“Look, I (have) not jumped to the conclusion that I believe that there are, you know, aliens coming from another planet. But I'm open to that,” Burlison said. “I think that it's our responsibility, especially when we're seeing that we have a government that is blocking, actively blocking information from us.”

Burlison made those comments during a U.S. House Oversight Committee meeting last week. During that meeting, he presented video of a military drone attempting to shoot down a glowing “orb” last year off the coast of Yemen.

Burlison also asked Dylan Boreland, an Air Force veteran who worked in geospatial intelligence, about whether he's seen evidence of extraterrestrial technology.

“Have you been exposed to undeniable confirmation of N-H-I technology?” he asked. “And then my second question is, is BAE Systems involved in any way with reverse engineering exploitation of Non-Human Intelligence craft?”

Boreland responded, “We're going to have to have a conversation for that, whether I'm legally even allowed to answer that and whether you're even allowed to hear it, sir.”

BAE Systems is an aerospace security company based in London.

Following a separate congressional hearing in 2023, Burlison said, “In my opinion I think it's either angels or it's manmade,” and “I think the most likely explanation is that it's manmade.”

 The Safe Airspace for Americans Act is a legislative proposal aimed at enhancing the reporting and analysis of incidents involving unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) in the context of aviation. Here are the key points regarding what the bill intends to implement:



 The bill mandates the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to:



 The FAA Administrator will coordinate with various other federal agencies to implement the bill, including the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and others, to optimize the reporting and investigation processes.



 All reports and archived information related to UAP incidents are to be shared with the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office within the Department of Defense to facilitate a broader understanding and response to these phenomena.



 The bill includes provisions to protect individuals who report UAP incidents:



 Within 180 days of the bill's enactment, the FAA is required to implement a communications strategy to:



 The FAA will also need to establish a specific reporting system, which may either integrate with the existing Aviation Safety Reporting Program or create a new system specifically for UAP. Any system developed must allow for detailed reporting, including descriptions of the phenomena and their behaviors.



 The bill provides definitions for key terms:



 The bill concludes with a statement reflecting the views of Congress, emphasizing the importance of reporting UAP encounters and advocating for the reduction of stigma associated with these reports.

TravelAwaits

Our mission is to serve the 50+ traveler who's ready to cross a few items off their bucket list.

When someone asks me which US state is worth visiting, West Virginia is one of the first that comes to mind.

A fantastic excursion in the New River Gorge left a strong impression on me, as did the state's winding country roads. As a travel writer, I also love the state's new tourism projects. Last year, I covered a series of pre-planned road trips, called Mountain Rides, released by the state tourism board.

That same year, they also released a Halloween-themed road trip itinerary that covers the state's 21 spookiest locations, called the Paranormal Trail. It's back again in 2025—and it's easier than ever to join thanks to their unique 2025 West Virginia Paranormal Trail Passport. Those who complete the challenge will even receive a prize that consists of a personalized lantern. (Other prizes include holographic stickers and keychains.)

Here's how to take part in the 2025 West Virginia Paranormal Trail.



Starting on October 1, 2025, you can visit 21 locations around the state. Using geolocation tools, you can confirm your presence with a ‘check-in' feature. In short, you show up, learn about the haunted location in question, and then mark down that you visited. You can do a check-in within .25 miles of the location, in case you have trouble with service.

Some locations unlock certain rewards, like the stickers and keychains listed above. The grand prize for those who visit all 21 locations is a personalized lantern. All prizes are exclusive to the 2025 Paranormal Trail.

You'll receive an email from the West Virginia Department of Tourism to confirm your receipt of exclusive gifts and to get a delivery address. You can earn up to four rewards. Here's how the prizes work:



Head to the Paranormal Trail page and scroll down to the button that says ‘get your pass'. You'll be prompted to enter your information, including an email and phone number. Both will help the state's tourism department track you down and deliver your gifts. You'll receive an email with instructions on how to get started.

I also suggest checking out the interactive map on the Paranormal Trail page. It includes funky icons that showcase West Virginia's 21 haunted locations on the trail. You can click on each to get a quick rundown of the legends and locations in question.

As a traveler with a love for ghost tours, I went through the whole list just for fun—but the map will also help you put together a short road trip. Many locations are only a short drive away, meaning you can still take part in the Paranormal Trail and earn a few prizes even if you don't spend a whole weekend crisscrossing the state to visit each site.

Southwest Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison is accusing the federal government of “actively blocking” information on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), formerly referred to as UFO's.

“Look, I (have) not jumped to the conclusion that I believe that there are, you know, aliens coming from another planet. But I'm open to that,” Burlison said. “I think that it's our responsibility, especially when we're seeing that we have a government that is blocking, actively blocking information from us.”

Burlison made those comments during a U.S. House Oversight Committee meeting last week. During that meeting, he presented video of a military drone attempting to shoot down a glowing “orb” last year off the coast of Yemen.

Burlison also asked Dylan Boreland, an Air Force veteran who worked in geospatial intelligence, about whether he's seen evidence of extraterrestrial technology.

“Have you been exposed to undeniable confirmation of N-H-I technology?” he asked. “And then my second question is, is BAE Systems involved in any way with reverse engineering exploitation of Non-Human Intelligence craft?”

Boreland responded, “We're going to have to have a conversation for that, whether I'm legally even allowed to answer that and whether you're even allowed to hear it, sir.”

BAE Systems is an aerospace security company based in London.

Following a separate congressional hearing in 2023, Burlison said, “In my opinion I think it's either angels or it's manmade,” and “I think the most likely explanation is that it's manmade.”

There might be habitable planets, but civilizations alive at the same time are few and far between.

Earth is pretty special, and as far as we know, the only place in the universe with life. But how special is it really? There are billions upon billions of planets in the Milky Way alone; shouldn't life be common? Maybe, but even if life is common, how common are advanced civilizations? Some new work argues that the answer is: pretty rare.

The new research comes from Dr Manuel Scherf and Professor Helmut Lammer of the Space Research Institute at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Graz. They considered the composition of the atmosphere and the geology of a planet and came to a concerning realization. Statistically, there might be just a handful of civilizations in the galaxy. The closest might be 33,000 light-years away, and that civilization is at least 280,000 years, if not millions of years old. 

""Extraterrestrial intelligences – ETIs – in our galaxy are probably pretty rare,"" Scherf said in a statement.

Their reasoning is this. If Earth is a reasonable model for intelligent life, a planet needs to be in the habitable zone, start with a significant amount of carbon dioxide to build a biosphere, and then get enough oxygen for technology. Crucial to the reduction of carbon dioxide are life and plate tectonics, which can sequester the carbon inside the planet over eons.

On Earth, it took over 3 billion years for intelligent life to evolve. The planet went from having at least 6 percent carbon dioxide in its atmosphere to a fraction of a percent, as more was trapped by tectonic plates. Maybe in one billion years, there won't be enough to make photosynthesis happen. 

Oxygen went up dramatically thanks to photosynthetic organisms, reaching today's level of 21 percent in an atmosphere dominated by nitrogen (78 percent). But for the smelting of metal, assuming that to be a crucial part of technology development, it can't be done if oxygen is below 18 percent.

A planet with an atmosphere that starts at 10 percent carbon dioxide could have a stable biosphere for 4.2 billion years. At 1 percent, for about 3 billion years. Then you consider how long intelligent life takes to evolve and how long a civilization lasts. Statistically, this data can tell us that if we want two civilizations to be alive at the same time, they would need to exist for at least 280,000 years.

            

""For 10 civilisations to exist at the same time as ours, the average lifetime must be above 10 million years,"" says Scherf. ""The numbers of ETIs are pretty low and depend strongly upon the lifetime of a civilisation.""

If this work is correct, does this mean we shouldn't look for them? The researchers think quite the opposite.

""Although ETIs might be rare there is only one way to really find out and that is by searching for it,"" says Scherf. ""If these searches find nothing, it makes our theory more likely, and if SETI does find something, then it will be one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs ever achieved as we would know that we are not alone in the universe.""

The study was presented at the EPSC–DPS2025 Joint Meeting in Helsinki last week.

	Eau Claire's Chad Lewis journeys from Bayfield's ghostly guestrooms to Two Harbors' sea-serpent sightings

There is no end to tales about Lake Superior, from deeply spiritual creation stories of the people who first lived along its shores thousands of years ago, to that incredible fish that an annoying relative won't stop talking about. Many have a message or moral, but some defy explanation of occurrences on the “Big Lake” and can't be explained scientifically — or that can be, and we simply haven't figured it out. 

“I always encourage people to go to these places and see for yourself,” said Chad Lewis of Eau Claire, author of “Supernatural Lake Superior.” “If you put science to use while you're there, combining it with folklore, you're going to have a fun road trip.”

Lewis joined WPR's Robin Washington on “Morning Edition” to talk about stories he's collected in his latest book. 

Get trustworthy reporting and unique local stories from WPR delivered directly to your inbox.

The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Robin Washington: What makes these stories particular to Lake Superior, rather than being urban legends that are told about any body of water? I know you've searched for the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland, yet she apparently has cousins all over the world, including Lake Superior.

Chad Lewis: There's something magical about Lake Superior. People feel drawn to it, whether it's on a vacation or they feel like they just have to move there and live on the lake. And that's been going since the first Indigenous peoples that set up camps around the lake when there were much safer places they could have chosen. There was something about the lake, a mysterious pull, which also seems to be more of a paranormal beacon for weirdness to take place.

RW: What can you tell us about our local sea serpent?

CL: I spoke with a gentleman in Two Harbors who was at his dentist's office, which happens to have a wonderful overlook of the lake. He saw what he thought looked like dolphins in the water with their dorsal fins. So he got up, took a closer look, and realized they weren't fins, but the humps of a giant lake monster. And as he tried to get his camera out, it simply submerged into the water and vanished. He believed he had seen either an unknown species or one that we think is extinct, but maybe it's not quite extinct.

RW: Is it possible he could have just had too much novocaine? I have read that mermaid sightings over the last millennia turned out to be attributed to manatees — that if you see the back half of a manatee and you're fantasizing about the front half, you can put a mermaid together.

CL: Yes, and mermaid stories are a bit different. We do have one from Lake Superior going back to the 1700s, of what appeared to be a young boy sitting on a rock with a mermaid-like tail. But I think mermaids kind of stretch the belief systems of a lot of people. 

RW: Do you have stories from the Wisconsin side?

CL: The most common question I receive is, “Where can I go to spend the night in a haunted place?” And if you have that macabre sense of adventure, you're in luck because in Wisconsin, we have all sorts of haunted lodging options. One of my favorites is Greunke's First Street Inn in Bayfield. It's old. It's historic, one of the oldest buildings in Bayfield, and they believe there are many spirits there. 

Guests will come in and claim that when they've been out for the day on the lake, they'll come back and the room's been rearranged. They'll see apparitions of people that they think are fellow guests, but who simply vanish into a wall or disappear right before their eyes. They often ask the staff, “This is going to sound strange, but have you ever heard of anybody reporting this?” And the staff have to gently tell them, “Yes, we have a long history of ghostly, spooky stories.”

RW: My early career was in science journalism, and a hallmark of science and journalism is skepticism. As you've searched the paranormal, particularly on Lake Superior, what spooky situations have you debunked?

CL: My background is in psychology, so I'm always looking at why people believe in these stories. What is it about belief systems that make people believe they've seen a UFO or an unidentified creature in the woods?

One of the stories of Lake Superior is the old Bete Grise singing sands. It holds that a woman lost her lover to the sea, and she was so heartbroken that she waited every day on the beach for her lost love to return. And you can go out to the beach and hear the sand singing. Then science steps in and says, no, it's the shape and the exact size of the sand that kind of squeaks as you step on it. So even though people believe that it's the woman in the sand crying out for her lost love, science says it's a little bit different.

RW: That reminds me of a story about the writer James Thurber, who was famously nearsighted. He was once looking at a window and saw a cute puppy sitting there. He knew it was actually a paper bag and if he put on his glasses, he would confirm it was a paper bag. But it was much more fun to have a cute puppy in the window. Is that what you're saying?

CL: Exactly. I can't tell you whether these things are real or if they're actually happening, but to the witnesses, they believe that it actually happened. For me, half the fun is just exploring these places, getting caught up in the moment, enjoying the folklore, really soaking in the whole legend and atmosphere of the entire lake. It adds a little more mystery and fun to any adventure.

I'm not going to lie, I love a good conspiracy theory, and I think I found one.

I was wasting time scrolling through TikTok the other day when I came across a weird video of strange lights in the Montana sky. I decided to read the comments, and several folks were talking about something called ""Project Blue Beam"".

Now, I had no idea what that was, but the internet is a wonderful thing, because no matter what you're searching for, you can not only find it, but also find out a bunch of information regarding it.

So, if you're like me and have no idea what Project Blue Beam is, let me get you up to date.

Project Blue Beam is a conspiracy theory that was started by a Canadian named Serge Monast, who passed away back in the mid-90s. Mr. Monast believed that at some point, the government would fake an attack by aliens to scare other countries into joining a ""New World Order"" form of government.

Many dismissed him as crazy; however, once all of these strange lights started appearing in the sky over the last couple of years, new life was given to his theory.

So, the question is, are there aliens, or is it all a government hoax?

It should be noted that Montana has been in the middle of a couple of alien sightings over the years, and let's be honest, if you were going to fake an alien invasion, I'm not sure Montana would be the best place. I mean, wouldn't you want to choose a place with a bigger population to get the whole scare factor?

Plus, I can't speak for you, but it's hard for me to believe that we're the only living beings in the entire Universe. I mean, if I were an alien and I had the chance to go watch other species, I think I would do it.

Wouldn't you?

So which is it? Are these strange lights over Montana actual aliens? Some sort of Government takeover? Or, someone messing around with AI? We know that the government has stated that they have artifacts that are not of this world that have been used in different ""crafts"".

Is that true, or all part of this Project Blue Beam?

What do you think? Do you believe in aliens? Do you think they are watching us, or do you think all of these ""strange sightings"" are nothing more than some sort of plot to control us?

Indeedee arrives during Psychic Spectacular 2025!

Psychic Spectacular: Taken Over is focused around both the release of Indeedee and Team Rocket's continued attempts to control Pokémon Go.

As is tradition, this means changes to the Team Rocket Grunts, Leaders and Giovanni team lineups. There's also a Psychic Spectacular: Taken Over Collection Challenge and selection of research tasks to complete.

Though you're probably more interested in making some headway on the Psychic Spectacular: Taken Over Special Research quest to catch your own Shadow Incarnate Forme Tornadus!

On this page:

Gathering Shadows is the Psychic Spectacular: Collection Challenge, so you need to complete it before 8pm (local time) passes on Sunday 21st September. Not doing so means you'll miss out on these Pokémon Go rewards.

The trick with this Collection Challenge is that the Pokémon can only be obtained by defeating the correct Team Rocket Grunt. Yes - this is a Shadow Pokémon Collection Challenge!

Here's all of the Pokémon in the Gathering Shadows Collection Challenge and how to get them:

Rewards: 8,000 XP and one Rocket Radar.

Here are the Psychic Spectacular: Taken Over field research tasks in Pokémon Go:




The Psychic Spectacular: Taken Over has brought a new Team Rocket quest where you'll face Giovanni again and the release of Indeedee.

You can now catch Dynamax Pokémon through Max Battles. First, however, you need to visit Power Spots to collect Max Particles and complete the To the Max! quest.

Don't forget to try out Routes, Gift Exchange and Party Play while you're hunting down rare Pokémon, fighting in the Go Battle League or competing in PokéStop Showcases.




Indeedee has debuted and we've got a whole guide on how to get Indeedee in Pokémon Go where we also take a look at shiny Indeedee. Take the time to add Indeedee to your collection - its male and female forms have distinct differences. Best of all, however, shiny Indeedee has also been released!

With changes to the Team Rocket team lineups comes a selection of new Shadow Pokémon:

Here are the Pokémon appearing more frequently in the wild during the Psychic Spectacular: Taken Over event:

Any 5km egg you collect during the Psychic Spectacular event will contain the following Pokémon:

The Groudon Shadow Raid Weekend is also running during the Psychic Spectacular: Taken Over event - namely from Saturday 20th September at 6am (local time) to Sunday 21st September at 10pm (local time).

Shadow Groudon will be appearing in 5-Star Shadow Raids during this time and you'll be able to earn an additional Raid Pass per day by spinning a Gym's Photo Disc. (So that's two extra Raid Passes.)

There's also a pay-to-play ticket at $4.99 or the equivalent pricing tier in your local currency. It will allow you to collect five additional Raid Passes from Gyms, earn 50% more XP and double Stardust from winning a raid.

Hope you enjoy the Psychic Spectacular: Taken Over event!

Hello again, Pokéfriends! It was only about a month that we had our last GO Rocket Takeover Event, but the next one is already here! So let's dive RIGHT into the analysis on which ones you want to grind for, and for which Leagues… right after our customary Bottom Line Up Front, of course!

Alright, on to the detailed analysis!



Well, as is tradition, I think we're obligated to begin with the new Legendary. In this case, that means Shadow TORNADUS, specifically the Incarnate Forme. But while the Therian Forme comes with at least a little intrigue, as I've noted in the past… well, far less so for Incarnate. And while Shadow is an improvement… well, not by much, adding exactly one win in Ultra (Shadow Annihilape) to only TWO other sure-fire wins (Virizion and Gastrodon). And while I ALSO usually advocate for keeping new Shadow Legendaries in Great League, and I guess I would say the same in this case too, there is zero reason to use it. Basically any other Flyer that hits 1500 CP is going to be better. And that's not just hyperbole… it is quite literally the lowest ranked Flyer in Great League.

So sure, get it if you want, but honestly you'd probably be fine pocketing the Super Rocket Radar if you want to save it for something else down the line.

Interestingly, I think I got more comments in this batch of new Shadows about the Balloon Pokémon, QWILFISH, than anything else, especially right after this Rocket Takeover was announced.

Well, the best I can say for Shadow Qwilfish in the end is that it's a sidegrade… at best. In the standard 1v1 shielding scenarios, ShadowQwil performs slightly worse than non-Shadow, uniquely beating Gastrodon, Greninja, Shadow Altered Giratina, Shadow Annihilape, and Dedenne, but dropping big names like Drapion, Feraligatr, Golisopod, Primeape, Gyarados, and Cradily in the process. Overall, gonna call those losses more impactful in today's meta than the new wins.

Shadow is also undone with shields down, gaining Azumarill, -Moltres, and now Gatr and Golis, but losing Carbink, Tinkaton, Togekiss, Talonflame, Gyarados, and Shadow Anni that non-Shadow can outlast instead. Doesn't seem worth the tradeoff, does it?

Where Shadow does get a leg up is in 2v2 shielding, losing Drap, Carbink, G-Molt, and Golis, but look at the gains: Shadow Anni, Blastoise, Cradily, Dedenne, Diggersby, Dunsparce, Forretress, Furret, Shadow Gyarados, Shadow Scizor, and Tinkaton. That's a swing of +7 wins! Not bad… not bad at all. But is it enough to spring for the Shadow? I don't know that I would necessarily abandon my steady non-Shadow for it outright, but having both in your arsenal moving forward seems like a good idea to me.

Spoiler alert: there's only Shadow on this list that overall seems demonstratively worse, proving that after years of trying to make CLAYDOL competitive and finally succeeding, one more tweak may just be too much.

Yes, turns out Claydol needs all the bulk it can get, as ShadowDol, while still viable, is just a worse version of the original. Through brute force it CAN power through new wins like Diggersby, Shadow Galarian Weezing, Shadow Dusclops, and even Lapras. But it just gives up too much to do it, with Shadow Anni, Shadow A-Tina, ShadowNite, ShadowZard, Talonflame, Gastrodon, and Azumarill all now able to fend it off. Noooooot great.

And other even shield scenarios are even a bit worse than that, with Shadow gaining Corviknight and Primeape in 2shield, but dropping Diggs, Azu, Blastoise, Togekiss, and Wigglytuff. And with sbields down, while Shadow scratches out new wins over Lapras and Cradily, ALL of the following escape Shadow but fall to non-Shadow: Charizard, Diggersby, Empoleon (ouch!), Gyarados, Primeape, and Scizor.

I'm not saying I wouldn't scoop up Shadow Baltoy to evolve if I saw them… but I think I AM saying this is probably your lowest priority of this group.

…well, aside from Tornadus.

Poor Tornadus.

I almost completely forgot about MILOTIC, who snuck in as one of the new Rocket Leader Pokémon. Yes, it remains gorgeous, especially as a shiny, and I have been a proponent for Millie's use in PvP in the past. It SHOULD be better these days with Wrap now in the mix, solving its long-standing problem of lacking a decent second charge move. But that positive change just hasn't really materialized yet. in Great, Ultra, or especially Master Leagues.

Now, being a Shadow DOES help, but sadly I don't think it will be nearly enough. Great League shows slight overall improvement, but it's really more of a sidegrade, with Shadow powering through Azumarill, Bastiodon, Dragonite, G-Moltres, Shadow Empoleon (now that one IS impressive!), Feraligatr, Stunfisk, and Shadow Tina… but non-Shadow stays close with its own unique wins versus G-Corsola, Dusclops, Dunspace, ShadoWak, Shadow Gary, and Blastoise.

The improvement is a more encouraging curve in Ultra League, but the ceiling remains worryingly low. Lots of new gains with Crustle, Shadow Gary, Jirachi, Nidoqueen, Primeape, Florges, Kommo-o, Armored Mewtwo, Turtonator, and Zygarde, and now losses to only Dragonite, Feraligatr, Gastrodon, and Guzzlord, so maybe Millie can do a little damage here. But a 40% winrate is only eye-catching in all the wrong ways. I wish I had better news, I really do!

Perhaps our biggest clearcut winner in this grouping is an old PvP favorite that has finally risen back to some prominence this season after a long slumber: ALTARIA works really well as a Shadow, folks. It's never a straight upgrade, but overall? Yeah, I think I can safely label it a seeming upgrade, with a positive win differential in all even shield scenarios.

First off, the standard 1v1 shield, with the now-standard Dragon Breath/Sky Attack/Flamethrower moveset. (Yes, Moonblast is still in the mix too, and perhaps even the improved Dragon Pulse, but I think Sky Attack is the default #1 and Flamethrower provides the most useful and now common coverage move.) Regular Altaria is looking fine, of course, but the new Shadow Altaria has a net gain of two wins, beating Shadow Dragonite, Shadow Steelix and Empoleon (Flamethrower putting in work!), Galarian Moltres, Stunfisk, and Blastoise, while surrendering only Morpeko, Primeape, Shadow Scizor, and sometimes Clodsire in exchange.

2shield results are close, with Shadow bagging Stunfisk, Regidrago, and the Shadow variants of Charizard, Giratina, and Annihilape, while non-Shadow settles for Talonflame, Clodsire, Shadow Quagsire, and Shadow Empoleon instead. But with shields removed, Shadow Altaria shines brightly with unique wins against Galarian Corsola, Jellicent, ShadowQuag, Cradily, Stunfisk, Talonflame, and now Clodsire as well, having to give away only Empoleon, Togekiss, and Furret that non-Shadow clings to instead.

So clearly you want Shadow Altaria… but do you perhaps want even more than one? Remember that it also has Peck, majorly buffed this season. Does that have any play? If we shift the Dragon damage to charge moves with Dragon Pulse and leave our Flying damage now to the fast move… well, it works, but is a bit less ideal, with losses that slip through now like Jellicent, Morpeko, Corviknight, and even Shadow Annihilape. However, Shadow with that Peck/Dragon Pulse/Flamethrower moveset tracks a LOT closer to Dragon Breath Shadow Altaria… at least in 1v1 shielding, dropping ShadowNite, Stunfisk, and Blastoise to instead gain Togekiss and Primeape. However, don't get TOO excited, as other even shield scenarios are less kind. (See 0shield, which IS strictly worse, and 2shield, which isn't much better. 😬)

So yeah, I suppose you can spring for a second Shadow Altaria (with Peck) and hold only it in case, but Dragon Breath remains the pretty clear go-to.

That just leaves ZWEILOUS. With buffs this season to Dragon Breath and Body Slam, it's enjoying a nice little PvP renaissance for anyone who's been paying attention. Does getting the Shadow treatment help it?

…well, no. It gains Gastrodon, but loses ALL of the following: Charjabug, Clodsire, Cradily, Diggersby, Shadow Empoleom, Shadoe Gyarados, Lapras, ShadoWak, Galarian Moltres, and Stunfisk. Ouch!

Now in fairness, things are not nearly as brutal across the board. In 2v2 shielding, Shadow sits right in line with non-Shadow, trading away Clodsire, Diggersby, and Empoleon to beat Regidrago and Shadow Empoleon instead. And with shields down, while non-Shadow outlasts Shadow Annihilape, Feraligatr, Lapras, Blastoise, and Corviknight, Shadow Zweilous is right there with wins instead versus Shadow Dragonite, Shadow Empoleon, Gastrodon, Duslcops, and Charjabug. So it's not ALL bad, just… well, those 1shields are scary, I gotta say. Hold me back from making a hearty endorsement here.

So perhaps we should evolve it instead? Because while Zweilous seems to be having a mostly under the radar resurgence, nobody has seriously considered HYDREIGON in PvP, and certainly not in Great League, of all places. Because while Zweilous has decent bulk (in the same range as Regidrago and Goodra), Hydreigon's bulk in Great League is down in Dragonite/Garchomp/Druddigon/Alolan Exeggutor territory. But lo and behold, the reworked Drago Breath and Dragon Pulse have been a boon even for Great League Hydreigon this season. And unlike Zweilous, which at least somewhat relies on its bulk and therefore stumbles a bit as a Shadow, Hydreigon thrives on it, with new wins like Cradily, Golisopod, Lapras, ShadoWak, Shadow Empoleon, and Corviknight, though it does drop Morpeko, Drapion, and Dragonite to get there. 2v2 shielding is another close parallel between Shadow and non-Shadow, but with shields down, Shadow Hydra leaves the non-Shadow in the dust, gaining Shadow Anni, ShadowZard, Shadow Tina, G-Moltres, Feraligatr, Blastoise, and Dunsparce while giving away only Cradily, Diggersby, and Empoleon.

And unlike most everything else covered above, Hydreigon has play beyond Great League as well. In Ultra League, the split is similar to the GL results in 1v1 shielding (Shadow beats Talonflame, ShadowZard, ShadowGary, Kommo-o, Cresselia, Feraligatr, and G-Moltres, while non-Shadow instead defeats Lapras, Blastoise, Empoleon, Jirachi, and SScizor) and with shields down (non-Shadow‘s unique wins are only Blastoise, Feraligatr, and SScizor, but Shadow instead overcomes Zygarde, Dragonite, Lugia, Nidoqueen, ShadowGatr, Empoleon, Lapras, Venusaur, and Cradily).

And yes, even all the way up in Master League, Hydreigon currently looks just okay. But give it the Shadow treatment, and HOLY CRAP it looks like a brutal beast! In 1v1 shielding, we have a strictly better situation on our hands, folks, with NO new losses and ALL of the following flipping to potential wins: Groudon, Ho-Oh, Lugia, Origin Dialga, Origin Palkia, Kyurem White, Reshiram, Zekrom, and Zygarde Complete! 😱

Now before you go and max out the first Shadow Hydreigon you get your mitts on, let me pump the breaks just a bit, as things are not quite as rosy outside of 1v1 shielding. In 2shield, Shadow Hydra drops Metagross, Reshiram, Zekrom, and Kyurem Black and White en route to losing two wins off the record as compared to non-Shadow (with Shadow's gains being Melmetal, Lugia, and Zygarde instead), and things are particularly brutal with shields down, where non-Shadow is able to knock out Metagross, Melmetal, Ho-Oh, and Dusk Mane, as compared to Shadow‘s sole unique win versus Lunala.

So yes, Shadow Hydreigon IS good, and worthy of consideration across the board. Perhaps YOU can surprise with it! Just know it does still have shaky bulk to overcome, and a typing that obviously leaves it deathly afraid of Fairies. You can somewhat combat this by shedding Dragon Pulse for Flash Cannon instead, though the only Fairies you usually flip are lesser names these days, I think (Xerneas and Zacian Hero), so probably not really worth it. Dragon Pulse just does more for you, IMO.

No, I didn't forget that we're getting a new, egg-locked Pokémon… actually TWO of them, since INDEEDEE has differing male and female forms. It's just that, frankly, it doesn't matter. They're both pretty terrible. So-so bulk, BAD moves, bad Pokémon. They are completely shown up by Psychic types already available: Oranguru and, of course, your friend and mine, Girafarig!

Alright, that's it for this batch. Hopefully this is a help to you as you hunt! Until next time, you can always find me on Twitter with regular GO analysis nuggets or Patreon.

Stay safe out there, Pokéfriends, and beware what lurks in the shadows! 🌑 Catch you next time.

David Keith speaks during a panel discussion on geoengineering at the University of Chicago in October 2024. Photo: Jason Smith, University of Chicago

Climate scientist David Keith said he's at least twice called police because of threats related to his work on solar geoengineering, in which a portion of the Sun's rays are reflected into space to temporarily cool the planet.

Why it matters: The incidents reflect — no pun intended — important lessons with regard to society's debates over climate and energy.

Catch up quick: Keith, a University of Chicago professor and climate scientist, is one of the world's foremost experts on geoengineering and related technologies. 

In a wide-ranging interview, he mentioned the threats were from conspiracy theorists about so-called ""chemtrails,"" which falsely claim that linear cloud-like formations from planes' exhausts are actually chemicals aimed at somehow controlling the weather or even biological warfare.

What they're saying: ""It worries me,"" Keith told Axios in the interview, which was recorded last year for an episode of a new podcast called ""Shocked"" that ran this week.

Yes, but: ""I've also had many conversations with 'chemtrails' people and all of the actual face-to-face conversations have been pretty polite,"" Keith said.

Driving the news: The Trump administration has taken varied steps on the topic. In July, the EPA created an informational website about geoengineering, including a section distinguishing it from contrails, which also sends users to a website on contrails that says the ""chemtrails"" theory is false.

What's next: A House subcommittee is holding a hearing Tuesday on these technologies, led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R.-Ga.), who recently introduced a bill that would ban geoengineering and similar types of tech.

Reality check: Such moves are looking to ban something that isn't happening on any significant scale — though various types of research are underway, which is controversial in and of itself.

Editor's note: This article was written partly based on content from the ""Shocked"" podcast, which was created by a team including experts at the University of Chicago's Institute for Climate and Sustainable Growth and producers at Magnificent Noise. Amy is also the institute's inaugural journalism fellow.

Domestic political chaos in Nepal follows troubles in Bangladesh. With two neighbours in turmoil, and others none too stable either, India faces some challenges within the region. But while these troubles might signal the need for resolute action by New Delhi, sometimes the best response is no response at all. It is to wait until the situation sorts itself out to provide greater clarity. 












The neighbourhood is a region of potential risks for any regionally dominant power like India, but regional dominance also carries some advantages. India is more capable of influencing smaller nations both through incentives and potential punishment. The neighbours know this, often better than New Delhi. Thus, not acting in haste and waiting for clarity to develop in the confused domestic politics is not as much of a risk in the region as it can be in other circumstances. 


This is particularly true because, though a turbulent region is potentially a problem, it is not quite clear whether India can do much about it. Precipitate action may actually do more harm than good. The key point to remember is that foreign powers, even dominant regional powers such as India, can't do much about domestic political mismanagement, which is the problem in both Nepal and Bangladesh.

Deep state conspiracy theories
It is often suspected that these regional troubles are being engineered by forces inimical to India, the favourite being the American liberal deep state. This is an absurd conspiracy theory for more than one reason. First, it makes little logical sense: every one of the last several US administrations from Bill Clinton onwards was keen on building up India and ensuring that Indian power grew as a counter to China. Undermining India would have meant undermining their own strategy. While it was very likely that some of the US administrations would have possibly preferred a less ideologically troublesome India, the idea that this would lead them to subvert their own strategic interests vis-à-vis China suggests a somewhat crude understanding of how Washington pursues its priorities. 
Second, of course, is the equally absurd notion of any “deep state”. Those who talk about it are either entirely ignorant of the complexity of bureaucratic politics or are seeking refuge in popular conspiratorial nonsense even when they should know better. It is ludicrous to imagine that there is some determined and synchronised core in any government that can direct national power to such specific objectives. This has always been the ambition of statesmen and even bureaucrats who set up coordination mechanisms such as the National Security Councils in many countries. Such agencies were set up precisely to coordinate policies because bureaucracies pull in different directions. But the experience of even such coordination agencies has generally been poor, and such coordination was rarely achieved in practice. 



There are indeed some celebrated successful cases of external intervention, such as the CIA operation to overthrow Iranian PM Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953 or the Soviet invasions of various Eastern European countries at several points. But these successes are few and far between. Despite years of effort, the US couldn't get rid of Cuba's Fidel Castro, just a few kilometres off the Florida coast, who thumbed his nose at Washington for decades. At other times, efforts to control other polities went horribly wrong for all parties. Think of the repeated US experience of nation-building in various parts of the world, from Southeast Asia to the Middle East and, most recently, Afghanistan. Despite the Cuban experience, the US has had greater success in the Western hemisphere, even though this is largely the result of sullen quiescence rather than active support of US goals. But this speaks to the advantages of regional dominance, an advantage for India too. 
Similarly, the Soviet client states in Central Europe chafed under Moscow's control only for as long as its power was sufficiently fearsome. As soon as Moscow weakened in the late 1980s, Eastern Europeans and then even constituent Soviet nationalities voted with their feet. Loss of regional dominance meant that Russia faced problems even in its own “near abroad”, but that is not a problem India faces today. 
The final absurdity of such conspiracy theories is revealed by the fact that their proponents blame both the US and China for the development. In other words, the authors of such theories couldn't decide who to blame and so took a tout azimuts view rather than consider the more likely possibility that political and economic mismanagement by the Sheikh Hasina (Bangladesh) and KP Oli governments (Nepal) led to their overthrow. The results were bad for Indian interests, no doubt, but such bad outcomes are not always the result of deliberate designs by others. It is often the outcome of complicated political processes that no one controls. Seeing this as a planned outcome is giving one's adversaries far too much credit. More importantly, it ends up sometimes creating unnecessary adversaries.
Ideologisation for foreign policy
Equally important to remember is that opposition to India is natural because it's the regional power. This is not India's fault, though that is obviously of little comfort to the strategists in New Delhi who have to deal with the fallout. New Delhi can make the situation worse if it makes mistakes, such as advertising its preferences within the political turbulence in the neighbourhood. This is unhelpful. In Bangladesh, while its official policy is to wait and watch, clearly the semi-official Indian media went after the new regime with considerable bitterness, blaming the overthrow of the Hasina government on an anti-India conspiracy, citing various Indian agencies as sources. This no doubt suggests a reflection of an official viewpoint that the government itself is unwilling to state publicly. 
Others in the region aren't fools, of course, so they'll take this as reflecting government views because it surely does. The problem is that this will undermine India's official hands-off stance, which is the correct and pragmatic view considering that we cannot predict how and in what way the situation will evolve. Neither New Delhi nor anyone else has the means to direct such political movements. External and even internal actors are basically passengers in a driverless vehicle and can only hope that the vehicle moves in a direction they want to go. 
Part of the reason for such unpragmatic actions is the growing ideologisation of foreign policy. Pragmatism requires dealing with all sides, including those one might disagree with, whereas a deeply ideological approach sees the world in terms of rigid friends and foes. Whether in dealing with US President Donald Trump or the Indian subcontinent region, such ideologised foreign policy is a danger because it introduces blinkers that limit one's strategic perspectives. This only makes an unpalatable situation worse.

Similarly, the Soviet client states in Central Europe chafed under Moscow's control only for as long as its power was sufficiently fearsome. As soon as Moscow weakened in the late 1980s, Eastern Europeans and then even constituent Soviet nationalities voted with their feet. Loss of regional dominance meant that Russia faced problems even in its own “near abroad”, but that is not a problem India faces today. 


The final absurdity of such conspiracy theories is revealed by the fact that their proponents blame both the US and China for the development. In other words, the authors of such theories couldn't decide who to blame and so took a tout azimuts view rather than consider the more likely possibility that political and economic mismanagement by the Sheikh Hasina (Bangladesh) and KP Oli governments (Nepal) led to their overthrow. The results were bad for Indian interests, no doubt, but such bad outcomes are not always the result of deliberate designs by others. It is often the outcome of complicated political processes that no one controls. Seeing this as a planned outcome is giving one's adversaries far too much credit. More importantly, it ends up sometimes creating unnecessary adversaries.
Ideologisation for foreign policy
Equally important to remember is that opposition to India is natural because it's the regional power. This is not India's fault, though that is obviously of little comfort to the strategists in New Delhi who have to deal with the fallout. New Delhi can make the situation worse if it makes mistakes, such as advertising its preferences within the political turbulence in the neighbourhood. This is unhelpful. In Bangladesh, while its official policy is to wait and watch, clearly the semi-official Indian media went after the new regime with considerable bitterness, blaming the overthrow of the Hasina government on an anti-India conspiracy, citing various Indian agencies as sources. This no doubt suggests a reflection of an official viewpoint that the government itself is unwilling to state publicly. 
Others in the region aren't fools, of course, so they'll take this as reflecting government views because it surely does. The problem is that this will undermine India's official hands-off stance, which is the correct and pragmatic view considering that we cannot predict how and in what way the situation will evolve. Neither New Delhi nor anyone else has the means to direct such political movements. External and even internal actors are basically passengers in a driverless vehicle and can only hope that the vehicle moves in a direction they want to go.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Josh Shapiro says Trump failed the ‘morality test' in his response to Kirk assassination","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/16/politics/josh-shapiro-trump-political-violence","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 17:11:11 GMT","


            Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Tuesday ripped President Donald Trump as having failed both a “leadership test” and a “morality test” after Charlie Kirk's assassination.
    


            “It should not be hard to stand up to some people who are celebrating the killing of Charlie Kirk and say, ‘That's wrong,' and it should not be hard to stand up to people who are calling for vengeance and revenge in the wake of the killing of Charlie Kirk and say, ‘That's not OK either.' I don't care if it's coming from the left or the right,” the Democratic governor told reporters in Pittsburgh following a speech on political violence.
    


            Shapiro, a contender to be Kamala Harris' running mate last year and a potential 2028 presidential candidate, criticized Trump for repeatedly blaming violence on the “radical left” without noting acts of violence committed by right-wing actors.
    


            “Doing that,” Shapiro said in his remarks, “only further divides us and it makes it harder to heal. There are some who will hear that selective condemnation and take it as a permission to commit more violence, so long as it suits their narrative or only targets the other side.”
    


            Shapiro appeared at a gathering of the group Eradicate Hate, which fights antisemitism, days after Kirk's assassination and five months after an assailant set fire to the Pennsylvania governor's mansion hours after Shapiro and extended family celebrated a Passover seder there.
    


            The answer to political violence, Shapiro said Tuesday, must come from government doing more to make a positive difference in people's lives but also from being more attuned to when “righteous frustration is taken advantage of to foment hate” online.
    


            “What starts with cowardly keystrokes,” Shapiro lamented, “often ends with a trigger being pulled in our communities.”
    


            Shapiro recalled both the terror of being woken up by state troopers after the April attack and the support he felt from the community. Most of his family had been asleep in a different part of the building.
    


            “That doesn't mean that the attack hasn't left emotional scars. I can attest to that — especially as a father: a father of four children, knowing that my life choices put them at risk,” Shapiro said.
    


            Shapiro linked that night to instances of political violence including Kirk's death, the assassination attempt on Trump last year in Pennsylvania, the killing of a health care CEO in Manhattan, and the slayings of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband in June.
    


            About political violence, Shapiro said, “not only does it seek to injure, maim or kill — it seeks to intimidate and terrorize and silence,” adding, “This type of violence has no place in our society, regardless of what motivates it or who pulls the trigger, who throws the Molotov cocktail or who wields the weapon.”
    


            That thought was shared by Tom Corbett, a former Republican governor of Pennsylvania who introduced Shapiro.
    


            “Preventing hate-fueled violence is not a partisan issue. It is one that requires all of us, around this country and around this world, to come together,” he said.
    


            After the attack in Harrisburg, Shapiro recalled, the chaplain of a local fire department gave him a handwritten prayer drawn from a passage of the Book of Numbers. What the man didn't know, Shapiro said, is that they were the same words of a prayer he recites every night in Hebrew with his hand on the head of his children, the words of which he briefly spoke himself.
    


            People may not agree on politics or have similar lives, Shapiro said, but what has been lost for too many is their ability to find their common ground.
    


            In that, Shapiro invoked a lesson from western Pennsylvania native Fred Rogers, better known as the famous children's broadcaster Mister Rogers: Look for the helpers.
    


            “I believe that we are stronger than hate,” Shapiro said. “But I also believe in America that this work doesn't fall to others. It falls to each and every one of us.”

            When the legendary Hollywood actor-turned director Robert Redford passed away Tuesday, he left behind not only a body of impactful and culturally significant films, but also a style legacy that has largely become the blueprint for American menswear.
    


            Instantly recognizable by his floppy windswept hair and penchant for relaxed, yet refined looks, Redford became a symbol of classic, understated elegance throughout the 1960s and ‘70s, when he became the go-to leading man in American cinema, starring in films such as “All the President's Men” and “The Way We Were.”
    


            Among Redford's memorable outfits is the elegant pastel suit worn in the 1974 romance-drama “The Great Gatsby” and the herringbone tweed sports coat, layered atop a blue chambray shirt, striped wool tie and light blue jeans, that he sported in the 1975 thriller “Three Days of the Condor” — a preppy, layered style that wouldn't feel out of place today amid the recent resurgence in Ivy League dressing.
    


            Indeed, Redford, who became the embodiment of timelessness and sophistication, paved the way for many American menswear archetypes, from prep to western.
    


            And his embrace of classic wardrobe styles, such as button-down shirts, aviator sunglasses and denim pants — at times worn with a matching shirt, making him an early adopter of the “double denim” look long before it became a trend — seeped beyond the big screen and into his sartorial choices.
    


            Despite his seemingly effortless nature, Redford was particular about his clothes. For “Three Days of the Condor,”  the actor made specific requests for his jeans, requesting a “Hollywood hem” for his flared Levi's that involved cropping the 36in inseam and reattaching the original cuff, the film's costume designer, Joseph Aulisi, told the Financial Times' luxury supplement HTSI, which on Monday published a tribute to Redford's style.
    


            Yet despite widespread efforts to imitate the icon's image, it was rarely successfully replicated, the French designer and founder of tailoring brand Husbands Paris, Nicolas Gabard, who produced the gray tweed blazer worn by Redford in the “Three Days of the Condor,” told HTSI. “All menswear guys, at one point, have tried to copy this jacket. Even Ralph Lauren,” he said. “And no one has succeeded.”
    


            Influential fashion designers and enthusiasts alike have often drawn inspiration from the late actor. Michael Kors, for example, looked at Redford's portrayal of a swaggering skier in the 1969 film “Downhill Racer” when designing his 2016 men's collection, which referenced “apres-ski” style. Ralph Lauren (who designed the costumes for the male cast of “The Great Gatsby”) has also spoken of his admiration for Hollywood's golden age and the style of its leading actors, such as Redford.
    


            “Robert Redford was America's movie star — from ‘Gatsby' to the ‘Sundance Kid', but it was his personal commitment to preserving his craft and the natural world he loved that will be his enduring legacy. We will miss his joy and optimistic view of living,” Ralph Lauren told CNN over email.
    


            Still, a tanned, graying brown-haired Redford said, aged 82, that he was “surprised” to have been considered a sex symbol. “When I was a kid no one ever told me I was good looking; I never heard that,” he told British newspaper The Telegraph in 2018.
    


            “My hair was red and unmanageable and I had cowlicks going all over the place. I had freckles and my teeth were too big. So I didn't have people coming up to me saying, ‘Boy, you're a really good-looking guy.' That came much later and when it did come I wasn't prepared for it,” he added.
    


            While Redford's looks and charisma were advantageous to his career in many ways, they didn't always work in his favor: The actor famously lost out on a starring role in the 1967 comedy-romance film “The Graduate” because he had never been rejected by a woman. (Speaking to Vanity Fair in 2008, the film's director Mike Nichols said Redford could “never play a loser” for that reason.)
    


            And no doubt he was right. 58 years on, Redford's appeal endures — and will likely continue long after his passing.

            Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Tuesday urged a greater emphasis on civic involvement and education, questioning whether some Americans had been clearly taught the difference between a president and a king.
    


            Speaking to the New York Law School in Manhattan, the Supreme Court's senior liberal encouraged people to get involved and lamented what she described as a lack of knowledge about fundamental aspects of American law.
    


            “Do we understand what the difference is between a king and president?” Sotomayor said at one point. “I think if people understood these things from the beginning, they would be more informed as to what would be important in a democracy in terms of what people can or should not do.”
    


            Sotomayor did not directly address President Donald Trump, nor criticism about his efforts to consolidate power within the executive branch. The Supreme Court is considering several appeals challenging the president's power to unilaterally impose tariffs, fire leaders of independent agencies, and claw back federal spending approved by Congress.
    


Kavanaugh faces blowback for claiming Americans can sue over encounters with ICE



            Sotomayor, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama, has frequently been in dissent in similar cases over the past year.
    


            “The relationship between the president and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably,” she wrote in a dissent last year when a majority of the court granted Trump broad criminal immunity for actions taken in office. “In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law.”
    


            Most of Sotomayor's remarks Tuesday focused not on current events but on civic education. In her own experience, Sotomayor said that schools covered only the basics of how government works.
    


            “What they didn't teach back then was the principles that motivated the structure of government,” she said.
    


            Schools, Sotomayor said, “really didn't explain, in more than a cursory way, what the functions were between the branches and what the expectations were of service in government.”

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday renewed calls for a settlement to the Ukraine conflict, insisting that Vladimir Zelensky will eventually have to strike a deal with Moscow.

Trump, who has been pushing for direct talks between Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring an end to the hostilities, previously claimed that he would need to “intervene” personally to bring them together.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday as he was departing for London, Trump repeated several times that “Zelensky's gonna have to make a deal.”

Putin has said he is ready in principle to meet Zelensky and suggested the Ukrainian leader could travel to Moscow for talks. Kiev has rejected the idea, saying it would not accept “deliberately unacceptable proposals.”

At the same time, the Russian president has questioned Zelensky's legitimacy and also expressed doubt about whether talks with him would be “meaningful.” Zelensky's presidential term expired in May 2024, but he has refused to hold elections, citing martial law.

Moscow has insisted on a peace agreement that addresses the underlying causes of the conflict. It has demanded that Ukraine maintain neutrality, stay out of NATO and other military blocs, demilitarize and denazify, and accept the current territorial reality – including the status of Crimea and the other regions that voted to join Russia in referendums in 2014 and 2022.

Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, a UN commission of inquiry said in a report published on Tuesday.

According to the findings, Israel has committed four of the five genocidal acts defined under the 1948 Genocide Convention since the start of its war with Hamas in 2023. These include killing, causing serious bodily or mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions of life aimed at destroying Palestinians in whole or in part, and imposing measures to prevent births.

“The commission finds that Israel is responsible for the commission of genocide in Gaza,” Navi Pillay, chair of the UN body, said at a press conference in Geneva. “It is clear that there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza through acts that meet the criteria set forth in the Genocide Convention.”

Pillay blamed “Israeli authorities at the highest echelons” for “these atrocity crimes,” saying they “have orchestrated a genocidal campaign for almost two years now with the specific intent to destroy the Palestinian group in Gaza.” She added that Israeli authorities have also failed to prevent or punish those responsible by not investigating or prosecuting the perpetrators of genocidal acts.

The commission said it had analyzed Israeli actions in Gaza, including “imposing starvation and inhumane conditions of life for Palestinians,” concluding that “genocidal intent was the only reasonable inference.” It also cited the “systematic destruction” of healthcare and education, along with “systematic” sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinians.

The commission urged Israel to “end the genocide in Gaza” and called on UN member states to halt arms transfers and prosecute individuals or companies complicit in genocide.

The Israeli Foreign Ministry has rejected the commission's report as “fake,” accusing its authors of being “Hamas proxies” and calling for the “immediate abolition” of the panel.

“The report relies entirely on Hamas falsehoods, laundered and repeated by others,” the ministry claimed. “Israel categorically rejects this distorted and false report and calls for the immediate abolition of this commission of inquiry.”

The conflict has continued since October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants launched a surprise assault on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 captive. The Palestinian death toll has risen to 64,905 as of Monday, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

On Tuesday, Israel launched a ground offensive in Gaza City – one of the few areas still outside IDF control – after weeks of intensified strikes on alleged Hamas targets. The move followed the Israeli Security Cabinet's approval of plans to seize the city last month.

George Zinn, accused of obstructing justice, was also booked in connection with images on his cell of child abuse

A man who was detained moments after Turning Point USA executive director Charlie Kirk's killing has been arrested on allegations of trying to thwart authorities by falsely confessing to the fatal shooting.

After being arrested on Monday, 71-year-old George Zinn faces a count of obstructing justice – a second-degree felony – in the wake of Kirk's killing at Utah Valley University (UVU). He was also booked in connection with images on his cellphone depicting child abuse, said state authorities, who took Zinn into custody after he was released from a hospital that was treating him for a medical condition.

Documents filed in Zinn's case by UVU campus police allege that he began screaming, “I shot him – now shoot me,” in the immediate aftermath of Kirk's killing at Utah Valley University (UVU) on 10 September. Video of officers holding Zinn down was widely circulated online, leading some to believe that authorities had quickly arrested a suspect in the killing of the conservative political activist.

Then, when asked by an officer where the gun used to kill Kirk was, Zinn allegedly replied: “I am not going to tell you.” Police contend that Zinn subsequently admitted that he was not the shooter and did not know who was – and he purportedly claimed that he had acted how he did to draw attention away from the real killer in hopes of becoming “a martyr” for Kirk.

Zinn was brought to a hospital after experiencing an unspecified medical episode and told officers he was “glad he said he shot the individual so the real suspect could get away”, according to police documents as well as a statement from authorities.

He allegedly was reluctant to let investigators look at his phone, saying he used the device “to look at child sexual abuse material”, local sheriff's deputies wrote in a separate report, as the Utah news outlet KSL noted. A search of Zinn's phone allegedly confirmed there were more than 20 images depicting child sexual abuse, including of minors believed to be between 5 and 12 years old – as well as explicit messages sharing the imagery with others, investigators said.

Ultimately, authorities arrested Zinn on counts of obstruction of justice linked to the aftermath of Kirk's killing and sexual exploitation of minors for the alleged content on his phone.

Police announced the arrest of Kirk's actual suspected killer on Friday after a two-day manhunt. He has been identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, of Washington county, Utah, about 260 miles south of UVU.

Zinn has a history of criminal charges and convictions in Utah over the previous three decades, according to KSL and other local media reports. Notably, in 2013, he was arrested on allegations that he asked Salt Lake City, Utah, marathon organizers if he could help set up bombs at the finish line.

The deadly 2013 Boston marathon bombing that killed three people and injured hundreds of others had been days earlier.

Citing information from a district attorney whose office had previously prosecuted him, the Salt Lake Tribune reported that Zinn was “politically conservative, leaning libertarian”.

On Monday, a judge ordered Zinn be held without bail, according to online court records. Robinson was expected in court Tuesday to face formal murder charges.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

A Russian drone strike targeted central Kharkiv during broad daylight on Sept. 16, damaging an educational institution and injuring at least four people, officials reported.

The employees hid in the shelter during the attack, said Vice-Rector Oleksandr Kukhtenko.

A fire broke out at the building covering an area of 150 square meters, according to the State Emergency Service.

Russia struck the city at around 11 a.m. local time, presumably using Geran-2 kamikaze drones, according to prosecutors. Local authorities said that some of the incoming drones were shot down.

The regional prosecutor's office released a video of a Russian drone hitting the university building in Kharkiv's Slobidskyi district, resulting in a massive explosion.

Several civilians were wounded while in the streets. The injured victims include three women aged 51, 52, and 54, and a 89-year-old man. All are in stable condition, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported.

""The strike was carried out in broad daylight, near the city center,"" Syniehubov said, stressing that the damaged facility was a purely civilian target with ""no connection to the military or defense industry.""

President Volodymyr Zelensky commented on the attack in a post on X, calling it ""a typical day for Russia, which, unfortunately, continues to avoid truly strong global pressure in response to prolonging the war."" 

""During the day, a strike hit the center of Kharkiv, targeting university buildings. The National University of Pharmacy — for Russia, simply a target. Russian guided aerial bombs continue to rain down on communities in the Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk regions,"" the Ukrainian president said.

Zelensky urged the international community to respond to every strike and stressed that only significant economic losses could force Moscow toward diplomacy. 

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city lying some 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the border with Russia, is a regular target of Russian missile and drone attacks.

U.S. President Donald Trump arrives in Britain on Tuesday for an unprecedented second state visit sure to be full of pomp and ceremony.

Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, land in Britain Tuesday evening but the pageantry starts Wednesday morning when they fly by helicopter to Windsor Castle.

The President will meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is facing deep public discontent and days ago fired his ambassador to the U.S. over ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The Trumps will be welcomed with a gun salute fired from the lawn of Windsor Castle and the Tower of London. They'll then join King Charles and Queen Camilla in a carriage procession through the Castle grounds, which will involve 1,300 soldiers, three military bands and 120 horses. The day's program also includes a musical performance, a fly past of U.S. and British F-35 fighter jets, a visit to the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II, military displays and a state banquet in the evening with other members of the Royal Family. 

On Thursday, the Trumps fly to Chequers, the Prime Minister's official country residence northeast of London. Mr. Trump will have a series of meetings with Mr. Starmer and the two leaders are expected to sign a technology partnership agreement. 

Security measures have been heightened because of the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist credited with leading the Republican youth movement and helping Mr. Trump win the election in 2024, and the area around the castle will be on virtual lockdown during the visit. Police have been conducting boat patrols on the Thames and hundreds of officers will be on the streets and perched on rooftops. The presidential couple will largely move by helicopter, and they will not be visiting Downing Street or Parliament.

Mr. Starmer hosts Mr. Trump as the Prime Minister's popularity has plummeted and his government faces a series of scandals and resignations.

Recently, Mr. Starmer's deputy, Angela Rayner, was forced to resign her cabinet position for failing to pay the proper amount of land tax on the purchase of a new home. Last week, the British Ambassador to Washington, Labour stalwart Peter Mandelson, resigned after e-mails emerged showing his close friendship with Mr. Epstein. 

His dismissal has heaped pressure on Mr. Starmer to explain why he appointed Lord Mandelson to the post, and it has prompted a few Labour MPs to openly call for the Prime Minister to resign. 

Mr. Starmer's travails have been a huge boost to Reform U.K., the upstart populist party led by Nigel Farage, which has been running well ahead of Labour in most opinion polls. And in a further sign of the public's discontentment on issues such as immigration, a rally in central London last weekend organized by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew more than 100,000 people. 

Mr. Starmer will also have to navigate some sharp differences with the unpredictable U.S. President. Britain has been highly critical of Israel's expanding military operation in Gaza and Mr. Starmer has announced plans to recognize Palestinian statehood, something Mr. Trump strongly opposes. 

Britain has also been a leader in Europe in backing Ukraine in its war with Russia and Mr. Starmer has been far more critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin than Mr. Trump.

Trade also remains a sensitive topic. Even though Britain has secured some relief from Mr. Trump's erratic global tariffs, many of the details have yet to be finalized and the U.K. still faces a 25-per-cent tariff on U.S. imports of British steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump is also expected to zero in on Britain's digital services tax, much like he has with other countries including Canada. The U.K. tax raises around £800-million, or $1.5-billion annually, through a 2-per-cent charge on revenue generated in Britain by global tech companies. 

Like most world leaders, Mr. Starmer has had to carefully calibrate his relationship with Mr. Trump. The Prime Minister has openly fawned on the President and tried to exploit his adoration for Britain's royal traditions.

Mr. Starmer pulled out an invitation from the King during his first meeting with Mr. Trump in February, and he made a point of announcing that this will be the first time a U.S. President has had two state visits (Queen Elizabeth hosted Mr. Trump on a state visit in 2019).

But Mr. Trump is a highly unpopular figure in the U.K. A monthly tracking poll of thousands of voters by YouGov has found that just 16 per cent of those surveyed have a positive view of the President. Several protests in Windsor and London have been organized by the Stop Trump Coalition. 

Cozying up to Trump is sure to alienate “those mainly but not exclusively on the left,” said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary University of London. “But most Brits seem to understand that keeping Trump sweet, however much they don't like him, is a sensible thing to do if the government wants, first, to keep him even vaguely interested in helping Ukraine and, second, to ensure that we get a least-worst trade deal.”

Maybe it was nerves from being in the presence of royalty, or perhaps it was a simple mistake, but over the years there have been quite a few gaffes between U.S. presidents, first ladies and members of the British Royal family.

An appeals court has blocked Donald Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook, a governor of the US Federal Reserve.

In the latest threat to the central bank's longstanding independence, the US president had ordered Ms Cook's removal over untested allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies.

It marked the first time in the Federal Reserve's 111-year history that a president has sought to remove one of its governors.

On Monday, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that Ms Cook can keep her seat ahead of the Fed's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, where it is expected to cut interest rates to shore up a cooling labour market.

The ruling came on the same day that the US president expanded his influence over the world's most important central bank after Stephen Miran, his top economic advisor, was handed one of 12 interest rate-setting votes on the eve of the key policy meeting.

In a blow to Mr Trump, the DC Circuit denied the justice department's request to put on hold a judge's order temporarily blocking the president from removing Ms Cook, an appointee of Joe Biden, the former president.

The decision was 2-1, with Circuit Judges Bradley Garcia and J Michelle Childs in the majority, both of whom were appointed by Mr Biden. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas, a Trump appointee, dissented.

The Trump administration is expected to appeal to the US Supreme Court.

US District Judge Jia Cobb had ruled on Sept 9 that Mr Trump's claims that Ms Cook committed “deceitful and criminal conduct in a financial matter” before taking office were not likely to be sufficient grounds for removal under the law that created the central bank.

Ms Cook denies wrongdoing and is in the process of suing Mr Trump.

Just before the decision about Ms Cook was announced, the Republican-controlled Senate narrowly confirmed Mr Miran to the Federal Reserve's board of governors.

The 48-47 vote marked the final step of a swift process that began in August, when Adriana Kugler resigned unexpectedly as a Federal Reserve governor.

That created an opening on the seven-member board for Mr Trump to fill with someone more amenable to lowering interest rates, as the president has demanded for all year.

Lisa Murkowski, a senator for Alaska, was the lone vote against Mr Miran from Republicans.

It typically takes months for a Federal Reserve governor nominee to be confirmed by the Senate. However, Mr Miran was confirmed in less than six weeks.

The swift action means Mr Miran will be able to take part in the central bank's policy meetings beginning on Tuesday, pending the completion of paperwork and his swearing-in.

Policymakers are expected to approve a quarter-percentage-point rate cut to support a weakening labour market at the end of the meeting on Wednesday.

Analysts anticipate that Mr Miran will dissent on the policy decision in favour of a bigger rate cut, though not necessarily the several-percentage-point reduction that Mr Trump has demanded.

As the head of the White House's council of economic advisers, Mr Miran has argued that the president's tariffs will not cause inflation and that Mr Trump's other policies, including his immigration crackdown, will ease broad price pressures by reducing demand for housing.

As the newest Federal Reserve board member, Mr Miran would have responsibilities that extend beyond voting on interest rates.

Governors typically serve on several committees with remits including US financial regulation and supervision, community banking, and staffing and budget decisions for the US central bank's system as well as its 12 regional banks.

Mr Miran will retain his White House job but go on unpaid leave while he serves at the Federal Reserve for a term that expires on Jan 31, although he could stay on indefinitely if a successor for his seat has not yet been picked and confirmed.

Democrats say the arrangement makes him a Trump “puppet”, a charge that Mr Miran denies.

            Hot Stocks 





            Federal Reserve officials are convening Tuesday and Wednesday for a pivotal meeting under unprecedented circumstances.
    


            On Wednesday at the conclusion of their two-day policy meeting, central bankers are expected to announce their first interest rate cut since December to support America's slowing labor market, with the hopes that President Donald Trump's expansive tariffs might have only a limited impact on inflation.
    


            But there's an elephant in the room as officials debate about the US economy: Trump's aggressive effort to reshape the Fed's top ranks.
    


            On Monday, the Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, Trump's top economic adviser, to serve on the Fed's Board of Governors to complete a vacated term that expires at the end of January, but could be extended. Miran has said he won't commit to resigning when his term ends if a permanent successor hasn't been named.
    


            After being sworn in on Tuesday morning, Miran is able to cast a vote at this week's Fed policy meeting.
    


            Fed Governor Lisa Cook, whom Trump tried to fire in late August, will also cast a vote at this week's meeting. An appeals court on Monday rejected Trump's attempt to fire Cook while her lawsuit challenging Trump's removal order moves forward. Cook is the first Fed governor ever to be subject to a firing attempt.
    


            The latest Fed meeting is extraordinary, not just because central bankers are finally pivoting their strategy on interest rates, but also because of the latest developments implicating the Fed's powerful board — all while the Trump administration continues to pile pressure on the politically independent central bank.
    


            Mounting signs of labor market weakness are a key reason why the Fed is lowering borrowing costs for the first time in nine months, coupled with Fed officials' growing belief that tariff inflation may be short lived.
    


            Job growth during the summer was anemic: Employers added an average of about 29,000 jobs in the three months ending in August, according to Labor Department data, slightly higher than July's average, which was the weakest three-month pace since 2010, outside of the pandemic.
    


            There are now more unemployed people seeking work than there are job openings; new applications for jobless benefits in the week ending September 6 rose to the highest level in nearly four years; and in August, the number of people unemployed for more than 26 weeks reached its highest level since November 2021.
    


            A preliminary benchmark revision to employment data for the year ending in March, released last week, showed that the US labor market was on even shakier ground than previously thought heading into the summer.
    


            Fed Chair Jerome Powell laid the groundwork for this week's rate cut during a high-profile speech in late August, stating that “downside risks to employment are rising.” Other Fed officials have echoed those concerns in recent weeks, though they were first raised prominently by Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both Trump appointees, who backed a rate cut in July.
    


            Fed officials' latest economic projections, to be released on Wednesday, will show how aggressively the central bank might lower rates in the coming months with the labor market in a precarious state.
    


            Inflation has crept up in recent months — mostly due to Trump's sweeping policies, including his tariffs — but Fed officials have warmed up to the idea that any uptick in inflation may be temporary.
    


            The Consumer Price Index rose 2.9% in August from a year earlier, the Labor Department reported last week, in line with economists' expectations. For months, consumer inflation readings have mostly come in as expected, despite the chaotic rollout of Trump's tariffs.
    


            San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly wrote in a recent social media post that “tariff-related price increases will be a one-off.” St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said in a speech earlier this month that he expects “the effects of tariffs will work through the economy over the next two to three quarters and the impact on inflation will fade after that.”
    


Wholesale inflation cooled in August as businesses absorb tariff costs — for now



            With a weakening labor market and persistent economic jitters, businesses now have less flexibility to raise prices compared to the years after the pandemic, when labor demand was red-hot and Americans' coffers were flush with pandemic-era stimulus payments and beefed-up savings.
    


            “Inflation has increased since the first quarter, but these numbers include the effects of import tariff increases, which, with inflation expectations anchored, I continue to expect will only temporarily raise inflation,” Waller said during an August 28 speech in Miami.
    


            “Most forecasts are for 12-month inflation to continue to slowly increase for a couple more months, with monthly tariff effects dissipating by early 2026,” he added.
    


            As Fed officials try to make sense of a complicated economic puzzle, the Trump administration continues to pressure the historically independent Fed.
    


            Since the beginning of his second term, Trump has repeatedly and publicly lashed out at Powell and the Fed because officials haven't lowered rates this year. Fed policymakers have held off on rate cuts until this week because they've wanted to see how Trump's policies — and its impacts — play out first.
    


            Trump threatened earlier this year to fire Powell, but eventually backed off after his advisers warned him that doing so could spark extreme volatility in financial markets, CNN previously reported.
    


            In July, the Trump administration seized on the Fed's ongoing $2.5 billion renovation of its headquarters in Washington, DC, as an opening to fire Powell, claiming it was mismanaged. At one point, Trump and Powell publicly feuded over the total cost of the project.
    


Trump feuds with Powell on tour of Fed's $2.5 billion renovation



            Now, Trump is trying to oust Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, which the Justice Department is actively investigating. The courts are keeping Cook in her job while her lawsuit challenging Trump's attempt to oust her moves forward in litigation. New documents reported by the Associated Press show that Cook's Atlanta condo, which the administration alleges is one of two properties she designated as a primary residence, was declared as a vacation home. Cook has denied any wrongdoing.
    


            While Cook's position remains in limbo, newly confirmed Fed governor Miran has elicited concerns from Democrats over his close ties with the president. For his part, Miran has said he will abide by ethics rules and federal law, and form independent opinions about the economy.
    


            “I'm very independently minded, as shown by my willingness to stray from consensus and have out-of-consensus views, and I believe that I will continue to be as independent in my thinking process, if confirmed,” Miran said during his confirmation hearing.
    


            Trump has said he wants a majority of Republicans on the Fed's Board of Governors, and Miran's confirmation process was swiftly shepherded through, taking only about a month from when he was nominated to when he got sworn in. The process typically takes a couple of months.
    


            Trump's insistence on lower rates likely sped up that timeline in order to get Miran on the Fed's board in time for the September meeting. Fed watchers already overwhelmingly expect the Fed to announce at least a quarter-point cut at the conclusion of the meeting, with or without Miran.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — As U.S. President Donald Trump ratchets up pressure on the International Criminal Court, staff responsible for investigating the world's worst crimes are finding ways to work around U.S. sanctions of the kind more usually imposed on officials from autocratic regimes and members of extremist organizations. 

Trump sanctioned staff at the court after a panel of ICC judges in November issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant.

Judges issued the warrants after finding that there were “reasonable grounds to believe” that the pair may have committed war crimes by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeting civilians in Israel's offensive against Hamas in Gaza — charges Israeli officials deny. 

Although prosecutors and judges involved in the investigation into Israel's leaders have been singled out, the sanctions are hampering work on a broad array of investigations and threaten to undermine the entire institution. 

Companies and individuals risk substantial fines and prison time if they provide a sanctioned person with “financial, material, or technological support.” 




For Americans, the risks are especially great. They are more likely to have assets in the United States and to return to home to see family, putting them within the reach of the U.S. government. Without a special license from the U.S. Treasury Department, they would be unable to pursue their work and could even face prosecution. 

The U.S.-based Association of International Criminal Law Prosecutors successfully negotiated with the Treasury for its members to be covered by an Office of Foreign Assets Control license, or OFAC, which allows individuals of any nationality to engage with sanctioned people or groups.

“The license is narrow and specific, but we were pleased Treasury agreed there was space for this kind of professional activity, even in a difficult climate,” the group's president, Brenda Hollis, told The Associated Press.

Hollis, a former U.S. Air Force colonel, was a prosecutor at the ICC until earlier this year, overseeing its investigation into Ukraine. 

Getting hit with sanctions can be devastating. The institution's top prosecutor, Karim Khan, a British national, had his bank accounts closed, his visa for the United States revoked, and Microsoft even cancelled his ICC email address. 

Getting the OFAC license was “a huge relief” for ICC prosecutor Eric Iverson, according to his lawyer Allison Miller. Earlier this year, before the association was set up, Iverson successfully sued the Trump administration so that he could continue his work investigating atrocities in Sudan. 

Before getting the license, Iverson couldn't provide legal or investigation advice to his boss, Khan. According to Miller, Iverson could not carry out “basic lawyer functions.” 

Iverson's lawsuit, and several others like it, “have only secured protection for those plaintiffs,” Hollis says. To get the same protections, every staff member would have had to launch their own individual lawsuit against the Trump administration. 

Hollis saw the need for a group to represent international prosecutors and set up the association in April. Her decision stemmed partially from her frustration with how the International Criminal Court handled the threat of sanctions under Khan, her former boss. 

Neither Khan nor the court took “steps to insulate the prosecutor and other sanctioned persons from the rest of the staff,” Hollis said, pointing that the ICC did take such measures when Khan's predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, was sanctioned by Trump during his first term.

When Bensouda was sanctioned, she shifted personnel management to other staff members to protect her subordinates and created barriers around American staff, who are more vulnerable to sanctions. After Khan was sanctioned, many but especially American staff felt as though their boss wasn't doing enough to shield them.

The institution has put in “a lot of effort” to “ensure the continuity” of investigations, according to spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah but he would not comment more specifically on the sanctions.

During a town hall meeting earlier this year, a staff member in the prosecutor's office asked the court would do anything to help American staff if they were arrested while traveling home. “No,” was the answer, according to multiple sources present, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.

Khan stepped down temporarily in May pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct.

A Treasury spokesperson who spoke on the condition of anonymity told AP that the Trump administration was committed to holding the ICC accountable for pursuing Israeli citizens. The spokesperson did not answer a question about why the department granted the OFAC license.

Yet after “back-and-forth” with Treasury, Hollis says, the organization was able to secure the needed license. 

ICC staff members who work on the two investigations targeted by the Trump administration — Afghanistan and the Israel-Palestinian conflict — are not eligible for a license. Otherwise, membership is open to prosecutors and other prosecution staff at any international court, not just the ICC. 

The group says it now has around 100 members and the majority are from the prosecutor's office at the ICC. 

Others targeted by the Trump administration also remain defiant. “We will keep the fight till the last breath,” Raji Sourani, the director of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, told AP after emerging from a meeting with the ICC last week. 

His organization, along with two other Palestinian organizations, Al Haq and the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, was also subjected to sanctions for having “directly engaged in efforts by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute Israeli nationals,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. 

Without accountability, Sourani says Gaza will become “the graveyard of international law.”

The Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican chairman has signaled his support for FBI Director Kash Patel. Patel is confronting skeptical Senate Democrats at a hearing likely to be dominated by questions about the investigation into Charlie Kirk's killing.

FBI Director Kash Patel clashed with skeptical Democrats at a contentious Senate oversight hearing Tuesday, defending his record amid criticism that he has politicized the nation's premier federal law enforcement agency and pursued retribution against perceived adversaries of President Donald Trump.

The appearance Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee represented the first oversight hearing of Patel's young but tumultuous tenure and provided a high-stakes platform for him to try to demonstrate that he is the right person for the job at a time of internal upheaval and mounting concerns about political violence inside the United States. Patel faced questions from senators about the investigation into Charlie Kirk's killing, the case against sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the firings of senior FBI officials who have accused Patel of illegal political retribution.

A man detained by authorities days after he nearly died in an Iowa shooting is one of a growing number of crime victims who have been targeted in the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. 

Felipe de Jesus Hernandez Marcelo was shot in June during an attempted robbery in Muscatine, Iowa, and has been detained since shortly after he got out of the hospital.

In January, Immigration and Customs Enforcement rescinded a policy that had shielded many victims from detention and removal. The number of people applying for visas that allow some victims to remain in the country has plummeted since then. Others have been detained unexpectedly by ICE as they go through the lengthy application process.

Trump is extending a deadline for the social media app TikTok to shut down.

It will be the fourth time that Trump has ignored federal law and extended a deadline for TikTok to go out of business. Trump has signed an executive order to keep TikTok operating, a day after he said he'd reached a framework deal with China to keep it operating.

The president issued an executive order creating a Presidential Emergency Board meant to resolve a contract dispute that nearly triggered a strike on the Long Island Railroad this week.

“Once again, President Trump is stepping up when Democrats have failed,” Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said in an apparent dig at Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.

Unionized LIRR workers voted to authorize a strike on Monday but also approved seeking federal intervention. The move pushed the possibility of a strike at least into January.

The Israeli prime minister says Trump had invited him to visit on Sept. 29, after he addresses the United Nations General Assembly.

It will be Netanyahu's fourth visit to the White House since Trump assumed office in January.

A group of Democratic governors is urging congressional leaders to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits. They write in a letter that letting the credits expire would cause harm that “will be felt for years.”

The appeal comes as Congress is moving toward a potential government shutdown, with Republicans and Democrats at odds over how to continue the tax credits that have made health insurance more affordable for millions.

The 18 Democratic governors wrote that “these subsidies are the only reason health insurance is still within reach in a country where the cost of living keeps going up.”

The letter was sent Monday and advised both Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate that “this isn't a partisan issue.”

President Trump says on social media that Republicans will hold the gathering to highlight “the great things we have done” since he was reelected in 2024.

The convention's date and location are still to come, Trump says. But he promised that “it will be quite the Event, and very exciting!”

Trump first floated the idea after news reports that the Democratic Party was considering its own gathering before the 2026 midterm elections to highlight candidates and garner attention as the party aims to regain control of both houses of Congress next year.

Patel has finished testifying after a contentious 4 ½ hour hearing before Congress.

The final round of questioning for the FBI director came from Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Tillis issued a call to both sides of the aisle, including fellow conservatives, to tone down the rhetoric in the face of escalating political violence in the U.S.

“How on earth are we de-escalating the situation with the tensions as high as they were last week with going out and saying we're at war?” Tillis said. “There are people out here on our side of the aisle that still need to look in the mirror.” 

The FBI director shouted over the California Democrat during questioning on how the Trump administration has handled the Jeffrey Epstein files and Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell.

“You are the biggest fraud to ever sit in the United States Senate,” Patel shouted at Schiff.

“You are a political buffoon at best!” Patel added.

Schiff tried to yell over him, saying, “You can make an internet troll the FBI director, but (he) will always be nothing more than an internet troll.”

Sen. Chuck Grassley, Republican chairman of the Senate Judicial Committee, pounded his gavel repeatedly, but Patel continued.

The feud between Patel and Schiff dates back years, to when Patel was a staffer on the House Intelligence Committee and Schiff was a House member.

U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois says immigration agents have arrested 250 people in the Chicago area since a new enforcement campaign was announced last week.

The Democrat is a member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations and got the information after a requested briefing with immigration officials. She shared details late Monday.

Underwood says the arrests began Sept. 6, two days earlier than a program touted as “Midway Blitz” was publicly announced. She says the operation would include the entire state of Illinois and neighboring Lake County in Indiana.

Top administration officials arrived in Chicago Tuesday, potentially signaling a more aggressive phase of immigration enforcement. DHS officials have not responded to questions about the number of arrests in the Chicago area.

Immigrants are being detained in various locations, sparking fear and leading some people to stay home. Advocates report increased activity from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with unmarked vehicles targeting work vans and staking out neighborhoods with large immigrant populations. 

One Metro Boston city canceled its Hispanic Heritage Month festival due to safety concerns. ICE's “Patriot 2.0"" operation follows a previous crackdown in Boston. 

The U.S. Department of Justice has also filed a lawsuit against Boston over its so-called sanctuary policies. Advocates argue the city's policy of limiting cooperation with ICE keeps the city safe and ensures Boston remains a place for all residents. 

Opponents argue challenging the federal government risks much-needed federal funding and allows criminals to walk the streets.

Patel had posted in the hours after the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk that “the subject” was in custody even though the actual suspect was still at large.

“I don't see it as a mistake. I see it as something -- working with the public to identify that there was a subject in custody,” Patel told senators.

He said he wanted to inform the public that a subject had been taken into custody, even though that person did not end up being the suspect in the shooting.

He told senators: “Could I have been more careful in my verbiage and said we had a subject instead of the subject? Sure.”Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, pushed back, saying it caused confusion by making it sound like authorities had caught the person suspected of killing Kirk.

Patel shot back by saying, “That's not what I said.”

A group of Democratic senators say they are deeply concerned that a Pentagon plan to allow military lawyers to work as temporary immigration judges will violate a ban on using service members for law enforcement and affect the military justice system.

The letter, sent to the military services and provided to The Associated Press, comes two weeks after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges. It is among the steps the Trump administration has taken to use the military in broader ways than previously seen, particularly in its immigration crackdown, including sending the National Guard into American cities and deploying active duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.

“These military officers would serve under the command and control of the Attorney General and would execute administrative determinations at the direction of the Attorney General,” according to the letter signed by 12 Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee. It added that “these actions are inherently law enforcement actions that may not be performed by members of the armed forces.”

Republican Gov. Mike Braun said that the redistricting conversation is “moving” and it's likely inevitable. But he doesn't want to call a special session unless there will be a successful outcome.

“I've been very clear, I want it to be organic,” he said in a video reported by WRTV in Indianapolis.

Indiana GOP lawmakers have been hesitant about redistricting while Texas and Missouri barrel ahead, emblematic of Indiana's independent streak. Braun said a special session could happen any time after November.

The GOP legislative caucuses met last week to discuss redistricting a few weeks after visiting the White House.

(AP Photo/Marc Levy, File)



Gov. Josh Shapiro says the nation must “turn the tide” against political violence and the belief that government can't solve problems while also rejecting vengeance.

Shapiro, a Democrat, delivered the remarks at the Eradicate Hate Global Summit in Pittsburgh. Shapiro said leaders must condemn all forms of political violence and shouldn't use violence as a pretext for more violence or to prosecute constitutionally protected speech.

Shapiro also criticized Trump, saying some people “in the dark corners of the internet, all the way to the Oval Office, want to cherry-pick which instances of political violence they want to condemn.”

In April, Shapiro and his family fled the governor's official residence in the middle of the night after an alleged arsonist set it on fire in an attempt to kill Shapiro.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said he has had no direct conversations with the White House or Border Patrol and reaffirmed that Chicago police would not collaborate with ICE.

“I get that people are feeling a level of anxiety, but they should be assured that we're going to work with all of our stakeholders to make sure the people of Chicago are safe and supported,” he said at a news conference following his signing of an executive order aiming to protect the right to protest.

The order states that, if federal law enforcement disrupts peaceful protests, Chicago police will “collaborate with protest organizers to develop a mutually acceptable alternative plan.”

Johnson said the order was an attempt to be “proactive” amid federal intervention and after protesters clashed with federal immigration agents Friday outside an ICE processing facility in Broadview, Illinois.

They unveiled a stopgap spending bill to keep the federal government through Nov. 21.

The bill generally funds agencies at current levels, though there is an extra $88 million to boost security for lawmakers and members of the Supreme Court and the executive branch. The House is expected to vote on the measure by Friday.

The budget year draws to a close at the end of the month, and Congress has yet to approve funding levels for the coming fiscal year. So, lawmakers will need to pass a stopgap measure to keep agencies funded while they work out their differences for the full year.

Democratic leaders have insisted that Republicans negotiate with them on the spending bill to protect health insurance coverage for millions of Americans. But Republicans leaders have rebuffed those demands and say those discussions are for another time and would not be part of the continuing resolution.

Any spending bill that passes will need some support from Democrats in the Senate as the measure will need at least 60 votes to advance to a final vote.

Patel and the New Jersey Democrat got into a shouting match as Booker charged that Patel is responsible for a “generational destruction of the nation's premier law enforcement agency.”

Patel fired back at Booker, telling him that he was an “embarrassment.”For several moments, the Republican chairman of the committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, pounded his gavel but struggled to gain control of the two men.

Still, Booker predicted that Patel would not last long in his post. He told Patel that Trump “will cut you loose. This may be the last time I have a hearing with you.”

Patel took the opportunity to give a fiery retort to Democratic senators who say the reason he got the job was his loyalty to President Donald Trump.

Patel's leadership of the FBI has been marked by turmoil and Democratic accusations that he's using the law enforcement agency to carry out Trump's goals.

But Patel told the Senate panel that it was “an entire falsehood” to suggest that he only got the job because he was a Trump loyalist.

Patel pointed to his experience as an attorney, congressional staffer and administration official, saying, “There was no loyalty then. There's no loyalty now to anything but the Constitution.”

Former Republican and onetime Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan is running as a Democrat for governor, a remarkable step for a staunch critic of Trump who left the conservative fold in a region where party switchers have gone in the other direction for generations.

“I've never wavered in taking on Trump. So Georgia Republicans threw me out of their party,” Duncan said in his announcement video released Tuesday. “I was leaving anyway. Now I'm running for governor as a proud Democrat.”

A 50-year-old resident of a Republican stronghold north of Atlanta, Duncan joins an already crowded field of lifelong Democrats. Top candidates include former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, state Sen. Jason Esteves and former labor commissioner Michael Thurmond.

Trump seemed miffed when an Australian Broadcasting Corp. reporter asked about his wealth since returning to office. Trump told the reporter, ‘You're hurting Australia very much right now, and they want to get along with me.”

He told the reporter that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese would be visiting soon and “I'm going to tell him about you. You set a very bad tone.”

The president also criticized ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl, whom he's known for years. Karl asked Trump about the attorney general's comments that she will be going after hate speech after the killing of Charlie Kirk.

Karl told Trump that even some of his allies say hate speech is free speech.

Trump responded by telling Karl the administration would “probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly, it's hate. You have a lot of hate in your heart.”

The House Select Committee on China says any deal between Beijing and Washington must comply with a law requiring TikTok to be divested from its Chinese ownership or face a ban in the U.S.

A framework deal was reached over the future of the popular social media platform at a trade meeting Monday in Madrid. Details remain unknown. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the committee's ranking Democrat, said he wants information on the ownership structure. 

“Underpinning all of our concerns is the Chinese Communist Party's access to American data,” he said. The social media platform needs user data to determine what to show users, and Krishnamoorthi said he would be open to discussions if the app is protected from Beijing's infiltration.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in an X post that she was on the ground Tuesday in Chicago “to make clear we are not backing down.”

“Our work is only beginning,” she said.

The news comes as Gregory Bovino, who spearheaded the immigration crackdown that sparked widespread protests in Los Angeles, announced Tuesday his arrival in Chicago, where residents have been bracing for weeks for Trump's promised immigration crackdown and National Guard deployment.

A senator asked if Patel would make a commitment to the agents assigned to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that they would not lose their jobs. His response: Your case assignment “does not dictate your career or your termination.”

Those comments are notable as the FBI director faces allegations in a lawsuit that he fired other agents and FBI leaders based on cases they worked.

Patel has refused to address the termination of those agents, telling lawmakers he won't discuss personnel matters.

The lawsuit filed last week says Patel told an FBI official that he understood the actions were “likely illegal,” but that he had to fire those his superiors wanted him to “because his ability to keep his own job depended on the removal of the agents who worked on cases involving the President.”

In a tense exchange, Sen. Richard Blumenthal accused the FBI director of lying when he told lawmakers at his confirmation hearing that agents would not be subject to political retribution.

Patel objected to the accusation, telling the Democrat from Connecticut: “You accusing me of lying is something I don't take lightly, but I'm not going to get into a tit for tat with you.”

The FBI director insisted that decisions to fire certain FBI agents were made by him, not the White House.

“Any termination at the FBI was a decision that I made based on the evidence that I have as director of the FBI,” Patel said. “It's my job and I'm not going to shy away from it.”

“There is no credible information — none. If there were, I would bring the case yesterday that he trafficked to other individuals,” Patel said, while also acknowledging that previous investigations of Epstein were limited.

Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said that kind of answer was unlikely to satisfy demands to release more information. 

“This issue is not going to go away,” Kennedy said. “And I think the central question for the American people is this: They know that Epstein trafficked young women for sex to himself. They want to know who if anyone else he trafficked these young women to.”

Patel said that the current case files only included “limited search warrants” between 2006 and 2007 because federal prosecutors in Florida had previously cut a secret deal with Epstein that allowed him to avoid prosecution for his previous actions.

Patel says the FBI has 35 open investigations into threats against judges, who have faced a sharp increase in violent messages in recent years.

Federal judges were targeted in 17 of those cases, while the others involved threats against state court judges, Patel said.

The FBI director said he's concerned about the problem, and the agency is referring cases for prosecution when it's supported by the evidence.

Judges have increasingly spoken out against threats of violence, pointing to worrying rhetoric from both sides of the political aisle in recent years and saying the threats have reached a new peak during the second Trump administration.

Johnson also defended employers who take action against employees whose comments go too far.

“That's not the government censoring speech, that's personal behavior and decorum,” the Republican from Louisiana said.

Johnson noted that Trump has been called “the most despicable names” and he urged all leaders to tone it down.

“Leaders cannot call their political opponents Nazis and fascists and enemies of the state because they disagree with their policy priorities,” he said.

Gregory Bovino, who spearheaded the immigration crackdown that sparked widespread protests in Los Angeles, announced his arrival in Chicago with a post on X.

“Well, Chicago, we've arrived!” he said. “Operation At Large is here to continue the mission we started in Los Angeles.”

Advocates for immigrants say they've noticed an uptick in detentions by ICE agents in Chicago as the nation's third-largest city braces for Trump's promised immigration crackdown and National Guard deployment. The threats have deepened dread among already fearful immigrant communities, which cancelled and delayed Mexican Independence Day celebrations. An ICE officer fatally shot a suspect trying to evade arrest last week.

Speaker Mike Johnson said a bill to avoid a partial government shutdown at month's end would not include health care provisions sought by Democrats.

“It will be a clean, short-term continuing resolution. End of story,” Johnson told reporters. He said the measure will be unveiled Tuesday. 

Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries has said House Democrats won't support a partisan bill that “continues to gut the healthcare of the American people.”

But Johnson said Republicans are not going to revisit their big tax cut bill that trimmed Medicaid spending over the coming decade, and said the looming expiration of tax credits for some health insurance coverage is a “December policy issue.”

“The same Democrats who decried government shutdowns under President Biden appear to have no heartache whatsoever at walking our nation off that cliff right now,” Johnson said.

The lawsuit against the paper and four of its journalists, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Florida, says several articles and one book published in the leadup to the 2024 election are “part of a decades-long pattern by the New York Times of intentional and malicious defamation against President Trump.”

Times spokesman Charles Stadtlander said Tuesday the lawsuit “lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics.” Penguin Random House, which published the book, called the lawsuit “meritless.”

Trump has gone after other media outlets, including filing a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the The Wall Street Journal and media mogul Rupert Murdoch in July after the newspaper published a story reporting on his ties to wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Patel was asked by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., whether the Kirk shooting is being treated as part of a broader trend of violence against religious groups, and Patel responded, “We are investigating Charlie's assassination fully and completely and running out every lead related to any allegation of broader violence.”

Patel also said that the FBI is investigating “anyone and everyone” who was involved in an online gaming chatroom on Discord with the alleged shooter. That chatroom involved “a lot more” than 20 people, Patel said.

The FBI director told Sen. Amy Klobuchar that he is “willing to engage and explore new ways” to address gun violence in the United States.

“Whatever creativity we can use to eliminate even just one shooting, one horrific death, I am in favor of engaging with Congress fully to do,” Patel told the Democrat from Minnesota.

Patel was later pressed by Klobuchar on whether he supports a ban on so-called assault weapons.

The FBI director said there are “instances on this legislation that could prevent future attacks” but said he would not “weigh into the creation of legislation.”

The FBI director says his agency, as well as the U.S. military and intelligence community, will be conducting a yearslong mission that seeks to use counterterrorism tactics against drug-trafficking organizations.

“We must treat them like foreign terrorist organizations post-9/11. We must treat them like the al-Qaidas of the world,” Patel told the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Patel argued that law enforcement resources alone aren't enough to dismantle criminal groups that traffic drugs into the U.S. and that the Trump administration is taking an “interagency” approach.

“Whether that's in a kill operation, a capture operation, a surrender operation, or a host nation takedown, like we did with the counterterrorism mission sets in Afghanistan and Iraq and Pakistan and elsewhere, we are applying that to the drug traffickers in Mexico and Venezuela and Colombia,” Patel said.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Tuesday he will seek a third term in the 2026 elections, hoping to beat the odds to become the longest-serving governor in a state where voters have usually said two terms were plenty.

“I've always tried to do what's right for Minnesota, and I'll never stop fighting to protect us from the chaos, corruption, and cruelty coming out of Washington,” Walz said in a campaign video.

Walz has been frequently mentioned as a potential 2028 presidential candidate. He sharply criticized Trump while touring early caucus and primary states after he and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris were defeated. But he told Axios in July he would not run for president if he sought reelection.

Questioned by Durbin on the recent firings of FBI agents, Patel said he would not get into personnel decisions and accused the Democrat of unfairly attacking FBI leadership.

Earlier in the hearing, Patel called it “absolutely disgraceful” to cite what the FBI director described as a “one-sided story” about the firings.

“Your attack on the current leadership of the men and women of the FBI is equally disgraceful,” the FBI director told Durbin.

Patel is facing a lawsuit from three high-ranking FBI officials who have accused him of illegally firing them in a “campaign of retribution.”

Neither offered any further on-the-record detail after Trump suggested the U.S. military had carried out an operation on a third vessel from Venezuela.

Asked earlier on Tuesday by a reporter about Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's angry response to two military strikes carried out by the U.S. military in recent weeks on alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean, Trump replied “We knocked off, actually, three boats not two.”

The Pentagon referred questions to the White House, which has not provided details about where and when the third military operation took place.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is a close ally of Trump, asked the FBI director what legal justification the administration is using for military strikes on Venezuelan boats that the president has said are carrying drugs.

Patel declined to answer, saying he would leave that to Attorney General Pam Bondi.

While Republicans in Congress haven't objected to Trump using the U.S. military to strike the boats, some are beginning to ask questions on how the operations are conducted and their legal justification. 

Still, Graham expressed support for an aggressive approach to nations where drugs are manufactured.

“We will hunt down every single one of those narco-traffickers,” Patel told Graham.

Durbin asked Patel about statements from Dan Bongino before he became deputy director of the FBI that the bombs found at the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee on Jan. 6, 2021, were an “inside job.”

The FBI director declined to comment on Bongino's comments, but said he found Durbin's criticism of Bongino “disgusting.”

“So you have no evidence?” asked Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

“I got a lot of evidence, and I'll give it to you when I can,” Patel said.

The person who placed the bombs just before the attack on the U.S. Capitol that day has never been identified.

During one combative exchange, Patel was pressed by the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee over an unsigned memo released by the Justice Department in July that said there was no evidence of a Jeffrey Epstein “client list.”

Patel responded with a dig at former President Joe Biden, telling Durbin: “Would you have preferred I used autopen?”

Republicans have accused the Democratic president of signing pardons in his final days in the White House with an autopen instead of by his own hand.

The Senate hearing is quickly becoming tense, with the FBI director repeatedly avoiding answering questions from Sen. Durbin on how the bureau has administered polygraph tests to staff.

Patel told Durbin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, that he wouldn't discuss the specifics of how polygraph tests are administered or what questions come up.

Durbin responded, “You have to have a decent memory when you come before a committee.”

The Associated Press has previously reported that agents and senior executives alike have been subjected to polygraph exams aimed at ferreting out disclosures of information related to Patel.

Patel brought up the Epstein files in his opening statement, seeking to address a topic that's brought criticism from some quarters of Trump's conservative base who want to see more information released about the probe.

The FBI director faulted the original case against Jeffrey Epstein that ended in a plea deal years ago. He says it involved a “very limited search warrant” and asserted that the Trump administration has done more to release all “credible information” they could under the law.

Patel also said Epstein had not been a source for the FBI.

He didn't acknowledge criticism that the FBI and Justice Department have faced in recent months over the abrupt announcement in July that they would not be releasing additional documents from their trove of evidence. 

The state's high court on Tuesday declined to hear Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' appeal of her removal from the case.

Trump reacted to the news by saying it was a “great decision” and a “rigged case to start off with.”

He also called for Willis to be jailed for attempting to prosecute him and several other individuals.

FBI Director Kash Patel appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his first oversight hearing where he is facing questions about the investigation into Charlie Kirk's killing as well as the recent firings of senior officials who have accused Patel of illegal political retribution, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)



Patel has concluded his opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee with a bit of a challenge for his critics: “I'm not going anywhere.”

The FBI director pointed to his experience as a congressional staffer and Trump administration official, saying, “If you want to criticize my 16 years of service, please bring it on.”

Senate Republicans have continued to express confidence in Patel despite criticism from some conservative commentators of how he's led the FBI's response to the killing of Charlie Kirk.

Democrats, meanwhile, will intensely question Patel over what they say is a highly politicized approach to the FBI.

The president reacted to news of the famed actor's death and said he made “seven or eight great movies.”

“He had a series of years where, there was nobody better,” he said.

▶ Read the AP's coverage of Robert Redford's death and legacy

The Illinois Democrat says both political parties “have a responsibility to bring down the temperature” and encourage unity following Kirk's killing.

In his opening remarks earlier in the hearing, Durbin said Democrats are not responsible for Kirk's death, just as Republicans are not responsible for the killing of a Democratic state lawmaker in Minnesota earlier this year.

The country is going through a period of division and political violence, he said, but “Republicans are not Nazis, Democrats are not evil.”

Patel's opening remarks highlighted his efforts to transform the bureau to focus on combating violent crime.

Patel said the FBI has arrested more than 23,000 violent criminals this year — an increase compared with last year. He also touted the FBI's efforts to target drug trafficking and violent drug cartels.

Critics have raised concerns that the focus on immigration enforcement and violent crime could divert attention from the FBI's ability to focus on matters like counterterrorism.

He has faced some criticism from conservative corners about how he has led the FBI in the wake of the shooting, but Patel told the Senate panel that his agency — “at my direction” — successfully brought the suspect in Charlie Kirk's killing into custody.

He also has touted the number of arrests made by the FBI, saying it represents an increase from the Biden administration.

“We are leading the mission to crush violent crime and defend the homeland,” Patel said.

“We're going to see what happens, because I hear Hamas is trying to use the old human shield deal. And if they do that, they're going to be in big trouble,” Trump said.

Trump in a Monday post on Truth Social said that he had read a news report indicating that Hamas would use the captives as “human shields.”

The Israeli military began a ground offensive targeting Gaza City on Tuesday, slowly squeezing in on the Palestinian territory's largest city that has seen block after block already destroyed in the Israel-Hamas war. Residents still in the city were warned they must leave and head south. The push marks yet another escalation in a conflict that has roiled the Middle East as any potential ceasefire feels even further out of reach despite months of diplomacy.

The president said, “they've been friends of mine for a long time,” called the king an “elegant gentleman” and said, “I think he represents the country so well.”

The president, speaking as he was leaving the White House, said that U.K. officials want to continue trade negotiations during his coming visit.

“They'd like to see if they can get a little bit better deal, so we'll talk to them” he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — For many dedicated sports fans, keeping up with their favorite teams has become a juggling act.

Activate an NFL package in August, unsubscribe after the Super Bowl and before the NBA playoffs get underway, then subscribe to the NBA's service. Grudgingly keep paying the cable bill because it's the only way to get the local baseball team. Throw in a subscription to ESPN's new direct-to-consumer streaming service for college football.

This patchwork of expensive subscriptions, cable packages and password shares is common for many sports fans, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, and it leaves them beholden to multiple platforms at a cost no one seems to like.

About 4 in 10 people who follow sports “extremely” or “very” closely use cable or satellite TV and a sports-only streaming platform, according to the poll, compared with about 2 in 10 people who follow sports “somewhat” closely.

For many fans — particularly those who want to watch out-of-market teams or follow regular-season play closely — there's no other option. Creating a more seamless form of live sports distribution means essentially rebuilding the cable bundles many have ditched over the last few years.

New services are emerging — most recently, ESPN's latest direct-to-consumer streaming service, which debuted in August — but for the most part, sports fans stick to multiple platforms and subscriptions. Sometimes, they choose instead to stop regularly watching a favorite sport or team.

The people who are happiest with the availability of sports events are the ones who use multiple platforms, according to the poll.

About 6 in 10 of U.S. adults who report using cable and streaming services say they are “somewhat” or “very” satisfied with the availability of sports events they want to watch, compared with just over half who use only sports streaming services and around 3 in 10 who just have cable.

John So, 45, was a relatively early cord-cutter, dropping his DirecTV cable subscription in 2020 in favor of the company's less expensive streaming service. So, who manages a pipeline supply fabrication business in Houston, said he appreciates the flexibility of being able to stream across multiple devices. 

But he sometimes struggles with video quality and turns to other streaming services — Disney+ with ESPN and Hulu integrations or Paramount Plus — when the quality of his DirecTV stream drops out.

And even though he can access almost all of the local Houston Texans games, he sometimes struggles to watch the local NBA and MLB franchises.

“I would say I'm content. I wouldn't say I'm happy (with the availability of sports),” So said. “Even though I'm not an avid watcher of regular-season games, it's sort of a feedback loop. The lack of availability of local games makes me not an avid watcher. The fact I need to pay an extra $15 or $16 a month for the local sports network package is a disincentive for me to become an active watcher.”

Serious sports fans are more likely to be using sports-only streaming platforms to begin with. People who follow sports “extremely” or “very” closely report higher usage of sports-only streaming platforms, such as MLB.TV, NFL Sunday Ticket or NBA League Pass. About 6 in 10 people who follow sports “extremely” or “very” closely use sports-only streaming platforms, compared with about 3 in 10 people who follow sports “somewhat” closely. Very few non-fans use these platforms.




Sports fans are also less likely to be cord-cutters, the AP-NORC poll found. People who follow sports “extremely” or “very” closely are especially likely to say they use cable or satellite TV, with about 6 in 10 saying they use traditional TV options, like cable and satellite. Approximately 40% of people who follow sports “somewhat” closely say the same, as did roughly one-third of people who don't follow sports closely.

The poll also found that sports fans are likelier to churn through streaming services than non-sports fans.

About 6 in 10 sports fans say they have subscribed to a streaming service for a specific show or sports season in the past year, while about half have canceled a streaming service after finishing a specific show or sports season.

People who follow sports “extremely” or “very” closely are especially likely to say they've subscribed or canceled for a specific show or season. That's also true of people who use sports streaming platforms. According to the poll, about two-thirds of people who currently use sports streaming platforms have subscribed to a streaming service for a specific show or season, compared with about one-third of people who don't use these platforms.

Randy Alvarez, 35, said he can get some of what he wants to watch on YouTube TV, an online alternative to TV. He got rid of cable in 2022 and hasn't missed it, but he described his approach as a “hodgepodge” of streaming, premium channels and password-sharing. 

The Los Angeles-based educator and administrator follows two out-of-market teams with ties to the Bay Area: the Las Vegas Raiders ( formerly of Oakland ) and the Golden State Warriors. But without adding on NFL Sunday Ticket and NBA League Pass, which he said are too expensive, he's stuck cobbling together what he can get from online streams and whatever is broadcast nationally. 

Sometimes, that means he's out of luck. The four-time NBA champion Warriors, at least, have games on TNT and ABC, Alvarez said. The Raiders? Well, not so much. 

Alvarez isn't alone in his approach. Nearly half of sports fans say they've shared a password or had a password shared with them, compared with 30% of people who follow sports “not very” or “not at all” closely.

One area where most sports fans are in agreement: It's expensive.

About half of people who follow sports at least “somewhat” closely say they are dissatisfied with the cost of the streaming and cable services they use, and about another quarter were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. 

ESPN's new ESPN Unlimited streaming, which was introduced at $29.99 per month, offers access to all ESPN networks and include expanded NFL-related programming ESPN received as part of its recent deal with the league. 

And, of course, ESPN makes that package available as part of a pay TV package.

Criminal profiler John Kelly weighs in on Charlie Kirk assassination suspect Tyler Robinson's alleged influence by 'dark' internet culture. 

Officials announced formal charges against conservative speaker Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin on Tuesday.

Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said that Tyler Robinson is being charged with several counts, including aggravated murder. 

""The murder of Charlie Kirk is an American tragedy,"" Gray said. ""As county attorney, I am charged with bringing justice to those who offend our laws.""

In addition to aggravated murder, the charges announced by Gray include two counts of obstruction of justice for hiding the rifle and discarding his clothing, two counts of witness tampering for instructing a roommate to delete texts and stay silent and one count of committing a violent offense in front of children.

Gray also filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, meaning the defendant will remain in jail without bail.

""I do not take this decision lightly, and it is a decision I have made independently as county attorney, based solely on the available evidence and circumstances and nature of the crime,"" Gray said. 

Gray said Robinson is also believed to have targeted Kirk based on his ""political expression."" 

Gray laid out the evidence against Robinson, detailing his actions taken after the shooting, including discarding clothing, hiding the weapon and urging his roommate to delete incriminating texts.

Authorities allege Robinson fired a single rifle shot from a rooftop sniper position, striking Kirk in the neck last Wednesday on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem, about 40 miles south of Salt Lake City.

Kirk was delivering a speech to a crowd of roughly 3,000 attendees when he was shot. He died later that day at a nearby hospital.

Robinson, a third-year electrical apprentice at a Utah technical college, initially fled the scene amidst the chaos. 

Investigators have reportedly tied Robinson to the shooting through surveillance video and digital evidence from his social media accounts, in addition to the information provided by his family. Gray said DNA evidence also tied him to the weapon and ammunition.

Gray also highlighted ideological motives, with Robinson's family and his own statements pointing to growing political radicalization. Robinson had voiced opposition to Kirk, accusing him of spreading hate, and left behind a note declaring his intent to kill Kirk.

His mother said Robinson ""had become more political… more pro-gay and trans rights oriented,"" Gray said. 

Gray also revealed a conversation that happened before the shooting where Robinson called UVU a ""stupid venue"" for Kirk's event and accused Kirk of ""spreading hate.""

In text exchanges with his roommate, Robinson also justified his actions as resistance to hate and expressed resentment over his father's strong support for President Donald Trump.

""The roommate received a text message from Robinson which said, 'drop what you're doing. Look under my keyboard,'"" Gray said. ""The roommate looked under the keyboard and found a note that stated, quote, I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it. Police found a photograph of this note."" 

Robinson was apprehended two days later at his parents' home, roughly 260 miles away from the university, after relatives and a family friend notified law enforcement that he had confessed involvement in the shooting, according to Gov. Spencer Cox.

Gray said Robinson's mother saw a photo of the alleged shooter the day after the assassination and noticed he looked like her son. 

""Robinson's mother called her son and asked him where he was. He said he was at home sick and that he had also been at home,"" Gray said. 

Gray added that Robinson's father also agreed that the shooter's photo looked like their son. 

""He also believed that the rifle that police suspected the shooter used matched a rifle that was given to his son as a gift,"" Gray said. 

Gray said both parents then talked about Robinson turning himself in and convinced Robinson to do so. Gray said Robinson also spoke with a family friend who was a retired deputy sheriff.

TIMELINE OF CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION 

FBI Director Kash Patel also revealed new information about the prosecution against Robinson, saying on Fox News' ""Hannity"" that authorities are going through Robinson's digital footprint and the people he communicated with leading up to Kirk's murder.

Patel also mentioned during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that the FBI was not ruling out the possibility of others being involved in Kirk's assassination.

Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby confirmed that Robinson's parents have ""fully cooperated"" with the investigation. 

While investigators have yet to disclose a motive, Kirk's supporters, including his wife Erika Kirk, have portrayed him as a martyr for their movement. Kirk, 31, was the co-founder and leader of the conservative student organization Turning Point USA and a close ally of Trump.

Memphis Tigers football coach Ryan Silverfield took a swipe at the Georgia Bulldogs on Monday over the program's spate of driving incidents.

Silverfield spoke out holding his players accountable the day after their games during an appearance on the Memphis Tiger Network. He said, in his talks with his players, he has a segment called ""not our standard.""

""We always start with a negative,"" he said, via On3 Sports. ""And the 'not our standard' is, 'Georgia wide receiver arrested for driving 900 miles per hour over the speed limit.' That's a weekly occurrence. 

""So, that's one of those things we'll show. You know, this guy at the USFL got a DUI, this guy at this college was shooting a paintball gun.""

The latest arrests within the Georgia football program came in March when wide receiver Nitro Tuggle was pulled over driving 107 mph, according to authorities in Georgia. Offensive lineman Marques Easley was reportedly involved in a vehicle crash as well.

Georgia was met with tragedy in January 2023 when offensive lineman Devin Willock and recruiting staffer Chandler LeCroy were killed in a crash that occurred while LeCroy and defensive tackle Jalen Carter were racing.

""There's things that surround each one of these outside of just the immediate reaction is, 'How in the world can this happen again?' And I get that, but each one is a case-by-case basis.

The consequences that come with those are based on a case-by-case basis. That's really what these two right now are doing.""

Travis Kelce was one of two Kansas City Chiefs, along with Ty'Quan Thornton, to wear shirts that read ""Free 4,"" a nod to suspended wide receiver Rashee Rice.

Rice, in his third season in the NFL, is serving a six-game suspension following his involvement in a crash where he was charged with collision involving serious bodily injury and racing on a highway causing bodily injury. He pleaded guilty in July, and as part of Rice's plea agreement, he received five-year deferred probation and 30 days in jail as a condition of the probation. 

Kelce and Thornton entered GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday ahead of their Super Bowl LIX rematch with the Philadelphia Eagles with graphic tees that featured photos of Rice.

The clothing caught the eye of March Lenahan, who represents one of the victims of the crash.

""I respect that Kelce and Thornton support their teammate, but the 'gym teacher' needs to talk with the history teacher,"" he wrote in a statement, referencing his engagement announcement with Taylor Swift, via WFAA. ""Rashee isn't Nelson Mandela or Pepe Mujica, men who fought for what they believed in. There is evidence that Rashee was going 119 mph in a $1,749 per day Lambo rental that had pot and a pistol in it, on a highway on Easter weekend.

""Free Rashee? He already thinks he's getting away scot-free."" Lenahan continued, adding that Rice has not paid ""a single cent"" of the $1.1 million settlement he made with his victim.

Rice was the driver of a Lamborghini Urus that was going 119 mph on the North Central Expressway in Dallas when he made ""multiple aggressive maneuvers around traffic"" before crashing into other vehicles, according to prosecutors. Rice did not check on those vehicles involved in the crash and decided to flee the scene on foot. 

The 25-year-old receiver said in a statement issued by his attorney that he's had ""a lot of sleepless nights thinking about the damages my actions caused, and I will continue working within my means to make sure that everyone impacted will be made whole.""

Rice has sat out the Chiefs' first two games, and they certainly miss him. They are 0-2 for the first time since 2014, as Patrick Mahomes is averaging just 211 passing yards so far. He is eligible to return to the Chiefs' sideline in Week 7, when they face the Las Vegas Raiders on Oct. 19.

FIRST ON FOX: The House Judiciary Committee plans to hold a field hearing in Charlotte, North Carolina, this month following the fatal stabbing of a young woman on the city's light rail that sparked heated debate about criminal justice reform.

The remote hearing is scheduled for the morning of Sept. 29, Fox News Digital has learned, and will highlight recent criminal activity in Charlotte.

News of the hearing comes after Iryna Zarutska's murder on Aug. 22 captured national attention. Chilling surveillance footage showed a suspect who was sitting behind Zarutska stand up and strike her with a pocket knife several times. Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee who was on her way home from work at the time of the incident, died on the train from her injuries, authorities said.

The Department of Justice charged the suspect, Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., in federal court. Brown had prior arrests dating back more than a decade and once served time for a robbery. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Brown will be prosecuted for murder and said ""soft-on-crime policies"" caused Zarutska's death.

""Iryna Zarutska was a young woman living the American dream — her horrific murder is a direct result of failed soft-on-crime policies that put criminals before innocent people,"" Bondi said. ""I have directed my attorneys to federally prosecute Decarlos Brown Jr., a repeat violent offender with a history of violent crime, for murder.""

All House Judiciary Committee members are able to attend the hearing. The panel's subcommittee on oversight will lead it.

The hearing was scheduled prior to another shocking crime event — the assassination of prolific conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which took place at Utah Valley University last week.

The field hearing marks the latest instance of the committee visiting Democrat-led cities to highlight grim crime rates and prosecutorial failures. The committee visited Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's jurisdiction in April 2023, a week after Bragg brought criminal charges against then-former President Donald Trump. The committee held a similar hearing in Chicago later that year.

Lawmakers at the hearings have examined prosecutorial policies, such as cashless bail, and highlighted recidivism and stories from victims and their families.

Charging and trying defendants in Charlotte comes under the purview of Mecklenburg County District Attorney Spencer B. Merriweather III, an appointee of North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat.

Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., confirmed the hearing in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying Zarutska's death was a ""culmination of years of failed liberal policies that put criminals ahead of victims.""

""This was entirely preventable, and we owe it to the people to fix it before another innocent life is lost,"" Van Drew said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","New York on the brink","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/daily-memo/3809761/new-york-on-brink-zohran-mamdani-mayoral-election/","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 17:16:15 GMT","

NEW YORK ON THE BRINK. Next year will bring the 25th anniversary of 9/11, and with it, an irresistible angle for journalists and commentators: New York‘s first Muslim mayor marks anniversary of devastating radical Islamic attack on city.

That mayor will be, of course, Zohran Mamdani, the socialist candidate with a huge lead over a fractured field in the Nov. 4 mayoral election. A series of recent polls suggests that, barring some huge, incredible, world-shaking unforeseen development, Mamdani will be elected mayor less than two months from now.

A new CBS News poll shows Mamdani with a 15-point lead, 43% to 28%, over former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, now running as an independent. Republican Curtis Sliwa is at 15%, 28 points behind Mamdani, and current New York Mayor Eric Adams is at 6%, 37 points behind Mamdani.

Even if Adams were to drop out, and there are reports he will, the basic structure of the race would not change.

Another recent poll, by Emerson, was nearly identical, with Mamdani at 43%, Cuomo at 28%, Sliwa at 10%, and Adams at 8%. A Quinnipiac survey has Mamdani at 45%, with Cuomo at 23%, Sliwa at 15%, and Adams at 12%. And a New York Times-Siena University poll has Mamdani at 46%, Cuomo at 24%, Sliwa at 15%, and Adams at 9%. Look at all the polls, and Mamdani's lead is anywhere from 15 to 22 points. 

One measure of how weird this campaign is is that even though Mamdani, the socialist, is running as the Democratic nominee, some top leaders in the Democratic Party cannot bring themselves to endorse their own team's candidate.

The election is less than two months away, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), both of whom live in New York City, have not endorsed Mamdani.

Indeed, only recently, on Sunday, did the Democratic governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, endorse the Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City. In an op-ed in the New York Times, Hochul said she had had many talks with Mamdani. She said they talked about public safety, religious tolerance, economic development, taxes, and other issues. 

Remember that Mamdani has either recently embraced or currently proposed abolishing the police, establishing city-paid child care, imposing a possibly business-crippling $30 minimum wage and sky-high taxes, and other so-called progressive policies. (On the other hand, he has recently stopped advocating “globalizing the intifada.”) 

“I did not leave my conversations with Mr. Mamdani aligned with him on every issue,” Hochul diplomatically wrote. “But I am confident that he has the courage, urgency and optimism New York City needs to lead it through the challenges of this moment.”

Perhaps Hochul is confident because she and Mamdani were completely, totally, absolutely on the same page on one issue. “I needed to know the next mayor will not be someone who would surrender one inch to President Trump,” she wrote. “Mr. Mamdani and I will both be fearless in confronting the president's extreme agenda — with urgency, conviction, and the defiance that defines New York.”

What could be more important? Yes, New York has some of the most burdensome housing prices in the country. People are leaving the city because they can't find an affordable place to live. Yes, everything else is insanely expensive, too. And yes, mentally ill and sometimes violent people make using public transit a risky proposition. And yes, public safety is a worry beyond the subways. And yes, there are lots of other problems. But at least the new mayor and the governor will be fearless in confronting the president of the United States. That's what really matters, isn't it?

New York has had terrible mayors before. To an outsider, it sometimes appears the city has a tendency to make a bad choice, suffer the consequences, pick a problem solver, such as Rudy Giuliani, to fix things, and then enjoy a new life, only to go off its meds again later and restart the cycle. Zohran Mamdani would be a new dimension in bad choices, and New York is about to find out what that means.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Dear James,

I am one of the luckiest people to fall victim to DOGE. I am a military veteran and 20-year federal employee who was able to take advantage of a buyout and early retirement. I have a husband with a military pension who was not pushed out of his federal job. This allowed us to buy our dream retirement home, where I spend my days reading novels and hanging out with my dog.

And yet: I feel lost and pointless. Ungrateful. Some days I can't get out of pajamas. I'm struggling to navigate the opportunities of my new life while witnessing the horrors unfolding in the United States and the world. How do I get past this ennui, and acknowledge the big while appreciating the small?

Dear Reader,

Stay in your pajamas.

In fact, stay in bed. Don't move. Don't go anywhere. And get that dog up there with you. Feel that lovely dog weight, dog density, as your dog settles and downshifts, grows heavy with unconsciousness, and makes the profound noises, the groans of contentment and secret multi-voweled suspirations, of a dog entering its sleep world. Let the dog be your teacher; let the dog be your guide. Deep-breathing animal equanimity, that's the ticket.

I think you might be suffering from some version of survivor's guilt. No doubt many of your colleagues had their jobs indiscriminately minced by the same whizzing DOGE machine that gifted you this painless early retirement. Meanwhile, the country you have served so well, for so long, is apparently separating into coagulated lumps of volcanic matter. And here you are in your nice house with your novels and your unscripted afternoons.

All the more reason, in my view, for you to let yourself off the hook. You don't sound ungrateful to me—quite the opposite—and you are certainly not pointless. The shape of your new life is not going to reveal itself unless you give it some space, which is going to require from you a degree of gentleness, both with yourself and with your circumstances. There are, as you know, a hundred things you can do, a hundred places where you are needed, a hundred places indeed where it would be impossible for you to be superfluous. But you'll get to that.

Right now I think you should deepen your relationship with idleness—which has a political value, let's not forget. A state of honoring your whims; smelling the roses; reading books; not being driven, harried, jabbed, guilted, digitally overwhelmed: At this phase in the culture, that's not self-care; that's revolution.

Collectively, we're heading into a sticky time, aren't we? The harbingers are everywhere. I was walking to the liquor store with my son the other day, crossing a large, downward-sloping expanse of a parking lot, when a hectic jogger veered into our path, flailed past us, and almost collided with the brick wall of a T.J. Maxx before self-correcting and zigzagging away. “Reality's breaking down, Dad,” my son observed. “That guy was like an NPC with a glitch.” (He had to explain to me what an NPC is: a nonplayer character in a video game—in other words, a character generated and controlled by the game itself.)

What I'm saying is: In the now-imminent uproar, we're going to need all the elements. We're going to need sane ones, and we're going to need mad ones, and leaders and loose cannons and daredevils and bureaucrats and the driven and the opportunistic, but we're also going to need some people who know how to savor the textures of existence. We're going to need you, in your pajamas, with a book in your hand and your dog by your side.

Making a thoughtful cup of tea,

James

A murder on Charlotte's light-rail was the culmination of years of failure.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The sort of violence that took the life of a Ukrainian refugee, Iryna Zarutska, on a light-rail train in Charlotte, North Carolina, last month is impossible to make sense of. But that doesn't mean that murders such as Zarutska's are unpreventable. Her killing represents a confluence of failures within the structures meant to keep people safe. The country's criminal-justice and mental-health systems should prevent exactly such incidents. But in recent years, these systems have been weakened, their efficacy deliberately reduced. No society can prevent all murders, but if these systems are restored, the prevalence of similar murders could be greatly diminished.

Such an effort begins with understanding more about Zarutska's alleged killer, Decarlos Brown, and the checks that should have prevented him from perpetrating such violence. Brown was, according to reporting, a frequent offender, with more than a dozen prior arrests. Those include two violent felony convictions, for breaking and entering and armed robbery (the latter while on probation for the former), and two assault arrests, including one for attacking his own sister. In spite of this, Brown was, at the time of the murder, free without bond in an open case stemming from his January arrest for alleged misuse of the 911 system. Much of Brown's behavior was likely related to his diagnosis of schizophrenia. He was homeless at the time of his arrest; his mother had evicted him because she considered him too violent. Lastly, Brown did not purchase a ticket before boarding the train.

Each of these factors—a history of criminal behavior, an open case, a serious mental illness, and a failure to follow the rules of the transit system—was both a red flag and an opportunity for intervention, which could have stopped Brown before he killed Zarutska. Several of those missed opportunities stem from one salient fact: Brown was a frequent offender. Repeat recidivists are responsible for a hugely disproportionate amount of the crimes Americans suffer each year. They are also easily identifiable, thanks to their criminal records. Both the criminal-justice and mental-health systems should be better equipped to root out such criminals, for either treatment or detention, or both. Doing so would yield enormous public-safety benefits.

Charles Fain Lehman: Trump is right that D.C. has a serious crime problem

Let's begin with a North Carolina judge's decision earlier this year to release Brown on nothing more than a written promise to return to court in the 911 case. That may have been needlessly lenient, but it's partly the result of North Carolina law, which determines whether someone is released mostly based on the offense that they are charged with, not their criminal history. In a more sensible system, a defendant such as Brown—with a history of mental-illness-related volatility and serious criminal behavior—should have needed to overcome a presumption that he should be held in jail pending a trial, meaning the burden would be on his lawyer to show why he should not be detained. In North Carolina, defendants charged with serious offenses, such as use of a firearm and certain drug-trafficking crimes, must make such a showing, but those charged with more minor crimes generally don't have to do so, even if they have an extensive record.

A better approach would be for judges to assess the totality of an offender's risk, including their criminal history. That can be done impartially using algorithmic risk-assessment tools, which use data on similar offenders to translate a defendant's criminal and mental-health history into a score that gives judges a numerical sense of the person's risk of flight or reoffense. Such tools have a track record of real-world success, as demonstrated in New Jersey, where the risk-assessment tool actually reduced the pretrial-detention population without increasing crime.

These tools don't always work perfectly—particularly because too many judges disregard their recommendations. But in an ideal world, judges would heed the assessment's ratings by releasing those who score low and remanding to detention those who score high. Doing so would ensure that demonstrably high-risk offenders are kept off the streets, and low-risk offenders do not have to spend additional time behind bars. Had this been done in Brown's case, Zarutska might well be alive today.

Backing up to before Brown's arrest for 911 misuse: Why was he free even then? He had a long list of felony convictions, including for armed robbery, larceny, and breaking and entering; he had also avoided federal charges for being a felon in possession of a firearm. At what point is enough really enough? Crime in America, as it is in other nations, is driven by a small population of high-rate offenders who do the large majority of offending. In New York City, for example, the top 10 most frequent offenders have racked up more than 600 arrests; just 63 people account for more than 5,000 subway arrests. Such people are either incapable of playing by society's rules or are refusing to do so. Unchecked, they make city life worse for the rest of us.

Charles Fain Lehman: New York City has lost control of crime

Curtailing such high-frequency offenders requires meaningful—and mandatory—sentencing enhancements based on their criminal history. Such a system would have offenders accrue points with each felony conviction. Reach a predetermined threshold—à la “three strikes”—and, depending on the nature of the charge that put him or her over, an offender would face a sentencing enhancement that could range anywhere from 10 years to life. The exact threshold would be up to a state's legislature, but the basic principle is that people with long criminal histories should be taken out of free society for longer than those without.

Such laws are often a source of controversy, shocking the public with high-profile failures (people committed to life in prison for minor third offenses) and raising concerns that the laws contribute to overincarceration. Smartly designed habitual-offender laws can address some of these challenges by making sure that only felonies, not misdemeanors, count toward “strikes” and by deducting points from an offender's total for each year they desist.

North Carolina does have a “habitual felon” law, implemented in the 1960s. But the law gives prosecutors discretion as to its use, instead of making the enhancement mandatory. The fact that the state's law failed, for whatever reason, to sweep up Brown suggests that it may need improvement. Many other states have no such provision, leaving them less able to sort out the high-frequency recidivists among their population.

Another aspect that necessitates examination is Brown's history of severe mental illness. Schizophrenia significantly increases one's risk of being both a victim and perpetrator of violence, according to a 2022 systematic review. Many people may believe that Brown's mental illness means his case should be addressed as a mental-health crisis, not primarily by the criminal-justice system. Whether or not that is right, North Carolina's mental-health-care system clearly failed to keep him psychologically stable enough to avoid him posing a risk to himself or others, including by not confining him to a facility.

One major factor in that failure is that North Carolina has grossly insufficient treatment capacity. According to the Treatment Advocacy Center, a nonprofit that supports assertive treatment for people diagnosed with serious mental illness, as of mid-2023, the state had just 453 fully staffed hospital beds for adults with serious mental illness—a 72 percent decline since 2007. People in jail must wait for one of the state's 82 “forensic” beds (specifically for people with mental illness in the criminal-justice system); the average waiting time is five months. North Carolina's bed shortage is particularly severe, but almost every state has some degree of a shortage, thanks largely to an obscure provision of the original 1965 law authorizing Medicaid that makes it nearly impossible for federal dollars to cover such care. Some states have responded by shifting patients to facilities that Medicaid will reimburse for treatments while allowing their psychiatric-hospital infrastructure to steadily decline.

Keith Humphreys: America's incarceration rate is about to fall off a cliff

North Carolina also has struggled with compelled outpatient commitment (sometimes called “assisted outpatient treatment”). Research from the state shows that “seriously violent” patients in AOT were significantly less likely to commit violent acts than people the study identified as “seriously violent” who were not enrolled. The Treatment Advocacy Center has criticized the state for its underuse of AOT in past years. AOT is infrequently used in part because when its patients refuse to comply with their treatment plan but do not meet the standard for involuntary commitment, the state has little recourse. State law currently prohibits forcibly medicating or treating people in AOT. The Treatment Advocacy Center also notes that family members currently have no pathway for petitioning to have their loved one placed in AOT—an intervention that might have helped both Brown and his mother.

Finally, consider where Brown's offense took place, on Charlotte's Lynx Blue Line. Charlotte's public-transit system has a reputation for danger. In recent polling, just 37 percent of residents of the surrounding Mecklenburg County described the system's buses and trains as safe from crime, and just 29 percent called the stations safe. That's consistent with research showing that extending the Blue Line caused an increase in crime in the immediate vicinity of new stations. But the problem isn't just in Charlotte. Although major crimes are declining nationwide, crimes on transit remained elevated through the end of 2024, according to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

How can Charlotte keep people such as Brown off the train? The answer goes back to his first offense of that evening—failure to pay his fare. People likely to commit major offenses underground also tend to commit minor offenses: fare evasion, riding bicycles or scooters in a station, or using drugs. In recent years, many jurisdictions have ratcheted back enforcement of these offenses on public transit. Charlotte is only now saying that it will add fare-inspection capacity, following years in which nobody checked tickets.

Although violent crime has been receding from recent highs, the murder in Charlotte shows how much work is left to be done. Policy makers should not downplay or disregard the cascading failures evident before Brown boarded that train. Rather, they should look for opportunities to fix the systems that so obviously failed, in ways that make them better for all Americans.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Student debt is hitting Gen Z especially hard.

A new FICO analysis found that the average American's credit score decreased two points to 715 since 2024, down for the second year in a row as Americans grappled with inflation, high interest rates, and changes to student-loan repayment.

The analysis showed that younger consumers, in particular, saw increased financial strains. Gen Zers had an average credit score decrease of three points, marking the largest year-over-year decline of any group since 2020. More broadly, 14.1% of Gen Zers had a 50-point credit score decrease in the last year. FICO defined Gen Z as 18- to 29-year-olds because consumers cannot have a credit report until they are 18.

Credit scores influence a consumer's access to loans like mortgages, and the better the score, the more likely it is that consumers will be able to get loans, rental applications, and higher credit limits approved.

""Gen Z consumers have had less time to build savings, and are less likely to benefit from stock market gains and home price appreciation,"" the analysis said. ""Instead, they are more likely to have affordability issues and more likely to face the impacts of higher interest rates and inflation.""

The analysis said that student loans play a significant role in the Gen Z data as well; 34% of the generation have open student loans, double the total population with open student loans.

FICO also announced in June that it would begin incorporating Buy Now, Pay Later loans into credit scores this fall. The analysis said that 29% of surveyed Americans said they relied on those loans to cover income gaps, suggesting credit scores could worsen as BNPL is taken into account.

Some Gen Z student-loan borrowers are entering repayment for the first time, and it coincides with a series of federal policy changes. President Donald Trump's administration resumed collections on defaulted student loans in May after a five-year pause, meaning that borrowers who are delinquent on their student loans are subject to negative credit reporting. They could also default if they continue to miss payments, putting them at risk of wage garnishment and seizure of other federal benefits.

Student-loan delinquencies are at record highs due to the policy changes. The New York Federal Reserve found that 10.2% of student borrowing was in serious delinquency, or more than 90 days past due, in the second quarter of 2025. FICO found that 6.1 million consumers with credit scores had a delinquency added to their records from February to April 2025.

FICO's analysis said that Gen Zers are more likely to face volatility with their credit scores because they don't have long credit histories and are less likely to make payments on time. This puts them at greater risk of facing the consequences of delinquency or default. But it's not all bad — the analysis added that the generation has the most potential for score improvement by learning to make payments on time and keeping balances low.

Along with Gen Z, all federal student-loan borrowers are facing big repayment changes in the coming year. Trump's ""big beautiful"" bill, which he signed into law in July, eliminated existing income-driven repayment plans and replaced them with two options: a standard repayment plan and a new Repayment Assistance Plan, which allows for loan forgiveness after 30 years.

It's less generous than former President Joe Biden's SAVE plan, which allowed for cheaper monthly payments and forgiveness after as few as 10 years of payments. Trump's bill eliminated SAVE, and the 8 million borrowers enrolled in the plan can either switch to a new plan or remain on SAVE while interest accumulates.

FICO said that delinquencies ""could increase even more than anticipated"" due to the repayment changes.

""On the other hand, consumers could adjust to the new reality of needing to make student loan payments to prevent wage garnishments, collections, and other negative consequences of not making student loan payments,"" the analysis said. ""This could also potentially impact the payment hierarchy.""

Utah prosecutors charged Tyler Robinson on Tuesday with aggravated murder in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said that he intends to seek the death penalty in the case against Robinson, who was also charged with felony discharge of a firearm, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and several other counts.

""I do not take this decision lightly, and it is a decision I have made independently as county attorney based solely on the available evidence and circumstances and nature of the crime,"" Gray said at a press conference.

Robinson, a Utah resident, is scheduled to appear virtually for his initial court appearance at 5 p.m. ET. He has been held in jail without bail since his arrest on Friday morning.

Gray said Robinson, 22, was identified as a suspect in part because his family recognized him in surveillance images released after Kirk, a married father of two, was killed last Wednesday during a crowded speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem..

""Robinson's mother expressed concern to her husband that the suspect shooter looked like Robinson,"" and Robinson's father agreed, Gray said.

Robinson's mother also told investigators that ""over the last year or so, her son had become more political and had started to lean more to the left, becoming more pro gay and trans-rights oriented,"" Gray said.

Robinson's mother also told police that he ""began to date his roommate, a biological male who was transitioning genders,"" the prosecutor said.

Gray also described a wide array of evidence that he said tied Robinson to Kirk's shooting.

Those included text messages between Robinson and his roommate, and DNA that was allegedly a match to Robinson.

Gray read aloud text messages that were allegedly exchanged between Robinson and his roommate after Kirk was killed. Several of those messages contained romantic sentiments.

Gray said the roommate told police that, on the day of the shooting, Robinson texted, ""Drop what you're doing. Look under my keyboard.""

The roommate looked and found a note stating, ""I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it,"" Gray said.

CNBC has not independently verified the content of messages.

Gray was uncertain whether Robinson had retained a defense lawyer.

Kirk's death has gripped the nation and generated highly charged reactions.

Many of Kirk's friends and political allies have felt intense grief, and politicians across the aisle have issued forceful condemnations of political violence.

But some, including President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, have blamed the ""radical left"" for the killing and signaled plans to crack down on groups aligned with that ideology.

Others on the left who criticized Kirk's right-wing politics while he was alive have continued to do so following his murder, drawing outrage from the activist's supporters.

In this article

Eli Lilly on Tuesday said it will spend $5 billion to build a manufacturing facility in Goochland County, Virginia, to boost production capacity for targeted cancer drugs and other treatments — the first in a string of new planned U.S. investments by the drugmaker. 

The company announced in February that it would spend at least $27 billion to build four new domestic manufacturing plants, adding to $23 billion in previous investments since 2020. Eli Lilly said it will announce the three remaining U.S. sites this year and expects to begin making medicines at all four facilities within five years. 

Drugmakers have been scrambling to boost their production in the U.S. as President Donald Trump threatens to clamp down on the industry with tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. Trump has said those levies will encourage companies to re-shore production after domestic drug manufacturing shrank dramatically over the past decade. 

In a release Tuesday, Eli Lilly said the new Virginia plant will develop active ingredients for cancer and autoimmune drugs, along with other advanced treatments. It will be the company's first dedicated active ingredient and drug product site for its bioconjugate platform and portfolio of monoclonal antibody drugs. 

Eli Lilly said the facility will particularly boost domestic manufacturing of targeted treatments called antibody drug conjugates — a type of bioconjugate that links a monoclonal antibody to a toxic ""payload"" to kill cancer cells. Eli Lilly is among several pharmaceutical companies developing or currently marketing those drugs, which drugmakers are also studying in autoimmune conditions and other diseases. 

""This is new capacity to allow for pipeline growth. We've got a number of new assets coming that will use both biologics but also these antibody drug conjugates,"" Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said in an interview with CNBC. ""This site will be unique in that we'll be able to make that kind of medicine for us — we don't currently have that capacity in the company — and even put it in the drug product form, so into the vial and ship it."" 

Ricks said the company will move some production from third parties and ""other nodes in our network, mostly from Europe,"" to the new Virginia site. 

Eli Lilly chose the state for the new plant ""because of the location, logistics, the workforce, and frankly, just a site that's ready to go,"" Ricks added. He said the construction had begun on the facility in previous years for a different industrial use. 

""Now, utilities and all those things are all ready to roll, and we're in a bit of a hurry to get these up and running as our pipeline is advancing,"" Ricks said. 

He said ""the main thing about building in America was really related to the tax situation"" rather than the threat of pharmaceutical tariffs, adding that ""it makes more sense to build in the U.S. than ever before."" Ricks previously touted Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for pushing the company to increase its U.S. manufacturing investments. 

That legislation, passed by a majority-Republican Congress during Trump's first term, was the largest tax code overhaul in nearly three decades and cut the corporate tax rate to 21%, among other efforts.

Eli Lilly said it will use advanced technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence at the site, which will ""enable right-first-time execution, all in support of the safe and reliable supply of medicines."" 

The company said the site will bring more than 650 new jobs to Virginia, including engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians. It will also create 1,800 construction jobs in the region, the company said. 

Eli Lilly's other U.S. plants include sites in North Carolina, Indiana and Wisconsin. 

The new U.S. investments build on the success of Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes counterpart Mounjaro, which have vied for dominance of the booming market for so-called GLP-1 drugs with rival treatments from Novo Nordisk. Both companies have funneled billions into boosting manufacturing capacity for those drugs, which has helped alleviate shortages of the treatments in the U.S. 

But Eli Lilly's new investments aren't solely dedicated to current and future obesity and diabetes treatments. The company is charting its future beyond Zepbound and Mounjaro, with hopes to deliver drugs from its broad pipeline of products for cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other conditions.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent brushed off recent reports of heated arguments inside President Donald Trump's administration, saying disputes were a part of the normal push-and-pull of policymaking.

""Treasury secretaries dating back to Alexander Hamilton have a history of dueling,"" Bessent joked Tuesday to CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""I think with the President's team, I turned out a little better for the Treasury's side this time.""

""With President Trump's team, just like any the great sports team, you can argue in the locker room, but we get out in the field and do the best for the President and the American people every day,"" he said.

Bessent's remarks come after recent stories detailed a series of fiery confrontations between him and other Trump officials, including Federal Housing Finance Agency chief Bill Pulte, over the direction of economic policy and influence in Trump's orbit. 

Tempers flared during meetings this summer where Bessent reportedly demanded to know why Pulte was bad-mouthing him to Trump, threatening to punch Pulte ""in the ----ing face.""

There was also other incidents of elevated tensions internally at the White House. In April, Bessent and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who at the time headed the Department of Government Efficiency, got into a heated fight outside of the Oval Office about the Internal Revenue Service.

A hedge fund veteran, Bessent became Treasury Secretary in January. Bessent, who has been leading trade negotiations for the administration, said Tuesday a trade deal with China is likely before the November deadline.

China's largest coffee chain is taking on the U.S.

Luckin Coffee, which unseated Starbucks as the top chain in China, is now making a big play in the Seattle-based stalwart's home country. As of mid-September, Luckin has opened 5 locations in New York City.

Luckin stores operate without cashiers, and customers must place orders on its mobile app. Although the sticker price of its drinks are not that far off from those at Starbucks, Luckin's operating model relies heavily on discounting by showering users with coupons in the app, typically in the range of 30% to 50% off. 

The company aims to expand its brand awareness with its U.S. launch.

Research from Bernstein suggests Luckin's current pricing levels and store volumes are not sustainable, as its initial stores are operating at a loss. That is not how its competitor Starbucks operates.

""Starbucks is always striving to be profitable on a single occasion... Usually, trying to target a minimum of 15% margin per store is our estimation,"" said Bernstein U.S restaurant equity research analyst Danilo Gargiulo. ""In the case of Luckin, the idea is I want to grow in awareness. I want to make sure that the brand gets recognized on a national basis, even though at the beginning, this means that I might need to be suffering from some smaller losses on a per store basis.""

Luckin Coffee's relatively short history has been fraught with controversy. 

The company was founded in 2017 and went public on the Nasdaq two years later. Its share price surged in its market debut, but the company quickly fell from grace as the SEC charged it with accounting fraud in 2020. 

An internal company investigation found that its COO had fabricated 2019 sales by $310 million.

Luckin was delisted from the Nasdaq and filed for bankruptcy less than a year later. Nonetheless, it emerged from the scandal with new leadership at the helm.

The stock now trades on the OTC, or ""over-the-counter,"" market, which is a less regulated exchange.

By 2023, Luckin Coffee crossed $3.5 billion in net revenue, surpassing Starbucks's Chinese operations. Since then, it has scaled rapidly.

Luckin currently has over 26,000 locations, most of them in China. Starbucks has around 8,000 stores in China.

Oops, something went wrong

Cryptocurrency-linked penny stocks have become some of the most explosive trades lately. Many small-cap firms are adopting Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD) treasury strategies to attract investors, a move pioneered by Strategy (MSTR) (formerly MicroStrategy) and now followed by a growing list of Nasdaq-listed names.

One of the latest entrants is Mogu (MOGU), a Chinese online fashion company that just announced plans to allocate $20 million into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana (SOLUSD). With this pivot, Mogu is positioning itself not just as a digital fashion player but also as a potential crypto treasury stock, blending e-commerce with digital assets in a way that could capture investor enthusiasm.

So, with momentum building and MOGU stock suddenly back on traders' radars, should you consider buying shares now?

Last week, Chinese fashion e‑commerce firm Mogu announced a dramatic shift in strategy, approving a plan to allocate up to $20 million of its corporate assets into cryptocurrencies. The board unanimously backed purchases of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, aiming to “diversify its treasury holdings” and bolster resources for future AI‑driven initiatives.

The announcement effectively transforms Mogu into a “digital asset treasury” (DAT) play, joining a wave of companies that are adding crypto to their balance sheets. News of the pivot triggered a frenzied rally. MOGU shares exploded more than 75%, jumping from roughly $4.4 to over $7.30.

MOGU stock hit multi-year highs after unveiling its crypto treasury plan, soaring about 120% intraday before settling near mid-$5, well above early-2025 levels. The stock was already up 113% year-to-date (YTD). Trading surged to 27 million shares, far beyond typical volume, as investors bet on crypto-driven treasury gains.

Mogu's pivot comes against a backdrop of a struggling core business. In its latest filings for the fiscal year that ended March 31, 2025, Mogu reported roughly RMB141.2 million in revenue (about $19.5 million), down nearly 12% from the prior year.

Mogu reported a net loss of RMB62.6 million ($8.6 million) for FY2025, up from RMB59.3 million a year earlier. Its operating loss widened to RMB101.1 million ($13.9 million). The company's gross merchandise volume (GMV), a key measure of its social-commerce platform, fell nearly 29% in the second half of FY2025 compared with the same period last year. Tougher competition and weaker user engagement drove that decline. Some areas, such as technology services, grew 54% year-over-year (YoY), but those gains did not make up for the drop in the core commission-based business.

On the balance sheet, however, MOGU is in a surprisingly strong liquidity position for a penny stock. The company held about RMB380.1 million in cash, equivalents, and short‑term investments as of March 31, 2025, roughly $52.4 million. It had essentially no long‑term debt, giving it a net cash position of over $50M. This ample cash cushion means Mogu can fund the $20 million crypto plan without drawing on external financing or leverage. Indeed, analyst services note a net cash per share of over $6.

The transition into crypto made MOGU stock skyrocket and helped keep the stock at higher points than ever before in 2025. If Bitcoin and Ethereum increase, their treasuries can improve by millions of dollars, and their influencer packages can gain access to AI and blockchain. But risks remain. A crypto crash would be detrimental, and the main business of Mogu has been experiencing declining income and hard competition in China. Crypto does not resolve poor fundamentals but does make them exciting. The rally can die off unless there is a proper increase in earnings. Investors ought to remain wary: the stock is speculative, subject to crypto swings, and will tend to decline should its e-commerce issues continue to affect it. Close attention should be paid.

American Express is blending travel and technology by introducing NFT passport stamps, allowing travelers to digitally commemorate their journeys. This move highlights the growing trend of integrating blockchain into everyday experiences, offering a secure, personalized way to preserve memories. By using NFTs, American Express not only taps into the digital collectibles market but also enhances the travel experience, providing a modern alternative to traditional passport stamps. This innovative approach reflects how technology is reshaping how we capture and relive our adventures.American Express has introduced a new way for cardholders to digitally preserve and commemorate their travel experiences. The company has launched a blockchain-based system that allows cardholders to collect digital travel stamps as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), marking the countries they have visited. This new feature, called Amex Passport, is designed to offer customers a unique and secure method of storing their travel memories while also tapping into the growing interest in digital collectibles.Advertisement  The travel stamps are built on the Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain, specifically on Base, which provides an efficient and secure way to store data without relying on a centralized server. Each stamp is an ERC-721 NFT, a widely recognized standard for unique digital assets, ensuring that every travel stamp is distinct and permanent. The stamps are personalized to reflect the highlights of each trip, allowing users to commemorate memorable moments such as visits to special attractions, standout meals, hotel stays, or unique experiences during their travels.To access these NFT travel stamps, users must hold a U.S.-based American Express consumer card linked to their online account. This limits eligibility to a specific group of cardholders, while the NFTs themselves are non-transferable, meaning they cannot be shared or sold to others. The travel stamps include only basic information such as the country or region visited, a brief description of the trip, and the date the stamp was earned. No personal information or detailed trip data will be visible to the public on the blockchain, ensuring the privacy of users.This launch represents a significant step toward integrating blockchain technology into the mainstream. Public blockchains like Base allow individuals and organizations to securely store and manage data in a decentralized manner, offering an alternative to traditional centralized storage systems. This move by American Express follows similar trends in the business world, where companies are increasingly looking to blockchain to ensure the integrity and security of customer data. For instance, the U.S. Department of Commerce recently announced that it would begin publishing economic data, such as GDP statistics, using blockchain technology.The introduction of blockchain-based travel stamps also aligns with the rising demand for digital mementos and commemorative keepsakes. A survey conducted by American Express found that 73% of respondents expressed interest in new ways to digitally remember their past travels. Moreover, 56% of those surveyed indicated they missed receiving physical passport stamps when arriving in a new country. These findings highlight a growing desire for innovative ways to capture and share travel memories in the digital age.Advertisement  The digital stamps can be easily shared on social media platforms or saved to a camera roll for future reference. In addition, American Express offers an automatic system where trips booked through the service, even up to two years prior, will be included in the passport, ensuring that no past travels are missed. This feature makes it easier for long-time customers to relive their journeys without needing to manually add each trip.Meanwhile, the integration of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology into the travel sector is still relatively new but growing rapidly. For example, crypto-focused travel platforms like Travala have made strides by offering cryptocurrency payment options for millions of hotels on Trivago, a popular hotel metasearch engine. This trend reflects the increasing acceptance of digital currencies within the travel and hospitality industries. Recent data from Travala revealed that crypto users tend to spend significantly more on hotel stays—around three times more—than traditional travelers, often staying for longer periods. This behavior aligns with the increasing flexibility of remote work and the rise of digital nomads who prioritize both travel and work-life balance.In 2024, it was reported that 14% of cryptocurrency transactions were directed toward travel and hospitality, signaling that the crypto community is becoming an important part of the tourism economy. More airlines are also beginning to accept crypto payments, further integrating digital currencies into the fabric of modern travel. This shift is indicative of the growing influence of blockchain and cryptocurrency on industries that traditionally relied on cash or credit cards.American Express's NFT travel stamps are part of this broader trend of incorporating blockchain technology into the consumer experience. By offering a digital passport that securely records travel history and provides a customizable, shareable memento, the company taps into the increasing desire for digital collectibles while also leveraging the power of decentralized technology. The ability to preserve travel memories in a way that is both secure and easily accessible makes this a compelling offering for a tech-savvy, travel-loving audience.As more consumers embrace digital currencies and blockchain-based solutions, it is likely that the tourism and travel industries will continue to evolve, offering new ways for travelers to engage with their experiences. The fusion of traditional travel with emerging technologies such as NFTs and cryptocurrency is setting the stage for an exciting future in the tourism sector, where memories are preserved in ways that were once unimaginable.Advertisement  Share On:Tags: american express, Blockchain, Digital Collectibles, NFT, Travel InnovationSubscribe to our NewslettersFollow Travel And Tour World in Google News

This behavior aligns with the increasing flexibility of remote work and the rise of digital nomads who prioritize both travel and work-life balance.In 2024, it was reported that 14% of cryptocurrency transactions were directed toward travel and hospitality, signaling that the crypto community is becoming an important part of the tourism economy. More airlines are also beginning to accept crypto payments, further integrating digital currencies into the fabric of modern travel. This shift is indicative of the growing influence of blockchain and cryptocurrency on industries that traditionally relied on cash or credit cards.American Express's NFT travel stamps are part of this broader trend of incorporating blockchain technology into the consumer experience. By offering a digital passport that securely records travel history and provides a customizable, shareable memento, the company taps into the increasing desire for digital collectibles while also leveraging the power of decentralized technology. The ability to preserve travel memories in a way that is both secure and easily accessible makes this a compelling offering for a tech-savvy, travel-loving audience.As more consumers embrace digital currencies and blockchain-based solutions, it is likely that the tourism and travel industries will continue to evolve, offering new ways for travelers to engage with their experiences.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","The Digital Euro: Innovation or Surveillance?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/the-digital-euro-innovation-or-surveillance","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 17:37:30 GMT","

The European Central Bank (ECB) is gearing up to launch the digital euro, a move that raises a ton of questions about what this means for both financial freedom and innovation. So, while it's being branded as a modern payment solution, it could also be a way for the state to keep an eye on us like never before. In this piece, we're diving into how the ECB's policies are changing the crypto game and what it means for fintech startups in Europe.

The digital currency scene in Europe is changing fast, with the ECB's digital euro stealing the spotlight. The aim here is to modernize payment systems and boost the euro's global standing. But this also raises some serious questions about personal freedom and privacy, especially with stablecoins making a mark.

As decentralized finance (DeFi) starts to gain traction, the need for alternatives to the traditional banking system is becoming clear. Web3 corporate banking is getting a lot of attention, and startups are figuring out how to use blockchain for cross-border payments and financial inclusion. The digital euro could be the bridge between centralized and decentralized finance, but its rollout needs to be carefully handled to ensure it doesn't choke innovation.

The ECB's regulatory framework plays a huge role in shaping the landscape for fintech startups across Europe. The goal is to create a stable financial environment, which sounds great, but the compliance burden can also put the brakes on innovation. Startups often find it challenging to navigate complex regulations, making them less nimble compared to more lightly-regulated competitors elsewhere.

On top of all this, the ECB's accommodating monetary policies, think negative interest rates and massive bond buying, have made traditional financing less accessible. For startups that need external funding to grow, this can be a real hurdle. But it's also a chance for them to come up with innovative solutions that meet the changing needs of consumers and businesses.

The biggest concern surrounding the digital euro has to be its potential impact on our financial privacy. The design could allow for significant government oversight and surveillance of transactions, which means questions about user anonymity are unavoidable. While the ECB talks a big game about privacy being a core principle, the reality is that they must comply with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.

The programmable aspect of the digital euro might let authorities monitor how we spend our money and even try to influence our behavior. The risk here is that this level of control could put off potential users, pushing them towards more private options like cryptocurrencies.

With the digital euro in the works, the role of cryptocurrencies in cross-border payroll solutions is becoming more important. Many startups operating in emerging markets find traditional banking systems cumbersome and pricey. Cryptocurrencies can provide a fast and efficient alternative for international money transfers, making it easier for businesses to pay employees and contractors.

Crypto payroll solutions are especially crucial for unbanked populations, giving them access to financial services that they previously couldn't tap into. By using blockchain tech, these solutions can promote financial inclusion and help individuals engage in the global economy.

As the ECB continues to tighten its grip, the question arises: will cryptocurrencies act as a buffer against state control? The growing scrutiny from regulatory bodies might push some users to seek refuge in decentralized assets like Bitcoin. The ECB's efforts to keep stability could end up driving interest in alternatives that promise more freedom.

It's clear that cryptocurrencies can still thrive despite regulatory challenges. As more people and businesses see the perks of decentralized finance, the demand for innovative solutions will only increase. The future of cryptocurrency in Europe will depend on how well regulators can juggle the need for innovation with consumer protection.

In summary, the digital euro is both an opportunity and a challenge for cryptocurrency and fintech in Europe. While it promises to modernize payment systems and enhance financial inclusion, it also raises questions about privacy and state control. The ECB's navigation through this complex landscape will be critical in determining the success of the digital euro and the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Moving forward, it's crucial for everyone—regulators, startups, and consumers—to have discussions about the implications of these changes. The future of finance in Europe is at a pivotal point, and the choices we make today will have lasting effects.

Galaxy Digital (GLXY), the digital asset investment firm led by Mike Novogratz, is planning to release a tokenized money-market fund, according to two people familiar with the plan.

The New York City-based company is aiming to bring a more crypto-native twist to the range of traditional finance-led tokenized fund offerings, such as BlackRock's BUIDL and Franklin Templeton's BENJI token, said the people, who declined to be identified. 

The Galaxy fund, which will debut in the coming months, will ultimately be available on the Ethereum, Solana and Stellar blockchains. That said, it won't appear on all three blockchains on day one, according to one of the people. Anchorage Digital is to be the custodian of the new fund.

“The overarching ambition is to use the power of tokenization to offer instant liquidity, and there's a lot of innovation around that to come,” the person said. “Galaxy has had the benefit of seeing BUIDL and some of the other ones out there in the market, and seeing who's engaging with these funds, how they're engaging with them, and how that could be better.”

A representative for Galaxy Digital declined to comment on the fund. Anchorage Digital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

BlackRock's BUIDL fund, which now has a market cap of around $2.2 billion, went live on the Solana blockchain in March after debuting on Ethereum.

Ethereum's proof-of-stake system is facing its largest test yet. As of mid-September, roughly 2.5 million ETH — valued at roughly $11.25 billion — is waiting to leave the validator set, according to validator queue dashboards.



The backlog pushed exit wait times to more than 46 days on Monday, the longest in Ethereum's short staking history, dashboards show. The last peak, in August, put the exit queue at 18 days.



The initial spark came on Sept. 9, when Kiln, a large infrastructure provider, chose to exit all of its validators as a safety precaution. The move, triggered by recent security incidents including the NPM supply-chain attack and the SwissBorg breach, pushed around 1.6 million ETH into the queue at once. Though unrelated to Ethereum's staking protocol itself, the hacks rattled confidence enough for Kiln to hit pause, highlighting how events in the broader crypto ecosystem can cascade into Ethereum's validator dynamics.



In a blog post from staking provider Figment, Senior Analyst Benjamin Thalman noted that the current exit queue build up isn't only about security. After ETH has rallied more than 160% since April, some stakers are simply taking profits. Others, especially institutional players, are shifting their portfolios exposure.



At the same time, validators entering the Ethereum staking ecosystem have been steadily rising. The SEC's May statement clarifying that staking is not a security has renewed interests in staking. Anticipation of ETH ETF approvals is another driver, as funds prepare for regulated ways to capture staking yield, Thalman noted.



Ethereum's churn limit, which is a protocol safeguard that caps how many validators can enter or exit over a certain time period, is currently capped at 256 ETH per epoch (about 6.4 minutes), restricting how quickly validators can join or leave the network, and is meant to keep the network stable.



With more than 2.5M ETH lined up, stakers on Wednesday face 44 days before even reaching the cooldown step.



Thalman believes that much of the ETH existing will simply be restaked under new validators, meaning that if even 75% of the current queue is re-deposited, nearly 2 million ETH will flood the activation queue, bringing delays for new ETH staking, and a backlog on both sides of the validator queue.



“The activation queue is currently 13 days, to this add the ~2M ETH from those currently exiting (35 days) and 4.7M from ETFs (81 days), and the total is 129 days. This assumes that there are no other ETH holders that choose to stake and enter the queue, like corporate treasuries,” Thalman wrote in the blog.



The swelling queue underscores a paradox: Ethereum is working ""as intended” Thalman notes, and the demand to both exit and re-enter highlights staking's central role in the ecosystem. The network is thus experiencing the growing pains of a maturing, institutionalized system where infrastructure scares, profit cycles, and regulatory shifts all collide in real time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Swiss banks complete first blockchain-based legally binding payment","https://cointelegraph.com/news/swiss-banking-giants-blockchain-study-bank-deposits","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:27:53 GMT","

 UBS, Sygnum Bank and PostFinance completed a blockchain study proving the technology's efficacy for bank deposits and institutional payment infrastructure. 

Some of Switzerland's largest banks completed a proof-of-concept (PoC) that tested blockchain technology and smart contracts for interbank payments, marking what they said was the first legally binding bank payment via a public blockchain.

Under the umbrella of the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA), UBS, PostFinance and Sygnum Bank conducted a feasibility study on blockchain-based deposit tokens and payments infrastructure, the SBA announced Tuesday.

The test initiated an offchain fiat money transfer triggered by payment instructions tokenized on the blockchain as a “deposit token.” The first use case executed a payment between bank customers of the participating banks, while the second tested an escrow-like process that exchanged deposit tokens for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) with automatically processed transactions.

The announcement touts the test as the first time banks have carried out a legally binding payment across institutions using bank deposits and a public blockchain.

The system's underlying smart contracts enable “verifiable processes, technical security, and compliance with regulatory requirements,” said the SBA, adding that public blockchains with permissioned applications can trigger “legally binding” payments.

While the results confirm the “feasibility” of institutional payment using blockchain technology, scalability requires “additional design adjustments and increased cooperation with other banks, infrastructure providers, and authorities,” the SBA added.

The successful study may signal more interest toward blockchain-based payment rails from large financial institutions, accelerating the convergence of traditional and decentralized finance (DeFi).

Founded in Basel in 1912, the SBA is an umbrella organization of the Swiss banks that comprises about 265 organizations and more than 12,000 individuals.

The study signals that interoperability between traditional bank deposits and public blockchains is becoming a “reality,” said Christoph Puhr, digital assets lead at UBS Group.

“This accelerates innovation in tokenized assets and makes it possible to actively shape the future of financial systems — both nationally and globally,” he added.

In the US, central banks are also experimenting with smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure.

In May, a joint research study by the US Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Innovation Center and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Swiss Centre, found that smart contracts could offer central banks flexible and rapid-response tools in a tokenized financial system.

“The smart contract toolkit was fast and flexible,” the BIS wrote. “In hypothetical scenarios, the central bank was able to add and change tools instantly.”

The BIS report also acknowledged that central banks will likely face infrastructure challenges, as most existing systems lack advanced use cases.

Weird ‘Time Crystals' Are Made Visible at Last

Time crystals, a state of matter once thought physically impossible, could soon be on a banknote

By Elizabeth Gibney & Nature magazine 

A time crystal as seen under a microscope.

Zhao & Smalyukh, 2025, Nature Materials (CC BY-NC-ND)

A time crystal is a form of matter that shows continuous, repeating patterns over time, much like how atoms in a normal crystal repeat in space. Examples once existed in only complex, quantum matter, but now physicists have found a way to make a time crystal that can be seen, under certain conditions, with the naked eye.

The feat, accomplished by physicists at the University of Colorado Boulder, and published in Nature Materials on 4 September, involved liquid crystals — bar-shaped molecules with properties between those of a liquid and those of a solid. Simply by shining a light on the liquid crystals, the team created ripples of twisting molecules through them. The ripples kept moving for hours, undulating with a distinct beat, even when the researchers changed the conditions. The rhythm was also out of sync with any incoming force — fulfilling the two defining criteria for a time crystal.

Although some of this behaviour of liquid crystals was already known, no one had previously considered whether it could be harnessed to make a time crystal, says Young-Ki Kim, a materials scientist at the Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea.

The macroscopic scale of the time crystal — at millimetres to centimetres across — creates opportunities “to provide deeper understanding” of the phenomena, he says. The distinctive patterns in the crystals could also allow them to be used in anti-counterfeit devices, say the authors.

Nobel-prizewinning physicist Frank Wilczek first proposed the idea of a time crystal in 2012. Wilczek's version was almost like a perpetual-motion machine; something that cycled endlessly while in its natural resting state. A team later published a paper that mathematically proved this concept was impossible, but researchers soon found that other kinds of time crystal were possible. Ordered time crystals could exist, for example, in bizarre systems that were perpetually in flux, rather than at rest.

Time crystals have since been made in a variety of ways, using interacting nanoscale defects in diamonds, trapped ions and simulated on Google's Sycamore quantum computer. But most examples have been at the microscopic scale.

The latest system involves shining a light, even that from a normal light bulb, on a liquid-crystal film trapped between two glass plates. When the light hits photosensitive dye molecules on the glass plates, they switch their orientation, which triggers molecules in the liquid crystal to begin twisting.

Intermolecular forces between rod-like liquid crystal molecules mean that they usually all point in the same direction. If some begin twisting, this sets off a domino effect: the molecules reorient themselves in a complex interaction that moves across the sample like a Mexican wave.

From this soup of molecules arise stable twisted formations that behave like particles. These particles interact with each other to create observable ripples. “We were surprised and excited to see that such time-crystalline order can be readily observed in soft matter systems,” says Ivan Smalyukh, a physicist at the University of Colorado Boulder, who led the work.

To observe the molecular dance in detail, the authors looked at the time-crystal system using a kind of microscope that transmits only polarized light. The amount of light that passes through depends on a molecule's alignment, revealing the time crystal's ripples as a series of dark and bright stripes.

The time crystal maintained its distinctive rhythm for hours, even when the researchers varied its temperature and the light intensity. Because the set-up can be tweaked to create patterns that are centimetres across, the effect can be seen by the naked eye, albeit with less contrast and resolution than with the microscope, says Smalyukh.

Because the pattern changes across both space and time, the system is technically a space-time crystal, say the authors. It unquestionably fits the definition of a time crystal, adds Smalyukh, but it does pose the question of whether other periodic effects also fit the bill.

The authors say that these time crystals are not just a curiosity. The thin layers of crystal could be embedded in bank notes as a way to verify their authenticity. Light passing through stacks of different crystals, each with a different characteristic pattern, would create not just a ripple in one direction, but a changing 2D barcode that would be extremely difficult to counterfeit and could also be used to store information, they say.

“We don't want to put a limit on the applications right now,” added Smalyukh, in a statement. “I think there are opportunities to push this technology in all sorts of directions.”

Math class could've been so much easier.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

From grade school onward, complex multiplication has been a headache. But an assistant professor from the University of New South Wales Sydney in Australia has developed  a method for multiplying giant numbers together that's more efficient than the “long multiplication” so many are taught at an early age.

“More technically, we have proved a 1971 conjecture of Schönhage and Strassen about the complexity of integer multiplication,” associate professor David Harvey says in this video. 

The Schönhage–Strassen algorithm, developed by two German mathematicians, was actually the fastest method of multiplication from 1971 through 2007. Although a faster method was developed in 2007, it's rarely used today. 

Schönhage and Strassen predicted that an algorithm multiplying n-digit numbers using n * log(n) basic operations should exist, Harvey says. His paper is the first known proof that it does. 

Harvey picks the example of 314 multiplied by 159—a large equation, sure, but much larger ones are used every day in real-life scenarios. To solve the problem, most people are taught to multiply each individual number together, and then add up the sums: 

This method is called n2 or n squared, because one must multiple n by n a number of times. It will get the correct answer, but Schönhage and Strassen designed a faster method. It was able to move beyond n2  and into something smaller, but a challenge still presented itself in the form of n * log(n).

For some, seeing a word in the middle of a math problem might be enough to make their eyes glaze over like they did in algebra class. As a refresher: log is short for logarithm, which helps people decipher exponents that make numbers squared or cubed or even something higher. So 2⁵ is 32, but expressed logarithmically, it would look like log₂(32)=5. While it may seem like a mouthful, logarithms are crucial when numbers get much larger.

The Schönhage-Strassen method is very fast, Harvey says. If a computer were to use the squared method taught in school on a problem where two numbers had a billion digits each, it would take months. A computer using the Schönhage-Strassen method could do so in 30 seconds. 

But if the numbers keep rising into the trillions and beyond, the algorithm developed by  Harvey and collaborator Joris van der Hoeven at École Polytechnique in France could find solutions faster than the 1971 Schönhage-Strassen algorithm. 

“It means you can do all sorts of arithmetic more efficiently, for example division and square roots,” he says. “You could also calculate digits of pi more efficiently than before. It even has applications to problems involving huge prime numbers.

“People have been hunting for such an algorithm for almost 50 years,” he continues. It was not a forgone conclusion that someone would eventually be successful. It might have turned out that Schönhage and Strassen were wrong, and that no such algorithm is possible. 

“But now we know better,” he says.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Earth has a few strategies up its metaphorical sleeves for creating new islands. The most well-known processes are magmatic hotspots where magma plumes from deep within the planet reach the surface, which created formations like the Hawaiian island chain over several million years. Then, you have the truly bizarre methods, such as mud volcanoes off the coast of Azerbaijan capable of creating islands seemingly overnight. 

Then, there are geologic processes that are a bit more middle of the road—not exactly spanning geologic epochs but not forming islands within moments either. Case in point is Prow Knob, a brand new island located in Alsek Lake in southeastern Alaska. Over the past century, this lake has seen a lot of changes, as a nearby glacier (Alsek Glacier) has retreated more than two miles, and the lake has grown to almost double its size. 

Lying within this lake is an approximately 2-square-mile landmass known as Prow Knob, named in the 1960s for its resemblance to the prow of a ship. As Alsek Glacier retreated, a process accelerated by anthropogenic climate change, Prow Knob started to very slowly form as an island. By 1984, the western part of Prow Knob formed a lakeshore, but it would still be another forty years until ice officially separated from the newly formed island. Based on satellite imagery, the separation likely occurred between July 13 and August 6 of this year, and according to NASA Earth Observatory, the separation of Prow Knob from the Alsek creation now makes glacial calving more likely in the region. 

Many of the most dynamic landscapes in the world were formed or sculpted as glaciers retreated across the globe—the Great Lakes and the Rocky Mountains are just two examples in North America alone. Compared to these examples, the creation of Prow Knob island may seem inconsequential. However, the natural processes that formed these other landscapes were millions of years in the making, and in the era of anthropogenic climate change, glacial retreat is speeding up, which can come with devastating and deadly consequences.

One of the more direct threats from glacier retreat is the increased likelihood of landslides within arctic lakes and fjords, and these can have dramatic consequences. In 2023, for example, a landslide in Greenland created a seiche that caused seismic waves for nine days. Eight years earlier, the 2015 Taan Fjord landslide in Alaska created a 600-foot-tall wave. 

And climate change isn't just limited to its impact on glaciers in Alaska. Another study published this week showed that permafrost in the world's Arctic regions, which are warming some four times faster than the rest of the world, are beginning to turn rivers orange as sulfuric acid, produced from sulfide-rich rocks interacting with water and oxygen, are dissolving toxic levels of naturally-occurring metals into the river. 

When it comes to climate change, nowhere will be left untouched—not even the most icy, remote corners of the world.

Pharmacological activation of STING holds promise in cancer treatment. A recent trend is the development of tumour-specific or conditionally activated STING agonists for enhanced safety and efficacy. Here we explore an unconventional prodrug activation strategy for on-tumour synthesis of a potent agonist. Leveraging the unique mechanism of MSA2, a small-molecule agonist that dimerizes non-covalently before binding to STING, we showed that its analogues bearing reactive functional groups readily and selectively form covalent dimers under mild conditions and in complex environments. We identified a reacting pair that led to a thioether-linked dimer with submicromolar potency in cell-based assays. Caging one of the reactants with a self-immolative β-glucuronide moiety resulted in a two-component prodrug system that near-exclusively formed the active compounds in tumours overexpressing β-glucuronidase. These results exemplify the use of small-molecule recognition for on-site generation of active compounds from benign precursors.

Misplaced cytosolic DNA in mammalian cells is commonly related to pathogen invasion, mitochondrial leakage and chromatin damage1. Their presence is thus closely monitored by cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), a pattern recognition receptor that binds to double-stranded DNA in a sequence-independent manner and subsequently activates the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) through the synthesis of the cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) messenger 2′,3′-cGAMP2,3,4,5. As an adaptor protein, STING scaffolds the phosphorylation of downstream effectors, including TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which induce the secretion of type-I interferons and other proinflammatory cytokines to elicit immune responses against the infected or damaged cells1,6,7.

Recently, pharmacological activation of STING has emerged as a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy8,9,10. In animal models, STING agonists could induce tumour regression, promote macrophage repolarization and establish long-term protection by tumour-specific memory T cells8,9,10. Despite their antitumour effects, first-generation STING agonists based on modified CDNs have demonstrated moderate success in clinical trials, and their administration route is limited solely to intratumoural injections11,12. Efforts to discover non-CDN STING agonists suitable for systemic administration have led to several novel small molecules potentially applicable to a broader range of malignancies13,14,15. However, possible side effects of indiscriminate STING activation in both healthy and cancerous tissues remain a potential risk that limits their therapeutic index, as mutations that hyperactivate the cGAS–STING pathway are known to cause severe autoimmune diseases16,17. STING agonist overdosing could also lead to the apoptosis of T cells, which probably contributed to the failure to establish durable anticancer immunity in some studies18,19,20,21. Moreover, instead of promoting immunity against tumours, STING activation in B cells induced the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-35 that impeded the actions of NK cells and led to poorer outcomes in mouse models22. These reports suggest that strategies for minimizing off-target STING activation could be vital in further developing STING-based therapeutics.

Several methods for tumour- or cell-type-specific delivery of STING agonists have been reported, including virus-like particles, HEK293-derived extracellular vesicles and antibody–STING agonist conjugates23,24,25,26. Of note, STING agonists combined with these delivery systems compared with the free drugs generally showed superior survival benefits in animal models while requiring lower doses, reinforcing the notion that non-specific activation could be the major obstacle in STING-based therapies. As an alternative to these macromolecule-based strategies, we seek to develop a small-molecule-based prodrug responsive to enzymes overexpressed in the tumour microenvironment (TME), thereby enabling a preferential activation of the STING agonist in the tumour.

MSA2 is a small-molecule non-CDN STING agonist discovered by scientists at Merck15. Under physiological conditions, it forms a weakly associated (KD = 18 mM) non-covalent dimer by stacking the aromatic ring. The non-covalent dimer then binds to and activates STING (Fig. 1a). Inspired by this unique mechanism of action, we designed a two-component prodrug system for tumour-specific, on-site synthesis of a potent STING agonist (Fig. 1b). An MSA2 analogue bearing a caged nucleophile would be administered systematically and uncaged by enzymes overexpressed in the TME, leading to a preferential accumulation of the free nucleophile in the tumour. Another MSA2 analogue bearing an electrophile would be administered intratumourally, which would dimerize non-covalently with its nucleophilic counterpart and facilitate the ligation between them, forming a covalently linked, active dimer in situ. Conventional enzyme-responsive prodrugs for cancer treatment face the hurdle of inadequate tumour specificity due to expressions of the triggering enzymes in healthy tissues27,28. The administration site of the second component, therefore, serves to further confine drug activation to the tumour. Moreover, individual components could be rendered benign compared with the parent MSA2 by their nucleophilic or electrophilic modifications, thus further increasing the safety profile of the two-component system.

We first synthesized several MSA2 analogues having either a thiol (N1), a vinyl sulfonamide (E1), a chloroacetamide (E2), an acrylamide (E3) or a half-mustard (E4) installed at the 5-methoxy group of MSA2 (Fig. 2a). As the 5-methoxy groups of the monomers are facing each other in the crystal structure of MSA2-bound STING (PDB: 6UKM), their positions are a natural choice of sites for linker attachment. The ligation reactions between nucleophile N1 and electrophile E1, E2 and E4 near-quantitatively afforded the desired dimers even at a low concentration (50 µM) and under mild conditions (pH 7, 37 °C) (Fig. 2b). Because MSA2 is known to dimerize in aqueous solutions, we hypothesized that, through proximity effects, such non-covalent interactions could lead to enhanced reaction rates between the analogues compared with those between N1 and a panel of non-specific electrophiles (Fig. 2c).

Each reacting pair (50 μM) was allowed to react for 2 h under physiological conditions (37 °C, 10 mM NaPi pH 7, 150 mM NaCl).

Conveniently, N1 exists primarily in its deprotonated form at neutral pH with strong absorption at 410 nm that diminishes after alkylation, allowing straightforward measurements of the rate constants using a published colorimetric assay29 (Fig. 2d,e). 2-Nitro-5-thiobenzoate (TNB2−) was used as a non-specific thiol to benchmark the intrinsic reactivities of the electrophiles. E4 and C6 demonstrated much faster alkylation rates of TNB2−, reflecting the higher reactivities expected for half-mustards. Likewise, similar alkylation rates were observed for the milder chloroacetamides, differing in most cases by no larger than twofold. These benchmarking results suggested that the intrinsic reactivities of the electrophiles were not substantially impacted by the MSA2 scaffold. While the same trend of reactivities was preserved for the alkylation of N1 by C2 to C5, clear rate enhancements were observed for the analogues E1 and particularly E2, which we believe could be attributed to the proximity effects induced by the dimerizing interactions. Among the non-specific electrophiles, C1 also showed an increased alkylation rate, albeit to a lesser extent. It remained possible that its rather hydrophobic aromatic ring could stack with the MSA2 scaffold of N1 as well and thus benefit from similar rate acceleration. Curiously, despite having the highest reactivities as indicated by TNB2−, alkylation rates of N1 by E4 or C6 were mediocre compared with the rest of the electrophiles.

To further investigate the eccentric behaviour of E4, we carried out a competition assay where equimolar mixtures of E4 and C1–6 (50 μM) competed for one equivalent of N1 (50 μM) (Fig. 2f). Surprisingly, in all cases, E4 prevailed, forming the covalent dimer as the major product. Such product distributions could not be explained in terms of their apparent second-order rate constants, as even the most reactive competitor, C1, merely reduced the amount of dimer by 35%. These results hinted that even weak interactions between the reactants could profoundly impact their selectivity. To ascertain that the thiol-modified structures of N1 and E4 were still capable of engaging in the same stacking interactions of MSA2, we incubated E4-ctrl, a non-reactive analogue of E4, with increasing concentrations of N1 and observed the resulting perturbations of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts (Fig. 2g). Indeed, protons close to the thiophene moiety (b, c, d and e) experienced dose-dependent shielding by the addition of N1, while the remote protons (a and f) showed no such effects, in agreement with the proposed spatial arrangement of the stacking monomers. Overall, the model reactions of the MSA2 analogues showed that they could efficiently and selectively form the desired covalent dimer under physiologically relevant conditions, providing the basis for further developing our two-component prodrug.

We next tested purified covalent dimers of the reacting analogues on THP-1 Lucia ISG cells, a commercially available human monocyte cell line engineered for monitoring the interferon pathway. While other dimers were inactive, a thioether-containing covalent compound SCS2 (Fig. 3a), formed from N1 and E4, induced the interferon pathway with an half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.71 µM; by comparison, the MSA2 parent molecule had an EC50 of 15 μM (Fig. 3b, left). The binding constant between SC2S and purified human wild-type STING was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to be 176 nM (Fig. 3b, right). Similar to the endogenous ligand 2′,3′-cGAMP, the reaction was highly endothermic, suggesting that both ligands induced substantial conformational change typical of STING activation3. Western blotting of THP-1 Lucia ISG treated with SC2S confirmed the phosphorylation of major STING pathway proteins (Fig. 3c).

Because thioether linkages represent a previously unexplored chemical space of MSA2, we synthesized a series of sulfur-containing dimers D1–7 with systematically varied lengths to gain further insight into their structure–activity relationship (SAR) (Fig. 3d,e). Three-atom linkages appeared to be optimal, with D2, D5 and D7 being the most active compounds in the THP-1 assay. Either shortening (D1) or lengthening the linker (D3) by one atom led to impaired cellular activities. Interestingly, their binding constants to purified STING ligand-binding domain (LBD) did not seem to correlate completely with their cellular EC50, a phenomenon reported previously15. Further lengthening of the linker (D4 and D6) completely abolished their activities. One-microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that thio-containing linkers with four or fewer atoms benefit from more favourable interactions (for example, CH-π with Y167) and greater numbers of hydrogen bonds (Extended Data Fig. 3). Co-crystal structure of D5 and STING LBD (Fig. 3f, left, PDB: 9QVT) revealed a closed-lid conformation similar to that induced by 2′,3′-cGAMP (PDB: 4KSY). Well-preserved interactions with residues such as R232, R238 and T263 were observed (Fig. 3f, right). In comparison with STING bound by MSA2 (Extended Data Fig. 4, PDB: 6UKM), the covalent linkage in D5 seems to allow for slightly more intimate packing between the benzothiophene rings, thereby promoting STING closure.

A prerequisite of our prodrug strategy is the efficient formation of the active dimer in more complex environments. We first conducted the dimerization reaction in the presence of excessive glutathione, an endogenous thiol that could potentially compete for E4 (Extended Data Fig. 5). No glutathione–E4 adduct was detected, while the formation of SC2S remained largely unaffected. We next tested the dilution limit of the N1–E4 reaction that could still form effective levels of SC2S (Fig. 3g). Components N1 and E4 serially diluted in foetal bovine serum (FBS)-containing growth medium were combined at various concentrations and seeded with THP-1 cells to stimulate IFN-β secretions, the levels of which corresponded to the strengths of STING activation. Strong responses were observed even when N1 and E4 were combined at single-digit micromolar concentrations, demonstrating the robustness of the reaction. Importantly, neither N1 nor E4 alone showed any STING activation up to 64 μM, confirming that the individual components of our prodrug system were rendered benign by the introduction of the nucleophilic or electrophilic substituent. Together, these results provided in vitro evidence that N1 and E4 efficiently reacted at low micromolar concentrations and under physiological conditions to form the active SC2S dimer.

β-Glucuronidase is an enzyme overexpressed in various cancers, particularly in the necrotic areas of solid tumours30,31. Its activity to cleave β-glucuronides has led to the design of numerous cancer-specific prodrugs and turn-on imaging probes32,33,34,35. Following a published procedure on synthesizing chloromethyl glycosides, we masked the free thiol of N1 with a β glucuronidase-cleavable moiety36. Upon cleavage of the glycosidic bond of the pronucleophile β-GlcA-N1, a hemithioacetal intermediate is released, which would spontaneously collapse in aqueous environments, generating in the process one molecule each of formaldehyde and N1. The uncaged N1 could then react with E4 to form the active SC2S dimer (Fig. 4a). We hypothesized that N1 would preferentially accumulate in TMEs overexpressing β-glucuronidase, while intratumoural administration of E4 would further enhance the tumour specificity by localizing the formation of the active STING agonist.

a, Cleavage of the glycosidic bond of β-GlcA-N1 (caged N1) releases a hemithioacetal, which collapses in aqueous environments and liberate the free N1.

The specificity of the β-GlcA-N1/E4 prodrug system was first confirmed by reaction assays in a phosphate buffer (Fig. 4b). In the presence of β-glucuronidase, clean and near-quantitative formation of the active SC2S agonist was observed within 2 h. By contrast, β-GlcA-N1 remained stable under the same conditions without the added enzyme, whereas most E4 underwent hydrolysis. No hemithioacetal intermediate was found in the reaction mixture, suggesting it rapidly degraded to release N1 under physiological conditions. The stability of β-GlcA-N1 was further assessed in human plasma (Extended Data Fig. 6). After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, more than 90% of β-GlcA-N1 remained intact. The Michaelis–Menten kinetics of the glycosidic bond-cleavage reaction determined with purified human β-glucuronidase yielded Km and kcat values close to those of previously reported substrates, indicating that the hemithioacetal spacer and the N1 moiety were well accommodated by the enzyme37 (Fig. 4c). The β-GlcA-N1/E4 system was then tested on THP-1 Lucia cells (Fig. 4d). The addition of β-glucuronidase to the culture medium resulted in significantly increased secretions of cytokines downstream of the STING pathway, including interferon-β, CXCL-10 and IL-6 (test group A). Swapping E4 for E4-ctrl (see Fig. 2g for the structure of E4-ctrl) diminished the cytokine inductions, supporting the idea that the linked dimer SC2S was the active compound (test group B). Neither β-GlcA-N1 nor E4 alone activated STING (test group C), although the commercial enzyme used in our study mildly stimulated the secretion of IL-6, which we attributed to the signalling of immune pathways other than STING (test group D). These results provide evidence of the in vitro functionality of the β-GlcA-N1/E4 two-component prodrug system.

We next tested the in vivo efficacy of the β-GlcA-N1/E4 prodrug system on a zebrafish xenograft model38,39. Compounds were first assessed for their maximum tolerated concentrations (MTC) on non-tumour zebrafish larvae to determine the treatment dosages (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Fluorescently labelled Hs578T cells (a triple-negative breast cancer cell line) were xenotransplanted into the perivitelline space (PVS) of 2 days postfertilization (dpf) zebrafish embryos, which after 24 h were treated with various compounds and analysed at 4 days postinjection (dpi) by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5a).

At 1 dpi, xenografts were randomly distributed into five treatment groups: DMSO, MSA2 (15 μM), SC2S (0.62 μM), β-GlcA-N1/E4 (20 μM each) and β-GlcA-N1/E4 + enzyme (20 μM each + 250 units ml−1 of β-glucuronidase) with daily renewal of the compounds. At 4 dpi (3 dpt), xenografts were fixed and analysed for apoptosis, tumour size, phagocytosis and macrophage infiltration. Macrophage polarization analysis was performed at 2 dpi (1 dpt) and 4 dpi (3 dpt) by live imaging. All compounds were administrated at concentrations below their MTCs (Extended Data Fig. 7a). mac, macrophages; enz, enzyme (β-glucuronidase). b, Treated xenografts at 4 dpi.

Treatments of xenografts with either MSA2 or purified SC2S dimer significantly induced apoptosis, as indicated by elevated levels of activated Caspase 3 (Fig. 5b,c). Unexpectedly, the β-GlcA-N1/E4 combination failed to induce apoptosis, although adding β-glucuronidase to the medium restored their activity. It was likely that insufficient expression levels of the enzyme in the tumours limited the activation of the prodrug system. Reduction in tumour size was observed across all treatment groups that induced apoptosis, consistent with the tumour-ablating effect of previously reported STING agonists when given at high doses14,15,21 (Fig. 5d). A key feature of STING agonist-based treatments is the inflammation of the TME, which promotes macrophage infiltration and their repolarization from the immunosuppressive M2 to the proinflammatory M1 phenotype9. To study the immunomodulatory effects of our prodrug system, a transgenic zebrafish line with mCherry-expressing macrophages (Tg(mpeg1:mcherry-F)) was xenotransplanted with Hs578T cells and treated with the β-GlcA-N1/E4 prodrug system or control compounds (Fig. 5e,f). All treatments significantly increased tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), although for β-GlcA-N1/E4 the effect was more pronounced in the presence of added β-glucuronidase. A distinguishing feature of M1-like macrophages is the expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)40,41. Therefore, we utilized the double-transgenic zebrafish line Tg(mpeg1:mCherry-F; tnfa:eGFP-F) expressing mCherry in macrophages and eGFP under the control of the tnfa promoter to quantify the M1-like subpopulation of the macrophages within the xenograft tumours (Fig. 5g–i). In the presence of added β-glucuronidase, the β-GlcA-N1/E4 combination potently polarized the macrophages towards the M1-like phenotype (mpeg and TNF positive, yellow) at 1 day posttreatment (dpt); the effect remained unabated even at 3 dpt compared with that of the control compounds MSA2 and SC2S dimer. In addition, the macrophages showed increased phagocytic activities accompanying their M2-to-M1 repolarizations (Extended Data Fig. 7b).

Together, these results suggest that, contrary to our expectations, the expression levels of β-glucuronidase in Hs578T xenografts were insufficient to trigger the β-GlcA-N1/E4 combination. A possibility was that the zebrafish xenograft lacked the necrotic areas of larger, more developed tumours, which contained much higher amounts of extracellular β-glucuronidase, as indicated by some previous studies32,33. With added β-glucuronidase, the prodrug system elicited tumour apoptosis and durable modulation of macrophages, lending further evidence for the in vivo feasibility of our prodrug system.

We next evaluated the therapeutic effects of our prodrug system on an MC38 syngeneic mouse model (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Consistent with our earlier zebrafish experiments, the combination of β-GlcA-N1/E4 did not elicit an appreciable antitumour response, a result that could probably be attributed to the lack of β-glucuronidase in the TME. Indeed, β-GlcA-N1/E4 preincubated with β-glucuronidase showed tumour-attenuating effects and conferred similar survival benefits compared with the benchmark MSA2 (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). None of the treatment groups induced significant body weight loss (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Secretome profiling of the sera indicated that both MSA2 and preincubated β-GlcA-N1/E4 activated highly overlapping sets of cytokines, suggesting the similarity of their mechanisms (Extended Data Fig. 8e).

To demonstrate the in situ formation of the SC2S dimer in a β-glucuronidase-rich TME, we turned to a CT26 syngeneic tumour model (CT26mβGUS) where the inoculated cell line was genetically engineered to express a membrane-anchored mouse β-glucuronidase for applications in gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy42 (Fig. 6a). At comparable doses, both MSA2 and the β-GlcA-N1/E4 treatments attenuated tumour growth to similar extents, while the individual components did not show significant effects (Fig. 6b). The benign nature of either β-GlcA-N1 or E4 alone was further supported by body weight monitoring, as no significant losses were observed (Fig. 6c). The β-GlcA-N1/E4 combination conferred slightly better survival benefits compared with MSA2 (Fig. 6d). It is worth noting that the effectiveness of β-GlcA-N1/E4 was indistinguishable from the SC2S control treatment group, where a matching concentration of the purified dimer was given intratumourally, from which one could infer that the efficiency of dimer formation from the prodrug system was not the limiting factor of its efficacy. Such results may represent the inherent limitations of STING-based therapy on our tumour model.

a, Experimental design. CT26 cells overexpressing the murine β-glucuronidase (CT26mβGUS) were inoculated into the right flank of BALB/c mice. Overexpression of β-glucuronidase was confirmed by western blotting (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Treatments began once the tumour volume reached about 90 mm3. MSA2: 5 mg kg−1 (IT); β-GlcA-N1: 12.5 mg kg−1 (IT or IP); E4: 5 mg kg−1 (IT); SC2S dimer: 8.6 mg kg−1 (IT, matching molar concentration of the β-GlcA-N1/E4 treatment group). n = 6 for each treatment group.

The tissue distribution of the active SC2S dimer resulted from the β-GlcA-N1/E4 combination (β-GlcA-N1 was given intraperitoneally (IP); E4 was given intratumourally (IT)) was analysed with mass spectrometry (Fig. 6e). For up to 4 h after the treatment, the SC2S dimer was detected at a stable level almost exclusively in the tumour. Apart from traces of SC2S detected in the blood and the liver, the concentrations of the agonist were below the detection limit across all other organs analysed. By comparison, the reported pharmacokinetic profile of intratumourally injected MSA2 indicated that its concentration in the tumour decreased rapidly past the 2-h timepoint, and substantial leakage into the plasma occurred15. Haematotoxicity (Extended Data Fig. 9b) and histopathology analyses (Extended Data Fig. 10) suggested that the treatments were generally well tolerated, although modest decreases in the levels of red blood cells, haemoglobin and haematocrit were observed for the MSA2 treatment group. Overall, these results provide an in vivo proof of concept of the two-component prodrug system and show that the active dimer could indeed be preferentially formed in a β-glucuronidase-rich TME, with minimal off-target accumulation relative to MSA2.

To summarize, we report a two-component prodrug system for STING activation utilizing the unique dimerization mechanism of the non-CDN STING agonist MSA2. Based on structural information of the non-covalent dimer in complex with STING, we synthesized MSA2 analogues with either an electrophile or a nucleophile that formed covalent dimers efficiently at low micromolar concentrations and under physiological conditions. One of the dimers with a thioether linkage activated THP-1 reporter cells at submicromolar concentrations. Caging the nucleophilic analogue with a self-immolative β-glucuronide moiety allowed for β-glucuronidase-specific STING agonist formation in cell-based assays and zebrafish xenograft models. Using a mouse tumour model overexpressing β-glucuronidase, we showed that separate administration of the two components resulted in near-exclusive formation of the active dimer in the tumour, thus providing an in vivo proof of concept of our prodrug system. Considering that β-glucuronidase-responsive prodrugs or imaging probes are known to be uncaged and to accumulate significantly in normal organs such as the liver, the kidney and the heart, the specificity achieved by the two-component system is remarkable32,43,44,45,46.

In recent years, a plethora of strategies for ‘on-tumour' generation of therapeutics has been reported47,48. Conceptually related to our two-component prodrug, these systems likewise involve separate administration of two elements: a ‘trigger' that preferentially accumulate in tumours, and a latent effector to be rendered active by the trigger through specific bond formation or cleavage. Triggers are commonly directed to tumours through the enhanced permeability and retention effects of nanomaterial, conjugations to antibodies or ligands, or even direct surgical implantations. An assumption that has been made throughout, however, is that the trigger must be a bioorthogonal reaction, such as palladium-catalysed depropargylation, trans-cyclooctene-tetrazine cycloaddition or azide–phosphine reduction49,50,51. As an alternative to this established paradigm, we showed that even a plain nucleophilic substitution reaction could efficiently and tumour-selectively form the active compound by utilizing the non-covalent interactions between the reactants. Compared with the rate constants of most bioorthogonal reactions, which fell in the range of 10−1 to 10−3 M−1 s−1, the dimerization rates of the MSA2 analogues reported herein were at least ten- to a hundred-fold faster, showing a potential benefit of moving beyond the constraints of biorthogonality. The reaction between the constituent components of our prodrug system also brings about important structural changes in these molecules, resulting in drastically different bioactivities between the reactants and the product. As demonstrated in our cell-based assays, neither β-GlcA-N1 nor E4 appreciably activates STING, while their product is a potent agonist at submicromolar concentrations. Therefore, toxicities stemming from non-specific decaging could be rendered less detrimental, as only a relatively benign precursor rather than a fully active compound would be released. A similar concept has also been explored in a palladium-based prodrug strategy, where targeted delivery of palladium nanoparticles catalysed an in-cell Suzuki–Miyaura coupling to synthesize a cytotoxic compound from two innocuous precursors52.

A question that remained unanswered is the exact nature of the dimerizing interactions between the MSA2 molecules. Indeed, at first glance, the benzo[b]thiophene core of MSA2 seems to be a rather inconspicuous moiety that is commonly used in medicinal chemistry. Yet, its stacking is strong enough to hold two monomers together with sufficient lifetime to bind to STING and, as leveraged in this work, to efficiently and specifically form a new covalent bond. It is conceivable that the discovery of more molecular scaffolds with such self-recognizing properties could open up new possibilities in prodrug design and beyond.

Most chemicals and solvents were purchased from Acros, Alfa Aesar, Sigma-Aldrich, MedChemExpress, Fluorochem, Biosynth Carbosynth and Cayman Chemical. Milli-Q ultrapure water was used in all relevant experiments. Thin-layer chromatography was performed with Supelco silica gel 60 F254 plates. Flash column chromatography was performed with Millipore silica gel 60 (0.040–0.063 mm, 230–400 mesh). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a BBO smart probe or on a Bruker Avance 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with a TXO cryoprobe. Spectra were processed with MestreNova. High-resolution mass spectra of small molecules were recorded on a Waters LCT Premier mass analyser equipped with an Agilent 1100 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system or on a Waters Xevo G2-S bench top QTOF. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis of reaction mixtures was performed on a Waters SQD2 mass analyser coupled with a Waters H-class UPLC system (Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 reversed-phase column). Preparative HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1260 Infinity II chromatography system (ZORBAX 5 Eclipse Plus C8 21.2 × 150 mm reversed-phase column).

Electrophiles C1–C5 and E1, E2 and E4 were prepared as 50 mM dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stock solutions, diluted in the reaction buffer (10 mM NaPi pH 7, 150 mM NaCl) to 500 µM, and dispensed (100 μl each well) into an ultraviolet-transparent 96-well plate (Corning 3635). Before the start of each assay, thiol N1 (or Ellman's reagent) was freshly weighed and prepared as a 50 mM DMSO stock solution. N1 was diluted in the reaction buffer containing 200 µM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) (TCEP) (400 μM for Ellman's reagent) to prepare a 200 µM working solution, which was then added (100 μl each well) to the electrophiles, resulting in the following initial condition: 250 μM of the electrophile, 100 μM of the nucleophile, 10 mM NaPi pH 7, 150 mM NaCl and 100 µM TCEP (assuming complete reduction of the Ellman's reagent). The absorbance at 410 nm (412 nm for Ellman's reagent) was monitored at 25 °C with a plate reader (Molecular Devices SpectraMax i3x). The concentration of the remaining nucleophile at each timepoint was determined by comparing the background-subtracted absorbance with a calibration curve obtained by serial dilutions of the 200 µM working solution. The concentration of the remaining electrophile at each timepoint was determined by calculating the amount of nucleophile consumed. Rate constants were obtained by fitting the data with the standard second-order rate law (GraphPad Prism).

Human β-glucuronidase (AcroBiosystems BEB-H52H3) was reconstituted in deionized water to a concentration of 1 mg ml−1. The enzyme stock solution was further diluted in assay buffer (0.2 M acetate pH 4.5) to 10 μg ml−1 (134 nM). β-GlcA-N1 (50 mM DMSO stock) was twofold serially diluted in assay buffer from 5 to 0.078 mM. The enzyme solution and diluted β-GlcA-N1 were incubated in a transparent 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C until thermo equilibrium was reached. Then, 100 µl of β-GlcA-N1 at various concentrations was mixed with 100 µl of β-glucuronidase using a multichannel pipette, resulting in the following initial condition: [β-GlcA-N1] = 2.5, 1.25, 0.62, 0.31, 0.16, 0.08 and 0.04 mM; [β-glucuronidase] = 67 nM; 5% DMSO (v/v). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C. At 30-min and 60-min timepoints, a 50-µl portion was withdrawn from each reaction mixture and mixed with 50 µl of quenching buffer (1 M sodium carbonate, 1 mM TCEP). The concentration of liberated N1 was determined by comparing the absorbance of each quenched reaction at 410 nm to a calibration curve of purified N1. Reaction velocities were calculated from the slopes of [N1] versus time plots. The velocity versus [β-GlcA-N1] plot was then fitted with the standard Michaelis–Menten kinetic model (GraphPad Prism).

Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Thermo Scientific EC0114) was transformed with a pET28a plasmid (Genscript) harbouring the codon-optimized sequence of SUMO-hSTINGwt (aa138-379). Transformed BL21 cells were inoculated into LB medium (50 µg ml−1 kanamycin) and incubated at 180 rpm, 37 °C overnight. The overnight culture was then diluted (1:100 dilution) in 2× YT medium (50 µg ml−1 kanamycin) and incubated at 180 rpm, 37 °C until optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.6 (approximately 3 h). The bacterial culture was then cooled to 16 °C, induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl 1-thio-d-galactopyranoside and incubated overnight at 180 rpm, 16 °C. The bacterial cells were pelleted at 4,000g for 30 min, resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole and 2 mM TCEP supplied with 2 tablets of cOmplete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitors) and disrupted by sonication on ice. The total lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 22,000g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45-µm filter (Millipore SLHAR33SS). The clarified lysate was then incubated on a roller with 10 ml bed volume of Ni-NTA resin (Thermo Scientific 88223) at 4 °C for 1 h. The Ni-NTA resin was then packed in a column, flushed with 20 ml of wash buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole) and eluted with 40 ml of elution buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole). The eluted protein was concentrated to approximately 5 ml (Millipore Amicon 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO)) and buffer-exchanged into storage buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl). TCEP was then added to a final concentration of 2 mM, and 250 units of SUMO protease (Merck SAE0067) were added. The cleavage reaction mixture was left to stand at 4 °C overnight until LC–MS analysis indicated the completion of the cleavage reaction. The cleavage mixture was incubated with 10 ml bed volume of Ni-NTA resin on a roller at 4 °C for 1 h and packed in a disposable column. The flowthrough was collected, and the resin was further flushed with 20 ml of wash buffer. The eluted fractions were combined, concentrated and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Cytiva, Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL). The purified protein in storage buffer was concentrated to 330 µM (dimer concentration) as determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for future use.

The binding constants of purified dimers were measured by ITC (Malvern Panalytical AutoITC200) in a reverse-titration format. Stock DMSO solutions of each dimer were dissolved in titration buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl) to a final concentration of 25 µM and added to the titration cell. The syringe was filled with 250 µM of purified STING in a matching buffer. Titration was performed at 25 °C with the following parameters: 750 rpm stirring, 0.2 µl initial injection followed by 2-µl injections of the dimer solution every 120 s. Titration of STING protein into blank buffer was separately performed and subtracted from the raw data before the analysis. The background-subtracted titration curves were fitted with the built-in Origin software using the standard one-site model.

The crystal structure of MSA2 in complex with STING (PDB entry: 6UKM)15 was used as initial structure for all simulations. MD simulations were performed with the AMBER 22 package53, implemented with ff14SB54 and gaff255 to correctly reproduce the conformational behaviour of the protein and the ligands, respectively. The LEaP module of AMBER 22 was used to generate the topology and coordinate files for the MD simulations, which were carried out using the CUDA version of the PMEMD module of the AMBER simulation package. Each complex was immersed in a water box with a 10 Å buffer of TIP3P water molecules56, and the system was neutralized by adding explicit counter ions (Na+). A two-stage geometry optimization approach was performed with the PMEMD module. The first stage minimizes only the positions of solvent molecules and ions, using a 50 kcal mol−1 Å−2 harmonic potential, and the second stage is an unrestrained minimization of all the atoms in the simulation cell. In both stages, 2,500 steps of steepest descent minimization were followed by 2,500 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. The systems were then heated by incrementing the temperature from 0 to 300 K under constant pressure of 1 atm and periodic boundary conditions for 2 ns. Harmonic restraints of 10 kcal mol−1 were applied to the solute, and the Andersen temperature coupling scheme57 was used to control and equalize the temperature. The time step was kept at 1 fs during the heating stages. The SHAKE algorithm was applied to constrain all bonds involving hydrogen atoms58. Long-range electrostatic effects were modelled using the particle-mesh-Ewald method59. A sharp cut-off of 8 Å was applied to Lennard–Jones interactions. Each system was equilibrated for 2 ns with a 2-fs time step at a constant volume and temperature of 300 K. Production trajectories were then run for an additional microsecond under the same simulation conditions. Binding free energy calculations were performed using the MM-GBSA method60. This approach combines molecular mechanics energies with solvation terms estimated using the generalized Born implicit solvent model. Representative snapshots were extracted from the equilibrated MD trajectories for postprocessing. Entropic contributions were not considered in this study.

THP-1 Lucia ISG cells (InvivoGen thpl-isg) were maintained in the growth medium (RPMI 1640, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 25 mM HEPES, 10% FBS and Pen-Strep/Normocin) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were pelleted (150g, 10 min) and resuspended in the growth medium (40% conditioned) at a density of 1 × 106 cells ml−1. The cell suspension was dispensed (50 µl each well) into a lidded white 96-well plate (BrandTech 781665). Test compounds or DMSO control were diluted in the growth medium and sterilized by filtering through 0.22-µm polyethersulfone (PES) membranes (Merck SLGP033RS). Compounds serially diluted in the growth medium were then added to (50 µl each well) the cell suspension, resulting in a final density of 5 × 105 cells ml−1 with 20% conditioned medium. In all cases, the DMSO content did not exceed 0.5%. Treated cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Upon cooling down to room temperature, 50 µl of reconstituted luciferase substrate (InvivoGen QUANTI-Luc) was added to each well via the injector of the plate reader (Molecular Devices SpectraMax i3x), and the luminescence output was recorded (4 s delay, 0.1 s integration). Raw signals were divided by the averaged signal of the DMSO-treated control wells and reported in relative luminescence unit (RLU). The dose–response curve of each replicate was fitted individually using the standard 4PL model (GraphPad Prism). The EC50 value of each compound was averaged from three independent experiments and reported as mean ± s.e.m.

THP-1 cells (Cell Line Service) were maintained in the growth medium (RPMI 1640, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1× non-essential amino acids, 10% FBS and Pen-Strep) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. On the day before the experiment, the cells were resuspended in fresh growth medium at a density of 5 × 105 cells ml−1, dispensed (75 µl per well) to a round-bottom 96-well plate (Sarstedt 83.3925.500), and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. DMSO stocks of Compound N1 and E4 were serially diluted in the growth medium in two separate 96-well plates (Sarstedt 83.3925.500). The contents of the two plates were mixed and incubated briefly (5 min) at 37 °C before being transferred to the cells (75 µl per well), resulting in a final density of 2.5 × 105 cells ml−1 per well. Cells treated with purified SC2S dimers (25 µM) served as the positive control. All test compounds diluted in the growth medium were sterilized by filtering through 0.22 µm PES membranes (Merck SLGP033RS). In all cases, the final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 0.5% (v/v). Treated cells were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h and pelleted by centrifugation (120g, 10 min). The supernatants were collected and immediately analysed for interferon-β concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; PBL assay science 41435) following the manufacturer's instructions. The signal strength of cells treated with 25 µM of purified SC2S dimer was defined as 100% response. All other wells were reported as percentage activation and plotted on a heatmap (GraphPad Prism) accordingly.

THP-1 Lucia ISG cells were maintained as described above. On the day of the experiment, cells were pelleted (150g, 10 min) and resuspended in the growth medium (40% conditioned) at a density of 1 × 106 cells ml−1. Compound β-GlcA-N1, E4 and E4-ctrl were prepared as DMSO stock solutions. β-Glucuronidase (Sigma-Aldrich G8295) was reconstituted in PBS (25,000 units ml−1). Various test groups (group A: 50 µM β-GlcA-N1, 50 µM E4, 500 units ml−1 β-glucuronidase; group B: 50 µM β-GlcA-N1, 50 µM E4-control, 500 units ml−1 β-glucuronidase; group C: 50 µM β-GlcA-N1, 50 µM E4-ctrl; group D: 500 units ml−1 β-glucuronidase) were prepared, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, sterile-filtered through 0.22-µm PES membranes (Merck SLGP033RS) and combined with the cell suspension at an equal volume (1 + 1 ml) on a 48-well plate (Greiner 677102). The final DMSO content of each well did not exceed 0.5%. Treated cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and pelleted by centrifugation (300g, 10 min). The supernatants were collected, aliquoted and frozen at −20 °C for future analysis. The concentrations of cytokines from three biological replicates were quantified by ELISA (CXCL-10: Bio-Techne QK266; IL-6: Bio-Techne D6050B; IFN-β: PBL assay science 41435). Data were analysed by two-tailed Welch's t-test (GraphPad Prism).

THP-1 Lucia ISG cells were maintained as described above. On the day of the experiment, cells were collected by centrifugation (150g, 10 min) and resuspended in fresh growth medium at a density of 2 × 106 cells ml−1. Cells were treated with cycloheximide (50 µg ml−1) and incubated for 50 min at 37 °C. Treated cells were then combined with the growth medium containing SC2S dimer (5 µM final concentration) to 1 × 106 cells ml−1 and incubated at 37 °C. At each timepoint, a portion (3 ml) of the cell suspension was withdrawn. Withdrawn cells were pelleted (300g, 3 min), washed with PBS (1 ml), pelleted again (300g, 3 min) and resuspended to a density of 1 × 107 cells ml−1 in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) supplied with protease/phosphatase inhibitor tablets (Pierce A32961) and freshly prepared phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM). Lysates were further disrupted by sonication at low power (5 s × 3 cycles). Sonicated lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C (13,000g, 5 min). The supernatants were collected, and the total protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce 23225). Samples were reduced and denatured at 95 °C for 5 min before being separated on a precast polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris, 20 µg total protein per lane). Protein bands were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen iBlot2). The membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST pH 7.4) on a shaker at room temperature for 1 h and probed by the respective primary antibody (anti-pSTING: Cell Signaling Technology E9A9K, 1:1,000 dilution; anti-pIRF3: Cell Signaling Technology E7J8G, 1:1,000 dilution; anti-pTBK1: Cell Signaling Technology D52C2, 1:1,000 dilution; anti-β-actin: Cell Signaling Technology 13E5, 1:1,000 dilution) at 4 °C for 15 h. The membrane was washed three times with TBST and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed three times with TBST, the membrane was treated with ECL reagent (Pierce 32106) and imaged using automatic exposure (Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP).

Tumour samples isolated from the mice were homogenized and lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor (Roche), phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) and 0.1% Benzonase (Sigma) on ice for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 21,000g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and the total protein concentrations were determined using BCA assay (Sigma). The supernatants were separated on 12% SDS–PAGE gels (30 µg total protein per lane) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare). Membranes were then blocked with 5% BSA in TBST for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with the primary antibodies (anti-GUSB: Proteintech 16332-1-AP, 1:1,000 dilution; anti-Vinculin, Cell Signaling Technology #18799, 1:1,000 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. The membranes were then washed three times with TBST and incubated with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG, Abcam ab205719, 1:10,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed three times and imaged using ECL substrate (BioRad #170-5060) and Amersham 800 Imaging System (Cytiva).

The zebrafish (Danio rerio) model was handled and maintained according to the standard protocols of the European Animal Welfare Legislation, Directive 2010/63/EU (European Commission, 2016) and Champalimaud Fish Platform. All protocols were approved by the Champalimaud Animal Ethical Committee and Portuguese institutional organizations—ORBEA (Órgão de Bem-Estar e Ética Animal/Animal Welfare and Ethics Body) and DGAV (Direção Geral de Alimentação e Veterinária/Directorate General for Food and Veterinary).

Depending on the purpose of each experiment, different genetically modified zebrafish lines were used in this study: Tg(mpeg1:mcherry-F; tnfa:GFP-F)41, Tg(mpeg1:mcherry-F)41 and mutants casper and nacre61.

TNBC cell line Hs578T was cultured and expanded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) high glucose (Biowest) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 U ml−1 of penicillin–streptomycin (Hyclone) and supplemented with insulin at 10 μg ml−1 (Sigma-Aldrich). Hs578T cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Hs578T were authenticated through short tandem repeat profile analysis and tested routinely for mycoplasma contamination. Hs578T cells were grown to 70% confluence, washed once with Dulbecco's PBS (Biowest) and detached with EDTA (1 mM) by scrapping. Cell suspension was collected to a microcentrifuge tube, mixed with lipophilic dye Deep Red Cell Tracker (1 μl ml−1 of cell suspension, 10 mM stock) (Life Technologies) for 10 min at 37 °C in darkness and washed with Dulbecco's PBS. Cells were centrifuged at 250g, for 4 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in DMEM. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion method, and cell number was determined by haemocytometer counting. Cells were resuspended in growth medium to a final density of 5 × 105 cells μl−1. Fluorescently labelled Hs578T cells were injected using borosilicate glass microcapillaries under a fluorescence scope (Zeiss Axio Zoom. V16) equipped with a mechanical micropipette (World Precision Instruments, Pneumatic Pico pump PV820). Cells were injected into the PVS of 2 dpf zebrafish embryo previously anaesthetized with 1× Tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich). After the injection, zebrafish xenografts were left for 10 min in 1× Tricaine, transferred to E3 medium and kept at 34 °C. At 1 dpi, zebrafish xenografts were screened for the presence of tumoural mass. Xenografts with cells in the yolk sac or cellular debris were discarded, while the successful ones were grouped according to the sizes of their tumours using the size of their eyes as a scale. The xenografts were then exposed to E2 media containing DMSO or the test compounds. Xenografts were checked daily; dead ones were removed, and the E2 medium with DMSO or compounds was refreshed. Four days later, the zebrafish xenografts were euthanized, fixed overnight with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde (Thermo Scientific) at 4 °C and preserved at −20 °C in pure methanol. For transgenic zebrafish line Tg(mpeg1:mcherry-F; tnfa:GFP-F), fixation was performed with PIPES for optimal fluorescence signal preservation.

At 2 dpi (1 dpt), controls and treated Tg(mpeg1:mcherry-F; tnfa:GFP-F) xenografts were carefully selected under a fluorescent scope to ensure that only the double-positive transgenics were imaged. Selected xenografts were anaesthetized and mounted onto a coverslip with 0.8% low-melting agarose with 1× Tricaine in E2 medium. The mounted xenografts were imaged using a LSM 980 Upright confocal laser scanning microscope, with a 25× water objective lens. Then, z-stack images of the tumours were obtained within a 3-µm interval. At the end of the acquisition, xenografts were carefully recovered and returned to the initial conditions (DMSO, MSA2, SC2S, N1/E4 and β-GlcA-N1/E4). At 3 dpt, the same xenografts were imaged once again. Image analysis was performed using FIJI software (ImageJ 2.14).

Fixed zebrafish xenograft images were acquired using a LSM 980 Upright confocal laser scanning microscope, with a 5-μm interval. Generated images were processed using the FIJI/ImageJ software. The number of cells was quantified using the Cell Counter plugin in ImageJ software. To assess tumour size, three representative slices of the tumour, from the top (Zfirst), middle (Zmiddle) and bottom (Zlast), per z stack per xenograft were analysed, and a proxy of total cell number of the entire tumour (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclei) was estimated as follows: tumour size = (total number of slices/1.5) × (Zfirst + Zmiddle + Zlast)/3. The correction factor of 1.5 was estimated based on human cells with nuclei averaging 10–12 μm in diameter. The number of activated caspase-3-positive cells, macrophages, M1 and M2-like TNF-positive macrophages were counted in every slide along the tumour. The transgenic xenografts negative for TNF were used to quantify TAMs and phagocytosis. To get the percentage of each population of M1 and M2-like, the obtained number was divided by its corresponding tumour size.

Xenografts stored in pure MeOH were rehydrated by a series of decreasing MeOH concentrations (75%, 50%, 25%, v/v MeOH diluted in PBS/0.1% Triton, w/v). Xenografts were then permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) Triton in PBS and blocked in a mixture of 1× PBS, BSA, DMSO, Triton 1% (w/v) and goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. The xenografts were then probed with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-cleaved Caspase-3, Cell Signaling Technologies, 1:100 dilution; rabbit anti-mCherry, Abcam, 1:100 dilution; mouse anti-GFP, Roche, 1:100 dilution) overnight and incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa goat anti-rabbit 594, Thermo Scientific, 1:400 dilution; Alexa goat anti-mouse 488, Thermo Scientific, 1:400 dilution) and DAPI (50 μg ml−1) at 4 °C overnight. The xenografts were washed, fixed and mounted between two coverslips, allowing for double side acquisition using Mowiol mounting media (Sigma).

Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism 9.0 software. All datasets were challenged by D'Agostino and Pearson and Shapiro–Wilk normality tests. In general, datasets with a Gaussian distribution were analysed by parametric unpaired t-test, and datasets that did not pass the normality tests were analysed by nonparametric unpaired Mann–Whitney test. Clearance datasets were analysed using Fisher's exact test. All tests were two-sided with a confidence interval of 95%.

Mouse colon adenocarcinoma MC38 cells were purchased from Kerafast (ENH204-FP). The cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, Thermo Scientific #21969035), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco, Thermo Scientific), 1× GlutaMAX (Gibco, Thermo Scientific) and 1× penicillin–streptomycin solution (Gibco, Thermo Scientific). Murine colon adenocarcinoma cell line CT26-overexpressing mouse β-glucuronidase enzyme (CT26mβGUS) was a gift from Dr Steve R. Roffler from the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Thermo Scientific) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco, Thermo Scientific), 1× GlutaMAX (Gibco, Thermo Scientific) and 1× penicillin–streptomycin solution (Gibco, Thermo Scientific). Both cell lines were cultured at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

All animal experiments were conducted at the Gulbenkian Institute for Molecular Medicine (GIMM, Lisbon). Animal work was performed with strict adherence to the Portuguese Law (Portaria 1005/92) and the European Guideline 86/609/EEC. The Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations guidelines and recommendations concerning laboratory animal welfare were followed. All animal experiments were approved by the Portuguese official veterinary department for welfare licensing – Direção Geral de Alimentação e Veterinária (DGAV) and the IMM Animal Ethics Committee (authorization AWB_2021_03_GB_TargCancerDrugs). Eight-week-old male and female C57BL/6J or BALB/c mice (purchased from Charles River) were subcutaneously inoculated in the right flank with 100 μl of 1 × 106 MC38 cells or 5 × 106 CT26mβGUS, respectively, in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Gibco) with Matrigel (Corning). Tumour growth was monitored over time by performing daily bilateral vernier caliper measurements. Tumour volumes were estimated with the formula: (length × width2)/2. Treatments were initiated when tumours reached 90–100 mm3. Treatments were randomly assigned to mice according to tumour volumes. Treatments were administered intratumourally (or intraperitoneally for component β-GlcA-N1). Animals were observed every 1–2 days and euthanized when either the tumour volume reached ~1,000 mm3, the body weight loss exceeded 20% or ulceration started to appear. For immune characterizations, inflammatory cells were isolated from the tumours, spleens and inguinal lymph nodes 24 h after the second treatment. Blood was collected and sera was obtained for cytokine profiling. Collected data were analysed with GraphPad Prism 9.

This study used Luminex xMAP technology for multiplexed quantification of 44 mouse cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. The multiplexing analysis was performed using the Luminex 200 system (Luminex) by Eve Technologies Corp. Forty-five markers were simultaneously measured in the samples using Eve Technologies' Mouse Cytokine 44-Plex Discovery Assay, which consists of two separate kits, one 32-plex and one 12-plex (MilliporeSigma), following the manufacturer's protocol. The 32-plex consisted of eotaxin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12(p40), IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IP-10, KC, LIF, LIX, MCP-1, M-CSF, MIG, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MIP-2, RANTES, TNF and VEGF. The 12-plex consisted of 6Ckine/Exodus2, erythropoietin, fractalkine, IFNβ-1, IL-11, IL-16, IL-20, MCP-5, MDC, MIP-3α, MIP-3β and TARC. Assay sensitivities of these markers range from 0.3 to 30.6 pg ml−1 for the 45-plex. The sensitivities of individual analytes are available in the MilliporeSigma MILLIPLEX MAP protocol.

Tumour-bearing mice treated with β-GlcA-N1(IP) + E4 (IT) were euthanized at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 72 h posttreatment (n = 3 for each timepoint). The blood, tumour, lung, kidney, liver and spleen were collected for each mouse. Three mice treated with vehicle were included as control samples. Whole blood samples were centrifuged at 2,000g, 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatant plasma was aspirated into an Eppendorf tube and frozen at −80 °C. Tumour and organ tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. The plasma samples (10-µl aliquots) were prepared by protein precipitation extraction. The organic layer was evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in a solution equivalent to the initial chromatographic starting conditions. The tissue samples were analysed by homogenization to give a 200 ng ml−1 homogenate concentration. The homogenised tissue samples (10-µl aliquots) were then taken through the same preparation procedure as the plasma samples. All samples were analysed using the PKB Core Facility's 6500 LC–MS/MS system, in negative ion mode. The chromatography was carried out using a gradient method on a Kinetex EVO C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm). Analysis was conducted in four batches, consisting of calibration standards, quality control samples, blank control samples, internal standard-only samples and study samples. Calibration curves were constructed using linear regression with a 1/x2 weighting. A calibration range of 1–500 ng ml−1 (5–2,500 ng g−1 in tissue) was used. Precision and accuracy were well within the PK/B core facility's acceptance criteria of ±20%. The LC–MS/MS method was developed and qualified ahead of the sample analysis. The performance of the method met normal Core Facility acceptance criteria for analysis.

The 8xHis-tagged R232-STING138–379 construct was expressed using vector pEXP-MBP (Addgene 112568). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, harbouring the recombinant plasmid, were cultivated in 2xYT medium (supplemented with 0.1 mg ml−1 ampicillin) at 37 °C until OD600 reached ~0.8 and then cooled to 18 °C for 30 min. Isopropyl 1-thio-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.4 mM, and growth continued at 18 °C for 16 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (30 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl,10 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol and 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. After 1 day, cells were thawed and lysed by sonication on ice (5 s ON, 10 s OFF, 5 min total ON). Proteins were purified using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) and eluted stepwise in binding buffer with 300 mM imidazole. Removal of histidine tag was performed at 4 °C overnight using recombinant TEV protease (at 1:20 molar ratio) while dialysing (SnakeSkin Dialysis Tubing, 10 kDa cut-off weight, Thermo Fisher Scientific) against gel filtration buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP and 5% glycerol). Proteins were further purified by reverse affinity in Ni-NTA followed by gel filtration (Superdex 200 16/60, GE Healthcare). Protein in gel filtration buffer was concentrated to 6.7 mg ml−1 using 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrators (Millipore) at 5 °C. Compounds in 100% DMSO were added to protein (247 µM final solution) at 2.2 mM final concentration (~2.2% DMSO) and incubated on ice for approximately 1 h. This mixture was centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min at 5 °C before setting up 200-nl sitting drops with protein–inhibitor complex and reservoir solution at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2. Crystallization experiments were performed at 20 °C. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Diffraction data were collected at the Diamond Light Source at the I04 beamline. The best-diffracting crystals grew under the conditions described in the table below. Diffraction data were integrated using XDS (within autoPROC)62 and scaled using AIMLESS from the CCP4 software suite63. Molecular replacement and initial refinement were performed using Dimple (PDB ID 4KSY was used as the molecular replacement search model for phasing). Follow-up refinements and manual model adjustments were conducted using BUSTER64 and Coot65, respectively. Structure validation was performed using MolProbity66. The final model and structure factors were deposited in the PDB (PDB ID: 9QVT).

a Absorbance time-course data. b Linearized second-order rate plots. [A]0 = 100 μM, initial concentration of the nucleophile; [B]0 = 250 μM, initial concentration of the electrophile. Each data point is presented as mean ± STD from three independent measurements. Validity of the assay was confirmed by LC-MS analysis of selected reactions at the end of the assay, which showed the alkylated thiol as the sole product. See Supplementary Fig. 2 for details.

Purified hSTINGwt138-379 (250 μM of homodimer) was titrated into each dimer (25 μM) dissolved in a matching buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) at 25 °C and 750 rpm stirring. Binding constants were reported as the average from duplicate measurements.

a Representative frame from 1 µs MD simulations. The key interacting residues (S162, T263, Y167, R232, and R238) are highlighted. Hydrogen bonds are depicted as yellow dashed lines. b Theoretical binding energy (relative to compound D7) of each dimer calculated using the MM-PBSA method. See the Method section for details. c Distance between the aromatic ring center of Y167 and the carbon atom of the methylene group (CO-CH2-) of the dimers over the course of the simulation, reflecting the stability of this interaction. d Population of hydrogen bonds observed in the MD simulation trajectory of each complex.

a Cartoon representation of the dimeric crystal structure of STING LBD bound to compound D5 at 2.31 Å resolution, followed by a 90° rotated view. The displayed distance was measured between the α-carbon (Cα) of Y186 in both chains (as spheres). Superposition of apo (PDB: 4EMU) and D5-bound (PDB: 9QVT) STING structures, aligned by chain A and shown in cartoon representation. The distances displayed were calculated between the Cα atoms of residue Y186 in chains A and B (represented as spheres). b Electron density map (2Fo-Fc, contoured at 1.0 σ) of the ligand, overlaid with its stick representation. c Superposition of D5- and 2',3' cGAMP-bound STING LBD crystal structures, emphasizing the angle formed by the C–S–C bonds in the linker region of D5. In both views, it is apparent that D5 penetrates deeper into the binding pocket and is also narrower at the base of the site compared to 2',3'-cGAMP. d Superposition of D5- (PDB: 9QVT) and MSA2-bound (PDB: 6UKM) STING LBD crystal structures, highlighting conformational differences in chain B when chains A are aligned.

N1 (50 μM) and E4 (50 μM) were reacted at neutral pH (25 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl) and in the presence of reduced glutathione (1 mM). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. No glutathione-adduct of E4 was identified.

At the indicated time point, an 80 µL aliquot was loaded onto an Agilent Bond Elut solid phase extraction column (C18, 3 mL bed volume). The collected eluent was lyophilized, redissolved in a 50% (v/v) acetonitrile in water (0.1% v/v formic acid), and analyzed by LC-MS.

a MTC of β-GlcA-N1/E4 treatments on non-tumor zebrafish larvae. Groups of 30 noninjected zebrafish larvae were exposed to different concentrations of the compounds (MSA2, SC2S, β-GlcA-N1/E4 and β-GlcA-N1/E4 + β-glucuronidase) for 3 consecutive days, with daily renewal of the E2 media containing the drugs. The tested concentrations of the compounds, in different combinations, were the following: MSA2: 15 μM, 75 μM and 150 μM; SC2S: 0.62 μM, 3.1 μM and 6.2 μM; β-GlcA-N1/E4: 5 μM + 5 μM, 10 μM + 10 μM, 20 μM + 20 μM and 100 μM + 100 μM; β-GlcA-N1/E4 + β-glucuronidase: 20 μM + 20 μM + 166 U/mL, 20 μM + 20 μM + 250 U/mL and 20 μM + 20 μM + 500 U/mL. Toxicity was assessed daily by counting the total number of dead larvae and checking for the presence of morphologic changes such cardiac edemas or curved tails. Control groups were treated with the highest matched DMSO concentration (0.04%, v/v). b Left: representative image of phagocytosis in a xenograft treated with β-GlcA-N1/E4 and β-glucuronidase at 2dpi in Tg(mpeg1:mcherry-F). Each yellow arrow indicates a phagocytic event. Right: n° of phagocytic events at 2dpi. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis follows that of Fig. 5.

Source data

a Experimental design. MC-38 cells were inoculated into the right flank of C57BL/6 mice and treated once tumors reached about 90 mm3. MSA2: 5 mg/kg. β-GlcA-N1: 12.5 mg/kg; E4: 5 mg/kg; N1 + E4: N1 12.5 mg/kg and E4 5 mg/kg; β-GlcA-N1/E4 + enz: 12.5 mg/kg of β-GlcA-N1 and 5 mg/kg of E4, preincubated with 500 units of E. coli β-glucuronidase at 37 °C for one hour. N1 was administered intraperitoneally (IP); all other compounds were administered intratumorally (IT). b Tumor growth curves. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by multiple comparisons adjusted with the Sidák-Holm correction. c Survival curves. Differences between the compound-treated groups and the vehicle-treated control group were analyzed by the Log-Rank test. d Body weight monitoring. e Cytokine profiling of sera obtained on Day 9.

Delta-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), or GluDs, are members of the iGluR ligand-gated ion channel family, yet their function remains enigmatic1. Although GluDs are widely expressed in the brain, play key roles in synaptic organization, and harbor disease-linked mutations, whether they retain iGluR-like channel function is debated as currents have not been directly observed2,3. Here, we define GluDs as ligand-gated ion channels that are tightly regulated in cellular contexts by purifying human GluD2 (hGluD2) and directly characterizing its structure and function using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and bilayer recordings. We show that hGluD2 is activated by D-serine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), with augmented activation at physiological temperatures. We reveal that hGluD2 contains an ion channel directly coupled to clamshell-like ligand-binding domains (LBDs), which are coordinated by the amino terminal domain (ATD) above the ion channel. Ligand binding triggers channel opening via an asymmetric mechanism, and a cerebellar ataxia point mutation in the LBD rearranges the receptor architecture and induces leak currents. Our findings demonstrate that GluDs possess the intrinsic biophysical properties of ligand-gated ion channels, reconciling prior conflicting observations to establish a framework for understanding their cellular regulation and for developing therapies targeting GluD2.

China leads the world in the scale of its expansion of high-speed rail, but there's no settled view on the benefits of such networks. Credit: Wenpu Wang/Getty

What if there were a technology that could help to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, air pollution and environmental degradation, while improving health, reducing social inequality and boosting economic growth? There is, and this month it turns 200. The opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway in northeast England on 27 September 1825 is generally considered to be the birth of the modern railway — an event that set in motion a revolution in human mobility and social organization.

Transporting food generates whopping amounts of carbon dioxide

Transporting food generates whopping amounts of carbon dioxide

Initially, the railways enjoyed breakneck expansion, but since the mid-twentieth century, railway development in most countries has hit the buffers, and been overtaken by growth in road and air travel. A study by the Paris-based International Transport Forum (ITF) of 51 mainly high- income countries found that rail's share of freight transport had fallen from 38% in 1980 to 24% in 2017 (see go.nature.com/3vpckhd). In the European Union in 2022, just 8.4% of passenger kilometres were travelled by rail, compared with 9% by air and 73% by car.

Despite prominent investments in high-speed rail in Japan, China and parts of Europe, the overall length of networks in many countries has declined as conventional lines deemed unprofitable have been cut. Meanwhile, rail transport is a low priority in many low- and middle-income countries, where networks are sparse or non-existent. The entire African continent, for example, has just 87,000 kilometres of rail. By contrast, India has at least 65,000 kilometres, and a land surface area just one-tenth of the size.

It's time to turn the tables, and acknowledge the vast benefits of railways as a cornerstone of a sustainable transport system that can support human development and economic growth. Research from across disciplines can inform policy in preparation for a much-needed renaissance, as railways travel into their third century.

According to the International Energy Agency, transport currently accounts for around one-quarter of global carbon dioxide emissions. Between 1990 and 2022, those emissions grew by 1.7% a year — an increase greater than that of any sector besides industry — as more people in more parts of the world became more mobile. Over 90% of the energy used to power transport comes from fossil fuels.

Those figures alone justify a renewed focus on rail transport. Per passenger kilometre, it produces one-fifth of the emissions of car transport, and less than one-quarter of those of flying. Direct emissions can be cut to zero if trains are powered by fully renewable electricity.

Rail transport also contributes little in the way of air-fouling particulate emissions, which are a health hazard. This is particularly important in a rapidly urbanizing world. Better rail-based mass-transit options could help to reduce urban sprawl, as well as the land needed for roads, car parks and other car-related infrastructure. Less-congested cities with fewer motor vehicles are more liveable places where people are more inclined to walk and cycle, reaping the health benefits of these activities. They are also more inclusive, particularly for younger and older people who are less likely to own a vehicle. As both urbanization and average population density grow, research shows that the economic benefits of investment in rail outstrip those of investment in roads1.

But it is not just cities. The United Kingdom will be celebrating its role in birthing the railways later this month, but the country also offers an example of the effects disinvestment in railways can have. A 2024 study2 examined a sustained programme of cuts made to the nation's railway network from the 1950s to the 1980s. It found that the predominantly rural areas most affected by the cuts saw population declines, job losses and drops in the number of skilled workers, relative to areas that were unaffected.

One way research can help to get things back on track is by broadening the criteria governments use to assess railway investment, says Christian Wolmar, an independent transport consultant and author based in London. All too often, these are based on narrow metrics of profitability or ‘time saved' by potential users, with insufficient consideration of the wider social and environmental impacts. Economists, other social scientists and sustainability researchers can all contribute to developing more-robust assessments of these indirect benefits.

Such initiatives can feed into broader regulatory and policy frameworks. Only one-third of countries have fully incorporated the transport sector into their ‘nationally determined contributions' — their ongoing commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions under the 2015 Paris climate agreement — according to an ITF tracker (see go.nature.com/4nxdiju). To meet net-zero targets, emissions from transport need to decline by 3% a year from now on.

Research can also illuminate the winners and losers created by investment decisions. China, for example, is set to continue the breakneck expansion of its high-speed rail, aiming to reach 60,000 kilometres by 2030. But scholars are debating the wisdom of the speed and scale of this expansion, with uncertainty remaining about how widely the economic benefits of high-speed links are distributed3.

At its zenith, immediately before the First World War, the US rail network extended to more than 400,000 kilometres — greater than the distance from Earth to the Moon. Today, it covers little more than half of that. The extent of this decline underscores the need to turn around the neglect of a technology that has not only changed the world, but could also save the planet.

For years, Apple has tried to extend the battery life of the Apple Watch. For as many years, the company has only succeeded by half measures. Features like Low Power mode or faster charging help you keep the watch on your wrist for longer, but Apple has not significantly improved the watch's 18-hour battery life—even at last year's much-hyped decade-versary of the Apple Watch.

I say this to give the context of why such a little thing was so shocking. After wearing the new Apple Watch Series 11 for a full afternoon and wearing it to sleep, I woke up in the morning and discovered that I still had 58 percent battery left. 58 percent! I can wear the watch to sleep, get up, get my kids to school, and charge the watch when I'm at my desk! Constantly fussing over battery life was a major pain of the Apple Watch, and it's been fixed.

Longer battery life also makes it significantly easier to use Apple's newest health features as well. If you have a Series 3 or 4 and have been waiting to upgrade, this is the year to do it. Too bad Apple couldn't pull this off last year.

First things first: The new Series 11 comes in 42- and 46-millimeter case sizes with aluminum and titanium finishes in a variety of colors—Gold, Natural, and Slate for titanium, Rose Gold, Silver, Space Gray, and Jet Black for aluminum). It has the same slim case as last year's Series 10, along with features like fast charging and a new, more scratch-resistant glass.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has long contended that the Apple Watch is meant to save your life. In accordance with this, the newest features on the watch (or more accurately, the watchOS 26 update that applies to all Apple Watches, Series 6 or later) are health-related. First, the watch now offers hypertension, or high blood pressure, notifications.

Undiagnosed high blood pressure now affects as many as one in three people worldwide and can lead to heart attacks, stroke, or other long-term health conditions. The optical heart rate monitor on the watch purports to check how your blood vessels respond to your heartbeats; Apple says that the feature was developed with data from a series of studies that totaled over 100,000 participants.

To get the notifications, you toggle them on in the Health app. Although the feature received FDA clearance as I was writing this review (and you can see the clinical validation here), the app explicitly warns you that this is not a medical device. You have to be over 22 and without a previous diagnosis of hypertension, and it should not be used to diagnose, monitor, or treat pregnancy conditions like eclampsia.

But if you're mildly worried that you might have high blood pressure (which, apparently, we should all be), the app will ping you if it sees trouble signs so that you can double-check with your doctor and a separate blood pressure monitor (BPM). It requires 14 days of monitoring before you can get a hypertension notification, so I haven't gotten one yet (and hopefully never will). If you get a notification, you can also log your BPM measurements in the app.

The Whoop MG was the first fitness tracker I tested that monitored high blood pressure, but you do have to calibrate it with a BPM before you can use it. It seems like this will quickly become a basic feature on many smartwatches. Apple's other new health feature, Sleep Score, already is—it checks the duration of your sleep, your bedtime, and the number of interruptions to check if your sleep was restful or not. In my week's worth of testing, Apple gives me almost perfect sleep scores, even on a night camping when our tent almost flooded, and another smart ring noted that my sleep was “agitated.”

However, bedtime and duration are the only two factors we have real control over when tracking sleep, so maybe keeping the variables limited to what is actionable will prevent users from getting stressed. (You can also see your heart rate and respiratory rate in the Health app under the Sleep Score tab.)

Finally, and this bears repeating, blood oxygen sensing is back on the watch and apparently for good. The prolonged legal battle over a feature that is by now standard on almost every other watch appears to be mostly over, so one of the biggest dings against the Apple Watch is gone.

The watch also has a few upgrades to make it easier to use without your phone. The cellular connectivity model has now been upgraded from LTE to 5G, plus there's satellite messaging, Find My via satellite, and Emergency SOS via satellite on the new Watch Ultra 3. To prevent reviewers from overrunning emergency services this weekend with false alarms (because we usually do call, just to check if it actually works), Apple conducted testing with reviewers on campus.

I also went camping off-grid this weekend to test 5G and satellite messaging, and I'm happy to report that it worked! (I added the watch to my own cell plan to test for this review.) One feature that I like is that, unlike other, more rugged satellite messengers, the watch guides you toward satellites for better reception. Satellites do require a line of sight, so this feature might not work well under tree cover.

If you had cell coverage with your watch before, you might not notice the upgrade to 5G. I am not watching videos or playing Bloons on the watch, but my music did download slightly faster while running.

Speaking of running, Workout Buddy was one of the most hyped-up features in watchOS 26. (You must also have a phone that is capable of Apple Intelligence.) To toggle on Workout Buddy, go to the Fitness app on your phone, go to a specific workout, click the dialog box, and toggle on the specific voice that you want to give you your encouragement.

As of publication, the AI-enabled personalized encouragement needs a bit more data to be useful. Right now, it cheerfully chirps my current stats with a disturbing amount of vocal fry, so I can't really say that an AI workout buddy is preferable to a real-life one. I prefer walking, climbing, biking, or running with my real-life dog, friends, or kids as of now.

As for Liquid Glass, one of Apple's most polarizing new features, you just don't see it on the watch very much. Probably the most prominent places you can see it are in the new Flow face, which is just clear numerals with glowing blobs swirling around behind. I don't object to how it looks, but as with last year's Reflections face, I like to be able to see my notifications, steps, and battery life with my watch, so I don't use it very much. The new Waypoint or even Exactograph is much more useful.

The wrist flick to dismiss the Smart Stack is nice; if you've gotten used to using Double Tap or shaking your head to dismiss Siri with your AirPods, you will find this familiar.

I generally say that if the latest watchOS is available on your watch, you probably don't need to upgrade. WatchOS 26 is available on all watches Series 6 or later; however, this is the first year I'd say that it's worth getting a new watch, especially if you've been waiting to buy one for a kid or elderly relative.

I had the opportunity to test the new Apple Watch SE ($249) and Apple Watch Ultra 3 ($799) as part of this review. The Watch SE hasn't been updated since 2022, and that second-gen model just didn't have many of the latest health features that are by now standard on every fitness tracker. The new Watch SE 3 has the latest chip and many of the health features that the older Watch SE did not have, like wrist temperature sensing and sleep apnea detection. Although it does not have the full 24 hours of battery life the Series 11 boasts, I still managed to eke out a day on one charge somehow. And it still costs only $249.

The new Watch Ultra 3 claims a full 42 hours on full power, up from 36 hours on the Watch Ultra 2. That means you can wear it for a weekend of navigation, satellite messaging, and activity tracking, which you definitely could not before. I tested this out this weekend on a camping trip with trail running, navigating for a several-hour-long drive, and satellite messaging, and it lasted from Friday morning to Sunday morning. It really is a weekend watch now, fulfilling the promise the original Watch Ultra made several years ago.

24-hour battery life is huge. Many users, including my own spouse, did not wear the Apple Watch to sleep, just because it was too annoying to wake up with a drained watch. Being able to wear the watch for 24 hours, instead of skipping one-third of each day, is a sea change.

Even if I find 5G to be personally negligible, satellite messaging dramatically adds to the usefulness of the watch. There are many times that I walk off without my iPhone, especially while camping, hiking, or running. The standard use case I give is leaving a campsite to pee—you think you've walked just a few yards to get behind a tree, and when you look up, you're totally disoriented. Even without the watchOS 26 updates, these two features alone are worth upgrading for. It's a good year for the Apple Watch—dare I say, the year that last year should've been.

Utah County prosecutors on Tuesday charged Tyler Robinson in the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, a murder officials say was politically motivated. They intend to seek the death penalty.

Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray announced the indictment at a midday news conference, listing charges of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, and commission of a violent offense in the presence of a child. Robinson, 22, is also charged with two counts of obstruction and two counts of witness tampering.

“Charlie Kirk was murdered while engaging in one of our most sacred and cherished American rights,” Gray said. “The bedrock of our democratic republic is the free exchange of ideas in a search for truth, understanding, and a more perfect union.”

Gray said that the murder was considered an aggravated offense because it was believed to be motivated by the victim's political expression. On the matter of the death penalty, he added: “I do not take this decision lightly, and it is a decision I have made independently as county attorney based solely on the available evidence and circumstances and nature of the crime.”

Robinson will make his first court appearance at 3 pm MST on Tuesday.

Kirk, 31, was fatally shot on September 10 while taking questions from students. The cofounder of Turning Point USA, he was credited with galvanizing young conservatives and playing a pivotal role in Donald Trump's 2024 White House return.

The shooting sparked chaos on campus, where delayed and contradictory emergency alerts left many students and faculty scrambling in confusion. Vigils for Kirk have since been held in Arizona, New York, and Washington, among other states. Across the US, Kirk's murder has become both a rallying cry for far-right retribution and fuel for an assault on civil society.

Investigators claim forensic evidence links Robinson to the shooting, with FBI director Kash Patel telling Fox & Friends that matching DNA was found on a towel wrapped around the rifle and on a screwdriver recovered from the rooftop where the fatal shot was fired. Patel also said investigators believe Robinson wrote a note of his alleged intent to kill Kirk, bolstering claims the attack was premeditated.

An indictment released Tuesday adds vivid details to the allegations. Prosecutors say surveillance footage captured Robinson climbing onto a campus rooftop, lying prone in a “sniper position,” and firing from nearly 160 yards away. Investigators recovered cartridges at the scene with hand-engraved messages, which prosecutors argue points to premeditation and motive.

Prosecutors also cited interviews with Robinson's parents and roommate, who said he expressed anger that Kirk “spreads too much hate” and admitted he had “enough of his hatred.” The filing further alleges that Robinson told his roommate to stay silent if approached by police and that children were visible near the stage when Kirk was shot—factors prosecutors say aggravated the seriousness of the crime.

The indictment recounts an interview with Robinson's mother, who told investigators her son had grown more political in the past year ""and had started to lean more to the left,"" the indictment claims, citing ""pro-gay"" and ""trans-rights"" views. She described him as becoming increasingly consumed by online debates and grievances, noting his fixation with political topics seemed to intensify in the weeks leading up to the shooting, the indictment says. She added that Robinson had also begun to date his roommate, a transgender woman, adding that his father has “very different political views.” The roommate is said to be fully cooperating with the government.

Investigators are also scrutinizing Robinson's digital footprint. Screenshots obtained by The Washington Post and other outlets allegedly show him confessing in a private Discord chat hours before surrendering: “It was me at UVU yesterday. i'm sorry for all of this.” The same user followed with another message saying he was about to turn himself in through “a sheriff friend.” Discord reportedly confirmed it gave copies of the messages to law enforcement and said it found no evidence that Robinson used the platform to plan or promote violence.

Robinson was arrested roughly 33 hours after the shooting, with authorities saying his parents first recognized him in photos and urged him to surrender. Robinson later turned himself in at the Washington County Sheriff's Office.

Kirk's murder was quickly weaponized to marshal power in Washington, with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance spinning allegations in tandem about a broader left-wing conspiracy—neither offering any evidence to support their claims. On Monday, Vance hosted an episode of The Charlie Kirk Show from the White House, where he and other officials pledged a crackdown on liberal organizations vaguely accused of fueling unrest.

Critics say the White House is exploiting the death to advance partisan aims, using an open criminal case to exact political retribution through the machinery of law.

US security services have long stressed that domestic extremism is driven by varied ideologies, from racially or ethnically motivated movements to anti-government and religious grievances. Multiple studies, nevertheless, have found that right-wing extremists commit far more attacks—and deadlier ones—than the left, a statistical reality that cuts directly against the administration's script.

A Department of Justice study showing that far-right extremist violence “continues to outpace all other types of terrorism and domestic violent extremism” in the US was removed from the DOJ's website this week without explanation.

Envive, a Seattle-based startup that builds AI agents for online retailers, raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Seattle-area venture firm FUSE. 

The company's software creates autonomous agents that help retail brands boost conversion, retention, and discoverability.

Brands such as Spanx, Coterie, Supergoop!, and Wine Enthusiast are using Envive's AI-powered software to engage with customers as they shop on websites and apps. Envive also helps companies improve their visibility in generative AI search results. 

Envive, previously known as Spiffy, is part of a broader trend as companies move from static websites and basic chatbots toward AI agents that can supercharge customer interactions. The 30-person company describes its approach as building “the intelligence layer for commerce.”

The platform offers several types of agents:

Envive said its revenue is expected to grow by 5X this year, with customer count tripling. 

GeekWire previously reported on the company's earlier funding round in 2023. The startup originally spun out of the AI2 Incubator in Seattle. Envive's core technology traces its roots to research at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2).

Envive CEO Aniket Deosthali previously helped Walmart build its generative AI-powered shopping assistant. The company's other co-founders include:

“Commerce is entering the agentic era,” Deosthali said in a statement. “Brands need more than just wrappers around LLMs. They need a system that continuously learns from real-world behavior and drives the outcomes they care about. That's what we are building: self-improving agents with performance, control, and safety at their core.”

The company's other investors include Point72 Ventures, the AI2 Incubator, and Ascend.

“I think their combination of advanced AI expertise and retail execution makes them uniquely positioned to lead the industry,” Sri Chandrasekar, managing partner at Point72 Ventures, said in a statement.

Humanoid robotics company Figure raised its largest round of funding yet, a sign of growing investor interest in robots designed to work alongside humans in warehouses, factories, and other settings.

San Jose, California-based Figure announced on Tuesday that it raised a Series C funding round that values the company at $39 billion. The round, which “exceeded $1 billion,” said Figure, was led by Parkway Venture Capital with participation from Brookfield Asset Management, Nvidia, and Intel Capital, among others.  

Figure said the funding will be used to scale the company's fleet of humanoid robots, build the necessary infrastructure to accelerate robot training, and launch advanced data collection efforts.  

The company has raised nearly $2 billion in funding since its 2022 founding. 

Earlier this year, Figure CEO Brett Adcock claimed that Figure was the most “sought-after” stock on the private market. But the company has also been sending cease-and-desist letters to multiple secondary stock market brokers, telling TechCrunch in April that it sends such letters when a broker isn't authorized to sell its shares. 

TechCrunch has reached out to Figure for comment.

If you are filled with too much childlike wonder, you might get relegated to a more kid-friendly version of ChatGPT. OpenAI announced Tuesday that it plans to implement a new age verification system that will help filter underage users into a new chatbot experience that is more age-appropriate. The change comes as the company faces increased scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators over how underage users interact with its chatbot.

To determine a user's age, OpenAI will use an age prediction system that attempts to estimate how old a user is based on how they interact with ChatGPT. The company said that when it believes a user is under 18, or when it can't make a clear determination, it'll filter them into an experience designed for younger users. For users who are placed in the age-gated experience when they are actually over 18, they will have to provide a form of identification to prove their age. And access the full version of ChatGPT.

Per the company, that version of the chatbot will block “graphic sexual content” and won't respond in flirty or sexually explicit conversations. If an under-18 user is expressing distress or suicidal ideation, it will attempt to contact the users' parents, and may contact the authorities if there are concerns of “imminent harm.” According to OpenAI, its experience for teens prioritizes “safety ahead of privacy and freedom.”

OpenAI offered two examples of how it delineates these experiences:

For example, the default behavior of our model will not lead to much flirtatious talk, but if an adult user asks for it, they should get it. For a much more difficult example, the model by default should not provide instructions about how to commit suicide, but if an adult user is asking for help writing a fictional story that depicts a suicide, the model should help with that request. “Treat our adult users like adults” is how we talk about this internally, extending freedom as far as possible without causing harm or undermining anyone else's freedom.

OpenAI is currently the subject of a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the parents of a 16-year-old who took his own life after expressing suicidal thoughts to ChatGPT. Over the course of the child's conversation with the chatbot, he shared evidence of self-harm and expressed plans to attempt suicide—none of which the platform flagged or elevated in a way that could lead to intervention. Researchers have found that chatbots like ChatGPT can be prompted by users for advice on how to engage in self-harm or to take their own life. Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission requested information from OpenAI and other tech companies on how their chatbots impact children and teens.

The move makes OpenAI the latest company to get in on the age verification trend, which has swept the internet this year—spurred by the Supreme Court's ruling that a Texas law that requires porn sites to verify the age of their users was constitutional, and by the United Kingdom's requirement that online platforms verify the age of users. While some companies have mandated users to upload a form of ID to prove their age, platforms like YouTube have also opted for age prediction methods like OpenAI, a method that has been criticized as inaccurate and creepy.

Hypoglycemia is linked to an increased risk for and progression of diabetic retinopathy, according to new research presented at The Retina Society (TRS) Annual Meeting 2025.

Severe hypoglycemia is linked to a higher rate of retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and proliferative disease in patients with the type 1 form of the condition. Previous research from scientists at Johns Hopkins found periods of hypoglycemia may weaken the blood-retina barrier and promote leakage in the tissue, leading to loss of vision.

The new findings underscore the importance of patients at risk for hypoglycemia to strictly monitor their blood glucose levels to avoid the onset or worsening of retinal problems, said Shree Kurup, MD, lead author of the study and director of Surgical Ocular Immunology and Uveitis and Vitreoretinal Diseases at University Hospital Eye Institute in Cleveland.

Hypoglycemia can severely affect the kidney and the retinas, Kurup said. “Glucose levels below 70 mg typically harm the retina and kidney more than elevated glucose and may lead to blindness. This is new information, since we used to just monitor the hemoglobin A1c, which can be spuriously low in a patient with low glucose levels since it's an average.”

For the retrospective study, Kurup and his colleagues analyzed data from the TriNetX repository on the association between hypoglycemia and diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, relative to both hyperglycemia and normoglycemia. They also evaluated the effect of hypoglycemia on chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Patients with hypoglycemia were roughly 3.5-4.8 times more likely to develop both nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and PDR, as were those with hyperglycemia or controlled blood sugar, according to the researchers.

Being hypoglycemic raised the risk for the two eye conditions as much as 1.68- and 2.05-fold, respectively, in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with those with type 1 diabetes. “Additionally, hypoglycemia elevated risk of progression from NPDR to PDR to a similar degree as hyperglycemia, up to 1.99 (1.56, 2.54) in type 2 diabetics, relative to normoglycemia,” they reported.

Neil M. Bressler, MD, the James P. Gills Professor of Ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, said hypoglycemia can manifest symptoms that range from mild to severe. “This study revealed an increased association between hypoglycemic events and the risk for having a milder amount of damage to the retina due to diabetes and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, or a severe amount of damage and proliferative diabetic retinopathy,” said Bressler, who helped conduct the new research.

Hypoglycemia also appeared to increase the risk for CKD, end stage renal disease, and progression from the former to the latter, the researchers found. Patients with CKD have a higher risk for hypoglycemia and related complications, according to the American Diabetes Association, and research shows that retinopathy can serve as a marker of CKD severity and the progression of one often aligns with the progression of the other.

Bressler emphasized that these findings reveal associations, not necessarily causation or cause and effect. The new results “may or may not be due to the hypoglycemic events,” he said. “Instead, the results may be tied to a confounding factor that caused the retinopathy, such as severe hyperglycemic events where the challenge to control this condition sometimes results in low blood sugar levels.”

“These finding emphasizes the need for patients to regularly monitor their blood glucose, not hemoglobin A1C,” Kurup said.

Bressler's employer, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, received grants from Regeneron. He is editor in chief of JAMA Ophthalmology, chair of the National Eye Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee for intramural trials, and volunteers on the Board of Directors for the JAEB Center for Health Research.

Kurup reported no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

A cross-sectional study found that frailty — but not chronological age — was associated with higher risk for local and systemic postoperative complications in older women undergoing surgery for nonmetastatic breast cancer.

""Our findings suggest that frailty and not chronological age alone should be considered in surgical decision-making and planning,” the authors wrote. In particular, they added, ""patients with frailty traveling long distances, with little social support, or with low health literacy may require more robust postoperative support and navigation from clinicians or at-home services.""

The study, led by Eliza H. Lorentzen, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, was published online in JAMA Network Open.

Limitations included reliance on SEER-Medicare coding and the absence of a clinical gold standard for frailty assessment. The study also lacked detail on factors influencing complication risk and on the clinical significance of complications.

The collection of cancer incidence data used in the study was supported by the California Department of Public Health, the US National Cancer Institute, and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Lorentzen was supported by the Brigham and Women's Department of Surgery Hale Family Research Fellowship. Several authors reported receiving grants, personal fees, and having other ties with various sources. Full disclosures are noted in the original article.

Receptor proteins, expressed on the cell surface or within the cell, bind to different signaling molecules, known as ligands, initiating cellular responses. Taste receptors, expressed in oral tissues, interact with tastants, the molecules responsible for the sensation of taste. Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) are responsible for the sensation of bitter taste. However, apart from oral tissue, these receptors are also expressed in the neuropod cells of the gastrointestinal tract, which are responsible for transmitting signals from the gut to the brain. Thus, T2Rs might play a crucial role in maintaining the gut-brain axis.

25 types of human T2Rs have been identified to date. However, due to certain complexities, the structure of most of these receptors is not yet elucidated. In recent times, AI-based prediction models have been used to understand protein structure accurately. Previously, a Nobel Prize-winning artificial intelligence (AI)-based model, AlphaFold2 (AF2), was utilized to decipher the structures of T2Rs. However, with the advancement in technology, the model has been updated to its latest version, AlphaFold3 (AF3). The latest model allows a more detailed structural prediction compared to the previous version.

Hence, in this study, a group of researchers, led by Professor Naomi Osakabe from Shibaura Institute of Technology, decided to analyze the structure of T2Rs using the AF3 model and compare the accuracy with the results from the AF2-based prediction study and the available three-dimensional structures of the two T2Rs, T2R14 and T2R46. ""The expression of bitter taste receptors in the gastrointestinal tract indicates that they are involved in maintaining the gut-brain axis, glucose tolerance, and appetite regulation. Hence, understanding the structure can provide a better insight into its function,"" mentioned Prof. Osakabe as the main motivation behind this study. The paper was made available online on July 14, 2025, and was published in Volume 11 of the journal Current Research in Food Science on July 22, 2025. This article has been co-authored by Takafumi Shimizu and Rio Ohno, from Shibaura Institute of Technology, and Professor Vittorio Calabrese, from the University of Catania.

The researchers obtained the amino acid sequences of all human T2Rs from the UniProt database and used the AF3 model to predict their three-dimensional structures. For comparison, previously generated AF2 prediction data were retrieved from the AlphaFold database. The experimentally determined structures of T2R14 and T2R46 were sourced from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Various software tools were employed for structure visualization, alignment, and accuracy assessment.

The analysis revealed that AF3 provided consistently more accurate structural predictions than AF2. For T2R14, predictions were benchmarked against 115 cryo-EM structures, and AF3 showed the higher agreement with experimental data. Similarly, for T2R46, comparisons with three experimentally resolved structures confirmed that AF3 achieved the closest match in all cases.

Similarities in the structure of the T2Rs were also analyzed for this study. For these receptors, part of the protein remains inside the cell, known as the intracellular region, while another part stays outside the cell (extracellular region). The interaction with signal molecules happens in the extracellular region. The study demonstrated that there are more structural similarities and consistencies among the intracellular regions of the T2Rs. The extracellular region of the receptors shows significant structural variation. ""Clustering of proteins is based on their structural similarity and dissimilarity. Based on our findings, we divided the T2Rs into three different clusters,"" states Prof. Osakabe. These patterns may help researchers understand how different T2Rs function and why certain receptors respond to specific compounds.

The structure of T2Rs probably allows them to recognize the thousands of different bitter substances via interaction with another taste receptor-specific G protein, α-gustducin. ""With the receptors' involvement in detecting bitter tastants and maintaining the gut-brain axis, this can play an important role in health and pharmaceutical-based research, specifically targeting lifestyle diseases like diabetes,"" mentioned Prof. Osakabe, explaining the importance of this study. Further research, focusing on the relation between sequence and structure of the T2Rs and how individual perception of taste varies, will help in a more comprehensive understanding of T2R function.

A diet focused on healthy plant-based foods may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, according to a new study by Solomon Sowah and colleagues from the MRC Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, published September 16th in the open-access journal PLOS Medicine.

Growing research shows that unhealthy foods not only impact your health but are also detrimental to the environment. Diets such as the Planetary Health Diet (PHD) recommend high amounts of healthy plant-based foods and limited animal-derived foods and sugary drinks to improve both human and environmental health. Data on the impact of these types of diets show inconsistent findings, and there is little epidemiological data specifically examining the effect of the PHD on type 2 diabetes or environmental factors, such as greenhouse gas emissions.

In this study, researchers analyzed dietary data from more than 23,000 people in the UK taken at three timepoints across 20 years. They found that higher adherence to the PHD was associated with lower incidence of type 2 diabetes-participants in the top fifth of adherence had a 32% lower incidence of type 2 diabetes compared to those in the bottom fifth. Higher adherence to the PHD was also associated with lower greenhouse emissions-among those in the top fifth of adherence, greenhouse gas emissions were 18% lower compared to those in the bottom fifth.

The researchers recognize that while the study does not show a direct causal link between the PHD and type 2 diabetes, promoting healthier plant-based diets could be an important strategy to simultaneously prevent type 2 diabetes while reducing the negative impact of diet on the environment.

Dr. Solomon Sowah says, ""Our motivation for this study was to address the limited evidence regarding the association between the planetary health diet and both type 2 diabetes incidence and greenhouse gas emissions in a European population. We found that the planetary health diet containing higher amounts of wholegrains, fruits and vegetables, and lower amounts of red and processed meat and sugary drinks was associated with lower type 2 diabetes incidence and lower diet-related greenhouse gas emissions.""

These findings provide support for the potential of the planetary health diet to make a meaningful contribution to help prevent type 2 diabetes. What's more is that eating in line with the planetary health diet is also linked with a lower environmental impact. So, it offers a win-win to potentially help improve both human and planetary health. Action will be needed from all players, including individuals and policy makers to enable food consumption aligned with this dietary approach.""

Research led by the Transforming and Expanding Access to Mental Health Care Universally in Pediatrics (TEAM UP) Scaling and Sustainability Center of Boston Medical Center (BMC) finds that children who receive behavioral health services delivered through the TEAM UP Model™ of integrated behavioral health care have fewer behavioral health symptoms. The findings, published recently in JAMA Network Open, offer new hope for addressing the children's mental health crisis. 

Several prior studies demonstrate that TEAM UP improves access to behavioral services for kids seen in pediatrics. This study takes the next step: we demonstrated that when they use TEAM UP's behavioral health services, kids and their parents or caregivers report fewer symptoms over time.""

R. Christopher Sheldrick, PhD, research and evaluation co-director of TEAM UP at BMC and senior author of this study

TEAM UP equips primary care practices to integrate behavioral health care to ensure all children and youth have access to services using a team-based approach. Co-developed with pediatric practices, the model includes a fully integrated multidisciplinary care team-behavioral health clinicians, community health workers, and primary care providers -to promote healthy development and ensure early identification of behavioral health issues. 

Led by Jihye Kim, PhD, the observational study included 942 children aged 4 to 18 with an identified behavioral health concern at four Massachusetts federally qualified health centers that implemented the TEAM UP model. The team measured children's behavioral health symptoms before and after they received behavioral health treatment -- which included encounters with behavioral health clinicians or medications prescribed by their primary care providers --using the PSC-17, a common screening tool for psychosocial symptoms in pediatrics. 

The researchers found that PSC-17 scores were lower after treatment, which suggests that behavioral health symptoms improved. ""TEAM UP practices see first-hand the success of integrating mental and physical healthcare in a single, convenient setting,"" notes Megan Bair-Merritt, MD, MSCE, Chief Scientific Officer for BMC Health System and past director of TEAM UP's research team. ""TEAM UP's approach of fully integrating behavioral health care into pediatric primary care not only addresses challenges children face in accessing mental health services but also seems to provide significant symptom improvement."" 

""It means that TEAM UP is better prepared to scale and to continue to enhance the rigor of its scientific evaluation."" TEAM UP is currently expanding its services across Massachusetts and beyond. The Center recently launched a new cohort of practices that will implement the TEAM UP Model, expanding its reach to an additional 40,000 children across the state. The Center is also working with local partners in New York City and Atlanta, Georgia, to begin to scale the model nationally.

When someone has a stroke - a leading worldwide cause of death and disability - time is of the essence. Almost nine out of 10 cases are ischemic strokes, caused by restricted blood flow in the brain, and the current gold-standard treatment that breaks up blood clots must be delivered within four and a half hours of symptoms appearing. 

Researchers are on the hunt for ways to extend that ticking clock and enable better stroke recovery. One promising prospect is an experimental stem cell therapy to help repair damaged brain tissue, co-developed by scientists at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich in Switzerland. A study in the journal Nature Communications showed that a stem cell transplant performed one week after an ischemic stroke in mice led to recovery.

There are a lot of patients who cannot get the acute treatment, and their blood vessels remain blocked. If we can bring this treatment to the clinic in the future, it may help patients who have long-term symptoms or large strokes see recovery.""

Ruslan Rust, PhD, co-corresponding author, assistant professor of research physiology and neuroscience at the Keck School of Medicine

Rust and his colleagues reprogrammed human blood cells into neural stem cells - which can mature into neurons - and transplanted them into the damaged brain tissue of mice that had strokes. After five weeks, the researchers compared their recovery to a group of mice from the same litter that had strokes but underwent surgery without transplantation. 

The brains of the mice that received transplanted neural stem cells showed more robust signs of recovery than those of untreated mice. The transplant recipients' brains had less inflammation, more growth of neurons and blood vessels, and more connectivity among neurons than the brains of the mice that did not receive transplanted cells. The treated mice also had less leakage from the blood-brain barrier, which is important for normal brain function and acts as a filter to keep harmful substances out of the brain.

To measure function, the researchers used artificial intelligence to closely track the movement of the animals' limbs while walking and climbing up a ladder with irregular rungs. 

""Recovery can be hard to determine in mice, so we needed to see these little differences,"" Rust said. ""The unbiased view we got through this deep learning tool gave us a lot more detail about this complex process.""

The team found that treated mice fully recovered the fine motor skills tested in the climbing task five weeks after the transplants. By the end of the study, their gait also improved significantly compared to mice that received a sham surgery.

When the researchers looked at which types of cells died off due to stroke, they found roughly a 50% reduction in neurons that secrete gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which decreases activity in the brain cells to which it binds. These GABA-secreting neurons, known as GABAergic neurons, have previously been shown to assist stroke recovery.

The team also explored the fate of the transplanted stem cells, finding that the majority had become GABAergic neurons. This is a possible indication that the local environment where the stroke injured the brain may help steer the development of the neural stem cells.

Rust and his colleagues also analyzed the interactions between the transplanted cells and other cells in the brains of the mice. They found strong activity in several signaling pathways that were shown in prior studies to be associated with regenerating neurons, forming connections between neurons, and guiding how neurons branch out.

""Mechanistic insight can be quite important if we seek to inform new therapies or improve emerging ones,"" Rust said. ""Understanding the mechanisms allows us to think about adapting a drug that regulates them - perhaps one that's already clinically approved for a different disease. It could open up a whole new wave of therapies.""

The team is currently investigating other ways to increase activity in the pathways identified in the study and evaluating the results of the transplant in mice for periods longer than five weeks.

""If we can help people by transplanting stem cells into a human stroke patient, we want the cells to be there for the rest of their life,"" Rust said. ""So our aim would be to look across the whole lifetime of a mouse and see what happens with the cells, and also see whether this recovery is sustained or even improves.""

Other co-authors are Beatriz Achón Buil, Nora Rentsch, Patrick Perron, Stefanie Halliday, Chantal Bodenmann, Kathrin Zürcher, Daniela Uhr, Debora Meier, Siri Peter, Melanie Generali of the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich; Allison Bosworth, Mingzi Zhang and Kassandra Kisler of the Keck School of Medicine; Shuo Lin and Markus Rüegg of the University of Basel in Switzerland; and Roger Nitsch of Neurimmune, a Swiss biopharmaceutical company.

Gab & Juls discuss the perception around Mauricio Pochettino and the USMNT. (2:38)

Hundreds more football clubs will get shares of a $355 million FIFA fund from its multi-billion 2026 World Cup revenues for releasing players to men's national teams.

FIFA said on Tuesday the program which has shared a total of hundreds of millions of dollars among clubs whose players were selected for each World Cup finals tournament since 2010 will now include all players who took part in qualifying games.

Eritrea and Russia -- which has been suspended from international football since 2022 -- did not play qualifying games among FIFA's 211 member federations.

""This new approach means that any club that releases a player for a FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier will now be directly compensated,"" FIFA said in a statement.

Clubs that release players for World Cup qualifiers will be compensated for the first time ever, whether or not the player plays at the final tournament.

FIFA previously agreed on a $355m allocation for the 2026 edition in the United States, Canada and Mexico as part of a renewed working agreement with the European Club Association (ECA) signed more than two years ago.

That was an increase from $209m paid to clubs worldwide from each of the past two editions, played in Qatar in 2022 and Russia in 2018.

FIFA said 440 clubs across 51 member countries got payments from the 2022 program, which were calculated as a daily rate for as long as players were involved with their squads at the tournament. Manchester City got the biggest payment with almost $4.6m.

The highest-earning clubs will earn a lower overall share this time because the pool of eligible teams has widened due to FIFA expanding the men's World Cup to 48 teams from 32, and qualifying games now also included.

More than 900 clubs across all 55 UEFA member countries got payments from a similar European program that already includes qualifying games for national team competitions played for four years through 2024.

FIFA created its ""club benefits program"" with $40m of revenue from the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as part of a deal with the ECA which was created two years earlier.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Sunette Viljeon is perhaps South Africa's most precious cricketer – she played cricket for her country between 2000 and 2002, including the Cricket World Cup 2000 in New Zealand. She made a return to the sport in 2021 with domestic side Northerns, and has been playing most recently for Lions women. But her moment of glory? The fabulous Olympics silver in javelin at the Rio Olympics.

Cricket is replete with stories of multi-skilled athletes from across the world.

Ellyse Perry is a two-time ICC Cricket World Cup winner, but also was part of the Matildas (Australian football national team), at the FIFA World Cup in 2011.

Not to be left behind should an Ashes rivalry crop up, Clare Taylor of Yorkshire, bowled fast for 127 wickets in 121 matches and went on to become 1993 World Cup winner at Lord's. Two years later in 1995, she represented England at FIFA World Cup.

New Zealand captain Suzie Bates represented her country at the Beijing Olympics in basketball in 2008, and was later also Cricketer of the Year in 2013 and 2016.

Elite international cricketers have paved the path with their multi-skilled outings in various sports, reaching the top in more than one sport. While the upcoming Cricket World Cup 2025 will showcase the biggest and brightest talents in the women's game as Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka battle it out to try and reach the final on 2 November, it will also be a celebration of these sporting polyglots who went beyond the boundaries of cricket.

The ICC while turning pages of history, wrote: “To reach cricket's pinnacle requires talent, hard work and a steadfast determination, but over the years, a handful of past and present stars have reached the top of other sports too.”
It started with the game's finest pioneers, Rachel Heyhoe Flint, who captained England between 1966 and 1978, who first hit a six in a Test match in 1973. She also played field hockey for England in 1964 as a goalkeeper.

Hailing from Wolverhampton, she was instrumental in arranging the inaugural women's World Cup in 1973, which came two years before the first men's World Cup.H eyhoe Flint last played for England in the 1982 World Cup final and was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in October 2010 after her 22-year international career.

Australian Ellyse Perry is a multi-sport legend after debuting for her country in both cricket and football at 16. ‘Perry played for Central Coast Mariners, Canberra United and Sydney FC during her footballing career and made 18 appearances for the Matildas. She has played at each sport's respective World Cups, scoring against Sweden at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup.Perry has been a top cricket star and a six-time world champion in T20Is,' ICC wrote.

Taylor on the other foot, spent 18 years at Yorkshire and played her club football for Bronte and Liverpool Ladies.

She is an ICC Hall of Famer too.

Bates, after her Beijing stint in Olympics basketball for the Tall Ferns, came from Dunedin decided only in 2011 to focus on cricket. She was also the T20I Cricketer of the Year award, also in 2016.

Also from the southern hemisphere, but South Africa came the youngest player to represent South Africa in an ODI when she made her debut aged just 17 years and 10 days, but crucially, Sunette Viljoen won a silver medal in javelin at the Rio Olympics. The Rustenburg native also won gold medals at the Commonwealth Games in 2006 and 2010.

The Saffers in fact more recently boasted iof Tazmin Brits, who too qualified for the 2012 Olympics in javelin but just eight months before the Games, she was involved in a horrific car accident which resulted in her breaking her pelvis, dislocating her hip and bursting her bladder, as per ICC.

Brits spent three months in hospital and had to learn how to walk again as she missed the London showpiece.

In 2018, however, Brits debuted in T20 against Bangladesh and is now a two-time ICC Women's T20 World Cup runner-up.

In fact as far back as 1934, when Gone With the Wind conceptualised filming for Scarlett O'Hara, Betty Snowball started her 15-year international cricket journey between 1934 to 1949 and also umpired one women's Test in 1951. The ICC wrote, ‘In 1935, Snowball hit 189 against New Zealand in what was just the fourth-ever women's Test. Her score was the world record for the highest individual score at the time and wasn't broken until 1986.'

What made her the Scotts queen was away from cricket, Snowball represented Scotland in squash and lacrosse.

The upcoming World Cup has a storied precedent from the last time India hosted in 2013. Australia's top scorer in the final and player of the match, was Jess Duffin nee Cameron.

Post cricket, she dabbled at and got good at Aussie Rules, turning out for the famous Collingwood, North Melbourne and Hawthorn, after retiring from cricket in 2023. She was also the first player to benefit from Cricket Australia's parental leave scheme when she had her first child, ICC noted.

The new tune written for her pops' recent 64th birthday features Mick Fleetwood and Lindsey Buckingham.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Miley Cyrus is getting ready to unleash her “Secrets.” Three weeks after teasing the song she said she wrote for dad Billy Ray Cyrus for his 64th birthday, Miley revealed on Tuesday morning (Sept. 16) that “Secrets” will drop this Friday (Sept. 19).


	She previewed the stand-alone single in an Instagram post featuring a short snippet of her crooning, “Anywhere you go/ You know I'll follow,” a cappella backed by a chorus of voices shadowing her vocals. In a brief video snippet accompanying the post, Cyrus is seen in close-up staring directly into the camera while wearing what looks like surgical gauze around her chin and head as more white material is blown by a breeze around her face.

	











	Cyrus has not said much else about the tune she first teased last month, which Billy Ray said in an Instagram story at the time was a “gift of music” his daughter gave him for his recent bday. Billy noted that the track featured two of his “favorite musicians” from Fleetwood Mac. According to People, Miley previewed the song that features former Mac bandmates drummer Mick Fleetwood and singer/guitarist Lindsey Buckingham in June during her visit to Monica Lewinsky's podcast, where she talked about how writing it helped her resolve some long-running tensions between herself and her father.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I wrote this song about my dad because I wanted him to tell me even though there were secrets, even though I didn't really want to know,” she told Lewinsky about the track that finds Miley singing: “Secrets, I want to keep your secrets/ Like sunlight in the shadows/ Like footsteps in the grass/I won't ever break my promise/ Like a songbird in the silence/ Like stones against the glass.”


	Cyrus added, “I wanted to be the one he felt safe enough to tell me the things that were damning and damaging to the family. I wanted him to think that as a middle child, I'm old enough that I could take some of that.”


	Noah Cyrus recently set the record straight on the numerous rumors surrounding an alleged family feud. Noah told People that she tries to keep herself “quite separated” from the family “drama” that has reportedly unfolded since Billy Ray and Tish Cyrus' breakup after nearly 30 years of marriage in 2022. Speculation has bubbled that Noah and her siblings, including Miley, had taken sides in the break-up.


	She also said a heated letters posted by older brother Trace on his socials were blown out of proportion.  “Yeah, it emotionally is draining,” she said. “But it doesn't hurt us or touch us. It's something that you really learn to keep separate and far away from yourself,” adding, “everybody's great and loves each other.”

The Great 78 Project aimed to preserve brittle old records for the sake of history, but the labels called it ""wholesale theft of generations of music.""


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Universal Music Group, Sony Music Group and Concord have reached a settlement to end their lawsuit  against the Internet Archive over a project to digitize old vinyl records from Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Bing Crosby and other iconic artists.


	In a motion filed Friday in Manhattan federal court, both sides say they have a deal to resolve litigation over the “Great 78 Project,” in which thousands of physical records have been digitized and made available to users for free.


	Terms of the agreement were not disclosed, and neither side immediately responded to requests for more details on the settlement. The Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the major labels, said in a statement: “The parties have reached a confidential resolution of all claims and will have no further public comment on this matter.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The labels sued in August 2023, calling the Great 78 Project the “wholesale theft of generations of music” under the guise of historical preservation: “The Great 78 website is a massive, unauthorized, digital record store of recordings.”


	The Internet Archive fired back that its project was no such nefarious effort – and that it had “preserved hundreds of thousands of recordings that are stored on shellac resin, an obsolete and brittle medium.”


	“When people want to listen to music they go to Spotify,” Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle said in the statement at the time. “When people want to study sound recordings as they were originally created, they go to libraries like the Internet Archive. Both are needed. There shouldn't be conflict here.”


	Though the lawsuit claimed that “hundreds of thousands” of songs had been illegally copied, the labels specifically sued over 2,749 songs, including iconic tracks like Crosby's “White Christmas” and Sinatra's “I've Got the World on a String.” They later added thousand more to the case.


	In the two years since the case was filed, it has chugged slowly along. In May 2024, a federal judge refused the Internet Archive's request to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing it to move into discovery and toward an eventual trial. Earlier this year, the non-profit accused the labels of “gamesmanship,” claiming they were “stonewalling” on key evidence and unfairly trying to add more songs to the case.


	But in April, the case was halted after the two sides said they had made “significant progress in settlement discussions.” It has remained largely on ice ever since, leading to Monday's settlement notice.

	The ballroom will be without one familiar face for the Dancing with the Stars Season 34 premiere.


	Longtime judge Carrie Ann Inaba will miss the first show due to illness, she revealed Tuesday morning on her social media. Sources tell Deadline that there will be no replacement judge in Inaba's place, meaning the Season 34 contestants will only hear from judges Bruno Tonioli and Derek Hough tonight.


	“I wanted to share that I will not be at the show tonight as I am feeling quite under the weather. I'm resting up and can't wait to be back next week in good health,” Inaba wrote in her post. “In the meantime, I wish all the contestants the very best of luck. I'll be cheering you on from home.”

Lionsgate on Tuesday released the trailer for The Housemaid, its upcoming thriller directed by Paul Feig and starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried.


	The movie, which is set to hit theaters December 19, is based on the bestselling novel by Freida McFadden and centers on Millie (Sweeney), who tries to escape her past by accepting a job as a live-in housemaid for wealthy couple Nina (Seyfried) and Andrew Winchester (Brandon Sklenar). It doesn't take long before what seems like a good gig unravels into something far more dangerous as secrets and scandals emerge.


	Michele Morrone and Elizabeth Perkins also star.

	











The Boys and The Vampire Diaries scribe Rebecca Sonnenshine adapted the book for the pic, which is produced by Todd Lieberman, Laura Fischer and Feig.

NY & Broadway Editor


Refresh for updates...Barbra Streisand is paying tribute to her late co-star Robert Redford, writing in part on Instagram, “Every day on the set of The Way We Were was exciting, intense and pure joy,”…  Bob was charismatic, intelligent, intense, always interesting— and one of the finest actors ever.as exciting, intense and pure joy.” 


	See Streisand's full statement below, along with many others.


	Leonardo DiCaprio is adding his voice in praise of the late Robert Redford, noting, part, “His unwavering commitment to protecting our planet and inspiring change matched his immense talent. His impact will endure for generations to come.”

	











	In a statement, Jane Fonda also paid tribute to Redford, who died Tuesday at 89. The two were frequent co-stars (Barefoot in the Park, The Chase, The Electric Horseman and Our Souls At Night) – and lifelong friends.


	“It hit me hard this morning when I read that Bob was gone,” Fonda said in the statement provided to news outlets. “I can't stop crying. He meant a lot to me and was a beautiful person in every way. He stood for an America we have to keep fighting for.”


	Meryl Streep also honored her Out of Africa co-star, saying in a statement, “One of the lions has passed. Rest in peace my lovely friend.”


	Streep's was just one of many tributes to the Hollywood and indie film icon that began arriving with news of Redford's death today at 89, and will no doubt continue throughout the day.


	Tom Rothman, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, said in a statement, “In addition to being a titanic acting and directing talent, as an early board member of the Sundance Institute, I saw first-hand the Sundance Kid's passionate commitment to indie film and young artists. Robert Redford truly gave back. The entire scope of American film would have been much poorer without him. An amazing legacy of an amazing man.” 


	The Sundance Institute said in a statement: “We are deeply saddened by the loss of our founder and friend Robert Redford. Bob's vision of a space and a platform for independent voices launched a movement that, over four decades later, has inspired generations of artists and redefined cinema in the U.S. and around the world. Beyond his enormous contributions to culture at large, we will miss his generosity, clarity of purpose, curiosity, rebellious spirit, and his love for the creative process. We are humbled to be among the stewards of his remarkable legacy, which will continue to guide the Institute in perpetuity.”

	











	The Cannes Film Festival also weighed in Tuesday:“Forever Robert Redford.


	“Forever the cowboy, the escapee, the candidate, the prisoner, the Great Gatsby, the con man, the student, the playboy, the loner, the cryptographer, the military man, the reporter, the rodeo champion, the lover, the baseball star, the sailor, the horse whisperer… More than 70 roles, nine directed films, the founding of the Sundance Independent Film Festival. And throughout a life dedicated to cinema, an unparalleled elegance in his art, his commitments, and his struggles. Redford was more than a myth: he was a role model. Forever Robert Redford, an electric horseman in love with freedom.”


	On The View today, moderator Whoopi Goldberg started the show by sharing news of Redford's death with an audibly surprised audience, then led a panel discussion about favorite movies from the actor's career. Among the many films mentioned, Goldberg noted a favorite Twilight Zone episode from 1962 titled “Nothing in the Dark,” in which Redford played the personification of death. Behar praised the romance classic The Way We Were, as well as Three Days of the Condor.


	“I was really struck by his work on climate change,” co-host Sunny Hostin said. “He knew that it would be a problem before many people were paying attention. That says something about caring for the world that he would leave behind.”


	Also remembering Redford today was Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who wrote on social media of Redford's impact on the state with the Sundance Film Festival: “Decades ago, Robert Redford came to Utah and fell in love with this place. He cherished our landscapes and built a legacy that made Utah a home for storytelling and creativity. Through Sundance and his devotion to conservation, he shared Utah with the world. Today we honor his life, his vision, and his lasting contribution to our state.”


	President Donald Trump, told of Redford's passing while speaking to reporters before his visit to the UK, said, “Robert Redford had a series of years where there was nobody better. There was a period of time when he was the hottest. I thought he was great.”


	Hillary Clinton also paid tribute to Redford, writing on social media that she “always admired Robert Redford, not only for his legendary career as an actor and director but for what came next. He championed progressive values like protecting the environment and access to the arts while creating opportunities for new generations of activists and filmmakers. A true American icon.”


	Others also weighed in:


	Directors Guild of America President Lesli Linka Glatter: “With Bob's passing, we have lost an incomparable director, actor, and independent film icon. Bob's masterful directorial debut in 1980 with Ordinary People, for which he won the DGA Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Feature Film, not only catapulted his career as a director, but also showcased his ability to rouse powerful, resonant performances from his actors,” said DGA President Lesli Linka Glatter. “He proved himself a master time and time again with such modern classics as The River Runs Through It, Quiz Show, for which he earned a DGA Award nomination in 1994, and Lions for Lambs.


	“Bob was also a passionate advocate,” Glatter continued, “always searching for ways to support filmmakers and bolster the craft of storytelling. His establishment of the Sundance Institute over 40 years ago embodies his legacy of giving back – shaping the landscape of independent filmmaking and paving the way for more diverse voices to be heard. And through his decades-long stewardship of the Sundance Film Festival, he advanced a showcase where independent film could truly thrive. He was a strong believer in film preservation through his service on the Board of Directors for The Film Foundation. He was also deeply involved in the DGA's political action committee and in helping steer its legislative efforts. A member since 1979, the entire DGA community mourns Bob's passing and is forever grateful for his efforts in supporting generations of new filmmakers. We will miss him dearly.” 

	











	“Our film, Coda, came to the attention of everyone because of Sundance,” wrote Marlee Matlin on X. “And Sundance happened because of Robert Redford. A genius has passed.”


	“What a career, what an actor, what a sad loss,” wrote Piers Morgan.


	Film at Lincoln Center called Redford “a true icon of the silver screen, a tireless champion of up-and-coming film artists…”

His best films were among the latter where a refective Reford came to the forefront and added immensely to the films.  He showed every actor that their talent became more formidable as they matured and he was a guiding light to all actors in that respect.  

He will be missed for his contributions to budding directors and actors at Sundance and deserves all praise for his life's collective work in the  field of acting and entertaining millions of Americans.  

A star was just dimmed in Hollywood in his passing…RIP, Mr. Redford…

He epitomized what was GOOD and RIGHT with America. “The Natural” is one of the greatest baseball movies ever made. And my generation can still shed a tear after seeing Redford as Hubble, whose love for Barbara Streisand's Katie was doomed yet will endure forever.
The word “icon” IS Mr. Redford.

I'm afraid to watch The Way We Were now. I know that the ending will hit even harder.

What an amazing life and incredible career and a wonderful person. Rest in peace.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","YouTube will protect creators' faces with ""likeness detection"" tool","https://www.avclub.com/youtube-likeness-detection-tool-rollout","Tue, 16 Sep 2025 18:43:52 GMT","

How are we supposed to protect ourselves as the internet becomes an increasingly tangled web of mis- and disinformation? YouTube is working on solutions for its creators, including a new likeness detection tool. Originally announced last year with a pilot program that included users MrBeast, Mark Robert, Doctor Mike, and Marques Brownlee, the company announced on Tuesday that the tool will now become available to all YouTube Partner Program creators. “Creators can already request the removal of AI fakes, including face and voice, through our existing privacy process. What this new technology does is scale that protection,” YouTube's vice president of creator products Amjad Hanif told Axios.

Per the outlet, the tool works by having users upload an image of their face, which will then be tracked and detected elsewhere on the platform. Creators can then request to have the content removed through YouTube's privacy complaint process. Other new features announced on Tuesday include generative AI tools for creating and editing video or turning speech into song. According to Variety, YouTube uses Google DeepMind's SynthID watermarks and content labels to indicate that applicable videos were generated with AI. Like every other tech company, YouTube is incorporating AI wherever it can. However, the platform is attempting to balance between embracing the innovations and protecting creators from them. 

Hanif told Axios that YouTube “is looking to expand its detection technology beyond face to other forms of likeness.” For instance, one of the tools announced last year “will allow partners to automatically detect and manage AI-generated content on YouTube that simulates their singing voices.” YouTube has also endorsed the NO FAKES Act, which would require platforms to respond quickly to takedown requests for AI-generated likenesses. As Hanif explained, “For us, a responsible AI future needs two things: clear legal frameworks like NO FAKES, and the scalable technology—which we're building—to actually enforce those principles on our platform.”

Casting rumors for Season 15 of the “Real Housewives of New Jersey” have swirled ever since the franchise was first put on pause in August 2024. At first, Bravo fans worried that the series would never return; then, earlier this summer, Andy Cohen finally confirmed that things were in motion. 

In early September, reports surfaced that Melissa Gorga, Dolores Catania, and Margaret Josephs were “test-filming” with a few potential new cast members. 

Luann de Lesseps shared her thoughts on what's really going on with RHONJ on Page Six Radio earlier this week.

Luann de Lesseps was a long-time cast member of the “Real Housewives of New York.“ That means that she most definitely knows how things work at Bravo. In a new interview, she had a hard time believing that they would waste the resources on test shooting.

“Are they test shooting or are they actually shooting? I think they're probably actually shooting, if you ask me.” The countess believes that the new girls who were filming may have been testing, but that the footage captured would be used.

“[You think they'd] waste their time and crews? You need sound and you need lighting, you need crew.”

The one person who was not included in any of the early filming is Teresa Giudice. That fact has fueled speculation that she may not return to the series that made her a household name. 

When asked if she thought that RHONJ could work if the focus were on Melissa Gorga, Lu said, “Listen, it can go south in a second. So I'm saying, you just never know.”

According to Ok Magazine on Aug. 29, 2025, Margaret Josephs is the new focus.

“There are lots of rumors trying to be put out that Teresa filmed test footage for RHONJ, but the truth is she didn't. But [only] Melissa Gorga, Margaret Josephs, and Dolores Catania filmed with new women … It's really looking probable that Bravo is moving on without [Teresa]. Bravo has decided to pursue building the show around Margaret as the main character for the time being,” explained a source.

Do you believe that RHONJ is actually already filming? Which of the ladies do you want to see return for Season 15? Do you believe that the franchise can work without Teresa shaking things up and flipping tables?

Tributes are pouring in for Robert Redford, the great actor, director, and Sundance Film Festival founder who died September 16 at the age of 89. One of the most moving comes from his costar Jane Fonda, who appeared in five movies with him: 1960's “Tall Story” (Redford's first movie — he went uncredited), 1966's “The Chase,” 1967's “Barefoot in the Park,” 1979's “The Electric Horseman,” and 2017's “Our Souls at Night.”

In a statement provided to IndieWire, Fonda said, “It hit me hard this morning when I read that Bob was gone. I can't stop crying. He meant a lot to me and was a beautiful person in every way. He stood for an America we have to keep fighting for.”

Barbra Streisand later added on Instagram, “Every day on the set of ‘The Way We Were' was exciting, intense and pure joy. We were such opposites: he was from the world of horses; I was allergic to them! Yet, we kept trying to find out more about each other, just like the characters in the movie. Bob was charismatic, intelligent, intense, always interesting— and one of the finest actors ever. The last time I saw him, when he came to lunch, we discussed art and decided to send each other our first drawings.He was one of a kind and I'm so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him.”

 










The Sundance Institute said in a statement about its founder, “We are deeply saddened by the loss of our founder and friend Robert Redford. Bob's vision of a space and a platform for independent voices launched a movement that, over four decades later,has inspired generations of artists and redefined cinema in the U.S. and around the world. Beyond his enormous contributions to culture at large, we will miss his generosity, clarity of purpose, curiosity, rebellious spirit, and his love for the creative process. We are humbled to be among the stewards of his remarkable legacy, which will continue to guide the Institute in perpetuity.” 

Morgan Freeman, who starred with him in “Brubaker” and “An Unfinished Life” posted on Instagram, “There are certain people you know that you're going to click with. After working with Robert Redford on ‘Brubaker' in 1980, we instantly became friends. Working with him again in ‘An Unfinished Life' was a dream come true. Rest peacefully, my friend.”

Robert Rodriguez credited his career to “El Mariachi” being accepted to Sundance in his tribute. “I grew up on Robert Redford films, he was the massive superstar of my youth,” Rodriguez wrote on X. “So to have El Mariachi accepted into his Sundance Film Festival — the most important and prestigious independent film festival in the world — remains one of the biggest highlights of my life. His sanctuary in Park City was like a dream: You fly in, meet Redford, present your film, and hope good things would follow. The greatest honor I've ever had and will ever have was being awarded at Sundance. Thank you, Mr. Redford. Your vision and independent spirit forever changed my life.”

 










Tom Rothman, chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, told IndieWire in a statement, “In addition to being a titanic acting and directing talent, as an early board member of the Sundance Institute, I saw first-hand the Sundance Kid's passionate commitment to indie film and young artists.   Robert Redford truly gave back. The entire scope of American film would have been much poorer without him. An amazing legacy of an amazing man.” 

Other tributes came from Marlee Matlin, who recognized on X the incredible impact that Redford's Sundance Film Festival had on allowing smaller human dramas to flourish. “Our film, CODA, came to the attention of everyone because of Sundance. And Sundance happened because of Robert Redford. A genius has passed. RIP Robert.”

Colman Domingo wrote on X, “With love and admiration. Thank you Mr. Redford for your everlasting impact. Will be felt for generations.”

The best Robert Redford movies are sometimes overlooked compared to the films of his New Hollywood contemporaries. Redford is undoubtedly one of the most influential figures in American film history with his founding of the Sundance Film Festival and the Sundance Institute. But that was simply a second act in what already been a luminous career for nearly two decades as one of Hollywood's finest actors, before adding “director” to his list of titles with “Ordinary People,” for which he won the Best Director Academy Award at the 1981 ceremony.

Because of just how important his Sundance work was for the development of American independent film, his earlier roles are sometimes neglected, but the body of acting work he had put together by the early '80s is towering and expansive. From his straight-man comedic shenanigans in “Barefoot in the Park” to the brooding misanthrope of “Downhill Racer” — Robert Redford unlikable? Yes! — to the Western heroes of “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” and “Jeremiah Johnson” to the overwhelming romanticism of “The Way We Were” and the procedural naturalism of “All the President's Men” (a movie that features the best “phone acting” ever), these are very different roles. All excellent. You could never accuse Redford of repeating himself — down to his staunch resistance to ever making a “Way We Were” sequel.

Robert Redford's best movies and performances show an actor committed to understatement, of serving the character rather than providing a showcase for himself. Redford took the mumbliness out of Brando's naturalism and dialed back the hotter-headed scenery-chewing of some of his New Hollywood contemporaries, in a worthwhile embrace of subtlety that didn't always resonate with the swing-for-the-fences brio that usually nabs Academy Awards. As such, the only Oscar nomination for acting he ever received was for Best Actor in “The Sting,” a film which does wear its movie-movie “Look at this bunch of characters!” personality on its sleeve way more than, say, “Jeremiah Johnson” or “The Candidate.” Let alone his turn as Fitzgerald's doomed hero in “The Great Gatsby,” where his Hollywood image as a kind of cypher lent itself perfectly to a man who's a total fabrication.

That idea of Redford as a cypher was undoubtedly also fueled by his extraordinary, perhaps generational, good looks. By any standard considered one of the handsomest men ever to appear on the big screen, Redford's beauty — has any man ever looked better onscreen than when he's playing catch in the wheatfield at the end of “The Natural”? And he was pushing 50! — was so overwhelming it probably resulted in him being taken less seriously as an actor. Hence, by layering himself with scruff and bearskin in as a mountain man “Jeremiah Johnson” he set the stage for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and other overwhelmingly handsome Hollywood actors to conceal their own beauty at various turns. With looks like Redford's, it may have been hard for many viewers to appreciate his performances beyond projecting their own feelings upon him.

Look beyond the surface, though, and you'll find extraordinary depth in Redford's work. Robert Redford's 15 best movies feature performances that are worth you firing up immediately — pinnacles of their New Hollywood era that have aged extremely well. —CB

Check out IndieWire's list of the 15 best Robert Redford movies below.

With editorial contributions from Kate Erbland, Jim Hemphill, and Sarah Shachat.

Before Redford got his big break on film, he was a stage actor gingerly making the transition to screen via the world of TV anthologies and procedurals. As a young man in the ‘60s, he paid his dues guest starring in shows such as “Alfred Hitchcock Presents,” “Perry Mason,” “Playhouse 90,” and “Maverick.” The best and most enduring of these spots came unsurprisingly in “The Twilight Zone,” the best and most enduring show of the '60s.

It helps that Redford scored a juicy two-hander in his appearance in “Nothing in the Dark,” a parable of an elderly woman (the excellent Gladys Cooper) afraid of death who reluctantly lets a wounded young man into her home. The end-of-episode twist is nowadays easy to see coming, but that doesn't rob the episode of its power, and while Cooper is the highlight, Redford turns in a great, light showing filled with warmth and magnetism. When he beckons for Cooper to take his hand with a flash of a smile at the episode's climax, it's like Redford is daring Hollywood to make him a star. —WC

Four years after starring in the original Broadway production of “Barefoot in the Park,” Redford reprised his role from Neil Simon's romantic comedy on screen, this time opposite Jane Fonda. Despite being one of his earliest major roles, his performance as stuffy, conservative lawyer Paul is wildly different from the debonair, masculine parts he rode to fame on. The film on a whole is also very much stuck in its time period, a dated gender roles study pairing the wimpy Paul with his strong-headed and vivacious bride Corie (Fonda) for a series of bickering fights as they navigate a dysfunctional marriage. But Fonda and Redford are fizzy and fun together, and “Barefoot in the Park” shows that Redford was more than capable of knocking comedy out of the park. —WC

Redford only made two films with Paul Newman over the course of his career. But those films are so iconic, and the men's chemistry so potent, that they're still beloved as one of American cinema's great film duos. There's a meta quality to their first collaboration,  George Roy Hill's “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” which casts them as the real life Wild West outlaws. Already a star, Newman played the older, wearier Cassidy who leads their gang with a light, affable touch, while the breakout Redford played the younger, more hotheaded and dangerous Sundance Kid. 

Surly but also effortlessly badass and sexy, especially when roleplaying a stick-up with his girlfriend Etta (Katherine Ross), Sundance is a subtly difficult, less immediately appealing part than Cassidy, and Redford's terrific work in the role catapulted him to stardom. And the friendship Redford and Newman builds between the two men, which gives the film the tenor of a bickering buddy comedy, is simply undeniable. —WC

In 1969, Robert Redford leveraged his growing celebrity to get Paramount to back his first film as producer, thus beginning one of the great Hollywood careers behind the camera as well as in front of it. Redford's turn as arrogant young skier David Chappellet is the first of his performances to seriously deepen and roughen up his star image, and “Downhill Racer” is the first of many movies Redford would make as a star, producer, and director to interrogate the question of what it means to be successful in America. It's also one of the all-time great sports films, with stunning location work and a documentary style courtesy of director Michael Ritchie, who made his feature debut at Redford's behest after Redford saw some of his television work. Ritchie would go on to make one great movie after another about the dark side of the American competitive spirit (“Smile,” “The Bad News Bears”) — this, along with his subsequent Redford collaboration “The Candidate,” is one of his best.—JH

IndieWire's written elsewhere about how “Jeremiah Johnson” may have the ultimate '70s moment in a '70s movie. And in many ways, Redford's stoic character feels like a '70s antihero transported back to the 1840s Rocky Mountains in the form of a mountain man. But it's also incredibly attuned to the vernacular of that period with the dialogue of Edward Anhalt and John Milius having the perfect kind of almost poetic stiltedness. Redford handles the dialogue with little affect making lines like his naming of his adopted son — “I will call you Caleb. It is a name I have always admired.” — sound like what anyone would say in the course of a conversation.

Yes, he layered himself with scruff and bearskin to the point that internet culture thought a meme of Redford's Jeremiah nodding was Zach Galifianakis. But this is a performance and a film so much richer and worthier of appreciation than could ever be conveyed in a meme. 

After the found-family he's assembled is all massacred, Jeremiah sits among the devastation and a quiet piano melody accompanies a long time-lapse shot of his face over several days as he processes the loss. It's the finest acting of Robert Redford's career, as this absolute tragedy gives way to the slightest smile on his face — the memory of his time with his lost family ultimately outweighing the grievousness of their loss.  —CB

Robert Redford and director Michael Ritchie reunited after “Downhill Racer” for this even more incisive look at competition and moral values, shifting their focus from sports to politics. Working from a script by political speechwriter Jeremy Larner, who won an Oscar for his work here, Redford and Ritchie dive deep into the anthropological details of the American political process in their tale of a nepo baby running for the Senate. Redford is dazzling as the title character, an idealistic and honest young man whose principles slowly but steadily erode over the course of his campaign. Like most of Ritchie's best films, “The Candidate” is a wry meditation on what it really means to win (and lose) in a culture where winning is valued above all else; one of the most memorable moments in all of Redford's work comes at the conclusion, when Redford's character wins his election but loses his soul and blankly asks, “What do we do now?” —JH

Sydney Pollock's bittersweet romance “The Way We Were” features Redford at his most swoon-worthy, as the golden-haired and effortlessly flirty WASP Hubbell Gardiner. It's also, subtly, him at his emptiest, playing a man defined by always taking the easiest and least complicated path in life. That makes him an unlikely interest for Barbra Streisand's Katie Morosky, a Jewish girl with strong Marxist convictions who nonetheless falls for him in their senior year of college. Following their bumpy relationship through seven years, “The Way We Were” always prioritizes Katie's point of view, and Streisand's performance becomes the film's centerpiece. Still, Redford is excellent as well, luring the audience into loving Hubbell just as much as Katie does, before he inevitably lets her and us down. —WC

If Redford's first film with Paul Newman and George Roy Hill, “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” was a bittersweet bromantic tragedy, “The Sting” has the air of friends hanging out and shooting the shit. The Ragtime-soundtracked crime caper about two grifters teaming up to scam an Irish mob boss (Robert Shaw) in Great Depression era Chicago is light on its feet and blissfully entertaining, deriving crowd-pleasing pleasure through sleight of hand tricks as it slowly unfurls the duo's ultimate con.  With other stars in the lead, “The Sting” could have been too insubstantial; with Newman and Redford on board, it won Best Picture. And the two once again are dynamite together, Redford's hotheaded young Johnny Hooker sparring against Newman's washed-up and cynical Henry Gondorff with heat and eventual camaraderie that cements the two as a legendary cinematic pair. As they walk off into the night together at the film's end, it's impossible to feel an ache of regret they never reunited again.—WC

Look, the Jack Clayton 1974 version of “The Great Gatsby” is not a great movie. Arguably, no film adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel is. But Robert Redford's performance of Jay Gatsby, in the moments that it's allowed to breathe, is a genuinely intriguing take on the midwestern romantic dashing himself hopelessly on the rocks of the East Coast society set he wants to belong to. It's also maybe the film that makes the best use of the shyness that sometimes creeps into Redford's work. 

Gatsby is larger-than-life, effortlessly charismatic, but broken in ways that will keep him from seeing how much more he could be without the approval of rich people generally and Daisy Buchanan (Mia Farrow) specifically. In glances and pauses and minute twitches on his face, Redford is able to show us that damage and Gatsby's desperate desire to be whole, all in one. If the camera didn't keep zooming around, it's that kind of sophisticated, instinctive acting that would get us to believe, along with Nick Carroway, that Gatsby is worth the whole damn bunch put together. 

That Redford finds moments of such grace and compassion for the character, while also being asked to literally reach for the Green Light in the same film (there are no good “The Great Gatsby” adaptations!), is more impressive still. —SS

In Sydney Pollack's 1975 political thriller “Three Days of the Condor,” Redford delivered one of the most riveting performances of his career — a fusion of star power, political urgency, and raw vulnerability. As mild-mannered CIA analyst Joe Turner, Redford was cast as a seemingly average man caught in a web of institutional betrayal and moral ambiguity. It's not just his charisma that carries the film; it's his quiet desperation, his obvious disillusionment, and the way he channels real fear into every glance and gesture.

As a mild-mannered CIA reader — literally! his job is to read things — thrust into a horrific, high-stakes cat-and-mouse game, the film allowed Redford to tap into an everyman role (well, sort of, he was still Robert Redford) with bite. But what makes the performance sing was how closely it aligned with Redford's own political sensibilities (and, as one of many projects he made with Pollack, this was clearly no accident). A lifelong advocate for transparency, environmentalism, and government accountability, Redford infused Joe Turner with a genuine skepticism of power that went beyond what we saw on the big screen.

One of the gems of the ‘70s-era sweep of paranoid cinema, Pollack's film gave Redford the ideal vehicle to merge his career instincts with his real-world ideals. The result is a thriller that feels disturbingly relevant today – and a performance that stands as a masterclass in marrying the personal and the political. —KE

A major passion project for Redford, “All the President's Men” came out after the actor read the book of the same name by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, two Washington Post journalists who exposed the Watergate scandal and the corruption of Richard Nixon. Redmond dogged the two reporters hard until he managed to convince them to sell him the rights to the book for $450,000, and then went to work selecting a screenwriter (William Goldman), director (Alan J. Pakula), and costar (Dustin Hoffman) to star opposite himself. The result is perhaps the defining political thriller of the ‘70s and certainly the definitive journalism movie of all time, an account of Bernstein and Woodward's reporting process that's cynical about the world around them but romantic about their dogged pursuit of their work. And Redford and Hoffman are an inspired odd couple as the WASPy Republican Woodward and the liberal Bernstein, bonded together by the same unquenchable thirst for the truth. —WC

“The Natural” may come the closest to Redford's turn in “The Great Gatsby” for him just simply representing Americana. He's in one body the collective vessel for the all the hopes and dreams and promise of this country — and all the corrupt forces that drag it out. But where Gatsby was at least a little corrupt of his own volition, as a bootlegger, Roy Hobbs is a total innocent. Someone who goes out into the world and doesn't see any darkness. Until it finds him.

Redford is pure mythology in “The Natural,” Barry Levinson's movie largely constructed out of Joseph Campbell-style archetypes. And it's easy to see how the projection of star power Redford conveys here harks back to the old studio system. You like Cary Grant in “North by Northwest” because he's playing a version of himself, it's his persona lent for a time to Roger Thornhill. The same goes for Redford — he self-consciously wants you to focus on his surface first and foremost for this film of myths and archetypes. And only as the film goes on, do you see deeper. The pain, the regret, the feeling that he had been a fool. The film's ending, so different from Bernard Malamud's novel of the same name, is an eruption of our greatest dreams coming true and a perfect synchronization of Randy Newman's music, Caleb Deschanel's cinematography, and Redford's performance. Tom Cruise recently talked about how all the greats, like Brando, understood lighting and the other technical aspects of a production. Redford showed that as well as anyone ever in “The Natural.” —CB

When this tale of an American gambler who gets mixed up in the Cuban Revolution of the 1950s was released in December 1990, critics compared it unfavorably to “Casablanca” and it sank at the box office as swiftly as Brian DePalma's contemporaneous flop “The Bonfire of the Vanities.” Yet while the Robert Redford/Lena Olin/Raul Julia love triangle set against a backdrop of political turmoil undoubtedly contains echoes of that classic, the comparison is unfair; Havana is very much its own movie, and it has a historical sophistication and moral complexity – particularly in terms of the Redford character, one of the most idiosyncratic the actor ever played – that allow it to stand on its own. “Havana” marked Redford's seventh collaboration with director Sydney Pollack after “This Property Is Condemned,” “Jeremiah Johnson,” “The Way We Were,” “Three Days of the Condor,” “The Electric Horseman,” and “Out of Africa,” and it's one of the pair's best — Redford plays the dark edge underneath his pretty-boy charm (now no longer as pretty as it was in the earlier films) with more depth and weariness than ever, and Pollack expertly showcases the performance with an expressive visual style that favors long takes and intricate blocking over quick cuts and close-ups. —JH

Redford had a solid end-career run before his de facto retirement in 2018, taking starring or supporting roles in good films like “Pete's Dragon” and “Our Souls At Night.” Easily his strongest twilight years' showcase, however, was “All is Lost,” in which he quite literally is the entire film. No other actor appears in J.C. Chandor's survival drama, which throws the audience immediately into disaster when Redford's unnamed man wakes on his boat to find it's sinking, a storm is coming, and there's no other vessel on the horizon. Redford is given nearly zero dialogue in the ensuing 106 minutes as the man attempts to save himself from certain doom — it's a startling moment when he lets out a deep-throated, despairing “fuck!” That lack of dialogue hardly matters, though: Redford's performance, characterized by weary experience and steely determination, makes this unnamed man a real character beyond the circumstances he's thrown into. It proved that seven decades into his life, Redford's movie star appeal never ran out. —WC

Redford had a couple final appearances after this, in “Avengers: Endgame” and as the voice of a dolphin monster in “Omniboat,” but for all intents and purposes “The Old Man & the Gun” is his swan song. The kind of movie designed literally to be his last movie in a way we may not have seen since John Wayne in “The Shootist.” It's an exceptionally sad movie, about a man so addicted to robbing banks just for the fun of it that he shuns a real chance at human connection with a character played by Sissy Spacek. Or maybe that's not the way we're supposed to view it. Maybe he's true to himself this way

Regardless, for a swan song, this is no cuddly victory lap or occasion to wallow in nostalgia — though a flashback clip of him from Arthur Penn's “The Chase,” at Redford's peak beauty in 1966, elicited gasps from audiences when it appeared, such was his movie star radiance — but an unsentimental portrait of a mercurial and even offputting individual. Those who thought “The Natural” was too much a celebration of wish-fulfillment would love this. —CB

	In today's WTF category: LimeWire has acquired the Fyre Festival brand. The file-sharing company, which relaunched in 2022, had won a competitive bidding war for the brand behind one of the most infamous festivals of all time.


	According to a release, LimeWire and Fyre will begin a new chapter “grounded in technology, transparency and a sense of humor.” LimeWire also makes clear they want to preserve its past while taking the brand into the future.


	“Fyre became a symbol of hype gone wrong, but it also made history,” LimeWire CEO Julian Zehetmayr said in a statement. “We're not bringing the festival back — we're bringing the brand and the meme back to life. This time with real experiences, and without the cheese sandwiches.”


	According to Fast Company, Ryan Reynolds‘ creative agency Maximum Effort had also bid on the Fyre Festival brand. Reynolds and Maximum Effort have had a longstanding fascination with the failed festival, referencing Netflix's Fyre documentary memes in a 2019 ad for his brand Aviation Gin. Zehetmayr revealed that Maximum Effort got in touch after LimeWire outbid the agency and the two entities have since collaborated on a new Visa ad that Reynolds narrates, which reimagines Fyre's slogan “It's everywhere you want to be.”

	











	“Congrats to LimeWire for their winning bid for Fyre Fest,” Reynolds said in a statement. “I look forward to attending their first event but will be bringing my own palette of water.”

	LimeWire has yet to reveal further plans for Fyre Festival, though the release on the acquisition promises one that “expands beyond the digital realm and taps into real-world experience.” There is a wait-list open at the Fyre Festival website for early access and exclusive updates.

	











	“We're not here to repeat the mistakes — we're here to own the meme and do it right,” LimeWire COO Marcus Feistl said in a statement. “Fyre became a symbol of everything that can go wrong. Now it's our chance to show what happens when you pair cultural relevance with real execution.”

Amanda Seyfried‘s happy home is haunted in the first official trailer for The Housemaid. In theaters Dec. 19, the Paul Feig-directed psychological thriller brings Seyfried's character Nina together with Sydney Sweeney‘s Millie under circumstances that are far more sinister than they initially appear. Based on the novel by Freida McFadden, The Housemaid follows Millie as she's hired by Nina to serve as a live-in housemaid. 


	This works out great for Millie, who needs somewhere to live, and also for Nina, who needs someone to handle cleaning, organizing, some light cooking, and maybe commit a crime for her. As the trailer shows, overlayed with a haunting rendition of Sabrina Carpenter's “Please Please Please,” the household Nina has built with her husband, Andrew, and their daughter is only picture-perfect in the beginning. What happens behind closed doors — locked doors, spilled secrets, and power struggles — shatters their perfect family illusion, but Millie's closet isn't devoid of skeletons, either. 

	











The Housemaid also stars Brandon Sklenar, Michele Morrone, and Elizabeth Perkins. The release will mark Sweeney's latest film following Christy and Echo Valley, both of which arrived earlier this year. Seyfried recently appeared in The Testament of Ann Lee, which premiered at the Venice International Film Festival on Sept. 1.

Rolling Stone named The Housemaid one of the 50 most anticipated films of fall 2025. “Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried star in an adaptation of Frieda McFadden's 2022 novel about a troubled young woman who, desperate for a steady paycheck, takes a job working as a maid for a wealthy woman and her family in Westchester, New York,” David Fear wrote. “Everything seems peachy, until the newest addition to the household begins to suspect that every happy smile hides a number of rather dark secrets. Paul Feig directs this thriller — and we're assuming we're getting more of the Feig who made A Simple Favor rather than the Feig who gave us, say, Spy and Bridesmaids.”

Within hours of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, edited videos began to spread online. Some focused on the moment Kirk was shot — zooming in on the obviously fatal wound to make the strange claim that he hadn't been killed at all: that the video was a fake, generated by computer, or that a squeeze of his right arm was proof he had popped a capsule to make it appear as if blood was pouring from his neck. 

In videos that each racked up hundreds of thousands of views, one Illinois creator pointed to photos of the Turning Point USA founder making an “OK” sign with his hands: these symbols, they said, proved Kirk had not only had faked his death, but that it also  actually revealed his alignment with a demonic cabal that secretly controlled the world. 

Kirk is, of course, senselessly and indisputably dead. That fact alone was enough to shatter reality, even for people outside the gravitational pull of internet conspiracy culture. 

Kirk is, of course, senselessly and indisputably dead. That fact alone was enough to shatter reality.

At 31, Kirk was arguably the most popular and influential figure in right-wing politics outside of Trump — for whom he acted as a strategist, the guy who brought young people into the MAGA movement and helped win Arizona. To the religious right, he was a hero. To many on the left, an avatar of racism, transphobia and misogyny. And to tens of thousands of young people, especially men, who packed his rallies and the millions more who watched his clips online, Kirk was someone who could talk to anyone, win any argument and offered a vision of life filled with purpose and power. He connected MAHA and MAGA and sealed Trump's selection of JD Vance for vice president. Kirk was, as his podcast intro declared, “the voice of a generation” and, many believed, a future president.

And then he was gone. Not just gone but stolen, executed on livestream in an act so violent, so graphic, that the only other event that comes close to its trauma in memory was President John F. Kennedy's assassination — viewed by most in grainy footage that doesn't approach the detailed horror of Kirk's recorded murder, seen almost instantaneously by millions. 

According to the most current information from law enforcement, the shooting appears to be the work of a single suspect: 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, a bright electrician-in-training who was taken into custody 33 hours after the shooting and was formally charged in Utah on Tuesday. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Robinson was motivated by and “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology,” citing statements from family members and messages sent to friends.

Yet, almost immediately after Kirk was shot, a wave of conspiracy theories from both the right and the left rushed in to cloud that reality — to deny it outright or to twist it into something politically useful. This kind of conspiracy theorizing was inevitable — what researchers call collective sensemaking as we try to understand what we've just experienced. It's a process that happens in two parts: the assembling of evidence and the framing. 

These theories drew on hundreds of photos and videos captured by rallygoers, organizers, federal law enforcement and news outlets. Users dissected the videos, marking them with red circles and arrows. In one video, a man adjusting his hat was labeled a conspirator signaling a hitman. In others, Kirk was said to have been shot not from above but from behind, with the assassin identified alternately as a man tugging his sleeve or a fuzzy figure in white.

Conspiracy theories live on a spectrum of possibility and politics. Some built around the Kirk assassination are far-flung ones, pushed by flat-earthers and false-flag obsessives. Others, more mainstream, have without strong evidence pointed blame at Israel, farther-right antisemitic activists, imaginary underground progressive terrorist organizations and Donald Trump himself. Some were likely motivated by belief, but others perhaps by a desire for internet attention, for entertainment or for political purposes yet to be seen. 

“Charlie Kirk's assassination was not just some kid,” former Trump adviser Steve Bannon told his War Room listeners Monday, inviting them to watch surveillance video of the alleged shooter descending a roof, footage that has been held up as evidence by some MAGA influencers that Kash Patel's FBI is hiding something. 

“It seems like we're being spoon-fed a narrative, and this audience is not going to take it, and we're not going to allow the martyr Charlie Kirk to have a situation like a grassy knoll that decades and decades and decades later, we're still arguing about this. We've got to get to the bottom of it.”

It is fitting, maybe, that so many conspiracy theories have engulfed Kirk upon his death. In life, Kirk entertained conspiracy theories, trafficked in them and benefited from their unchecked spread. Over the years on his podcast, Kirk leaned into conspiracy theories including the “great reset” (a globalist plot to control the world) and the “great replacement” (a Democratic plot to erase the white race). On his podcast where he fashioned himself as a Christian Rush Limbaugh, Kirk spread claims that Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were “taking people's pets and eating them,” that American men had been purposefully “feminized,” that the media was hiding something about the attack on Paul Pelosi, and that President Joe Biden had intentionally ignored weather disasters so they could be used to promote policies that addressed climate change. Kirk pushed debunked theories that a nebulous group of government “theys” conspired to steal elections, set up peaceful patriots to attack the Capitol on Jan. 6 and forced deadly vaccines on unwitting Americans. 

At the same time, Kirk surrounded himself with conspiracy theorists — a growing influence of power within the conservative establishment.

At the same time, Kirk surrounded himself with conspiracy theorists — a growing influence of power within the conservative establishment — including President Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Candace Owens and radio host Alex Jones, to name a few. 

Jones and Owens now count among the conspiracy creators focused on Kirk's death. 

“Who called the hit on Charlie?” Owens posted on X the day after the shooting. 

Owens, his longtime friend and former employee, has spent the last several days publicly grieving while posting about “some very powerful billionaires” that she said Kirk was facing pressure from over his wavering support for Israel. In her online show Monday, she also suggested something nefarious about the FBI's handling of the crime. 

“If they had wanted to catch Charlie's killer, they would have immediately publicized all pictures and videos and the internet would have solved it in minutes,” Owens posted. “The desire was never there.”

As is his custom, Jones immediately leapt on Kirk's death. But this time, he didn't theorize, as he had with children murdered in their elementary school, that Kirk's death was a production of the government to rip away gun rights. Instead, he claimed this was an execution overseen and commanded by “a trans death cult.” (The suspect was in a romantic relationship with a roommate who is transgender and who is cooperating with authorities, Gov. Cox said last week. Officials have not yet suggested that Robinson was motivated by trans issues.)

“The Soros strike force has been activated,” Jones posted Monday, referring to the liberal billionaire donor.

The framing of Kirk's death, as staged or part of a larger plot, may not hold. But a more insidious narrative — one less easily debunked or written over with facts learned during a criminal case against Robinson — is already being amplified by the Trump administration. Fueled by raw emotion and few facts, this frame is shaping into something likely to be more durable and destructive. 

On a special episode of The Charlie Kirk Podcast, broadcast Monday from a wood-paneled office in the White House complex, the administration's most senior officials joined guest host Vice President JD Vance to eulogize Kirk. Flanked by American and vice presidential flags, deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller sipped tea and pointed to a shadowy alliance of progressive organizations, funders and activists who, he claimed, are ultimately responsible for Kirk's killing. He cited this narrative as justification to unleash the power of the federal government upon its contrived threats so that, as Vance said, something like Kirk's assassination would never happen again.

“With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again,” Miller said, defining the unnamed networks as “the organized doxxing campaigns, the organized riots, the organized street violence, the organized campaigns of dehumanization, vilification, posting people's addresses, combining that with messaging designed to trigger, incite violence and the actual organized cells that carry out and facilitate the violence.”

This narrative is the ultimate conspiracy theory. That its enemy is so fundamentally undefined is the source of its power. The characters in this story are so broad that it can be weaponized against any and every perceived political enemy. It already has been. 

The day after Kirk was shot, anonymous self-described political operatives registered a website, “CharliesMurderers.com” which crowdsourced screenshots and identifying details to accuse people of celebrating his murder. People featured on the site — whose remarks were often misrepresented — have reported receiving death threats and being fired from their jobs. The anonymous organizers, who solicit donations, claim to have more than 60,000 submissions and plan to publish soon. Meanwhile, Cabinet secretaries and the heads of federal departments have been tasked with identifying organizations they claim fund and incite left-wing violence, according to The New York Times. Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed Monday, without evidence, that “left-wing radicals” killed Kirk, and that “they” would be held to account. 

It's a tactic I imagine Kirk would have approved of. It was Kirk who built the professor “watchlist,” intended to expose alleged leftist bias but which ultimately led to doxxing and death threats for hundreds of academics. It was Kirk who argued that the only way to heal the country's political divisions was for conservatives to “win.” Kirk was the kind of strategist who understood when to lean into a grand conspiracy theory for the greater MAGA good.

Kirk helped cultivate a modern conservative worldview that declared itself at war with the left. In death, he has become the main character in its central conspiracy theory.

Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, joins 'America Reports' to discuss a DOJ memo claiming FBI agents who 'followed orders' on Jan 6 investigations won't be fired. 

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, revealed Tuesday that the FBI's election-related investigation into President Donald Trump, launched in 2022, swept in dozens of Republican entities, including the late Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA.

Speaking during a hearing focused on oversight of the FBI, Grassley said the investigation, which the bureau called ""Arctic Frost,"" was partisan in nature and that its expansive scope was evidence of that.

""In other words, Arctic Frost wasn't just a case to politically investigate Trump,"" Grassley said. ""It was a vehicle by which partisan FBI agents and Department of Justice prosecutors could achieve their partisan ends and improperly investigate the entire Republican political apparatus.""

Since January, Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., have been publishing records related to Arctic Frost, the investigation launched during FBI Director Chris Wray's tenure that served as the basis for former special counsel Jack Smith to bring criminal charges against Trump related to the 2020 election.

Grassley unveiled a new set of documents during his opening statement on Tuesday that showed numerous Republican-affiliated organizations and people were targeted with subpoenas during Arctic Frost.

Some targets on the list were well known, such as Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, who spread unproven allegations that widespread election fraud occurred during the 2020 election. But the basis for targeting other groups, like Kirk's group and the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), was less clear.

""For years, the deep state, unelected Biden bureaucrats — including the FBI — used lawfare to target Republican AGs and many other close friends because we were allies of Donald Trump,"" RAGA Executive Director Adam Piper said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""The Biden Administration bastardized the rule of law, gave license to lawless liberals, and did everything possible to kneecap any and all opposition. Republican AGs will work to hold these bad actors accountable and help President Trump restore objectivity to our federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.""

Kirk was assassinated last week while speaking during an event at Utah Valley University. He was a prolific conservative activist and his massive organization remains a part of his legacy. Turning Point USA recruited conservative college students and was heavily involved in promoting election turnout. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, Kirk amplified some of Trump's claims about election fraud.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and Department of Justice leaders have said the suspect in Kirk's shooting, Tyler Robinson, was driven by leftist ideology but that the investigation remains in an early stage. Authorities said antifascist messaging found on bullet casings, Discord messages and other messages have helped to develop an understanding of Robinson's motive as the investigation continues.

Utah prosecutors charged Tyler Robinson on Tuesday with aggravated murder in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said that he intends to seek the death penalty in the case against Robinson, who was also charged with felony discharge of a firearm, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and several other counts.

""I do not take this decision lightly, and it is a decision I have made independently as county attorney based solely on the available evidence and circumstances and nature of the crime,"" Gray said at a press conference.

Robinson, a Washington, Utah, resident, is scheduled to appear virtually for his initial court appearance at 5 p.m. ET. He has been held in jail without bail since his arrest on Friday morning.

Gray said Robinson, 22, was identified as a suspect in part because his family recognized him in surveillance images released after Kirk, a married father of two, was killed last Wednesday during a crowded speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem.

""Robinson's mother expressed concern to her husband that the suspect shooter looked like Robinson,"" and Robinson's father agreed, Gray said.

Robinson's mother also told investigators that ""over the last year or so, her son had become more political and had started to lean more to the left, becoming more pro gay and trans-rights oriented,"" Gray said.

Robinson's mother also told police that he ""began to date his roommate, a biological male who was transitioning genders,"" the prosecutor said.

Gray also described a wide array of evidence that he said tied Robinson to Kirk's shooting, including text messages between the suspect and his roommate and DNA that was allegedly matched to Robinson. 

Several of the messages, which were detailed in charging documents shared with CNBC later Tuesday, contained romantic sentiments. 

The roommate told police that, on the day of the shooting, Robinson texted, ""Drop what you're doing. Look under my keyboard,"" the documents alleged.

The roommate looked and found a note stating, ""I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it.""

After reading the note, the roommate texted Robinson, ""What?????????????? You're joking, right????""

Robinson replied that, ""To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you.""

The roommate asked, ""you weren't the one who did it right????""

Robinson wrote back, ""I am, I'm sorry.""

When the roommate asked why Robinson did it, he replied, ""I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out.""

CNBC has not independently verified the content of messages.

Gray was uncertain whether Robinson had retained a defense lawyer.

Kirk's death has gripped the nation and generated highly charged reactions.

Many of Kirk's friends and political allies have felt intense grief, and politicians across the aisle have issued forceful condemnations of political violence.

But some, including President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, have blamed the ""radical left"" for the killing and signaled plans to crack down on groups aligned with that ideology.

Others on the left who criticized Kirk's right-wing politics while he was alive have continued to do so following his murder, drawing outrage from the activist's supporters.

For years, Big Tech CEOs have touted visions of AI agents that can autonomously use software applications to complete tasks for people. But take today's consumer AI agents out for a spin, whether it's OpenAI's ChatGPT Agent or Perplexity's Comet, and you'll quickly realize how limited the technology still is. Making AI agents more robust may take a new set of techniques that the industry is still discovering.

One of those techniques is carefully simulating workspaces where agents can be trained on multi-step tasks — known as reinforcement learning (RL) environments. Similarly to how labeled datasets powered the last wave of AI, RL environments are starting to look like a critical element in the development of agents.

AI researchers, founders, and investors tell TechCrunch that leading AI labs are now demanding more RL environments, and there's no shortage of startups hoping to supply them.

“All the big AI labs are building RL environments in-house,” said Jennifer Li, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, in an interview with TechCrunch. “But as you can imagine, creating these datasets is very complex, so AI labs are also looking at third party vendors that can create high quality environments and evaluations. Everyone is looking at this space.”

The push for RL environments has minted a new class of well-funded startups, such as Mechanize Work and Prime Intellect, that aim to lead the space. Meanwhile, large data-labeling companies like Mercor and Surge say they're investing more in RL environments to keep pace with the industry's shifts from static datasets to interactive simulations. The major labs are considering investing heavily too: according to The Information, leaders at Anthropic have discussed spending more than $1 billion on RL environments over the next year.

The hope for investors and founders is that one of these startups emerge as the “Scale AI for environments,” referring to the $29 billion data labelling powerhouse that powered the chatbot era.

The question is whether RL environments will truly push the frontier of AI progress.

At their core, RL environments are training grounds that simulate what an AI agent would be doing in a real software application. One founder described building them in recent interview “like creating a very boring video game.”

For example, an environment could simulate a Chrome browser and task an AI agent with purchasing a pair of socks on Amazon. The agent is graded on its performance and sent a reward signal when it succeeds (in this case, buying a worthy pair of socks).

While such a task sounds relatively simple, there are a lot of places where an AI agent could get tripped up. It might get lost navigating the web page's drop down menus, or buy too many socks. And because developers can't predict exactly what wrong turn an agent will take, the environment itself has to be robust enough to capture any unexpected behavior, and still deliver useful feedback. That makes building environments far more complex than a static dataset.

Some environments are quite elaborate, allowing for AI agents to use tools, access the internet, or use various software applications to complete a given task. Others are more narrow, aimed at helping an agent learn specific tasks in enterprise software applications.

While RL environments are the hot thing in Silicon Valley right now, there's a lot of precedent for using this technique. One of OpenAI's first projects back in 2016 was building “RL Gyms,” which were quite similar to the modern conception of environments. The same year, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo AI system beat a world champion at the board game, Go. It also used RL techniques within a simulated environment.

What's unique about today's environments is that researchers are trying to build computer-using AI agents with large transformer models. Unlike AlphaGo, which was a specialized AI system working in a closed environments, today's AI agents are trained to have more general capabilities. AI researchers today have a stronger starting point, but also a complicated goal where more can go wrong. 

AI data labeling companies like Scale AI, Surge, and Mercor are trying to meet the moment and build out RL environments. These companies have more resources than many startups in the space, as well as deep relationships with AI labs. 

Surge CEO Edwin Chen tells TechCrunch he's recently seen a “significant increase” in demand for RL environments within AI labs. Surge — which reportedly generated $1.2 billion in revenue last year from working with AI labs like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Meta — recently spun up a new internal organization specifically tasked with building out RL environments, he said.

Close behind Surge is Mercor, a startup valued at $10 billion, which has also worked with OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic. Mercor is pitching investors on its business building RL environments for domain specific tasks such as coding, healthcare, and law, according to marketing materials seen by TechCrunch.

Mercor CEO Brendan Foody told TechCrunch in an interview that “few understand how large the opportunity around RL environments truly is.”

Scale AI used to dominate the data labeling space, but has lost ground since Meta invested $14 billion and hired away its CEO. Since then, Google and OpenAI dropped Scale AI as a data provider, and the startup even faces competition for data labelling work inside of Meta. But still, Scale is trying to meet the moment and build environments.

“This is just the nature of the business [Scale AI] is in,” said Chetan Rane, Scale AI's head of product for agents and RL environments. “Scale has proven its ability to adapt quickly. We did this in the early days of autonomous vehicles, our first business unit. When ChatGPT came out, Scale AI adapted to that. And now, once again, we're adapting to new frontier spaces like agents and environments.”

Some newer players are focusing exclusively on environments from the outset. Among them is Mechanize Work, a startup founded roughly six months ago with the audacious goal of “automating all jobs.” However, co-founder Matthew Barnett tells TechCrunch that his firm is starting with RL environments for AI coding agents.

Mechanize Work aims to supply AI labs with a small number of robust RL environments, Barnett says, rather than larger data firms that create a wide range of simple RL environments. To this point, the startup is offering software engineers $500,000 salaries to build RL environments — far higher than an hourly contractor could earn working at Scale AI or Surge.

Mechanize Work has already been working with Anthropic on RL environments, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Mechanize Work and Anthropic declined to comment on the partnership.

Other startups are betting that RL environments will be influential outside of AI labs. Prime Intellect — a startup backed by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy, Founders Fund, and Menlo Ventures — is targeting smaller developers with its RL environments.

Last month, Prime Intellect launched an RL environments hub, which aims to be a “Hugging Face for RL environments.” The idea is to give open-source developers access to the same resources that large AI labs have, and sell those developers access to computational resources in the process.

Training generally capable agents in RL environments can be more computational expensive than previous AI training techniques, according to Prime Intellect researcher Will Brown. Alongside startups building RL environments, there's another opportunity for GPU providers that can power the process.

“RL environments are going to be too large for any one company to dominate,” said Brown in an interview. “Part of what we're doing is just trying to build good open-source infrastructure around it. The service we sell is compute, so it is a convenient onramp to using GPUs, but we're thinking of this more in the long term.”

The open question around RL environments is whether the technique will scale like previous AI training methods.

Reinforcement learning has powered some of the biggest leaps in AI over the past year, including models like OpenAI's o1 and Anthropic's Claude Opus 4. Those are particularly important breakthroughs because the methods previously used to improve AI models are now showing diminishing returns. 

Environments are part of AI labs' bigger bet on RL, which many believe will continue to drive progress as they add more data and computational resources to the process. Some of the OpenAI researchers behind o1 previously told TechCrunch that the company originally invested in AI reasoning models — which were created through investments in RL and test-time-compute — because they thought it would scale nicely.

The best way to scale RL remains unclear, but environments seem like a promising contender. Instead of simply rewarding chatbots for text responses, they let agents operate in simulations with tools and computers at their disposal. That's far more resource-intensive, but potentially more rewarding. 

Some are skeptical that all these RL environments will pan out. Ross Taylor, a former AI research lead with Meta that co-founded General Reasoning, tells TechCrunch that RL environments are prone to reward hacking. This is a process in which AI models cheat in order to get a reward, without really doing the task.

“I think people are underestimating how difficult it is to scale environments,” said Taylor. “Even the best publicly available [RL environments] typically don't work without serious modification.”

OpenAI's Head of Engineering for its API business, Sherwin Wu, said in a recent podcast that he was “short” on RL environment startups. Wu noted that it's a very competitive space, but also that AI research is evolving so quickly that it's hard to serve AI labs well.

Karpathy, an investor in Prime Intellect that has called RL environments a potential breakthrough, has also voiced caution for the RL space more broadly. In a post on X, he raised concerns about how much more AI progress can be squeezed out of RL.

“I am bullish on environments and agentic interactions but I am bearish on reinforcement learning specifically,” said Karpathy.

In children younger than 2 years undergoing surgery under general anesthesia, the addition of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil to sevoflurane did not alter the short-term neurodevelopmental outcomes compared with inhaled sevoflurane alone, although it reduced the requirement of sevoflurane.

The findings “support existing evidence suggesting that brief anesthetic exposure is unlikely to result in clinically significant neurodevelopmental impairment,"" the researchers reported. “Although the combination of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil effectively reduced sevoflurane requirements during surgery, it provided no measurable neuroprotective advantages,” they added.

This study was led by Sang-Hwan Ji, MD, PhD, of Seoul National University Hospital in South Korea. It was published online on September 9, 2025, in Anesthesiology.

Children who needed additional anesthesia during follow-up were not included, potentially introducing selection bias. Only one tool was used to assess intelligence at baseline. This study lacked comparison with a group of children who were not anesthetized.

This study received support from the National Research Foundation of Korea. The authors declared having no competing interests.

The combination of tarlatamab and standard anti-PD-L1 therapy as first-line maintenance therapy led to “unprecedented” survival gains among patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in the phase 1b DeLLphi-303 trial.

Patients receiving the combination had a median overall survival of more than 2 years than the historic benchmark of about 1 year, reported lead investigator Kelly Paulson, MD, PhD, Providence Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, in a presentation at the World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) 2025.

The survival data are “truly exciting,” Paulson told attendees, noting that the combination therapy's safety profile was manageable.

Study discussant Charles Rudin, MD, PhD, thoracic medical oncologist and deputy director, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, agreed that the survival benefit was impressive. “We have not seen that before ever in our patients,” he said. “I know I'm supposed to be critical, but, you know, it's a wow.”

Rudin cautioned, however, that the finding should also be seen in context: “Patients had to get through chemoimmunotherapy induction, still be alive, still be in response, or at least [have] stable disease, to be able to be enrolled in this trial,” he pointed out.

The results were simultaneously published in The Lancet Oncology.

ES-SCLC is an aggressive cancer with poor long-term prognosis. Most patients respond to first-line chemoimmunotherapy, followed by a PD-L1 inhibitor in the maintenance setting. However, relapse often occurs quickly, with trials reporting a median progression-free survival of about 5 months and a median overall survival of 1 year.

Tarlatamab is a bispecific T-cell engager immunotherapy that directs cytotoxic T cells to cancer cells expressing delta-like ligand 3. Previous studies have shown that tarlatamab as second-line treatment for patients with SCLC improves overall survival and has a better safety profile vs standard chemotherapy. Last year, the FDA granted accelerated approval to tarlatamab for the treatment of patients with ES-SCLC who progress on chemotherapy.

The phase 1b DeLLphi-303 trial tested the safety and efficacy of tarlatamab in the first-line maintenance setting in combination with a PD-L1 inhibitor (atezolizumab or durvalumab). The trial enrolled 88 patients with ES-SCLC who had completed four to six cycles of first-line platinum-etoposide chemotherapy and anti-PD-L1 therapy without disease progression.

Maintenance treatment — initiated within 8 weeks from the start of the last chemoimmunotherapy cycle and continued until disease progression — was intravenous atezolizumab (1680 mg every 4 weeks) or intravenous durvalumab (1500 mg every 4 weeks) plus intravenous tarlatamab (10 mg every 2 weeks). The median exposure to tarlatamab was 35 weeks (range, 0.1-119).

At a median follow-up from the start of maintenance of 18.4 months, the median overall survival was 25.3 months (95% CI, 20.3 to not estimable), with a median progression-free survival of 5.6 months (95% CI, 3.5-9.0). Both outcomes were similar whether patients received atezolizumab or durvalumab.

Overall, 21 patients (24%) had an objective response to maintenance therapy, as measured from a baseline scan after completion of chemoimmunotherapy. That included 19 patients with a partial response and two with a complete response; their median duration of response was 16.6 months.

Notably, said Paulson, the disease control rate was 60%, with 36% of patients having sustained disease control of at least 1 year.

The combination therapy's safety profile of tarlatamab was consistent with that observed with tarlatamab monotherapy, according to Paulson — with no dose-limiting toxicity or treatment-related deaths and a low incidence of discontinuation (6%).

Cytokine-release syndrome was the most common treatment-related adverse event (56%), with most being grade 1 (43%) or grade 2 (11%); all events resolved with supportive care. Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in 6% of patients, with a median onset of 9 days after the first tarlatamab dose; again, all those events were resolved with supportive care.

Other treatment-related adverse events included dysgeusia (53%), fatigue (38%), and pyrexia (25%).

If these findings are confirmed in the ongoing randomized phase 3 DeLLphi-305 study, Paulson said, the tarlatamab/anti-PD-L1 combination could establish a new standard for first-line maintenance therapy in ES-SCLC.

The study was funded by Amgen Inc. Paulson reported receiving research funding to her institution from Amgen Inc., BMS, Merck, Iovance Biotherapeutics, and Immunocore; and consulting fees from BMS. Rudin did not provide disclosure information.

Tyler Robinson, the alleged killer of right-wing organizer and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, has been charged with seven counts, including aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, and obstruction of justice. Utah County Attorney Attorney Jeff Gray said in announcing the charges that prosecutors would seek the death penalty.


	“The murder of Charlie Kirk is an American tragedy,” Gray said on Tuesday. “Charlie Kirk was murdered while engaging in one of our most sacred and cherished American rights.”


	“I'm filing notice of intent to seek the death penalty,” Gray added. “I do not make this decision lightly, and it's one I've made as county attorney based solely on evidence and circumstances of the crime.”


	Robinson is expected to appear virtually in court for the first time later on Tuesday.


	Robinson, 22, is suspected of shooting and killing Kirk last week during an event at Utah Valley University. Robinson was arrested after a two-day manhunt during which the FBI interrogated and released at least two other persons of interest in the shooting. Robinson was ultimately turned into authorities by his family, who recognized him from photos released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Gray said Tuesday that he initially denied he was the person in the pictures when confronted by his mother, before he ultimately turned himself in along with his parents and a family friend.

	











	Gray said Tuesday that Robinson's mother told investigators that Robinson had become “more political and had started to lean more to the left, becoming more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented,” as Gray put it. “She stated that Robinson began to date his roommate, a biological male who was transitioning genders,” Gray said, adding that the roommate told police that Robinson messaged them about the shooting, and that the roommate turned over the messages to authorities.

	











	Gray said that on Sept. 10, Robinson messaged the roommate telling them to look under his keyboard. The roommate found a note under the keyboard that read: “I have the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it.” The roommate asked Robinson if he was joking, and Robinson eventually said that he wasn't and that he was the one who killed Kirk. When the roommate asked Robinson why he did it, Robinson replied, “I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out. If I am able to grab my rifle unseen, I will have left no evidence.”

	According to Governor Spencer Cox (R-Utah), investigators recovered a “high-powered bolt-action rifle” they believe was used in the shooting, as well as bullets with various inscriptions appearing to reference video games and online memes.

	“Inscriptions on a fired casing read ‘notices, bulges, OWO, what's this, question mark.' Inscriptions on the unfired casings read, ‘Hey fascist!

A second unfired casing read, ‘O, bella ciao, bella ciao, bella biao, ciao, ciao,' and a third unfired casing read, ‘If you read this, you are gay, LMAO,'” Cox reported. 


	On Monday, the FBI said that they had further linked Robinson to the assassination via a positive DNA match to a towel found wrapped around the rifle allegedly used in the shooting, and a screwdriver near the snipers nest. FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News on Monday that Robinson had said he was going to kill Kirk in a text message, and a “destroyed” note that the bureau was able to reconstruct, but has not been made public.
