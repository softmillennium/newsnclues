                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A man who was detained moments after Turning Point USA executive director Charlie Kirk's killing has been arrested on allegations of trying to thwart authorities by falsely confessing to the fatal shooting. After being arrested on Monday, 71-year-old George Zinn faces a count of obstructing justice – a second-degree felony – in the wake of Kirk's killing at Utah Valley University (UVU). Documents filed in Zinn's case by UVU campus police allege that he began screaming, “I shot him – now shoot me,” in the immediate aftermath of Kirk's killing at Utah Valley University (UVU) on 10 September. Video of officers holding Zinn down was widely circulated online, leading some to believe that authorities had quickly arrested a suspect in the killing of the conservative political activist. Then, when asked by an officer where the gun used to kill Kirk was, Zinn allegedly replied: “I am not going to tell you.” Police contend that Zinn subsequently admitted that he was not the shooter and did not know who was – and he purportedly claimed that he had acted how he did to draw attention away from the real killer in hopes of becoming “a martyr” for Kirk. He allegedly was reluctant to let investigators look at his phone, saying he used the device “to look at child sexual abuse material”, local sheriff's deputies wrote in a separate report, as the Utah news outlet KSL noted. A search of Zinn's phone allegedly confirmed there were more than 20 images depicting child sexual abuse, including of minors believed to be between 5 and 12 years old – as well as explicit messages sharing the imagery with others, investigators said. Police announced the arrest of Kirk's actual suspected killer on Friday after a two-day manhunt. The deadly 2013 Boston marathon bombing that killed three people and injured hundreds of others had been days earlier. Citing information from a district attorney whose office had previously prosecuted him, the Salt Lake Tribune reported that Zinn was “politically conservative, leaning libertarian”. On Monday, a judge ordered Zinn be held without bail, according to online court records.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Josh Shapiro on Tuesday ripped President Donald Trump as having failed both a “leadership test” and a “morality test” after Charlie Kirk's assassination. “It should not be hard to stand up to some people who are celebrating the killing of Charlie Kirk and say, ‘That's wrong,' and it should not be hard to stand up to people who are calling for vengeance and revenge in the wake of the killing of Charlie Kirk and say, ‘That's not OK either.' Shapiro, a contender to be Kamala Harris' running mate last year and a potential 2028 presidential candidate, criticized Trump for repeatedly blaming violence on the “radical left” without noting acts of violence committed by right-wing actors. There are some who will hear that selective condemnation and take it as a permission to commit more violence, so long as it suits their narrative or only targets the other side.” Shapiro appeared at a gathering of the group Eradicate Hate, which fights antisemitism, days after Kirk's assassination and five months after an assailant set fire to the Pennsylvania governor's mansion hours after Shapiro and extended family celebrated a Passover seder there. I can attest to that — especially as a father: a father of four children, knowing that my life choices put them at risk,” Shapiro said. Shapiro linked that night to instances of political violence including Kirk's death, the assassination attempt on Trump last year in Pennsylvania, the killing of a health care CEO in Manhattan, and the slayings of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband in June. About political violence, Shapiro said, “not only does it seek to injure, maim or kill — it seeks to intimidate and terrorize and silence,” adding, “This type of violence has no place in our society, regardless of what motivates it or who pulls the trigger, who throws the Molotov cocktail or who wields the weapon.” That thought was shared by Tom Corbett, a former Republican governor of Pennsylvania who introduced Shapiro. “Preventing hate-fueled violence is not a partisan issue. It is one that requires all of us, around this country and around this world, to come together,” he said. People may not agree on politics or have similar lives, Shapiro said, but what has been lost for too many is their ability to find their common ground. In that, Shapiro invoked a lesson from western Pennsylvania native Fred Rogers, better known as the famous children's broadcaster Mister Rogers: Look for the helpers. “I believe that we are stronger than hate,” Shapiro said. “But I also believe in America that this work doesn't fall to others. It falls to each and every one of us.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luigi Mangione scored a major legal victory on Tuesday with a judge dismissing the two top state charges against him: first-degree murder and second-degree murder, both of which prosecutors had argued were terrorism crimes. Mangione still faces an additional second-degree murder charge, as well as a federal murder charge, in the killing of United HealthCare executive Brian Thompson last December. Mangione also faces federal charges for allegedly gunning down Thompson outside a hotel, and weapons possession counts. Mangione's defense had also argued his case should be dismissed for double jeopardy – being prosecuted twice for the same crime – because he was charged with murder in both state and federal court, but the judge rejected that. Carro also rejected the defense's bid to put Mangione's state case on hold so that he could face his federal trial first. Mangione entered the Manhattan courtroom just before 9.30am, wearing khaki jail scrubs, with handcuffed wrists and shackled ankles. His appearance came six days after the rightwing commentator Charlie Kirk was shot dead during an event at Utah Valley University. The shootings of Thompson and Kirk have prompted highly politicized rhetoric. The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, called Thompson's killing “a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America”. Bondi said her decision was in step with “Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and make America safe again”. The killing sparked a contentious public debate about US healthcare that crossed the political aisle, with some praising Mangione and denouncing healthcare companies and many others outraged that a murder would be used to air political grievances. On Tuesday outside the 100 Centre Street courtroom, as with his prior court appearances, Mangione supporters gathered for a glimpse of him, lining up for courtroom seats and fanning themselves with yellow index cards that guaranteed entry.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Tuesday urged a greater emphasis on civic involvement and education, questioning whether some Americans had been clearly taught the difference between a president and a king. Speaking to the New York Law School in Manhattan, the Supreme Court's senior liberal encouraged people to get involved and lamented what she described as a lack of knowledge about fundamental aspects of American law. “Do we understand what the difference is between a king and president?” Sotomayor said at one point. “I think if people understood these things from the beginning, they would be more informed as to what would be important in a democracy in terms of what people can or should not do.” Sotomayor did not directly address President Donald Trump, nor criticism about his efforts to consolidate power within the executive branch. The Supreme Court is considering several appeals challenging the president's power to unilaterally impose tariffs, fire leaders of independent agencies, and claw back federal spending approved by Congress. Kavanaugh faces blowback for claiming Americans can sue over encounters with ICE Sotomayor, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama, has frequently been in dissent in similar cases over the past year. In her own experience, Sotomayor said that schools covered only the basics of how government works. Schools, Sotomayor said, “really didn't explain, in more than a cursory way, what the functions were between the branches and what the expectations were of service in government.”</p>

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. A new Trump executive order has opened the door for 401(K) holders to invest in private equity, cryptocurrency, and other alternative assets. Gerald Epstein, a leading expert on finance and financial crises, warns that Trump's executive order on retirement accounts not only comes with high risks, but the so-called alternative assets deliver, at best, average returns. C. J. Polychroniou: On August 7, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(K) Investors.” Trump's executive order defines alternative assets in a very broad manner to include private equity and private credit, real estate, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. At any rate, with nearly $9 trillion being currently held in 401(K) plans, this executive order represents a historic shift that could potentially reshape how people save for retirement and have indeed major effects on the economy. Why would Trump open the door for 401(K) retirement plans to invest in private equity and crypto? It's hard to imagine Trump being interested in expanding access to these assets because he cares about economic security and the future of the average U.S. worker. Gerald Epstein: You are right: Trump signed an executive order on August 7, 2025, which, like so many of the Trumpian orders, has an Orwellian title: “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(K) Investors.” It is Orwellian because, in effect, it will allow and indeed encourage more Americans, desperate to put away savings for their retirement, to open themselves up to exploitative and misleading investment advisors, brokers, and asset managers on the false promise that they will get higher returns from so-called “alternative” assets. But in fact, this move is more like social dumping. The “smart money” — wealthy investors, pension funds, and university endowments — are starting to abandon some of these “alternative investments” such as private equity. Private equity firms, increasingly desperate for investors, and who for years have been eyeing the “little guys'” 401(K) plans, will now have a chance to make up lost ground by trying to attract middle-class and working-class retirement funds. So, far from democratizing access, Trump's executive order will “democratize” exploitation. And with respect to crypto — the new cool “alternative” asset — this move is a payback to all the crypto pushers who dumped millions of dollars into Republican and friendly Democratic coffers in the 2024 election. And more to the point, it is a pay-forward to Trump, his family, and his cronies, who are making a fortune from the crypto business. David D. Kirkpatrick at The New Yorker, using a very judicious approach, estimates that, so far, the Trump family has made a minimum of $3.4 billion from exploiting Trump's role as president. Of that, 70 percent ($2.4 billion) has come from crypto-related ventures. Would it be accurate to say that Trump's new 401(K) policy has the potential to offer bigger returns but also higher risks? There are two main types of assets that come under the rubric of “alternative investment”: private equity and crypto assets. As Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt, among others, have detailed, private equity refers to financial firms that have become famous for taking over everything from Toys ‘R Us to Steward Health Care, running them into the ground by loading them up with debt, and generating billions for the private equity owners. According to Americans for Financial Reform, private equity firms have been called a “billionaire factory” for private equity managers, whose performance fees increased the number of multibillionaires in the U.S. sevenfold between 2006 and 2015. While the private equity partners make billions, some studies show the private equity investors make no more than average returns but pay much higher fees and expenses, according to analyst Ludovic Phalippou and others. As Tonantzin Carmona of the Brookings Institution and law professor Hilary Allen, among others, have shown, although there might be a few small investors who strike it rich, for most, crypto assets are highly risky with rates of return lower than those on other more regulated investments, such as index funds. Let's assume for a moment that the U.S. economy slips into a recession, where the odds of that happening are now 50-50. What could a recession mean for alternative assets in 401(K)s? As I just indicated, these “alternative investments” are highly risky with, at most, average returns. This question asks whether they are good hedges against negative shocks to the economy, such as recessions, or inflation. Any significant shock is likely to spook investors, leading to a run on crypto-related assets, as we saw in 2023 with the runs on crypto-friendly banks — Silicon Valley, Signature Bank, and First Republic. Private equity is more complicated but will also be at risk. Clearly, a new regulatory regime has been established in Washington since Trump's reelection, which encourages all kinds of financial innovation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. SERGEY RADCHENKO is Wilson E. Schmidt Distinguished Professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Europe. A Plan to Beat the Kremlin on Its Own Terms In the early hours of September 10, Polish and NATO forces shot down several of the 19 Russian drones estimated to have crossed into Polish airspace—an unprecedented incursion that caused consternation and alarm throughout Europe. A few days later, another Russian drone moved into NATO airspace, this time over Romania, although the Romanians took no action and the drone eventually crossed into Ukraine. These events underline what remains a daunting prospect for Europeans: the possibility that the grinding war of attrition in Ukraine will spill over into a broader war between Europe and Russia. Moscow's evident determination to keep fighting in Ukraine has fueled mounting anxiety among European leaders. Yet it was Russian President Vladimir Putin—the “ogre at the door,” as French President Emmanuel Macron once called him—who strolled down a red carpet, to Trump's applause, before a bilateral summit in Alaska in August. The Europeans, who weren't invited, turned to damage control. The following week, European leaders flew to Washington alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to offer him support and show a united front against Russia. Trump treated his guests as he might contestants on The Apprentice: at once effusive, then dismissive, and always uncommitted. The European Union's failure to shape global geopolitical outcomes stems from its own foreign policy incoherence, including a historic overreliance on the United States and an inability to develop a consistent strategy for dealing with Russia, its key adversary. As a result, Putin has opted for endurance: outlasting Western support for Ukraine by exploiting transatlantic fatigue and pairing threats of escalation with the phantasm of a peace that is always just around the corner. Putin inflates modest battlefield gains into major victories and touts Russia's overheated war economy as a sign of strength. His goals are clear: turn Ukraine into a truncated client state, fracture Western unity, and reshape the world order to support Russia's long-term bid for imperial greatness. What Europe needs is to confront the Kremlin on its own terms. At the same time, it should not take stringent positions that consign it to the sidelines of future negotiations—for instance, by refusing to countenance sanctions relief for Russia unless Ukraine is restored to its 1991 borders, a stance that means that Europe will not get a seat at the table. Europe should also learn to beat Putin at his own subversive game by encouraging both the defection of Russian elites and the flight of capital from Russia. European leaders should look ahead, as well, to a time beyond Putin—and lay the groundwork for that future relationship. If Europe wants to help shape Russia, it must start now. The bloc established Security Action for Europe, a fund of 150 billion euros from which EU member states and several external partners, including Ukraine, can draw for defense procurement. New defense coproduction schemes, such as an agreement between Denmark and Ukraine, will also allow Europeans to build up military capabilities they will need for decades to come. European capabilities may be fairly strong, but Europe's will is not. There is certainly no consensus on how to respond to Russian provocations, as evidenced by the different reactions Poland and Romania had toward the drone threats. European states do not even have a shared understanding of what it would mean for Europe if Russia finally subdued Ukraine, either through an outright military victory or a settlement brokered on Putin's terms. One view, rarely voiced in public but quietly circulated in elite EU policy circles, is that such an outcome wouldn't fundamentally change things for Europe. The continent could resume a limited relationship with Russia; after all, Europe bought oil and gas from the Soviet Union, which controlled Ukraine, and even signed arms control treaties with it—détentes propelled by the logic of Wandel durch Handel, West Germany's “change through trade” policy toward communist states. Far-right opposition forces in France, Germany, Italy, and Romania would also likely tilt these member states' national policies toward rapprochement if they were to gain power. The logic of this position is simple: an antagonistic Russia is not going away and the risks of escalation are too high. Europe should find a balance with an aggressive Russia through trade and concessions, even as Russia rebuilds an empire on Europe's eastern frontier. The alternative view is that an end to the war in Ukraine that favors Russia would pose an existential threat to the continent by leaving Europe's eastern flank exposed to Russian subversion or even outright invasion. This line of thinking holds that it was naive to assume Putin would stop at Crimea in 2014 and that it is dangerous to assume he will stop at Ukraine now. It regards Russia's demands that NATO retreat to its pre-1997 borders not as rhetorical bluff but as a maximalist goal Moscow will try to fulfill. But there is little actual appetite for instituting any kind of European-led security guarantees. As Poland's foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, recently said, “Who wants to fight Russia? I don't see many volunteers.” EU members have also been squabbling among themselves, as in a recent public spat between Poland and Hungary over Ukrainian attacks on the Druzhba oil pipeline, which delivers Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia. Such bickering projects an image of a helpless Europe unable to speak with one voice. It also prevents Europe from using the significant tools already at its disposal. For example, the Europeans have been unwilling to confiscate frozen Russian assets to raise more money for Ukraine, earning duplicitous praise from the Kremlin. A leading EU member state, Germany, has been incomprehensibly reluctant to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, while France has vaguely threatened to send ground troops to Ukraine even though it has no real intention of doing so. The Russian drone incursions into Poland and Romania have so far led to little more than statements of concern, instead of what it should have brought about: additional and very public commitments of significant military aid to Ukraine. As it is, Putin has every reason to doubt that further acts of Russian sabotage or subversion will provoke tangible consequences. With few exceptions, the Europeans have shunned direct contact with Russia, instead using long-range propaganda to show the Kremlin what they think of Putin's brutal policies. Trump even brought Armenia and Azerbaijan together to sign a peace deal in the White House, without any Russian or European involvement. Just three years ago, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, had called Azerbaijan a “crucial energy partner.” That economic opening, however, was not matched by political follow-through. This lost opportunity to establish transactional ties with a country on Russia's doorstep is symptomatic of the EU's lack of pragmatism concerning the larger region. Projecting European strength requires more than simply building up arms and offering Ukraine reassurances of future assistance. Europe must also start employing Putin's own tactics against him. By conservative estimates, more than $150 billion was moved to offshore accounts while ordinary Russians faced economic ruin. This propelled the country's 1998 financial crisis, which further accelerated capital flight and resulted in domestic political chaos. Buoyed by soaring oil prices, Russia's new leader rebuilt the economy and amassed a formidable war chest—one that now sustains his campaign in Ukraine and underwrites the resilience of his regime. After the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia shielded its economy by combining aggressive fiscal stimuli with strict controls, effectively preventing a mass exodus of capital. “It's safer at home,” he said, taunting those who had lost fortunes elsewhere as naive. “Invest here.” He branded those who moved capital abroad as “dangerous” to his regime. Some U.S. and European sanctions actually reinforced this fortress strategy by making it harder for Russians to transfer or shelter assets overseas. This does not mean turning the continent into a safe haven for illicit wealth. The death in July of Russia's transport minister, Roman Starovoit, officially ruled a suicide, points to the deepening paranoia and pressure within Russia's ruling class. Europe must offer an escape hatch for those ready to abandon ship—and bring their knowledge and money with them. The goal is not to rehabilitate Russia's weakening oligarchy but to fracture the elite networks that still play a significant role in sustaining Putin's rule. By voting with their feet, they could drain talent, accelerate decay, and pressure the Kremlin to seal its borders—an act that would expose Putin's authoritarianism and hasten his decline. A key argument against this approach is the risk of infiltration by Russian saboteurs and spies. But the threat is overstated: Russian intelligence operatives are already in Europe in significant numbers, and any further increase can be partially neutralized through better counterintelligence work and due diligence. It would come with manageable danger for Europe, but the potential effect on Russia's already thinly stretched economy cannot be overstated. It helped delegitimize East German communism and paved the way for its eventual collapse. Likewise, Europe should make clear, through both policy and public messaging, that Putin's war has severed Russia from the European idea, and that those willing to walk away from that war will find Europe open to them. This is because subversion relies on national competence, not EU unanimity, since many aspects of migration and border control can be reshaped through existing mechanisms without total consensus. Even skeptics such as Hungary or Slovakia can paint the selective intake of high-skill Russian workers and elites as a humanitarian, pro-growth measure rather than an escalation of hostilities. Any viable EU strategy toward Russia must incorporate a long-term vision for where Europe wants Russia to be in ten or 15 years—whether or not Putin remains in power. That tradition continued to guide EU engagement with Russia until the invasion of Ukraine, even when its members should have decided to change course. The EU's Russia strategy should therefore include planning for Russia's postconflict transition, when it may reintegrate with collaborative international frameworks with Western countries. Russia is not destined to be hostile, undemocratic, or imperialist by nature. Even as Europe confronts Russian aggression with clarity and force, it must pursue a dual-track strategy—one that keeps the door open to a different relationship with the country. Europe can hold a dagger in one hand, but it must be prepared to extend the other.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump has filed a US$15-billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times and book publisher Penguin Random House, his latest legal assault on major media companies he accuses of treating him unfairly. The lawsuit filed on Monday in Florida federal court centers on a book about Trump by two New York Times reporters and three “false, malicious, defamatory, and disparaging” articles that he says were aimed at sabotaging his chances in the 2024 presidential election. In a statement on Tuesday, the Times said Trump's lawsuit has no legitimate legal claims and is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. U.S. law makes it difficult for public figures like Trump to prevail in defamation cases, requiring them to prove defendants published information they knew or should have known was false. Trump has nonetheless mounted a flurry of legal attacks against major media outlets during his second term, including a US$10-billion defamation case against the Wall Street Journal in July. The lawsuit cites three articles, including an editorial prior to the 2024 election saying Trump was unfit for office, and a 2024 book titled Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father's Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success, which was written by two Times reporters and published by Penguin Random House. Trump sues Wall Street Journal, Rupert Murdoch for Epstein birthday letter coverage Those publications harmed Trump's business and personal reputation, thereby causing massive economic damage to his brand value and significant damage to his future financial prospects, Trump's lawyers said in a court filing. The filing comes after Trump threatened last week to sue the New York Times for its reporting on an allegedly sexually suggestive note and drawing given to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and sex offender who died by suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019. Trump has said he parted ways with Epstein before the financier's legal troubles became public in 2006. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Russian drone strike targeted central Kharkiv during broad daylight on Sept. 16, damaging an educational institution and injuring at least four people, officials reported. A fire broke out at the building covering an area of 150 square meters, according to the State Emergency Service. Russia struck the city at around 11 a.m. local time, presumably using Geran-2 kamikaze drones, according to prosecutors. Local authorities said that some of the incoming drones were shot down. Several civilians were wounded while in the streets. All are in stable condition, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. President Volodymyr Zelensky commented on the attack in a post on X, calling it "a typical day for Russia, which, unfortunately, continues to avoid truly strong global pressure in response to prolonging the war." The National University of Pharmacy — for Russia, simply a target. Russian guided aerial bombs continue to rain down on communities in the Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk regions," the Ukrainian president said. Zelensky urged the international community to respond to every strike and stressed that only significant economic losses could force Moscow toward diplomacy. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city lying some 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the border with Russia, is a regular target of Russian missile and drone attacks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) carried out explosions in Russia's Vladivostok as a "revenge operation" targeting troops accused of war crimes, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 16. Vladivostok, a major port on the Sea of Japan near China, lies about 6,000 kilometers (3,730 miles) east of Ukraine, making it one of Russia's most distant cities from the war's front lines. Russian media said emergency services and a helicopter were dispatched to the scene. Local officials said the explosions were caused by a gas equipment malfunction, adding that "there were no casualties, though several vehicles suffered minor damage." In May, HUR carried out explosions near Vladivostok, also targeting Russia's 47th Airborne Assault Battalion, an intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent at the time. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Ukraine has previously carried out targeted sabotage operations deep inside Russian territory, hitting military logistics, fuel depots, and infrastructure critical to Moscow's war effort.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. HUSSEIN AGHA has been involved in Israeli-Palestinian affairs and negotiations for more than half a century. He was a Senior Associate at St. Antony's College, University of Oxford from 1996 to 2023. ROBERT MALLEY is a Lecturer at Yale University's Jackson School of Global Affairs. This article is adapted from their book Tomorrow Is Yesterday: Life, Death, and the Pursuit of Peace in Israel-Palestine (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2025). As Its Influence Faded, Washington Dissembled and Denied Reality On any given day during the long war in Gaza, a Biden administration official could be expected to assert any of the following: a cease-fire was around the corner, the United States was working tirelessly to achieve one, it cared equally about the Israelis and the Palestinians, a historic Saudi-Israeli normalization deal was at hand, and all this was bound up with an irreversible path to Palestinian statehood. Not one of those pronouncements bore even a loose resemblance to the truth. Talks about a cease-fire dragged on, and when they fitfully bore fruit, the resulting understandings quickly fell apart. Taking that step was also the one thing that might have demonstrated, beyond platitudes, a U.S. commitment to protecting both Israeli and Palestinian lives. Saudi Arabia kept repeating that normalization with Israel depended on progress toward a Palestinian state, and the Israeli government consistently ruled such progress out. The more time went on, the more U.S. statements were exposed as empty words, met with disbelief or indifference. That did not stop them from being made. If not, why did they keep saying it? They helped normalize Israel's indiscriminate killings; its targeting of hospitals, schools, and mosques; its use of access to food as a weapon of war; and its continued reliance on American weapons. They laid the ground and there was no turning back. For decades, the United States dissembled about its stance toward the conflict, posing as a mediator when it was an outright partisan. As the falsehoods have become more apparent and harder to ignore, U.S. influence has dwindled. Israelis, Palestinians, and other local actors ignore the charade—leaving behind the bromides about the two-state solution, peace, democracy, and American mediation—and revert to more visceral, unembellished attitudes that sprout from their pasts. As in earlier decades, Palestinians—adrift, leaderless, brimming with anger and thirst for revenge—resort to isolated acts of violence against Israelis, awaiting the day they cohere into more organized form. As before, Israel, unrestrained and unbridled, extends its arm wherever and whenever it sees a Palestinian ripe for killing: in the 1970s in Amman, Beirut, Tunis, Paris, or Rome; nowadays in Doha and Tehran. First comes the wrong-headed approach, misreading of a situation, deliberate or inadvertent mistake, as when U.S. officials assert that the best way to influence Israel is not through pressure but with a warm embrace. When they clumsily meddle in Palestinian politics, seeking to anoint a preferred set of “moderate” leaders, an endorsement that, in the eyes of those leaders' constituents, has little to distinguish itself from an indictment. When they exclude from peacemaking the forces most able to derail it, those on both sides who, for reasons religious or ideological, share a deep, immutable attachment to all the land between the river and the sea, and who would experience giving up an inch of it as a wrenching ripping apart—Israeli settlers and religious nationalists, Palestinian refugees and Islamists. Information is not understanding; it can be the opposite. In 2000, senior U.S. intelligence officials, based on what they had seen, heard, and thought they had learned, assured President Bill Clinton that the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat would have no choice but to accept Clinton's proposals during the summit at Camp David, that he would be crazy not to. Arafat turned them down, celebrated as a hero by his people for doing so. In 2006, the Bush administration missed clear signs that pointed to a Hamas victory in the Palestinian elections for which Washington had clamored and about which Palestinian officials had fretted. Years later, after the 2011 uprising in Syria broke out, raw intelligence erroneously depicted a battlefield that gave President Bashar al-Assad scant chance of short-term survival, the rebels who sought to oust him a relatively swift path to success. During the Biden administration, U.S. officials relied on intelligence reports to evaluate the thinking of Iranian leaders and their stance on a proposed nuclear deal. These shocks were not the result of deliberate distortions in which intelligence is molded to suit official whims—such as when the Central Intelligence Agency in 2003 told President George W. Bush what he wanted to hear: that the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, that the case against him was a “slam dunk.” They were the result of a dynamic that is less deceptive, less purposeful. Officials may be reminded that the information they have received was gleaned from a single conversation in one place, at one time, without the benefit of wider analysis, broader context, and knowledge of unspoken assumptions. They can be told that whatever is extracted is not the whole puzzle and that to possess pieces of the puzzle can be more misleading than to have none. To those who have never crossed paths with raw intelligence—the intercept of a conversation, the contents of a secret memorandum—the thrill can be hard to describe. To get things wrong, misread foreign dynamics, or misapprehend local actors is not unusual. For most policymakers, it is part of the job. What is uncommon, and harder to explain, is how often these failures have been allowed to happen and recur; how even their proliferation has led to neither personal nor institutional accountability, seldom to a mild reprimand, let alone a genuine rethink; how little the United States appears capable of learning from mistakes. Next in the life of an American failure is its replication. Even more confounding than the mistakes or their stubborn repetition is U.S. officials' habit of voicing a falsehood even after they know it to be untrue, even after they know that others know it to be untrue. Unmoored from reality, the pronouncements veer into happy talk. It suggests a deliberate, almost strategic attitude of boundless cheer contrary to common sense and everyday experience. It is this, the casual way in which the United States regularly proffers optimistic statements that fly in the face of all evidence and stand in sharp contrast to a sorry record, that is most striking and perplexing. All would learn to distrust him—the learning came fast. But lies saved him and put his cause on the map. There are lies that get things done, even if what gets done can be ugly, foul, violent, or worse. But the fabrications that came to pervade and corrode the United States' Middle East diplomacy are not of this kind. They stand apart because they fool nobody and those who utter them must know that nobody is fooled. They happen when one U.S. administration after another has proclaimed its determination to achieve a two-state solution well after the time such an outcome had become impossible; when the Biden administration asserted it cared equally about Israeli and Palestinian lives; when it proclaimed it was tireless in its pursuit of a cease-fire or that Saudi-Israeli normalization was there for the taking, just within reach. Many of the assertions do not start that way. Indeed, they had told the Israeli prime minister as much. At Camp David in 2000, U.S. participants likewise persuaded themselves that a deal between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was at hand when nothing—neither territorial division nor the status of Jerusalem nor the fate of Palestinian refugees—had been agreed. When, during President Barack Obama's second term, Secretary of State John Kerry, fresh into his Israeli-Palestinian diplomatic foray, said that the parties were closer to a deal than ever before, it is doubtful that he was pretending. Like others before him, he was confident that reaching an agreement was a matter of will and perseverance, both of which he possessed in abundance. When Biden administration officials claimed that Saudi Arabia would be ready for normalization with Israel, they probably meant it; after all, that is what Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had privately conveyed. Over time, it becomes difficult to tell where self-delusion ends and dissembling begins. An illusion endlessly repeated despite its demonstrable untruth ceases to be an illusion and becomes a lie; a lie endlessly retold can become second nature, so ingrained and instinctive as to detach from its origins and morph into self-delusion. American officials' recurrent claims, over many decades, that they are committed to a two-state solution and that another round of U.S.-mediated talks could bring it about were no doubt born of genuine conviction. When, failure after failure, they continue to echo the mantra, it is no longer an illusion and turns into deceit. American officials had faith when they went to Geneva and Camp David and also knew both would be a bust; believed in Kerry's initiative and knew it was quixotic; trusted that Saudi-Israeli normalization was achievable and were resigned to the fact that, for the time being, it was a pipe dream. Proof disproves belief, and still the faith endures. There came a time when, in its dealings with the Middle East, the United States began to make a religion out of optimism, embrace an ideology of wishful thinking, routinely speak empty words, and issue claims readily disproved by events. It is hard to identify a precise date, easier to identify a probable cause: the acquired habit cannot be separated from the erosion of U.S. power and influence. No party can match American military or economic dominance, but an increasing number of partners and enemies in the Middle East learned to disregard it. The United States, with all its might, was regularly rebuffed by Israel, often even by the Palestinians, and did little more than witness its own embarrassment. But it is difficult to imagine a greater chasm between capability and accomplishment. The bully was bullied and did nothing about it. Elsewhere, in Afghanistan as in Iraq, the United States showed it did not know how to wage a war, much less win one. The United States showed it could not manage peace, either. It sought to promote a democratic transition in Egypt in 2011, a chapter that closed with the consolidation of a government more repressive than the one its leaders helped overthrow. The U.S. president hoped the operation would succeed, later described it as a “shit show.” He was right on one of those counts. The Obama administration's subsequent efforts to oust the Syrian regime through heavy investment in the armed opposition followed a similar pattern: U.S. involvement helped prolong a civil war, further encouraged Iranian and Russian interventions, and failed to bring the rebels to power. In each case, wishful thinking stumbled on hard facts, and the United States appeared curiously oblivious to the lessons of its own Middle East history—lessons about its overconfidence; the limits of its power; the resilience of established governments; the unreliability of local partners keen for American succor, indifferent to American advice; the blowback that follows propping up armed groups about which Washington knows little and over which it has even less control; its repeated attraction, like moth to flame, to a region it has repeatedly vowed to escape. Lessons, in short, about the marriage of the United States' irresistible urge to meddle in a region and its unfamiliarity with that region's ways. Even when the outcomes for which it had labored came to pass, they did not come at Washington's behest. The significant strike, the serious one, came at Israel's hands, when it decapitated Hezbollah and devastated its ranks in September 2024. Shortly before Assad fled Damascus that December and his regime disintegrated, the United States had concluded that both were there to stay and pondered a deal to improve bilateral relations. Stunned, American officials could do little more than watch as a group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States swiftly chased Assad out, completing the task Washington had tried so hard and so unsuccessfully to accomplish, and sit down with someone who, in the quick transition from opposition to power, had transformed in their eyes from jihadist to statesman. In Afghanistan, the United States repeated that success was around the corner and chased its tail until it caught up with defeat. While claiming to be engaged in a fight for democracy and human rights, Washington was flanked by partners—Egypt, Gulf Arab monarchies and sheikhdoms, Israel—that ignored the former and flouted the latter. The United States insisted its pressure could constrain Iran's nuclear program. Yet each new U.S. sanction slapped on in response to every new Iranian act of defiance was proof of its own futility. One cannot seriously argue that pressure will curb Iran's behavior if more pressure continually yields worse behavior. When Obama armed Syrian rebels, he publicly asserted, “This dictator will fall.” Later, he acknowledged that the idea of such an opposition succeeding—a ragtag group of “former doctors, farmers, pharmacists” vanquishing an army—was a fantasy. The Biden administration decried President Donald Trump's 2018 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal that Obama had negotiated and to reimpose sanctions. In the same breath, it boasted that it had not lifted a single sanction, had added many more, and vowed to increase the pressure it acknowledged had not worked. President Joe Biden, also, when U.S. forces began to go after the Houthis in Yemen in response to their attacks on commercial ships, and U.S. military spokespeople repeatedly claimed success, gave this curious statement about the strikes he had ordered to a reporter: “When you say are they working, are they stopping the Houthis? The disconnect between words and reality is near impossible to comprehend, save perhaps as a hint of the end of an era. How the Arab world initially reacted to Trump's reelection in 2024 spoke volumes. By almost any standard, Trump should have had everything going against him in this regard. In his first term, he had decisively tilted the field in Israel's favor, eager to break with convention and jettison peace process truisms he dismissed as fairy tales. During his campaign, he had called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “finish the job” in Gaza; whatever moral indignation Biden officials dared voice at Israel's conduct of its war there would find no echo among their successors. Yet in the early days, in many corners of the Middle East, relief came more readily than despair at the thought of bidding farewell to Biden's approach—and, as they saw it, Obama's, as well. The familiar explanation that it takes an autocrat to enjoy an autocrat, that in Trump, Arab dictators recognized one of their ilk, goes only so far. Biden, after all, had hardly proved a true crusader on behalf of democracy and human rights. What they found hard to stomach were the lies. They saw in him a leader without moral compass, at ease with the unashamed exercise of power. Unlike his predecessors, Trump did not drone on about an imaginary two-state solution; meant it when he said all options were on the table regarding Iran; and, when he authorized talks with Hamas, dropped the pantomime of refusing to engage with the only Palestinian entity that could decide on matters of war and peace. How much this represents a break with the past remains to be seen. Still, after years of faux outrage and bogus preaching, genuine cynicism was to many a welcome breath of fresh air. Over decades, the United States had gradually built an alternate universe. A universe in which happy talk comes true and actions produce promised consequences. In which Washington's mission in Afghanistan gives rise to a modern democracy and U.S.-backed government forces can stand up to the Taliban. In which economic sanctions yield desired political change, domesticate the Houthis, reverse Iran's nuclear advances. A universe in which moderate Palestinians represent their people, will reform the Palestinian Authority and curb its political demands; a reasonable Israeli center will take charge thanks to gentle American prodding, will agree to meaningful territorial withdrawals and to a Palestinian state worthy of the name. A universe in which a cease-fire in Gaza is imminent, international justice is blind, and Washington's crude double standards do not incessantly defile the international order it purports to defend. Despite Misgivings About Netanyahu's Gaza Plans, Most Israelis Support His Approach to the Palestinians Trump Has Leverage, but He Must Use It Wisely But America Can Still Use Its Leverage to End the War in Gaza Russia's Allies in the Region Couldn't Count on Moscow—and Neither Should China Washington Still Has Significant Leverage Over China, North Korea, and Russia Ryan C.

TOKYO (AP) — Armand “Mondo” Duplantis traded handshakes and hugs with the pole vaulters he'd just beaten to capture his third world championship. Then, like any great performer in a jam-packed stadium, he turned around, walked back onstage and delivered the encore the people had been waiting for. It was another world record — the 14th time he's set it — by clearing the bar at 6.30 meters. Duplantis cleared it on his third and final attempt Monday night in Tokyo. But nobody in the crowd of 53,000 would dare walk out on Mondo. “To be able to enjoy this world record with them and give them that is super special,” Duplantis said. “Especially considering the last time I was in this stadium, we didn't have any spectators. The night of his last performance at Japan National Stadium was during the COVID Olympics, held a year late in 2021 and without any fans. This time, there was noise and fun — the people clapping in rhythm every time Duplantis lined up — and like any great artist, Mondo knew how to play to the crowd. After clearing 6.10, for instance, he imitated Japanese baseball Hall of Famer Ichiro Suzuki's pre-bat sleeve-tugging routine. “My brother was in the crowd and he plays baseball, so I was trying to fire him up,” Duplantis said. The Louisiana-born phenom who competes for his mother's native Sweden collected $70,000 for the win — his 49th straight dating to September 2022 — along with the $100,000 bonus that goes to record breakers at world championships. “Motivation-wise, it's not that much of a problem. Duplantis started breaking records on Feb. 8, 2020, and has broken them on three continents and, now, in nine counties. This latest feat puts the height at an even 6.30. At this rate, it would take another few years. Bubka's final record was 6.14, and after France's Renaud Lavillenie topped that once, Duplantis took over. He has improved the record by one centimeter every time, giving him maximum opportunities to pocket bonuses like the one he'll receive from World Athletics for this one. “What Mondo has in spades is what every pole vaulter is trying to achieve,” said Sam Kendricks, the fourth-place finisher who is the last man not named Duplantis to win a world title (in 2019). He's got a family that really supports him, and then he's got a field of guys that's really pushing him up there.” Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ruling comes as US president pushes to weaken central bank's independence An appeals court has blocked Donald Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook, a governor of the US Federal Reserve. On Monday, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that Ms Cook can keep her seat ahead of the Fed's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, where it is expected to cut interest rates to shore up a cooling labour market. The decision was 2-1, with Circuit Judges Bradley Garcia and J Michelle Childs in the majority, both of whom were appointed by Mr Biden. US District Judge Jia Cobb had ruled on Sept 9 that Mr Trump's claims that Ms Cook committed “deceitful and criminal conduct in a financial matter” before taking office were not likely to be sufficient grounds for removal under the law that created the central bank. Ms Cook denies wrongdoing and is in the process of suing Mr Trump. The 48-47 vote marked the final step of a swift process that began in August, when Adriana Kugler resigned unexpectedly as a Federal Reserve governor. That created an opening on the seven-member board for Mr Trump to fill with someone more amenable to lowering interest rates, as the president has demanded for all year. Lisa Murkowski, a senator for Alaska, was the lone vote against Mr Miran from Republicans. It typically takes months for a Federal Reserve governor nominee to be confirmed by the Senate. However, Mr Miran was confirmed in less than six weeks. Policymakers are expected to approve a quarter-percentage-point rate cut to support a weakening labour market at the end of the meeting on Wednesday. Analysts anticipate that Mr Miran will dissent on the policy decision in favour of a bigger rate cut, though not necessarily the several-percentage-point reduction that Mr Trump has demanded. As the head of the White House's council of economic advisers, Mr Miran has argued that the president's tariffs will not cause inflation and that Mr Trump's other policies, including his immigration crackdown, will ease broad price pressures by reducing demand for housing. As the newest Federal Reserve board member, Mr Miran would have responsibilities that extend beyond voting on interest rates. Mr Miran will retain his White House job but go on unpaid leave while he serves at the Federal Reserve for a term that expires on Jan 31, although he could stay on indefinitely if a successor for his seat has not yet been picked and confirmed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOSCOW, September 16. Serbia does not intend to introduce visas for Russians due to the European Union's pressure, the republic's ambassador to Russia Momcilo Babic told TASS. The media reported this spring that Serbia planned to harmonize its visa policy with the EU by the end of 2026. The republic has already introduced a visa regime with Oman, Kuwait, Mongolia, and Qatar. "I hope no visas will be introduced before 2027. I am not aware of the Serbian government preparing for this. Moreover, I am sure that this is not true," the ambassador said. He recalled that Serbia is not accepted into the EU. "Why should we take steps that are not in the interests of our people? Be it energy, defense, Russia is our reliable ally," Babic said.</p>
