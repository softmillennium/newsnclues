                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Utah County prosecutors on Tuesday charged Tyler Robinson in the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, a murder officials say was politically motivated. “Charlie Kirk was murdered while engaging in one of our most sacred and cherished American rights,” Gray said. “The bedrock of our democratic republic is the free exchange of ideas in a search for truth, understanding, and a more perfect union.” Robinson will make his first court appearance at 3 pm MST on Tuesday. Kirk, 31, was fatally shot on September 10 while taking questions from students. The cofounder of Turning Point USA, he was credited with galvanizing young conservatives and playing a pivotal role in Donald Trump's 2024 White House return. Vigils for Kirk have since been held in Arizona, New York, and Washington, among other states. Patel also said investigators believe Robinson wrote a note of his alleged intent to kill Kirk, bolstering claims the attack was premeditated. An indictment released Tuesday adds vivid details to the allegations. Investigators recovered cartridges at the scene with hand-engraved messages, which prosecutors argue points to premeditation and motive. Prosecutors also cited interviews with Robinson's parents and roommate, who said he expressed anger that Kirk “spreads too much hate” and admitted he had “enough of his hatred.” The filing further alleges that Robinson told his roommate to stay silent if approached by police and that children were visible near the stage when Kirk was shot—factors prosecutors say aggravated the seriousness of the crime. She added that Robinson had also begun to date his roommate, a transgender woman, adding that his father has “very different political views.” The roommate is said to be fully cooperating with the government. Screenshots obtained by The Washington Post and other outlets allegedly show him confessing in a private Discord chat hours before surrendering: “It was me at UVU yesterday. i'm sorry for all of this.” The same user followed with another message saying he was about to turn himself in through “a sheriff friend.” Discord reportedly confirmed it gave copies of the messages to law enforcement and said it found no evidence that Robinson used the platform to plan or promote violence. Robinson later turned himself in at the Washington County Sheriff's Office. Kirk's murder was quickly weaponized to marshal power in Washington, with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance spinning allegations in tandem about a broader left-wing conspiracy—neither offering any evidence to support their claims. On Monday, Vance hosted an episode of The Charlie Kirk Show from the White House, where he and other officials pledged a crackdown on liberal organizations vaguely accused of fueling unrest. US security services have long stressed that domestic extremism is driven by varied ideologies, from racially or ethnically motivated movements to anti-government and religious grievances. Multiple studies, nevertheless, have found that right-wing extremists commit far more attacks—and deadlier ones—than the left, a statistical reality that cuts directly against the administration's script. A Department of Justice study showing that far-right extremist violence “continues to outpace all other types of terrorism and domestic violent extremism” in the US was removed from the DOJ's website this week without explanation. Updated 3:20 pm ET, September 16, 2025: Added additional details from the indictment against Robinson.

Envive also helps companies improve their visibility in generative AI search results. Envive, previously known as Spiffy, is part of a broader trend as companies move from static websites and basic chatbots toward AI agents that can supercharge customer interactions. Envive said its revenue is expected to grow by 5X this year, with customer count tripling. Envive's core technology traces its roots to research at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2). Envive CEO Aniket Deosthali previously helped Walmart build its generative AI-powered shopping assistant. “Commerce is entering the agentic era,” Deosthali said in a statement. That's what we are building: self-improving agents with performance, control, and safety at their core.” “I think their combination of advanced AI expertise and retail execution makes them uniquely positioned to lead the industry,” Sri Chandrasekar, managing partner at Point72 Ventures, said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The generative AI industry has promised to “disrupt” society, and on that front, it can be said to have succeeded. AI has certainly disrupted many parts of society, including education, social media, and politics. Most of all, it seems to have disrupted the tech industry itself, where what was once a profitable career (software development) increasingly seems to be more of a precarious one, thanks to the rise of so-called “vibe coding”—a form of AI-assisted software development that requires less experience and more automation. This whole vibe coding thing doesn't seem to be working out for companies, however, as generating code via an LLM prompt at breakneck speed can, predictably, lead to less-than-stellar work. Now, in an ironic twist, it seems that, having dispensed with more skilled coders for the cheap effectiveness of a chatbot-aided code monkey, companies are having to hire additional contractors to fix the AI's screw-ups. The outlet cites one description shared with them by a specialist, who said his particular expertise was to “polish” up codebases that might be a little rough around the edges: “I've been offering vibe coding fixer services for about two years now, starting in late 2023. Currently, I work with around 15-20 clients regularly, with additional one-off projects throughout the year,” Hamid Siddiqi, who offers to “review, fix your vibe code” on Fiverr, told me in an email. “I started fixing vibe-coded projects because I noticed a growing number of developers and small teams struggling to refine AI-generated code that was functional but lacked the polish or ‘vibe' needed to align with their vision. I saw an opportunity to bridge that gap, combining my coding expertise with an eye for aesthetic and user experience.” Siddiqi told 404 that he commonly assists companies with “inconsistent UI/UX design in AI-generated frontends, poorly optimized code that impacts performance, misaligned branding elements, and features that function but feel clunky or unintuitive.” Yet another cleanup specialist, Swatantra Sohni, told the outlet that they think AI is being leveraged by people who don't otherwise have the digital skills to build products. Vibe coding is, at the moment, kind of like infancy. It's very handy to convey the prototype they want, but I don't think they are really intended to make it like a production grade app.” As with many other AI-led industries, humans are still necessary after all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Automotive giant General Motors is preparing for layoffs at its assembly plant in Wentzville, Missouri. GM's Wentzville plant builds the company's Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon mid-size trucks, as well as the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana full-size vans. The latter two are some of GM's longest-running offerings and were rumored to be due for a complete EV revamp by 2026, but GM walked back on those plans, according to GMAuthority. GM didn't respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo. Although the current tax credit was passed as part of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, an EV tax credit has existed in one form or another for more than a decade. That unknown caused GM to cut output at a major electric vehicle assembly plant, temporarily lay off workers, and indefinitely delay a shift at a Kansas City assembly plant that was set to produce electric Chevy Bolts later this year, Reuters reported in September. Back in 2021, GM made a significant commitment to completely electrify its fleet of vehicles by 2035. A major roadblock for that vision has since arrived in the form of Trump-era EV policies. According to CEO Mary Barra's comments from last week, electric vehicles are still the company's “north star.” Previously floundering demand is now looking up, too: sales of used electric vehicles rose 40% from last year in July, and GM's own electric vehicle sales jumped to an all-time monthly record in August. The company shared in a press release that although they are expecting strong demand in September as well, sales will “no doubt” be lower after the tax credits end. “It may take several months for the market to normalize. We will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won't overproduce,” Duncan Aldred, president of GM's North America business, said in the press release. The upcoming uncertainty is not just a test for GM, but a test for the U.S. at large. While EV demand flutters in the U.S. and Washington repeals key support for the industry, Chinese EV-makers like BYD enjoy government support as they ambitiously expand operations and global influence. Goldman Sachs analysts shared last year that they expect electric vehicles to make up 50% of global new car sales by 2035. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The old debate of form over function remains true with iOS 26 and the final version that launched for all iPhones today. There's all but a faint whiff of that long-promised Apple Intelligence, though you'll still find plenty to love and more to complain about with the switch from iOS 18 all the way to the “26” generation. Remember to set aside some storage on iPhone, as the update will demand a good chunk. Our senior editor, Raymond Wong, got the update on his iPhone 16 Pro and noted it was 14.9GB. Along with iOS 26, Apple also released iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and all the rest. Every Apple product now shares a similar design language centered on the “Liquid Glass” look. For instance, the “Search” button on iPhones may blend more into your background wallpaper. Users didn't appreciate having to watch short animations before getting into their apps. Despite the controversy, skeuomorphism—where Apple tried incorporating more familiar images and designs, such as the battery image representing battery life—still remains to this day. That brings us to now and the emphasis on “glassmorphism,” emphasizing opaque windows for a pseudo-3D effect. As somebody who has used multiple versions of the iPadOS 26 and macOS 26 betas extensively during the beta period this past summer, I appreciated some design changes more than others. Clicking on those notifications also opens up the iPhone Mirroring, a feature that was introduced in last year's macOS Sequoia. There's no more Launchpad available in the dock, and to bring it back you need to muck around in Terminal. Instead, you're granted an “Apps” folder that is overloaded with all your iPhone apps in addition to those you installed on Mac. macOS 26 also sports a few more minor additions, like the largely ineffectual Game Overlay. All that functionality is now bedecked in the translucent layer of glass, from your app icons to the Control Center. The real innovation was saved for Apple's tablets. The iPad is now far more usable as a dedicated laptop replacement for all your tasks. Apple added the ability to have multiple apps open on-screen at once. If you want to watch YouTube and type up your notes, it's now easier than the previous Stage Manager or dual-screen solutions. Apple has fine-tuned Liquid Glass from its initial dev beta into the public beta and again for the final release. The latest public betas honed in on the current design, where you can catch a hint of content underneath menus, as if staring into a pool of glassy water. The effect wants to evoke something tangible, like you're doing more than scrolling pixels on a pane of glass. After months of playing with all the various betas, I still would prefer a version of Liquid Glass that matches up to the name. Regular Apple users who use their iPhone for little more than accessing their camera or their TikTok feeds may not understand the hate, but the most-dedicated iPhone aficionados may grow impatient with the new design. Critics say Liquid Glass distracts you from the functions of each app. Some developers publicly lambasted the new design that sticks important functionality behind hamburger menus (those three horizontal bars that open up drop-down menus). Then again, that's a fact of life for living in Apple's ecosystem. The company is more concerned with devices that focus apps for specific use types. Inevitably, you'll run up against a single instance where the glass garbles words or distracts you from an important part of a text or email. After those fleeting moments where the raw hate overflows, you'll just keep using your devices the way you always have. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company on Tuesday debuted Neo, a new AI agent that automates cloud infrastructure tasks at enterprise scale. Pulumi CEO Joe Duffy said he pulled a third of his 130-person workforce to build Neo, which he described as “an extension of your team,” capable of handling infrastructure provisioning, security, and compliance work that can traditionally take days or weeks. Neo builds on Pulumi's infrastructure-as-code (IaC) foundation and uses large language models — primarily Claude — combined with enterprise guardrails. It integrates with AI developer tools such as Devin, Cursor, Windsurf, and VS Code via Pulumi's Model Context Protocol server, and lets users adjust its autonomy from human-approved steps to fully automated workflows. AI has transformed application development, letting developers spin up apps and websites in seconds. Pulumi is betting the same pattern will emerge for complex back-end cloud infrastructure — and it's launching Neo at a time when platform teams are struggling to keep up as developers write more code than ever. “While developer teams race to adopt AI, platform teams are drowning in managing the infrastructure demands, and a volume/velocity crisis develops,” said Sheila Gulati, managing director at Tola Capital, a Pulumi investor. “Infrastructure provisioning is still manual because of compliance priorities internally. Automating platform engineering tasks will help companies continue making AI investments and avoid being throttled by infrastructure capacity, security, and resilience needs, Gulati said. “Neo is going to help them keep up and spend more time on strategic tasks, rather than firefighting all the time,” he said. Pulumi says beta users have delivered 10 times more infrastructure, deployed 75% faster, and cut policy violations by 90%. Founded in 2017, Pulumi now counts more than 3,700 customers including Nvidia and BMW, with more than one million downloads per week of its IaC tool. The startup recently moved into a new office at Two Union Square in downtown Seattle and opened a subsidiary in Europe as it expands globally.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While many robotics companies are building human-sized robots, or working to automate entire factories, MicroFactory is instead trying to think big by building small. San Francisco-based MicroFactory built a general-purpose, tabletop manufacturing kit that's about the size of my Siberian Husky's dog crate. “General purpose robots are good, but it's not necessary [to] be humanoid,” said Igor Kulakov, the co-founder and CEO of MicroFactory, in an interview with TechCrunch. “We decided to design robots from scratch that will still be general purpose but not in human shape, and this way, it can be done much simpler, much easier, in hardware and on the AI side.” Rather than selling individual robotic arms, MicroFactory's system comes as an enclosed but transparent workstation, allowing users to watch the manufacturing process in real time. The compact factory-in-a-box is designed for precision tasks like circuit board assembly, component soldering, and cable routing. Users can train the robots by physically guiding the arms through complex motions — a hands-on approach that Kulakov says works faster than traditional AI programming for intricate manufacturing sequences. Kulakov's experience with traditional manufacturing helped spark the idea behind MicroFactory. He and his co-founder, Viktor Petrenko, used to run bitLighter, a manufacturing business that made portable lighting equipment for photographers. It took them about five months to build their prototype. MicroFactory just raised a $1.5 million pre-seed funding round that included investors like executives from the AI company Hugging Face and investor-entrepreneur Naval Ravikant. The company is currently converting its prototype into a commercial product that it hopes to begin shipping in about two months.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Founded last year, Ethosphere uses wearable microphones and audio processing software to analyze in-store conversations with customers. Large language models help digest the data and provide feedback to frontline retail workers. The goal is to help associates improve their performance while giving managers better visibility into what drives sales, CEO Evan Smith said in an interview with GeekWire. Smith, who held leadership roles at Starbucks in technology and operations, said that high-performing managers are the biggest driver of retail success. “At our core, we're inspired by empowering people to be great in what they do and using AI to give people superpowers,” Smith said. Associates get feedback on what they did well and where they can improve; managers see data on who's excelling and who could benefit from targeted coaching. Retailers work with the company to implement appropriate in-store disclosures. In luxury settings, Smith said the company is exploring opt-in use cases where stylists offer to record conversations as a white-glove concierge perk. Smith noted that some employees enjoy using the system to get feedback in a new way. “The gamification element of this shows up in a much more powerful way than I would have predicted when we started this,” he said. Ethosphere isn't naming customers but said it is working with brands in the quick-service restaurant industry, clothing shops, and high-end luxury retailers. The 9-person startup is generating revenue from some customers while working with others on custom pilots. “In an increasingly busy landscape flooded with theoretical AI, Ethosphere stood out to us with a practical, powerful application that we believe has the potential to directly impact the sales and customer experience,” Sri Chandrasekar, a Seattle-based managing partner at Point72 Ventures, said in a statement. Smith, who began his career in education and public affairs, co-founded the company with CTO Ahad Rana, a veteran technologist with experience at AWS, Google, Factual, and AOL. Both held entrepreneur-in-residence positions at Seattle's AI2 Incubator before launching Ethosphere.

All three major manufacturers have completed their current family of GPUs, so we can expect more variants or refreshes in the future. With so much excitement around new chips and architectures, what's next for all three companies? We break down everything you need to know about their upcoming plans. Built on TSMC's 4NP process node, the Blackwell consumer GPUs highlighted an uplift in AI-accelerated workloads across desktop and laptop platforms. But it wasn't a huge leap in performance across the board. This is a continuation of TSMC's 5nm-class manufacturing family, prioritizing mature process reliability over bleeding-edge node adoption, which allows for some degree of cost control. The Blackwell consumer architecture incorporates fundamental architectural improvements over Ada Lovelace, including doubled integer math throughput per clock cycle through fully unified FP32 and INT32 cores. The streaming multiprocessor (SM) design has been completely reengineered, with each SM containing 128 CUDA cores, four fifth-generation Tensor cores, one fourth-generation RT core, and four texture units alongside 256KB register files and configurable 128KB L1/shared memory. The post-Blackwell era of Nvidia consumer graphics signals a strong shift toward neural rendering-first design philosophy, with three major architectural generations positioned to push the envelope on desktop and laptop GPU capabilities through 2029. The Rubin, Rubin Ultra, and Feynman architectures plan to incorporate advanced manufacturing processes, next-generation memory technologies, and AI acceleration, which are likely to land in future desktop GPUs. Nvidia's Rubin architecture is expected to be the first consumer GPU generation manufactured on TSMC's 3nm-class process technology. Projected to debut in late 2026 with the RTX 60 series, Rubin will likely transition from TSMC's 4NP node utilized by Blackwell to the more advanced N3P process, delivering significant improvements in transistor density and power efficiency. As anticipated, the Rubin consumer GPU, powered by TSMC's 3nm node, might provide approximately 15% increased transistor density compared to the 4nm process used for RTX 50 series GPUs. This transition enables TSMC to deliver a claimed 10-15% performance improvement at equivalent power consumption, or offer a 20-30% power reduction at equivalent performance levels. Consumer variants will likely follow the pattern seen in Blackwell and Ada Lovelace. Laptop variants will use further cut-down dies or lower TDP (Max-Q) implementations. Since Nvidia is continually shifting die cut-downs between generations, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly which might end up turning into a specific GPU class. Data center Rubin dies are targeting up to 1,800W per AI chip at the highest configuration. This is an extrapolation from Blackwell and Ada Lovelace scaling, with increased efficiency due to being powered by a 3nm node. Nvidia has confirmed that Rubin will use HBM4 in the data center. However, memory configurations for consumer Rubin GPUs are expected to utilize faster GDDR7 variants or potentially introduce GDDR7X memory technology, offering substantial bandwidth improvements over current GDDR7 implementations. There is no official indication that Rubin is data center-only; Nvidia's executive statements and annual release cadence strongly point toward the lineup's release. Rubin production is on track for H2 2026, per official Nvidia statements and refuted delay rumors. Following Rubin, there is no official confirmation about the consumer implementation of future architectures announced at GTC 2025, as Nvidia is traditionally an enterprise-first company. However, the architectures (Rubin Ultra and Feynman) may be used in consumer GPUs. Feynman, like Volta (2017), may remain data center-only, but all current Nvidia statements suggest consumer implementations are planned. At the data center level, this architecture implements quad-die GPU configurations within single packages, dramatically increasing computational density. Consumer implementations will likely utilize cost-optimized packaging approaches while maintaining the performance advantages of multi-die, or chiplet architectures. The gate-all-around field-effect transistor (GAAFET) technology implementation in TSMC's 2nm variant, expected for Rubin Ultra and possibly Feynman, represents a significant departure from FinFET designs, offering enhanced optimization flexibility for either performance or efficiency targets. Data center implementations of Rubin Ultra are currently planned to have HBM4/HBM4e memory, but it is unlikely that HBM will end up being the VRAM type used in consumer GPUs based on the Rubin Ultra and Feynman architectures. Feynman is the company's most advanced GPU generation currently planned. Be sure to take these dates with a dose of salt, as nothing is confirmed until Nvidia itself says so. AMD's primary goal this generation was to target the mainstream with GPUs, in quantity, that were both affordable and performed well. AMD also elected not to introduce any enthusiast-class GPUs with RDNA 4. Codenames are not yet public, but technical documentation references “Next-Gen RDNA” under the “Growth Driver” umbrella. AMD's discrete GPU strategy beyond the current RDNA 4 (RX 9000 series) generation centers on a significant architectural transition, moving from the established Radeon DNA (RDNA) lineage towards a potentially unified architecture, internally designated GFX13. Crucially, AMD has publicly confirmed the development of an architecture following RDNA 4 during its Financial Analyst Day 2022 and subsequent roadmap updates, though specific branding (RDNA 5 vs. UDNA) remains officially unclarified. While AMD roadmaps historically labeled this successor "RDNA 5," current industry reports suggest a potential rebranding to "UDNA" (Unified DNA). A unified UDNA architecture aims to simplify the software stack (particularly ROCm), improve memory optimization consistency, and enhance forward/backward compatibility across the products, from laptops to servers. AMD aims to streamline development, hardware design, and software optimization by adopting a consistent core Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) design reminiscent of the pre-RDNA Graphics Core Next (GCN) lineage, enabling compatibility across consumer gaming, AI workloads, and professional compute workloads alike. Crucially, UDNA is expected to be fabricated on TSMC's 3nm-class manufacturing node (N3 or N3E). This will represent a substantial leap in transistor density and power efficiency over RDNA 4's 5nm process node. AMD has publicly stated that improving ray tracing performance is a core focus for future generations. The UDNA architecture may also see AMD shift back from monolithic to a chiplet-based design, optimizing manufacturing yields and enabling finer die cutdowns. Potentially using this, can expect a range from 96 CUs all the way down to 32 CUs for UDNA, with GDDR7 memory being the VRAM technology of choice. Broader availability across desktop segments and mobile variants (RX 10000M series) might arrive in Q1-Q2 2027. We expect to hear official details on UDNA at AMD's 2025 Financial Analyst Day in November 2025. Despite some teething issues, these GPUs were surprisingly capable, affordable, and generously equipped with 12GB/10GB of VRAM, capacities that are unheard of in the $250 market. Intel has officially established its commitment to discrete graphics beyond the current Battlemage generation, with Co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus confirming at CES 2025 that Intel remains "very committed to the discrete graphics market" and will "continue to make strategic investments". With the Battlemage (Xe2 architecture) now deployed, Intel's roadmap extends through the Xe3 "Celestial" and Xe4 "Druid" architectures, representing significant steps in Intel's GPU design and manufacturing strategy. Intel Fellow Tom Petersen confirmed in December 2024 that the Xe3 Celestial architecture has been finalized, with hardware design locked and the development team transitioning to Xe4 development. Intel has not disclosed full architectural details, but Xe3 builds on Xe2's vector engines with projected refinements in compute throughput and cache hierarchies. Celestial has progressed to pre-silicon validation as of May 2025, with Intel's OEM partners conducting virtual GPU testing for firmware development. Based on Intel's validation timeline, Celestial is expected to enter volume production by late 2025 or early 2026. Discrete Celestial GPUs are not expected until after the architecture debuts in integrated form within Panther Lake mobile CPUs. Based on typical development cycles, volume production of discrete Celestial GPUs might not begin until late 2026, with availability beginning in early 2027. However, this remains unconfirmed until Intel itself offers up more information. This architecture is projected as a modular redesign, potentially incorporating hybrid tiles for graphics and media, as hinted in Intel's June 2025 leaks on Nova Lake iGPUs using Xe3/Xe4 combinations, though discrete details are absent. Petersen also noted that Intel's development lifecycles can exceed one year, meaning that it's likely that we won't see this particular architecture materialize for desktop system use for quite some time, so don't hold your breath for Druid until 2026, or beyond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Built on a standard CMOS process and packed into three racks, Quantum Motion's silicon spin-qubit machine is ready to be tested. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A UK start-up says that it has built the world's first full-stack quantum computer using the same silicon chip technology used in laptops and phones, and it has already been installed at the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC). Quantum Motion, a 2017 spinout from University College London and Oxford, unveiled the three-rack system on September 15 as part of a government-backed push to commercialize scalable quantum hardware. Built entirely on a conventional CMOS process, the machine is being pitched as “quantum computing's silicon moment,” which can be fabricated in commercial foundries and dropped into existing server infrastructure. Unlike superconducting or photonic systems, Quantum Motion's system is built around a silicon spin-qubit processor, housed in a tileable architecture that is designed to scale. It also supports existing software frameworks like Qiskit and Cirq, allowing developers to build and run quantum workloads without having to reinvent the tooling. But for all the talk of standard chips and data center form factors, the company hasn't revealed any data that actually demonstrates performance. There's also no confirmation of how — or whether — the system handles error mitigation or connectivity scaling, the key hurdles facing every current quantum platform. Oxford Ionics installed a trapped-ion setup earlier this year, and several other UK projects are contributing hardware and firmware under the national program. What Quantum Motion is claiming is not first-to-ship, but first to build a full-stack quantum machine entirely using standard silicon CMOS manufacturing, and to fit the whole thing into a datacenter-friendly rack footprint. Getting that down to three racks, including the dilution fridge, is a notable engineering win. But without published specs or real workloads, it's impossible to know how far the platform goes beyond being a neat demonstration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Travis Day regrets being so strict with his ex-partner about never sleeping in the same bed. “She was not happy and really hated having to go back to her place,” says Day, now a human design coach with 11,000 followers on Instagram. He didn't know how much the “auric distancing” bothered her, he says, “until she finally expressed it when we were breaking up.” The mystical, mechanical inner-discovery system turned Day's life around when he spontaneously received a reading on a beach just outside of LA in August 2020. He was at a financial and emotional “rock bottom” amid the failure of his “beachproof” dog accessory brand, but that initial personality analysis represented “the first time someone actually saw me.” It might not be long before the phrase, “that's so mani-gen” is as common, in certain circles, as “that's so Leo.” Some human design coaches have more than 100,000 followers on social media, offering people advice on everything from love lives to how to get rich. There are coaching programs and entire centers dedicated to learning and teaching the practice as retreats are cropping up in wellness hot spots from Puerto Escondido, Mexico, to Sofia, Bulgaria. Readings can cost hundreds of dollars; TikTok creator Kendra Hilty, who went viral after documenting how she fell in love with her psychiatrist, received $3,000 for three months of weekly human design readings, according to The Cut. Even as I'm writing this article, I pass a bookstore in Vancouver, British Columbia, with a human design book prominently displayed in its front window. The buzz around this radical system has led people to take life-changing decisions like ending their marriages or moving countries after single readings, which can also be conducted with ChatGPT. But he tells WIRED there are culty elements in the ecosystem of training connected to this “new astrology.” After several promising dates with singer Aanu Adewole, Justus starts to doubt the message from his spleen, noting it is “silent.” He dumps Adewole after she appears reluctant to sing for him and confesses that if her mother vetoed him she would drop him. “I have to follow my spleen,” Justus tells her. “It breaks my heart to tell you I'm breaking up with you.” (It later emerged that another woman may have been pregnant with Justus' child during the filming of the series and that he had omitted to mention it. In a statement Justus provided to the show for its reunion episode, he said: “2025 has been life-changing as I embrace the joy of becoming a father.”) Justus' seemingly strict adherence to his human design is not an anomaly. But Redditors report being scared to “decondition” and make the drastic lifestyle changes required to bring them into greater accordance with their design. Others claim to have gone to extremes in attempts to live fully in accordance with the teachings and what Day describes as “not self-conditioning forces.” These supposedly show up when one is out of alignment with their design and can include frustration, anger, bitterness, or disappointment. In an Instagram reel, one human design advocate promotes the consumption of “single-ingredient foods” such as polenta to live within their design. Erin Claire Jones, a human design coach with 172,000 followers on Instagram, says the detail in human design assessments is also part of its appeal. “I've seen the most skeptical people fall in love with it because it's practical, but it's also so specific,” she says, noting the rise of human design from the extreme fringes toward the mainstream in recent years reflects an increasing collective desire to “learn about ourselves,” warts and all. Over the past decade Jones has sold 43,000 personalized design guides, mostly for $95 each, conducted sessions with 4,000 people, and trained another 1,500 in how to give readings, en route to publishing the book How Do You Choose? She helps people use human design within their own families to help foster more harmonious relations, and also does so herself. “My daughters both have entirely different designs than mine. Human design was born in 1987 when Canadian former advertising executive Robert Krakower, a rumored ketamine enthusiast who had been living like a hippie and residing in a dilapidated casita in Ibiza, claimed to have had an intense transcendental encounter with “the voice” over the course of eight days. As origin myths go, his makes Moses at the burning bush sound almost low-key. Then Krakower claimed he started gushing with sweat from head to toe. He said he was told to burn a combination of herbs from the shelves and that a series of cosmic revelations ensued, spanning the big bang, the nature of being, the “crystals of consciousness,” and “rave cosmology,” a far-out prophecy he went on to make, predicting alien influence in a prophesied influx of disabled and mute children born in or after 2027. In accordance with Krakower's prophecy, Richard Beaumont, the director of Human Design UK, who worked closely with Krakower for years before his death, has already purchased the domain name Silentbabies.com. “There's going to be a new species coming in February 2027,” he says, sipping a glass of white wine in front of a human design chart over Zoom from his home in the west of England. Human design is not a belief system, says Beaumont, who has 38,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel. Day—who recently founded a “projector only” online community dedicated to “deconditioning” and other activities like singles nights—claims that some leading figures in the movement can be incredibly prescriptive. “I had never seen so many unhappy, angry people,” he recalls. “People get really attached to making it into rules and then saying, ‘This is what you can do, and this is what you can't do based on your design. '” It's a “fucking Wild West,” Day says of the sprawling human design industry. At the same time, he admits that giving human design readings for $250 each has turned his fortunes around; he does at least three readings per week, in addition to offering other services. Perhaps my fortunes will change, too, if I live more in accordance with whatever my design is, following a recent split which left me soul-searching. I give Day my time and date of birth and the name of the city where I was born, just like with a Zodiac reading, and he inputs the information into a website that conjures a diamond-shaped “bodygraph” which, he says, reveals a distinct numeric genetic code underpinning my “manifesting generator” personality. “Your mind will say you always need to be looking for love and direction, [but] you're super sensitive to others' frequencies,” fellow singleton Day tells me.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Google has laid off over 200 contractors who worked on improving its AI product offerings, Gemini, and search AI overviews, according to Wired. Some were told it was part of a "ramp-down" on the project they were working on, but others believe it was due to complaints made over pay and working conditions. These laid-off contractors join hundreds of other AI-related contractors who have been fired from other major AI firms like xAI and Meta in recent months. For the first half of 2025, AI growth was everywhere, and all the major companies were spending big to try to get ahead. Per the report, workers on the 'super rater' program were required to have either a PhD or a master's, and were tasked with moderating AI responses. Google seemingly didn't need that expertise any longer, though. It has reportedly been working on developing an AI model for rating AI responses, though it's not clear if that's matured enough to take over what the human raters were doing. The Wired report even cites some workers worried "they are being set up to replace themselves." Two have filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board. AI developmental companies have been repeatedly accused of using underpaid human workers to classify AI data and rate responses to improve their services. The company Meta invested almost $15 billion to poach their CEO, ScaleAI, was accused of using low-paid workers in Southeast Asian countries to build out its data annotation services. After Meta bought a 49% stake in the company, over 200 of its staff were cut. Just a few days ago, xAI also announced it was laying off around a third of its data annotation team, amounting to over 500 workers. However, unlike Google, company messaging suggests this is to pivot towards more specialist AI trainers. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. That may mean employment opportunities for some of the AI trainers Google let go, but it does make it clear what a shaky industry this is to get into. The big AI developers don't appear to have a coherent strategy for how to improve their products in the near term and are taking different approaches in doing so. All the firings come in stark contrast to the major AI developer hiring sprees that companies like Meta went on earlier this year. While low-paid data annotators may have limited employment prospects at the big firms, there is less concern over hiring big names and rising stars for hundreds of millions of dollars.
