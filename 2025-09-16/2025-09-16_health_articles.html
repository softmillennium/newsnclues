                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A diet focused on healthy plant-based foods may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, according to a new study by Solomon Sowah and colleagues from the MRC Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, published September 16th in the open-access journal PLOS Medicine. Growing research shows that unhealthy foods not only impact your health but are also detrimental to the environment. Data on the impact of these types of diets show inconsistent findings, and there is little epidemiological data specifically examining the effect of the PHD on type 2 diabetes or environmental factors, such as greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, researchers analyzed dietary data from more than 23,000 people in the UK taken at three timepoints across 20 years. They found that higher adherence to the PHD was associated with lower incidence of type 2 diabetes-participants in the top fifth of adherence had a 32% lower incidence of type 2 diabetes compared to those in the bottom fifth. Higher adherence to the PHD was also associated with lower greenhouse emissions-among those in the top fifth of adherence, greenhouse gas emissions were 18% lower compared to those in the bottom fifth. Dr. Solomon Sowah says, "Our motivation for this study was to address the limited evidence regarding the association between the planetary health diet and both type 2 diabetes incidence and greenhouse gas emissions in a European population. These findings provide support for the potential of the planetary health diet to make a meaningful contribution to help prevent type 2 diabetes. What's more is that eating in line with the planetary health diet is also linked with a lower environmental impact. So, it offers a win-win to potentially help improve both human and planetary health. Action will be needed from all players, including individuals and policy makers to enable food consumption aligned with this dietary approach."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Research led by the Transforming and Expanding Access to Mental Health Care Universally in Pediatrics (TEAM UP) Scaling and Sustainability Center of Boston Medical Center (BMC) finds that children who receive behavioral health services delivered through the TEAM UP Model™ of integrated behavioral health care have fewer behavioral health symptoms. Several prior studies demonstrate that TEAM UP improves access to behavioral services for kids seen in pediatrics. This study takes the next step: we demonstrated that when they use TEAM UP's behavioral health services, kids and their parents or caregivers report fewer symptoms over time." R. Christopher Sheldrick, PhD, research and evaluation co-director of TEAM UP at BMC and senior author of this study Co-developed with pediatric practices, the model includes a fully integrated multidisciplinary care team-behavioral health clinicians, community health workers, and primary care providers -to promote healthy development and ensure early identification of behavioral health issues. Led by Jihye Kim, PhD, the observational study included 942 children aged 4 to 18 with an identified behavioral health concern at four Massachusetts federally qualified health centers that implemented the TEAM UP model. The team measured children's behavioral health symptoms before and after they received behavioral health treatment -- which included encounters with behavioral health clinicians or medications prescribed by their primary care providers --using the PSC-17, a common screening tool for psychosocial symptoms in pediatrics. "TEAM UP practices see first-hand the success of integrating mental and physical healthcare in a single, convenient setting," notes Megan Bair-Merritt, MD, MSCE, Chief Scientific Officer for BMC Health System and past director of TEAM UP's research team. "TEAM UP's approach of fully integrating behavioral health care into pediatric primary care not only addresses challenges children face in accessing mental health services but also seems to provide significant symptom improvement." TEAM UP is currently expanding its services across Massachusetts and beyond. The Center is also working with local partners in New York City and Atlanta, Georgia, to begin to scale the model nationally.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article is based on a poster originally authored by Hsuan Chou, Amy Craster, Kayleigh Arthur, Billy Boyle, Matt Kerr, Eli F. Kelley, Glenn M. Stewart, Courtney M. Wheatley, Jesse Schwartz, Catlin C. Fermoyle, Briana L. Ziegler, Kay A. Johnson, Paul Robach, Patrick Basset, Huw Davies, Amine Khider, and Bruce D. Johnson. Ultramarathon running induces significant physiological stress, particularly in the pulmonary and metabolic systems.1 While blood-based biomarkers have been utilized to monitor these changes, repeated blood sampling can be invasive, uncomfortable, and impractical in field settings. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath offer a non-invasive alternative for assessing systemic metabolic and physiological responses. Previous studies have demonstrated alterations in breath VOC profiles following ultramarathon events, suggesting their potential as biomarkers of exercise-induced stress and adaptation.2 Thirty-two healthy participants in the 2019 UTMB ultramarathon (171 km, approximately 10,000 m ascent) underwent assessments 24–72 hours before and 1–4 hours after the race. Tests included blood sampling, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide measurement, transthoracic ultrasound, breath VOC collection (ReCIVA®, Owlstone Medical), and submaximal cycling to assess lung diffusion (DLco/DLno, Dmco, Vc). Clinical and respiratory parameters were measured using portable devices following ATS/ERS guidelines. Breath samples (n = 48 from 24 subjects) were analyzed pre- and post-race without fasting requirements. Data was analyzed in Python using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and Spearman's correlation; coefficients greater than 0.7 were considered strong, while those between 0.5 and 0.7 were deemed moderate. The Owlstone breath collection system includes: CASPER – a filtered air supply unit, which provides air scrubbed of background VOCs to patients via the ReCIVA, ReCIVA – a reliable and reproducible non-invasive breath sample collection unit, which preferentially collects alveolar breath fraction identified using pressure tracing and selected for with two pumps, and lastly Breath Biopsy Collect – which connects to and operates the ReCIVA, enabling collection of specific breath fractions and monitoring patient breathing in real-time. Post-race clinical data revealed a modest decline in pulmonary function, with significant reductions in vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), as expected following exhaustive exercise.3 Correlation and network analyses highlighted strengthening associations between respiratory parameters post-race (see Table 1). However, despite declines in absolute values, the post-race strengthening of these associations suggests that exhaustive exercise enhances the coupling between expiratory effort and lung function. Correlation analysis between clinical variables in pre- and post-race samples. All variables here are at least moderately correlated (r >0.5) with each other. FVC – Forced Vital Capacity, VC – Vital Capacity, FEV1 – Forced Expiratory Volume in one second, MIPS – Maximal Inspiratory Pressures, MEPS – Maximal Expiratory Pressure, BUN – Blood Urea Nitrogen, Glu – Blood glucose, cTnI – Cardiac Troponin I, CK-MB – Creatine Kinase-MB isoform. Correlation with clinical metadata and VOCs in post-race samples. Unless indicated within a correlation coeffcient, all correlations presented are moderate (0.5-0.7). Given the increased post-race correlations between respiratory function and metabolic parameters, we further investigated associations between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and respiratory measures. A total of 63 VOCs were found to change significantly (p < 0.05) between pre- and post-race samples, with several being gut-derived, including 2,3-butanediol, which showed a significant increase in post-race samples. Correlation with clinical metadata between FEV1 and VOC 2,3-butanediol in post-race samples. Notably, 2,3-butanediol demonstrated a positive correlation with both VC (r = 0.53) and FEV1 (r = 0.63), but only in post-race samples, as shown in Figure 3. As a product of anaerobic glucose fermentation by gut microbiota, this compound's emergent association with respiratory parameters may reflect increased gut–lung axis activity following exhaustive exercise. While the mechanisms underlying this correlation remain to be fully elucidated, previous work has suggested that altered gut barrier integrity or shifts in microbial fermentation activity during exercise could be contributing factors.4,5 The potential of breath VOCs, such as 2,3-butanediol, to enhance our understanding of physiological adaptation to exercise warrants further investigation. These findings indicate that exhaustive exercise not only modifies lung function but may also impact microbial metabolism, as evidenced by the emergence of post-race correlations between respiratory parameters and gut-derived VOCs such as 2,3-butanediol. This study represents the first demonstration of correlations between exhaled breath VOCs and clinical respiratory variables within the context of an ultramarathon. Collectively, this data underscores the potential of breath-based biomarkers for monitoring physiological strain and recovery, with significant implications for performance optimization and athlete health assessment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article is based on a poster originally authored by R. Pinto-Lopes, M. Kerr, B. Boyle, G. PJMullan, and K Thompson. Intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO) is characterized by an excessive presence of methane-producing archaea in the gastrointestinal tract and is associated with symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, and constipation.1 However, these evaluations necessitate patient preparation and are constrained by the limited number of breath samples collected during the testing process. The study discussed here evaluates the OMED Health® Breath Analyzer for its capacity to accurately measure breath methane and hydrogen. Preliminary data illustrating its potential for diagnosing and longitudinally monitoring treatment responses in IMO within a real-world context is presented. The OMED Health® Breath Analyzer is a handheld device designed to measure hydrogen and methane concentrations in exhaled breath in real time. Data is recorded and displayed through a companion smartphone application (Figure 2). Each participant provided three breath samples, spaced three minutes apart, in the following order: in-clinic instrument, OMED Health® device, in-clinic instrument. To account for variations in absolute gas concentrations between samples, the two readings from the in-clinic instrument were averaged (AVG HMBT) and utilized for comparison. A subset of participants was evaluated for IMO (n = 24) and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO; n = 14) using the in-clinic HMBT instrument and the OMED Health® device. IMO was defined as any methane reading exceeding 10 ppm during the test, while SIBO was defined as a greater than 10 ppm increase in hydrogen within 65 minutes of lactulose ingestion (EU criterion). The OMED Health Breath Analyzer and companion mobile app provides a direct, real-time readout of breath hydrogen and methane levels. A total of 243 breath samples were collected from 54 participants, with complete data available for hydrogen and methane measurements from both devices. This data facilitated a direct comparison of hydrogen and methane concentrations between the OMED Health® Breath Analyzer and the gold-standard in-clinic HMBT instrument. Results demonstrated comparable error distributions for both gases. Diagnostic results for IMO and SIBO derived from the OMED Health® Breath Analyzer were compared against those from the in-clinic HMBT instrument, revealing greater than 90 % concordance. High concordance was observed, with only one false positive for IMO and one false negative for SIBO identified. Following the initiation of herbal antimicrobial therapy on June 13, methane levels decreased from 35.7 ppm to 2.64 ppm over a two-week period. Subsequent continuous, non-fasting monitoring revealed a rebound in methane levels, resulting in a second IMO-positive diagnosis on July 16, with an average of 24.3 ± 3.79 ppm. A follow-up course of antibiotics successfully reduced methane levels from 32.8 ppm to 3.56 ppm within two weeks, after which the patient reported a negative result for IMO. By September, methane levels remained consistently low at 3.07 ± 0.94 ppm. A) Comparison of average hydrogen and methane values from the HMBT (mean of two consecutive samples) with corresponding OMED Health® Breath Analyzer measurements, including error distributions. B) Diagnostic performance of the OMED Health® Breath Analyzer compared to gold-standard HMBT testing for IMO and SIBO. High concordance was observed, with >90 % accuracy for both diagnoses (per EU criteria). C) Daily average breath methane levels in Patient A before and after treatment 1, with recurrence and resolution following treatment 2. Longitudinal sampling is increasingly recognized for its ability to facilitate real-time analysis and establish personalized baselines, thereby supporting a transition from static to continuous monitoring in clinical care. This approach is exemplified by the evolution from fingerstick blood sampling to continuous glucose monitoring in diabetes management. When applied to breath analysis, the OMED Health® Breath Analyzer enables efficient detection and real-time monitoring of treatment responses in gastrointestinal conditions such as IMO. In the study discussed here, the device demonstrated over 90 % diagnostic concordance with the gold standard in-clinic Hydrogen Methane Breath Test (HMBT) for both IMO and Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO), underscoring its potential clinical utility. Beyond IMO, breath methane monitoring shows promise in broader contexts, including gut motility, inflammatory regulation, and metabolic health.4 These findings emphasize the value of at-home breath testing conducted under clinical guidance to ensure accurate interpretation and optimized treatment outcomes.

A recent report from the Global Burden of Disease estimated that 387,000 lung cancer deaths in 2013 (24% of all lung cancer deaths) were attributable to outdoor air pollution. Additionally, air pollution is associated with an increased risk of mortality from ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infections. Notably, the particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) was identified as the fifth-ranking risk factor for mortality in 2015. Despite the acknowledged significance of air pollution exposure as a risk factor for major causes of death at the population level, the effects of particulate matter exposure at the individual level remain inadequately understood. Controlled exposure studies serve as a valuable approach to elucidate the impacts of particulate exposure and explore acute inflammation. Lung inflammation, a response to pollutants, releases volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath, which may act as non-invasive markers for assessing inflammation. The study discussed here aimed to identify breath markers associated with acute lung inflammation induced by exposure to 2.5 µm particulate matter (PM2.5) in healthy individuals. The study recruited 20 healthy individuals (10 males and 10 females, aged 18-45), all of whom were non-smokers. The study employed a double-blinded crossover design. Participants underwent two separate exposure sessions in the UBC Air Pollution Exposure Lab booth: 300 μg/m3 of PM2.5 from a diesel engine and filtered air (sham), with a minimum spacing of six weeks between exposures. Participants were randomized and blinded to the order of exposure. Figure 1 presents a representative flowchart of the study design. Respiratory droplet samples were obtained at three time points: baseline before exposure, 3 hours post-exposure, and 24 hours post-exposure. Samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), with both untargeted and targeted analyses conducted. PCA score plot of exhaled breath and blank samples: (A) consisting of 33 targeted VOCs (Table 1) and (B) 900 VOCs from untargeted analysis. Clear separation between breath samples and ambient blanks was demonstrated for both targeted and untargeted analysis. ANOVA Simultaneous Component Analysis of Targeted VOC Data in Exhaled Breath Following Exposure 1: Sham and Exposure 2: Diesel. (A) Score plot of the first principal component (PC1), explaining 35.16 % of the variance, across seven time points. This plot highlights the temporal response of VOCs to sham (Exposure 1) and diesel, PM2.5 (Exposure 2) exposures. Key VOCs such as decane, hexadecane, 1-propanol, p-xylene, 3methylthiophene, and hexane have significant loadings on PC1, indicating their strong association with exposure effects. This plot shows further differentiation between the exposures, with VOCs like pentanal, heptanal, and decanal contributing significantly to the observed variance. ANOVA Simultaneous Component Analysis of Untargeted VOC Data in Exhaled Breath Following Exposure 1: Sham and Exposure 2: Diesel. (A) Score plot of the first principal component (PC1), which explains 44.02 % of the variance, across seven time points. This figure captures the primary response of VOC profiles to the sham (Exposure 1) and diesel (Exposure 2), with VOCs such as VOC472, VOC235, and VOC186 contributing heavily to this variance. VOCs such as VOC33, VOC310, and VOC229 are highlighted for their significant loadings on PC2, indicating their potential role in distinguishing the exposure effects. Data analysis indicated a significant effect of exposure type, along with a notable interaction between post-exposure time and exposure type. Targeted analysis revealed a significant increase in inflammation-related compounds in individuals exposed to PM2.5 compared to controls. Furthermore, 12 VOCs significantly increased in the breath of the PM2.5 group, with levels diminishing in samples collected 24 hours post-exposure. The study presented here demonstrates that a distinct breath VOC profile can be detected in individuals exposed to PM2.5, suggesting that breath VOCs may serve as indicators of acute airway inflammation and assist in assessing respiratory diseases related to air pollution.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have developed a smarter way to activate the immune system against cancer, potentially making treatments safer and more precise. The research focuses on a powerful pathway inside our cells known as STING. Drugs that activate this pathway have shown promise in cancer therapy, but until now, they faced a major problem: if switched on in healthy tissues, they can cause harmful and sometimes dangerous side effects. To solve this problem, researchers from the University of Cambridge designed a two-part 'prodrug' system, made of two harmless components that only activate when they meet in a tumour. One component of the drug was 'caged' so that it remains inactive until it encounters a tumour-specific enzyme called β-glucuronidase, which is rarely found in healthy tissue. "This is like sending two safe packages into the body that only unlock and combine when they meet the tumour's unique chemistry," said Professor Gonçalo Bernardes from Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, who led the research. Laboratory experiments showed that the two drug components have almost no activity on their own. But when they met in tumour conditions, the active compound formed and successfully triggered STING at very low concentrations. Their results are reported in the journal Nature Chemistry. This level of precision represents a major advance for STING-based therapies, which have previously struggled to distinguish between healthy and cancerous tissues. By using a simple chemical design, the Cambridge team achieved targeted activation of the immune system without relying on complex or artificial reactions. Beyond cancer, the researchers believe this method could inspire a new class of precision medicines. The concept of safe, separate components that only form active drugs at the disease site could be applied to other illnesses where strong drugs must be delivered safely. This discovery is exciting not only for cancer treatment, but also as a new way of thinking about how we make medicines safer and more precise."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Depression is one of the most common mental health challenges, but its early signs are often overlooked. However, whether mild depression or subthreshold depression (StD) (a mild state of depressive symptoms that does not meet the criteria for diagnosis but is a risk factor for developing depression) is associated with changes in facial expressions remains unknown. In light of this, Associate Professor Eriko Sugimori and doctoral student Mayu Yamaguchi from the Faculty of Human Sciences, Waseda University, Japan, have now investigated changes in facial expression in Japanese undergraduates using facial data and artificial intelligence. "As concerns around mental well-being have been rising, I wanted to explore how subtle non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions, shape social impressions and reflect mental health using artificial intelligence-based facial analysis," says Sugimori. The researchers asked 64 Japanese university students to record short self-introduction videos. Another group of 63 students then rated how expressive, friendly, natural, or likeable the speakers appeared. Students who reported subthreshold depressive symptoms were rated by their peers as less friendly, expressive, and likable. Interestingly, they were not judged as more stiff, fake, or nervous. This suggests that StD does not make people appear overtly negative but rather tones down their positive expressivity. Artificial intelligence analysis revealed specific patterns of eye and mouth movements, such as the inner brow raiser, upper lid raiser, lip stretcher, and mouth-opening actions that were more frequent in participants with StD. These subtle muscle movements were strongly linked to depression scores, even though they were too fine for untrained observers to pick up on. The researchers note that their study was conducted with Japanese students, an important consideration given that cultural norms influence how people express emotions. The proposed approach could be used in mental health technology, digital health platforms, or employee wellness programs to monitor psychological well-being efficiently. "Overall, our study provides a novel, accessible, and non-invasive artificial intelligence-based facial analysis tool for early detection of depression (before the appearance of clinical symptoms), enabling early interventions and timely care of mental health," concludes Sugimori.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Receptor proteins, expressed on the cell surface or within the cell, bind to different signaling molecules, known as ligands, initiating cellular responses. Taste receptors, expressed in oral tissues, interact with tastants, the molecules responsible for the sensation of taste. Thus, T2Rs might play a crucial role in maintaining the gut-brain axis. 25 types of human T2Rs have been identified to date. However, due to certain complexities, the structure of most of these receptors is not yet elucidated. In recent times, AI-based prediction models have been used to understand protein structure accurately. Previously, a Nobel Prize-winning artificial intelligence (AI)-based model, AlphaFold2 (AF2), was utilized to decipher the structures of T2Rs. Hence, understanding the structure can provide a better insight into its function," mentioned Prof. Osakabe as the main motivation behind this study. The paper was made available online on July 14, 2025, and was published in Volume 11 of the journal Current Research in Food Science on July 22, 2025. This article has been co-authored by Takafumi Shimizu and Rio Ohno, from Shibaura Institute of Technology, and Professor Vittorio Calabrese, from the University of Catania. For comparison, previously generated AF2 prediction data were retrieved from the AlphaFold database. Various software tools were employed for structure visualization, alignment, and accuracy assessment. The analysis revealed that AF3 provided consistently more accurate structural predictions than AF2. For T2R14, predictions were benchmarked against 115 cryo-EM structures, and AF3 showed the higher agreement with experimental data. Similarly, for T2R46, comparisons with three experimentally resolved structures confirmed that AF3 achieved the closest match in all cases. "Clustering of proteins is based on their structural similarity and dissimilarity. Based on our findings, we divided the T2Rs into three different clusters," states Prof. Osakabe. These patterns may help researchers understand how different T2Rs function and why certain receptors respond to specific compounds. The structure of T2Rs probably allows them to recognize the thousands of different bitter substances via interaction with another taste receptor-specific G protein, α-gustducin. "With the receptors' involvement in detecting bitter tastants and maintaining the gut-brain axis, this can play an important role in health and pharmaceutical-based research, specifically targeting lifestyle diseases like diabetes," mentioned Prof. Osakabe, explaining the importance of this study. Further research, focusing on the relation between sequence and structure of the T2Rs and how individual perception of taste varies, will help in a more comprehensive understanding of T2R function.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three months of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy reduced fatigue and improved cardiovascular markers in people living with HIV and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), with benefits similar to those observed in individuals without HIV infection. Therefore, clinicians treating PLWH should consider routinely screening for OSA and, if found, encourage treatment,” the authors wrote. The study was led by David L. Berry, BS, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep Medicine & Physiology, University of California, San Diego. It was published online on August 26, 2025, in the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes. Protocol adjustments during the COVID pandemic required reliance on self-reported adherence to PAP instead of objective data. Additionally, the pandemic may have discouraged participation of people living with HIV who had greater comorbidities, potentially affecting the study's generalizability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When someone has a stroke - a leading worldwide cause of death and disability - time is of the essence. Almost nine out of 10 cases are ischemic strokes, caused by restricted blood flow in the brain, and the current gold-standard treatment that breaks up blood clots must be delivered within four and a half hours of symptoms appearing. Researchers are on the hunt for ways to extend that ticking clock and enable better stroke recovery. One promising prospect is an experimental stem cell therapy to help repair damaged brain tissue, co-developed by scientists at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich in Switzerland. A study in the journal Nature Communications showed that a stem cell transplant performed one week after an ischemic stroke in mice led to recovery. There are a lot of patients who cannot get the acute treatment, and their blood vessels remain blocked. If we can bring this treatment to the clinic in the future, it may help patients who have long-term symptoms or large strokes see recovery." Ruslan Rust, PhD, co-corresponding author, assistant professor of research physiology and neuroscience at the Keck School of Medicine Rust and his colleagues reprogrammed human blood cells into neural stem cells - which can mature into neurons - and transplanted them into the damaged brain tissue of mice that had strokes. After five weeks, the researchers compared their recovery to a group of mice from the same litter that had strokes but underwent surgery without transplantation. The transplant recipients' brains had less inflammation, more growth of neurons and blood vessels, and more connectivity among neurons than the brains of the mice that did not receive transplanted cells. The treated mice also had less leakage from the blood-brain barrier, which is important for normal brain function and acts as a filter to keep harmful substances out of the brain. "Recovery can be hard to determine in mice, so we needed to see these little differences," Rust said. "The unbiased view we got through this deep learning tool gave us a lot more detail about this complex process." By the end of the study, their gait also improved significantly compared to mice that received a sham surgery. When the researchers looked at which types of cells died off due to stroke, they found roughly a 50% reduction in neurons that secrete gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which decreases activity in the brain cells to which it binds. They found strong activity in several signaling pathways that were shown in prior studies to be associated with regenerating neurons, forming connections between neurons, and guiding how neurons branch out. "Mechanistic insight can be quite important if we seek to inform new therapies or improve emerging ones," Rust said. "Understanding the mechanisms allows us to think about adapting a drug that regulates them - perhaps one that's already clinically approved for a different disease. It could open up a whole new wave of therapies." "If we can help people by transplanting stem cells into a human stroke patient, we want the cells to be there for the rest of their life," Rust said. "So our aim would be to look across the whole lifetime of a mouse and see what happens with the cells, and also see whether this recovery is sustained or even improves." Neural xenografts contribute to long-term recovery in stroke via molecular graft-host crosstalk. Discover how real-time Raman monitoring enhances API control and quality during hot melt extrusion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study led by investigators at Mass General Brigham finds that adding novel weight loss GLP-1 drugs semaglutide and tirzepatide to usual care represents a cost-effective treatment strategy for people with knee osteoarthritis and obesity, with tirzepatide providing greater health benefits at lower cost compared to semaglutide. Weight loss can relieve joint pain, but semaglutide and tirzepatide are expensive and most insurance plans don't cover weight loss medications. This means that many patients can't afford these medications. It gives payers and policymakers the data they need to make informed coverage decisions and improve access to these weight loss treatments. Elena Losina, PhD, senior author, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital The investigators used OApol, a validated and widely published computer simulation model, to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the two GLP-1 drugs as well as two other common weight loss interventions: bariatric surgery and lifestyle modifications. They found that tirzepatide offered somewhat better value than semaglutide and would be the preferred option between the two drugs for most patients. For eligible and willing patients, bariatric surgery, which provides sustained benefits, may be the best option from a clinical and economic perspective. Limitations of this analysis include its reliance on data integrated from multiple sources. In addition, conducting this study required researchers to make assumptions about the duration of time patients would remain on these medications, which may affect the findings. "Osteoarthritis substantially reduces quality of life due to debilitating pain and limited mobility. Obesity has been shown to shorten life expectancy," said Losina. "Offering these drugs to patients with knee osteoarthritis and obesity improves both measures." Discover how real-time Raman monitoring enhances API control and quality during hot melt extrusion.
