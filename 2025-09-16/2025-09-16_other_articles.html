                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When someone asks me which US state is worth visiting, West Virginia is one of the first that comes to mind. A fantastic excursion in the New River Gorge left a strong impression on me, as did the state's winding country roads. As a travel writer, I also love the state's new tourism projects. Last year, I covered a series of pre-planned road trips, called Mountain Rides, released by the state tourism board. That same year, they also released a Halloween-themed road trip itinerary that covers the state's 21 spookiest locations, called the Paranormal Trail. It's back again in 2025—and it's easier than ever to join thanks to their unique 2025 West Virginia Paranormal Trail Passport. Here's how to take part in the 2025 West Virginia Paranormal Trail. Starting on October 1, 2025, you can visit 21 locations around the state. Using geolocation tools, you can confirm your presence with a ‘check-in' feature. Some locations unlock certain rewards, like the stickers and keychains listed above. The grand prize for those who visit all 21 locations is a personalized lantern. All prizes are exclusive to the 2025 Paranormal Trail. You'll receive an email from the West Virginia Department of Tourism to confirm your receipt of exclusive gifts and to get a delivery address. You'll be prompted to enter your information, including an email and phone number. Both will help the state's tourism department track you down and deliver your gifts. You'll receive an email with instructions on how to get started. It includes funky icons that showcase West Virginia's 21 haunted locations on the trail. You can click on each to get a quick rundown of the legends and locations in question. Many locations are only a short drive away, meaning you can still take part in the Paranormal Trail and earn a few prizes even if you don't spend a whole weekend crisscrossing the state to visit each site.

Earth is pretty special, and as far as we know, the only place in the universe with life. There are billions upon billions of planets in the Milky Way alone; shouldn't life be common? Some new work argues that the answer is: pretty rare. Statistically, there might be just a handful of civilizations in the galaxy. The closest might be 33,000 light-years away, and that civilization is at least 280,000 years, if not millions of years old. On Earth, it took over 3 billion years for intelligent life to evolve. The planet went from having at least 6 percent carbon dioxide in its atmosphere to a fraction of a percent, as more was trapped by tectonic plates. Maybe in one billion years, there won't be enough to make photosynthesis happen. Oxygen went up dramatically thanks to photosynthetic organisms, reaching today's level of 21 percent in an atmosphere dominated by nitrogen (78 percent). But for the smelting of metal, assuming that to be a crucial part of technology development, it can't be done if oxygen is below 18 percent. A planet with an atmosphere that starts at 10 percent carbon dioxide could have a stable biosphere for 4.2 billion years. Statistically, this data can tell us that if we want two civilizations to be alive at the same time, they would need to exist for at least 280,000 years. "For 10 civilisations to exist at the same time as ours, the average lifetime must be above 10 million years," says Scherf. "Although ETIs might be rare there is only one way to really find out and that is by searching for it," says Scherf. "If these searches find nothing, it makes our theory more likely, and if SETI does find something, then it will be one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs ever achieved as we would know that we are not alone in the universe."

India is more capable of influencing smaller nations both through incentives and potential punishment. The neighbours know this, often better than New Delhi.

This is an absurd conspiracy theory for more than one reason. First, it makes little logical sense: every one of the last several US administrations from Bill Clinton onwards was keen on building up India and ensuring that Indian power grew as a counter to China. While it was very likely that some of the US administrations would have possibly preferred a less ideologically troublesome India, the idea that this would lead them to subvert their own strategic interests vis-à-vis China suggests a somewhat crude understanding of how Washington pursues its priorities. Those who talk about it are either entirely ignorant of the complexity of bureaucratic politics or are seeking refuge in popular conspiratorial nonsense even when they should know better. It is ludicrous to imagine that there is some determined and synchronised core in any government that can direct national power to such specific objectives. This has always been the ambition of statesmen and even bureaucrats who set up coordination mechanisms such as the National Security Councils in many countries. Such agencies were set up precisely to coordinate policies because bureaucracies pull in different directions. But the experience of even such coordination agencies has generally been poor, and such coordination was rarely achieved in practice. There are indeed some celebrated successful cases of external intervention, such as the CIA operation to overthrow Iranian PM Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953 or the Soviet invasions of various Eastern European countries at several points. Despite years of effort, the US couldn't get rid of Cuba's Fidel Castro, just a few kilometres off the Florida coast, who thumbed his nose at Washington for decades. But this speaks to the advantages of regional dominance, an advantage for India too. Similarly, the Soviet client states in Central Europe chafed under Moscow's control only for as long as its power was sufficiently fearsome. Loss of regional dominance meant that Russia faced problems even in its own “near abroad”, but that is not a problem India faces today. In other words, the authors of such theories couldn't decide who to blame and so took a tout azimuts view rather than consider the more likely possibility that political and economic mismanagement by the Sheikh Hasina (Bangladesh) and KP Oli governments (Nepal) led to their overthrow. The results were bad for Indian interests, no doubt, but such bad outcomes are not always the result of deliberate designs by others. It is often the outcome of complicated political processes that no one controls. Seeing this as a planned outcome is giving one's adversaries far too much credit. More importantly, it ends up sometimes creating unnecessary adversaries. This is not India's fault, though that is obviously of little comfort to the strategists in New Delhi who have to deal with the fallout. This no doubt suggests a reflection of an official viewpoint that the government itself is unwilling to state publicly. Others in the region aren't fools, of course, so they'll take this as reflecting government views because it surely does. The problem is that this will undermine India's official hands-off stance, which is the correct and pragmatic view considering that we cannot predict how and in what way the situation will evolve. Neither New Delhi nor anyone else has the means to direct such political movements. External and even internal actors are basically passengers in a driverless vehicle and can only hope that the vehicle moves in a direction they want to go. Pragmatism requires dealing with all sides, including those one might disagree with, whereas a deeply ideological approach sees the world in terms of rigid friends and foes. Whether in dealing with US President Donald Trump or the Indian subcontinent region, such ideologised foreign policy is a danger because it introduces blinkers that limit one's strategic perspectives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eau Claire's Chad Lewis journeys from Bayfield's ghostly guestrooms to Two Harbors' sea-serpent sightings There is no end to tales about Lake Superior, from deeply spiritual creation stories of the people who first lived along its shores thousands of years ago, to that incredible fish that an annoying relative won't stop talking about. Many have a message or moral, but some defy explanation of occurrences on the “Big Lake” and can't be explained scientifically — or that can be, and we simply haven't figured it out. Lewis joined WPR's Robin Washington on “Morning Edition” to talk about stories he's collected in his latest book. Get trustworthy reporting and unique local stories from WPR delivered directly to your inbox. The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. Robin Washington: What makes these stories particular to Lake Superior, rather than being urban legends that are told about any body of water? I know you've searched for the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland, yet she apparently has cousins all over the world, including Lake Superior. People feel drawn to it, whether it's on a vacation or they feel like they just have to move there and live on the lake. And that's been going since the first Indigenous peoples that set up camps around the lake when there were much safer places they could have chosen. There was something about the lake, a mysterious pull, which also seems to be more of a paranormal beacon for weirdness to take place. RW: What can you tell us about our local sea serpent? CL: I spoke with a gentleman in Two Harbors who was at his dentist's office, which happens to have a wonderful overlook of the lake. He believed he had seen either an unknown species or one that we think is extinct, but maybe it's not quite extinct. RW: Is it possible he could have just had too much novocaine? I have read that mermaid sightings over the last millennia turned out to be attributed to manatees — that if you see the back half of a manatee and you're fantasizing about the front half, you can put a mermaid together. CL: Yes, and mermaid stories are a bit different. CL: The most common question I receive is, “Where can I go to spend the night in a haunted place?” And if you have that macabre sense of adventure, you're in luck because in Wisconsin, we have all sorts of haunted lodging options. One of my favorites is Greunke's First Street Inn in Bayfield. They'll see apparitions of people that they think are fellow guests, but who simply vanish into a wall or disappear right before their eyes. They often ask the staff, “This is going to sound strange, but have you ever heard of anybody reporting this?” And the staff have to gently tell them, “Yes, we have a long history of ghostly, spooky stories.” What is it about belief systems that make people believe they've seen a UFO or an unidentified creature in the woods? It holds that a woman lost her lover to the sea, and she was so heartbroken that she waited every day on the beach for her lost love to return. So even though people believe that it's the woman in the sand crying out for her lost love, science says it's a little bit different. RW: That reminds me of a story about the writer James Thurber, who was famously nearsighted. But it was much more fun to have a cute puppy in the window. I can't tell you whether these things are real or if they're actually happening, but to the witnesses, they believe that it actually happened. It adds a little more mystery and fun to any adventure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Buried in all the news this week was another congressional hearing on UFOs. For some reason, our government now prefers the acronym UAP, which stood for Unidentified Aerial Phenomena until they changed it again Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. So, in other words, an unidentified flying object or UFO, right? The highlight of this week's congressional hearing was a leaked military video purportedly taken by a U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper Drone showing a hellfire missile striking sphere-like object in the skies off the coast of Yemen and having little to no effect. I sought out some experts in the field. I spoke to a family member who served several tours in Afghanistan and he told me there is a chain of command and permission needed before a Hellfire Missile is fired. "I believe those are the most pertinent questions, but upon seeing this footage we also have to ask ourselves, what sort of technology could cause this result? The Hellfire Missile was designed for anti-armor attacks and is able to destroy any known armored vehicle in the world, and it lost. The target, while it seemed to lose a few bits and veered from its course momentarily, rebounded almost immediately and kept going. That's not a known technology we have here on Earth ... unless something else is being hidden from us, militarily or otherwise." Was it finally time to build my bunker in the backyard? Were the monsters really due on Maple Street? Not so fast, says Adam Frank, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester whose research delves into Theoretical Astrophysics, and in particular the hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic evolution of matter. Frank said there are way too many unknowns to make any sort of scientific declaration based on what he described as a "grainy video with blobs on it that comes with a predigested story." "If you really want to know what it is, you've got to do a proper investigation of it," he said. "That means knowing what time of day is it? Right now that can't be answered. The other thing to take into account, Frank said, was that the object was not moving very fast since Hellfire Missiles are used mainly to attack stationary or slower-moving objects like tanks and helicopters. But the biggest takeaway from my discussion with Frank was something I hadn't noticed on the video or even considered. "It's not like you see the missile hit whatever the thing was and explode in a giant explosion and then the thing propagates away from it like in one of those science fiction movies," Frank said. "It looks like it's a glancing blow right which means that the targeting wasn't that great. You see it move, so this is not some kind of super alien technology which is impervious to anything, it kind of behaves like you might expect something to behave if it got a glancing blow from a fast moving object." OK, so maybe it's not from outer space. Florida Congresswoman and chair of Declassification of Federal Secrets Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, wants to know as well. She has been calling on the government to be more transparent when it comes to these types of things. "From Roswell to the coast of Jacksonville, the sightings of UFO's have rarely been explained by the people who have first-hand accounts of these situations," she said last year. "This is largely due to the lack of transparency by our own government and the failure of our elected leaders to make good on their promises to release explanations and footage and mountains of classified documents that continue to be hidden from the American people." I've only recently come across the term “Peer State Adversary,” meaning a country with similar technology as ours that is adversarial. Anyway, more likely than an alien spacecraft, the object on the video could be a drone operated by one of those adversarial countries. And if that's the case, Frank explains, the military would have good reason to keep tight-lipped about it. For example, Frank said, what if a country like China or Iran was testing the camera-spoofing technology of an experimental drone? Our military leaders would not want to tip their hand and reveal to those nations what we know about them. “As somebody who studies the possibility of life in the universe professionally, I would love if we found aliens," Frank said. "That would answer the question I've been interested in my whole life. But there's just nothing there to be able to make that giant leap without the right kind of scientific evidence." I gotta admit being relieved after speaking with Frank. Support local journalism and become a subscriber.</p>
