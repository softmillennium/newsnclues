                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Utah prosecutors charged Tyler Robinson on Tuesday with aggravated murder in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said that he intends to seek the death penalty in the case against Robinson, who was also charged with felony discharge of a firearm, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and several other counts. "I do not take this decision lightly, and it is a decision I have made independently as county attorney based solely on the available evidence and circumstances and nature of the crime," Gray said at a press conference. Robinson, a Washington, Utah, resident, is scheduled to appear virtually for his initial court appearance at 5 p.m. He has been held in jail without bail since his arrest on Friday morning. Gray said Robinson, 22, was identified as a suspect in part because his family recognized him in surveillance images released after Kirk, a married father of two, was killed last Wednesday during a crowded speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem. Robinson's mother also told investigators that "over the last year or so, her son had become more political and had started to lean more to the left, becoming more pro gay and trans-rights oriented," Gray said. Robinson's mother also told police that he "began to date his roommate, a biological male who was transitioning genders," the prosecutor said. Gray also described a wide array of evidence that he said tied Robinson to Kirk's shooting, including text messages between the suspect and his roommate and DNA that was allegedly matched to Robinson. Several of the messages, which were detailed in charging documents shared with CNBC later Tuesday, contained romantic sentiments. Look under my keyboard," the documents alleged. The roommate looked and found a note stating, "I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it." Robinson replied that, "To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. When the roommate asked why Robinson did it, he replied, "I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out." CNBC has not independently verified the content of messages. Gray was uncertain whether Robinson had retained a defense lawyer. Kirk's death has gripped the nation and generated highly charged reactions. Many of Kirk's friends and political allies have felt intense grief, and politicians across the aisle have issued forceful condemnations of political violence. But some, including President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, have blamed the "radical left" for the killing and signaled plans to crack down on groups aligned with that ideology. Others on the left who criticized Kirk's right-wing politics while he was alive have continued to do so following his murder, drawing outrage from the activist's supporters. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI on Tuesday announced it will launch a dedicated ChatGPT experience with parental controls for users under 18 years old as the artificial intelligence company works to enhance safety protections for teenagers. When OpenAI identifies that a user is a minor, they will automatically be directed to an age-appropriate ChatGPT experience that blocks graphic and sexual content and can involve law enforcement in rare cases of acute distress, the company said. OpenAI is also developing a technology to better predict a user's age, but ChatGPT will default to the under-18 experience if there is uncertainty or incomplete information. The startup's safety updates come after the Federal Trade Commission recently launched an inquiry into several tech companies, including OpenAI, over how AI chatbots like ChatGPT potentially negatively affect children and teenagers. OpenAI also shared how ChatGPT will handle "sensitive situations" last month after a lawsuit from a family blamed the chatbot for their teenage son's death by suicide. In August, OpenAI said it would release parental controls to help them understand and shape how their teens are using ChatGPT. OpenAI shared more details about those parental controls on Tuesday, and it said they will be available at the end of the month. ChatGPT is intended for users who are ages 13 and up, OpenAI said. "These are difficult decisions, but after talking with experts, this is what we think is best and want to be transparent in our intentions," Altman wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eli Lilly on Tuesday said it will spend $5 billion to build a manufacturing facility in Goochland County, Virginia, to boost production capacity for targeted cancer drugs and other treatments — the first in a string of new planned U.S. investments by the drugmaker. The company announced in February that it would spend at least $27 billion to build four new domestic manufacturing plants, adding to $23 billion in previous investments since 2020. Eli Lilly said it will announce the three remaining U.S. sites this year and expects to begin making medicines at all four facilities within five years. Drugmakers have been scrambling to boost their production in the U.S. as President Donald Trump threatens to clamp down on the industry with tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. Trump has said those levies will encourage companies to re-shore production after domestic drug manufacturing shrank dramatically over the past decade. In a release Tuesday, Eli Lilly said the new Virginia plant will develop active ingredients for cancer and autoimmune drugs, along with other advanced treatments. It will be the company's first dedicated active ingredient and drug product site for its bioconjugate platform and portfolio of monoclonal antibody drugs. Eli Lilly said the facility will particularly boost domestic manufacturing of targeted treatments called antibody drug conjugates — a type of bioconjugate that links a monoclonal antibody to a toxic "payload" to kill cancer cells. Eli Lilly is among several pharmaceutical companies developing or currently marketing those drugs, which drugmakers are also studying in autoimmune conditions and other diseases. "This is new capacity to allow for pipeline growth. We've got a number of new assets coming that will use both biologics but also these antibody drug conjugates," Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said in an interview with CNBC. "This site will be unique in that we'll be able to make that kind of medicine for us — we don't currently have that capacity in the company — and even put it in the drug product form, so into the vial and ship it." Ricks said the company will move some production from third parties and "other nodes in our network, mostly from Europe," to the new Virginia site. Ricks previously touted Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for pushing the company to increase its U.S. manufacturing investments. That legislation, passed by a majority-Republican Congress during Trump's first term, was the largest tax code overhaul in nearly three decades and cut the corporate tax rate to 21%, among other efforts. Eli Lilly said it will use advanced technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence at the site, which will "enable right-first-time execution, all in support of the safe and reliable supply of medicines." The company said the site will bring more than 650 new jobs to Virginia, including engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians. Eli Lilly's other U.S. plants include sites in North Carolina, Indiana and Wisconsin. The new U.S. investments build on the success of Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes counterpart Mounjaro, which have vied for dominance of the booming market for so-called GLP-1 drugs with rival treatments from Novo Nordisk. Both companies have funneled billions into boosting manufacturing capacity for those drugs, which has helped alleviate shortages of the treatments in the U.S. The company is charting its future beyond Zepbound and Mounjaro, with hopes to deliver drugs from its broad pipeline of products for cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other conditions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The framework agreement for the social media platform TikTok will include new investors as well as existing investors in the platform's Chinese parent company ByteDance, sources told CNBC's David Faber. "Where this thing is capitalized and how large it is remains to be seen," Faber said Tuesday on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." "'I'm hearing it's actually going to be relatively small in terms of the actual size of the checks that are written for the entity itself, and it will not be something that is going to go public at some point." The White House, TikTok and Oracle did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. TikTok's future in the U.S. has been uncertain since 2024, when Congress passed a bill that would ban the platform unless ByteDance divested from U.S. operations. Lawmakers had grown concerned that the Chinese government could access sensitive data from American users or manipulate content on the platform. Deal talks have dragged, with President Donald Trump extending the deadline three times since taking office in January. Bessent said Tuesday that commercial terms had been in place since March or April, but the Chinese put it on hold after Trump's "liberation day" tariff blitz. Oracle has been floated as a potential investor or buyer of TikTok for months. Reuters reported in January that the White House picked Oracle to handle TikTok's data collection and software updates as part of a deal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent brushed off recent reports of heated arguments inside President Donald Trump's administration, saying disputes were a part of the normal push-and-pull of policymaking. "Treasury secretaries dating back to Alexander Hamilton have a history of dueling," Bessent joked Tuesday to CNBC's "Squawk Box." "I think with the President's team, I turned out a little better for the Treasury's side this time." Bessent's remarks come after recent stories detailed a series of fiery confrontations between him and other Trump officials, including Federal Housing Finance Agency chief Bill Pulte, over the direction of economic policy and influence in Trump's orbit. Tempers flared during meetings this summer where Bessent reportedly demanded to know why Pulte was bad-mouthing him to Trump, threatening to punch Pulte "in the ----ing face." There was also other incidents of elevated tensions internally at the White House. In April, Bessent and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who at the time headed the Department of Government Efficiency, got into a heated fight outside of the Oval Office about the Internal Revenue Service. A hedge fund veteran, Bessent became Treasury Secretary in January. Bessent, who has been leading trade negotiations for the administration, said Tuesday a trade deal with China is likely before the November deadline. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly two years into its retaliatory military offensive in the Gaza Strip, Israel said it has launched a long-studied ground assault on Gaza City. "IDF troops have begun expanding ground operations in Gaza City as part of Operation Gideon's Chariots II," the Israeli Defense Forces said Tuesday on social media. "We will not relent or turn back — until the mission is complete," he added. The ground invasion marks a deepening of Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip, which once housed 2.2 million people and has devolved into a starvation-stricken battlefield. Israel insists its campaign targets the demilitarization of Hamas and release of hostages taken by the Palestinian militant group after its terror attacks in October 2023. Speaking to reporters as he prepared to leave Israel, visiting U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signaled that a ground invasion of Gaza City was imminent. "Well, as you saw, the Israelis have begun to take operations there. CNBC has reached out to the IDF and Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment. Several Western nations initially backed Israel's right to self-defense and to pursue Hamas militarily after the Palestinian militant group's terror attacks, but have since noted the perceived disproportionality of the Jewish state's Gaza campaign and risk to civilians. Nations including Norway, Spain and Ireland recognized Palestinian statehood in the spring of 2024, with France, Canada and Australia later announcing plans to take the same step this month. In a blow to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration, a report by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Tuesday concluded that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinian people in the Gaza enclave. In November 2024, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas officials on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the Gaza conflict and October 2023 terror onslaught. The U.N. commission's Tuesday findings could deal a further reputational blow to Israel, which has sought to retain working trade ties with international partners. In August, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, said it had quit its investments in U.S. machinery manufacturer Caterpillar and five Israeli banks following a review of the companies' connection to the Gaza conflict. Broader market reactions have been muted, barring brief spikes in oil prices when Israel entered direct confrontations with Hamas' crude-rich patron Iran and with other of Tehran's proxies, such as Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthis. Yet Arab nations in the oil-bountiful Middle East — many of which entertain or are building solid relations with the U.S. — are unlikely to protest Israel's current aggression in Gaza through an oil embargo, as they did in 1973, according to experts. "We would have to really see the big oil producers of the region — Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Iran — join and create an oil embargo," Marko Papic, macro and geopolitical expert at BCA Research, told CNBC's Dan Murphy. "There is absolutely no talk of that, and therefore I believe this will continue to be completely and utterly market irrelevant for global investors." He also downplayed the odds of success of Israel's latest Gaza offensive, which he qualified as "yet another incursion that is unlikely to root out Hamas, and the reason for that is that Hamas is an ideology that will persist, either in its current form or in some future form." Despite this, Israel's invasion threatens to rupture the Jewish state's already shaky political relations with its Arab neighbors, many of which have historically supported the Palestinian cause. The Gaza City invasion comes after Arab and Muslim leaders convened in Qatar and called for a review of ties with Israel following the country's strike on Doha last week. Qatar's emir urged leaders to take "concrete steps" against Israel in response to a missile strike on Doha which killed six people, including a Qatari national. Views on Israel are divided among other Gulf nations. The UAE signed the Abraham Accords in 2020, recognizing Israel and establishing diplomatic normalization along with Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco after years of Arab isolation. The agreement now faces "the most difficult time since it was signed five years ago," Emirati academic and political scientist Abdulkhaleq Abdulla told CNBC. U.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has made it his mission to improve ties between Israel and other Arab nations, cementing Washington's influence in the Middle East. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has signaled that this step would require a credible and irreversible pathway to the establishment of a Palestinian state. "While relations can keep on being resilient, they are taking a different nature – limited in scope, mostly under-the-radar, focusing on security interests, and without a meaningful public dimension," Nimrod Goren, president and founder of Mitvim, told CNBC. "Should the Israeli government decide to annex any part of Palestinian territories in the West Bank, following upcoming recognitions of a Palestinian state, then ties with Arab countries will suffer another blow and will further deteriorate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The three wealthiest people on the planet are worth a combined $1 trillion, about as much as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Together, they're worth $1.06 trillion, virtually matching Berkshire's market capitalization and comfortably surpassing the $800 billion-plus market values of Oracle, JPMorgan, and Walmart. It's striking that three individuals are worth as much on paper as Berkshire, a corporate behemoth that generates about $370 billion in annual revenue, employs nearly 400,000 workers, and has arguably the world's greatest living investor at its helm. Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg are worth so much because they're the biggest shareholders of some of the world's most valuable companies. Most ultrawealthy people have also grown substantially richer this year. The 17 members of the $100 billion club have added a net $486 billion to their joint fortunes, boosting their combined wealth to around $3.3 trillion at Monday's close — a figure greater than the market values of Alphabet or Amazon. Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg have seen their fortunes balloon in recent years thanks to investor optimism around AI's potential to slash corporations' costs and supercharge their profitability. Oracle's stock price climbed as much as 43% last Wednesday alone, lifting the company's market value by nearly $300 billion at its peak, after it projected rapid revenue growth fueled by AI demand. The proposed deal would grant Musk shares worth over $1 trillion if he manages to increase his company's market value by about eightfold and hit a slew of operational targets within the next decade or so. Musk purchased about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock on Friday, signaling he likes his chances.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is suing The New York Times. In a lawsuit filed on Monday, Trump accused the Times and four of its journalists of defamation and libel. "The New York Times has been allowed to freely lie, smear, and defame me for far too long, and that stops, NOW!" He is seeking at least $15 billion in damages, per the lawsuit. Brito represented Trump when he sued ABC News and The Wall Street Journal for defamation. ABC News paid Trump a $15 million settlement last year. In the court filing, Trump's lawyers said the Times had been trying to "destroy his reputation as a successful businessman, and subject him to humiliation and ridicule." It also took aim at "Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father's Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success," a book written by two Times reporters, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner. Craig, Buettner, and their publisher, Penguin Random House, were listed as defendants alongside the Times. "The Book and Articles are part of a decades-long pattern by the New York Times of intentional and malicious defamation against President Trump," Trump's lawyers wrote in the court filing. The newspaper's editorial routine is now one of industrial-scale defamation and libel against political opponents," the filing said. Trump's lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. In 2021, he filed a lawsuit against the paper, accusing the Times and its reporters of conspiring with his niece, Mary Trump, to obtain his tax records. Craig and Buettner were two of the three reporters named in Trump's lawsuit.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sean "Diddy" Combs is hoping for sentencing help from an unlikely source: some of the dozens of escorts he hired for "freak offs," men the prosecutors are counting as victims. As early as Friday, Combs' legal team intends to submit a sentencing brief to the judge, arguing that some of these "entertainers" gave prosecutors never-revealed interviews that actually help the defense. "Statements of non-testifying witnesses are traditionally considered nonpublic," prosecutors argued in a recent court filing. They have asked the judge to count these escorts as victims at a sentencing scheduled for October 3. Combs' team counters that none of the escorts are victims, and that details from their pretrial, prosecution interviews should not be sealed or even partially redacted. Prosecutors say Combs caused multiple people to cross state lines for the dayslong sex performances he called freak offs — not just longtime girlfriends Cassie Ventura and a second ex who testified pseudonymously as "Jane," but male escorts as well. Two of these escorts testified at trial that they witnessed Combs being violent with Ventura and Jane during freak offs. But in closing arguments, Assistant US Attorney Christy Slavik showed the jury a collage of 27 escorts whom she alleged Combs hired, many of whom were caused by Combs to cross state lines for these encounters. "This slide shows you just a subset of the strangers who had sex with Jane and Cassie in these rooms for hours and days on end, drugged, covered in oil, sore, exhausted, over and over again," Slavik told the jurors as the escort collage was shown to jurors and the courtroom audience. It's unclear how many of the 27 gave pre-trial interviews to prosecutors, or how many of them prosecutors intend to say were victims when they file their own pre-sentencing brief later this month. The defense has asked to submit it on Monday instead. Combs faces up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced; the maximum for each of the two counts is 10 years. Prosecutors have said that they will seek at least five years in prison total. But that was in July; the number of "victims" will figure into their final sentencing recommendations. Prosecutors have also said they will count the trial evidence of Combs' admitted violence and drug use in their ultimate sentencing recommendation. The defense has said they will ask for zero jail time, and told Business Insider last month that he is a changed man who hopes to become an anti-domestic abuse advocate. "The government has taken the view that several consenting male 'entertainers,' who willingly consented to sexual activity with Ms. Ventura and Jane, are now victims" under the meaning of federal sentencing guidelines, defense lawyers wrote this month. Combs has been jailed since his arrest in September 2024. Subramanian has not said when he will rule on the defense requests for more time and pages, or on their request to file any pre-sentencing arguments relating to the escorts without redaction.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta's would-be surprise announcement about its new smart glasses display was leaked on Monday ahead of a major company event. Meta posted and then removed a YouTube video showing off its new Ray-Ban smart glasses and Oakley smart glasses days before Meta Connect, the company's annual flagship conference that is set for Wednesday and Thursday this week. UploadVR first reported on the leaked video, which it also captured and uploaded clips of to X. One video clip shows off a new pair of Meta Ray-Ban glasses that include a heads-up display, or HUD, that will let wearers superimpose maps and text onto the real world, as well as a wristband that interacts with them. Meta did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Meta's Orion glasses, which Business Insider's Peter Kafka tried out last year, are augmented-reality glasses that come with a HUD and a wristband that tracks muscle movements. Meta isn't the first company to show off smart glasses with a built-in display. Google showed off its own version in May, powered by Android XR, a new platform for augmented reality glasses. Google is partnering with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster to design its frames, which are expected to be released later this year. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been bullish on smart glasses. During the company's second-quarter earnings call in July, he said smart glasses will eventually be the primary way people interact with AI and that anyone not using them would be at a "cognitive disadvantage."</p>
