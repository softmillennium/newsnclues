Numerous rivers are still in major flood stage, and there’s widespread beach erosion.

Cyclone Alfred struck the east coast of Australia late Friday, unleashing strong winds, rough surf and dangerous rip currents along popular beaches over the weekend. An estimated 10 to 15 inches fell around Brisbane and on Moreton Island during the storm.

Widespread beach erosion and coastal wind damage affected parts of Queensland and New South Wales, while inland areas also felt the effects of heavy rain and freshwater flooding. In addition to the 15 inches in those areas, northeastern New South Wales also saw heavy rain, with 4 to 10 inches from Newcastle to the Queensland border. Sydney only saw an inch or two in most of its suburbs.

Meanwhile, nearly 5 inches of rainfall was recorded in a single hour at Cracow in New South Wales between 6:22 p.m. and 7:22 p.m. on Monday evening. In Pine Hills, 2 inches was recorded, and the Durah Homestead Alert saw 3 inches in two hours during the afternoon.

Before Alfred formed, the instigating system initially formed northeast of Australia over the Coral Sea on Feb. 20. It was upgraded to a tropical storm two days later, and began quickly intensifying. On Feb. 27, the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded Alfred to a Category 4-equivalent cyclone with winds of up to 130 mph at its core. The system was still offshore but exhibited a pinhole eye on satellite.

Alfred lingered offshore for another week and a half before weakening and making landfall on Moreton Island, South East Queensland, late Friday evening. Moreton Island is just east of Brisbane. A named storm hasn’t passed this close to Brisbane — the country’s third-largest city, with 2.7 million people — since Zoe in 1974.

Winds were estimated at 45 mph, meaning the system was the equivalent of a low-end tropical storm. Still, the slow-moving nature of the storm caused serious erosion.

Tropical cyclones (and all low-pressure systems) spin clockwise in the southern hemisphere, so the heaviest rain totals — associated with onshore flow — hit south of the storm’s center.

Meanwhile, scattered strong to severe thunderstorms continue to affect Australia; most of Queensland was under a severe thunderstorm warning Monday evening local time.

The Bureau of Meteorology warned of additional “major flood warnings” in effect for the following rivers:

Toronto: Former central banker Mark Carney coasted to a landslide victory on Sunday to become the new leader of the ruling Liberal Party, paving the way for him to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada’s prime minister.

Carney, 59, garnered nearly 86% of the approximately 152,000 votes cast by registered party members. His closest rival, former deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, could only manage 8% support in the leadership race.

In his victory speech at the Roger’s Centre in Ottawa on Sunday, Carney focused his attention on the threat posed to Canada by US President Donald Trump, as he said the country faced “dark days.”

“We needed big changes, guided by strong Canadian values,” he said, in order to confront Trump. “I will use those values again as we face the most serious threat in a generation,” he stressed.

“Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country,” he warned, adding, “He’s attacking Canadian families, workers and business and we cannot let him succeed, and we won’t.”

Carney also attacked his principal rival, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, but also adopted several policies that the opposition has backed in the last year, including eliminating a consumer carbon tax, stopping a hike in capitals gains tax, reducing Government spending and building energy pipelines.

Carney, who will celebrate his 60th birthday next Sunday, is expected to be sworn in as Canada’s 24th PM during the course of the week ahead as Trudeau demits office after over nine years at the helm in Ottawa.

Carney is expected to call for early federal elections, which could take place in late spring instead of as scheduled in October. He repeated used the phrase “Canada Strong” which could be his slogan.

“Canadians want positive leadership that will end division and held us build together,” he stressed, adding that meant creating a “stronger economy” creating “new trading relationships with reliable trading partners” and securing the country’s borders.

Carney also thanked Trudeau, who was in the arena, for his “hard work” and “service” to Canada.

Max Cameron, professor of political science at the University of British Columbia, felt Carney would take the party to the centre. “He’s not, in any way, a radical. He’s fiscally conservative and socially liberal,” he said.

Professor Cameron said the Liberals’ electoral fortunes appeared to have turned since Trudeau’s resignation and part of that could be because Carney came into the picture. Being a “new face” could help him but in leading the party into federal elections, he was “untested in electoral terms.”

“Can he really connect with voters?” was the question Cameron said will determine his political future specially since Carney has never fought or won an election.

Former British Columbia premier Ujjal Dosanjh felt that Carney “is a good thing happening to Canada.” He said the country needed to move to the centre and away from the “excessive pandering” by Trudeau that led to a “splintering of society.”

Dosanjh, also a former federal cabinet minister from the Liberal Party, said he expected Carney to practice “economic pragmatism” while “enhancing social cohesion.” He said Carney has already revived the fortunes of the Liberals, which had cratered under Trudeau, though that was, in part, attributable to Trump’s “antics.”

Poilievre and the Conservative Party, as expected, have Carney now as their target. On Sunday, the Conservative leader posted on X, “Liberals are trying to trick Canadians into electing them for a fourth term by replacing Trudeau with his economic advisor, Mark Carney.” Carney has chaired a task force on economic growth that has been advising Trudeau since September last year.

Earlier, Trudeau also addressed the gathering, after being introduced by his daughter Ella-Grace. Trudeau said that “being Prime Minister of this country has been the honour of my life”.

He added, “I’m damn proud of what we have accomplished over the last 10 years.” A tribute to Trudeau played out before he appeared on stage and he reminisced about entering politics 18 years ago, as he first became an MP from Papineau in Quebec, as well as 2013, when he became leader of the Liberal Party, and 2015, when he won his first term as PM in 2015, with the only majority his party enjoyed under his command.

Carney becomes the leader after Trudeau’s 12 year tenure. The winner said that Canda faced “new challenges” which required “new leadership.”

In what will become the campaign theme of the next election, Carney reiterated that Canada faced the “greatest crisis of our lifetimes.”

But, he said, “Canada never ever will be part of American n any way, shape or form.”

The leadership race was precipitated by Trudeau’s announcement on January 6 that he intended to resign once his successor was selected by the party. That process concluded on Sunday, with Canada now looking ahead to a post-Trudeau polity after nearly a decade of his rule.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with Ukrainian officials for the first time since the Oval Office blow-up between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky.

The Trump administration may resume U.S. military and intelligence support for Ukraine if its leaders commit to a peace process during a high stakes meeting Tuesday in Saudi Arabi, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters.

Rubio said the initial suspension of aid “came about because we felt the Ukrainians were not committed” to negotiations to end the three-year war to repel Russia’s invasion, but if that changes, U.S. policy will probably change too, he said Monday as he landed in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah.

“My hope is we’ll have a really good meeting tomorrow and be in a different place,” he added.

Rubio’s meeting will be his first with senior Ukrainian officials since the Oval Office blow up between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that resulted in the aid being cut off.

The decision stunned Ukrainian officials and alarmed U.S. allies in Europe who are desperately hoping for the talks to restore U.S.-Ukrainian relations as a wave of Russian attacks has continued to hit government and residential buildings across Ukraine.

Ahead of Rubio’s arrival in Jeddah, U.S. officials said they were pleased at the high-level delegation Zelensky chose to send. “The fact that they’re coming here at senior levels is a good indication to us that they want to sit down, and they’re ready to move forward,” a senior State Department official said on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive talks.

The Ukrainian delegation will be led by Zelensky’s top aide, Andriy Yermak, alongside Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa. Rubio will be joined by White House national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff.

Zelensky will not attend the meeting but will be in Saudi Arabia to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh.

“These are separate events,” a Ukrainian official told The Washington Post.

“We hope for results — both in bringing peace closer and in continuing support,” Zelensky said in a video address late Sunday.

Zelensky is under extraordinary pressure to placate the Trump administration and demonstrate support for the president’s diplomatic drive despite his unanswered push for a U.S. security guarantee that would deter Russia from reinvading Ukraine.

Trump has insisted that the United States be repaid for the more than $100 billion it has spent in its support for Kyiv since Russia invaded more than three years ago. To that end, Kyiv and Washington are negotiating a deal that would provide the United States access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine that U.S. officials say will provide a type of security guarantee for Ukraine given the presence of U.S. businesspeople — an arrangement many Ukrainian officials view as insufficient.

The Trump administration has ruled out allowing Ukraine into NATO, viewing that as placing new burdens on the United States and obviating a path to peace with Moscow.

Rubio emphasized that the conflict in Ukraine has calcified into a war of attrition and that neither Russia nor Ukraine can prevail militarily. He said both sides would have to accept concessions but that the first objective for U.S. officials was understanding Ukraine’s position.

“The most important thing that we have to leave here with is a strong sense that Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things — like the Russians will have to do difficult things — to end this conflict,” he said.

Rubio said the mineral deal was not a core focus of the meetings in Saudi Arabia, but emphasized that “it’s certainly a deal the president wants to see done … doesn’t necessarily have to be done tomorrow.”

Ukrainian officials have bristled at the way the Trump administration has handled the negotiations, in particular by excluding them from the initial talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia.

Trump, who called Zelensky a “dictator” who was ungrateful for U.S. support, has softened his tone in recent days.

On Sunday, when asked whether he would consider lifting the intelligence pause, Trump said “we just about have. I mean, we really just about have, and we want to do anything we can to get Ukraine to be serious about getting something done.”

Among the types of intelligence that have been suspended is the provision of satellite imagery services used by Ukrainian artillery and drone units to assess quality targets and keep tabs on Russian positions and depots.

Rubio clarified that the Ukrainians are “already receiving defensive intelligence information as we speak.”

The United States also stopped the transfer of any of the $3.85 billion in remaining military equipment available for Ukraine as well as halted the delivery of weapons already in transit after having been approved by the Biden administration.

“The pause in aid broadly is something I hope we can resolve, obviously what happens tomorrow will be key to that,” Rubio added.

The latest: The Ukrainian military has launched a long-anticipated counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces, opening a crucial phase in the war aimed at restoring Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and preserving Western support in its fight against Moscow.

The fight: Ukrainian troops have  intensified their attacks on the front line in the southeast region, according to multiple individuals in the country’s armed forces, in a significant push toward Russian-occupied territory.

The front line: The Washington Post has mapped out the 600-mile front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the United States can support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

LONDON — A fuel tanker and a cargo vessel were involved in a fiery collision off the British coast in the North Sea on Monday, the U.K. coast guard said. 

The tanker, MV Stena Immaculate, was struck by the Portugal-registered Solong container ship, according to a statement from Crowley, the company that manages the the tanker. The Stena Immaculate is a U.S. vessel that was anchored off the North Sea coast near Hull at the time, the company said. 

"The Stena Immaculate sustained a ruptured cargo tank containing Jet-A1 fuel due to the (collision)," the statement said. "A fire occurred as a result of the (collision), and fuel was reported released." 

A defense official told NBC News that the ship was carrying fuel that was to be used by U.S. Navy ships. 

The scene was one of chaos in video footage published by The Guardian newspaper, with both vessels apparently on fire and sending thick black smoke billowing into the gray North Sea sky.

Crowley confirmed that all crew aboard the Stena Immaculate abandoned the vessel following multiple explosions onboard. Everyone was "safe and fully accounted for," the company said.

Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East, told Sky News that 32 people had been brought ashore alive. The town of Grimsby is around 60 miles southeast of the city of York. 

"There was a line of ambulances waiting to take them to the Princess Diana hospital," Boyers said.

"I'm concerned to hear of the collision between two vessels in the North Sea this morning and am liaising with officials and HM Coastguard as the situation develops," British Transport Minister Heidi Alexander said in a post on X. 

"I want to thank all emergency service workers involved for their continued efforts in responding to the incident," she added.

A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the situation was “extremely concerning" and details are still "becoming clear." 

"We’re obviously monitoring the situation, we’ll continue to co-ordinate the response and we’re grateful to emergency personnel for their continued efforts," the spokesperon said.

While NBC News has been unable to independently verify that information, the nonprofit Royal National Lifeboat Institution said in a statement that four lifeboat crews had been called to support two ships after they had collided off the East Yorkshire coast early Monday. 

“There were reports that a number of people had abandoned the vessels following a collision and there were fires on both ships,” the RNLI said in a media statement. 

It added that at shortly before midday local time, while its Cleethorpes crew had been called back, three more crews from Bridlington, Mablethorpe and Skegness continued to support search and rescue efforts. 

The Stena Immaculate had been sailing from the Greek port of Agioi Theodori, near Athens, while the Solong had just left the nearby British port of Immingham and was on its way to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, according to Marine Traffic, a maritime analytics provider.  

His Majesty’s Coastguard, which acts as the United Kingdom's national maritime emergency service, earlier said that it was coordinating a response to reports of a collision between a tanker and cargo vessel off the coast of East Yorkshire in England.

It said an alarm was raised alerting the agency to the incident at 9:48 a.m. local time (5:48 a.m. ET). 

A coast guard rescue helicopter was last being dispatched to respond to the collision, the British government's Maritime and Coastguard Agency said in a media statement. 

It added that a coast guard aircraft and nearby vessels with "fire-fighting capability" were also being deployed.

The collision has raised fears of an explosion or environmental catastrophe, with rescue teams racing to the scene.

LONDON — Rescue teams raced to the aid of two cargo vessels that collided Monday in the North Sea off the east coast of England, sparking fires aboard both ships — an oil tanker and a container vessel, British officials said. The incident forced at least some crew members to abandon ship.

More than 40 crew members were taken ashore at the nearby Port of Grimsby, and both ships’ full rosters were accounted for after several hours, a local official told reporters. One crew member was reported hospitalized.

But officials cautioned that the situation remained unstable, as fears of an explosion or environmental disaster, or both, ran high. Video showed plumes of black smoke and orange flames coming from both ships.

The British coast guard mounted a major rescue operation, with  helicopters, planes, lifeboats and firefighting vessels from nearby bases. A pop-up flotilla of private and commercial craft in the area also responded, some reportedly picking up crew members and transporting them to shore.

The 600-foot tanker is the U.S.-flagged Stena Immaculate, a ship that sometimes transports materials for the U.S. military. The other vessel is the Solong, a Portuguese-registered container ship.

The American tanker, having traveled from Greece, was anchored just off the Yorkshire port city of Hull at the time of the collision, according to maritime traffic sites. The Solong was heading south from a Scottish port toward Rotterdam when it struck the stationary tanker, according to an analysis by Marinetraffic.com.

Mayday calls were reported shortly before 10 a.m. local time, the coast guard said. Some residents reported seeing a “massive fireball” after the collision, said Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East.

British Transport Minister Heidi Alexander said on X that her office was monitoring the situation and in touch with the coast guard.

The Stena Immaculate’s joint owner, Crowley Logistics, based in Jacksonville, Florida, said in a statement that the ship was carrying jet fuel. The coast guard said it was preparing for the strong possibility of a spill.

“The incident remains ongoing and an assessment of the likely counter pollution response required is being enacted,” the coast guard said in statement.

Officials in Hull said they are bracing for a possible environmental catastrophe if the tanker explodes or founders in the sensitive coastal waters where the ship was burning. The ship had been at anchor in the Humber estuary, near the approach to the port.

Hull City Council leader Mike Ross told the BBC that any significant spill could be “devastating.”

Greenpeace UK said in a statement that it was too early to determine the extent of the spill and that weather, currents and then amount of material spilled would determined how serious the damage would be. But the group cautioned that “the high speed of the collision and the footage of the aftermath are cause for great concern.”

The Stena Immaculate is one of a small group of tankers that remain on standby to transport fuel for the U.S. military during times of emergency.

The collision occurred in a crowded shipping area under conditions that were moderate but foggy, local officials said. The cause of the accident remains unclear. British officials said investigators were on their way to the scene.

Israel's Knesset Health Committee held a heated discussion on a proposal for Israel to leave the World Health Organization (WHO), a United Nations agency. The committee will hold another discussion to hear from government ministry representatives.The WHO was established on April 7, 1948, as a UN agency with the mission of promoting global public health, combating infectious diseases, and assisting countries in health emergencies. It is primarily funded by member states, alongside contributions from international foundations and private entities.Israel joined the organization in 1949 and has since participated in its activities and provided financial support as part of its international commitments. However, recent calls within the government have pushed for Israel to withdraw from the WHO.  Claims of antisemitism and calls for withdrawalThe discussion was initiated by MK Limor Son Har-Melech (Otzma Yehudit), who argued that the WHO consistently takes a hostile stance against Israel, promoting resolutions that harm its international standing."The organization's policies are often tainted with antisemitism and clear discrimination against Israel, severely undermining its legitimacy as a sovereign state," she said. "The US president announced America's withdrawal from the organization on his first day in office, recognizing that the WHO does not serve the interests of democratic nations and even harms them. Israel must take similar action to protect its international status, prevent harm to its interests, and send a clear message against antisemitic discrimination in international institutions." THE WORLD Health Organization in Geneva: The writer asserts that October 7 brought to the fore two of the most critical questions of the day – to be or not to be? And to disengage or reengage?  (credit: DENIS BALIBOUSE/REUTERS)She added that with the US withdrawal, the organization lost 30% of its budget, crippling its ability to conduct research and foster international collaborations. Other Likud members, MKs Galit Distel Atbaryan, Nissim Vaturi, Osher Shkalim, Tsega Melaku, Ariel Kallner, Keti Shitrit, as well as MKs Ohad Tal and Michal Waldiger (Religious Zionism), backed the call for Israel’s withdrawal.Criticism of the WHO’s policiesProfessor Ehud Keinan, an international chemistry expert, stated that while the WHO’s professional authority is debated, its policies are corrupt and driven by political interests. He cited Taiwan as a leading global power in medicine despite not being a member of the WHO. Michael Pua, chairman of “Choosing Family”, added that the WHO promotes an agenda of sexual education for children from birth, which he called "progressive lunacy that severely disrupts a child’s identity development in relation to their physical growth and family environment.""With the US withdrawing, it is clear that anyone who values liberty and justice cannot support this organization. Since the US ceased funding the WHO, only negative interest-driven entities remain in control," he stated.WHO’s silence on October 7 and Hamas' use of hospitalsDuring the discussion, it was also noted that the WHO has yet to condemn the October 7 massacre, during which Hamas terrorists attacked ambulances and murdered doctors, paramedics, and medics.

On November 20, 2023, the WHO published an article titled “WHO Shocked by the Recent Attack on the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza.”The report stated: "The WHO has documented approximately 335 attacks on health institutions in the occupied Palestinian territories since October 7.

Donald Trump’s brinkmanship and stop-start approach to tariffs rattle investors

The risk that the US economy will enter recession this year is rising, according to economists, as Donald Trump’s chaotic approach to tariffs continued to hit markets.

Shares on Wall Street fell sharply on Monday as investors bet the president’s unpredictable tariff trade war and handling of the economy would hit growth, amid a recent plunge in business and consumer confidence.

On another day of selling pressure in global markets, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 1.5%, while the S&P 500 was down 2.4%. Share prices also fell in Europe, as the FTSE 100 tumbled 0.9% in London, Germany’s Dax was down 1.7% and France’s CAC fell 0.9% on Monday.

Economists said the risks of a “Trumpcession” had increased as the president’s brinkmanship and stop-start approach to tariffs rattled global investors, exemplified by last week’s decision to pause US tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico for the second time in as many months.

Trump declined on Sunday to rule out the possibility that the US economy could tumble into recession this year as he warned businesses and households to brace for a “period of transition” and the potential for higher inflation.

Analysts said the president could have used the interview with Fox News as an opportunity to calm jitters in financial markets but that he instead chose to press on with an increasingly chaotic approach to his second term in office.

Kathleen Brooks of the trading platform XTB said Trump was putting his political goals ahead of the strength of the economy and the stock market. “[His] flip-flopping on tariffs, and his old-fashioned views of America first, is weighing on consumption and knocking confidence.”

Wall Street economists have downgraded their growth forecasts for the US, warning that Trump’s trade wars are proving more damaging for the US economy than first anticipated.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs said on Friday that the chances of a US recession had increased from 15% to 20%, as it revised its forecasts to incorporate higher tariffs and inflation, alongside a hit to gross domestic product and employment.

Morgan Stanley cut its 2025 GDP growth forecast from 1.9% to 1.5%. “While we did expect growth-constraining policies (tariffs and immigration controls) to precede growth-supportive initiatives (tax cuts and deregulation), their severity has been greater than we anticipated. This is especially the case with tariffs, which have come in faster and broader than we had pencilled in,” it said.

Many economists still reckon the US will avoid the widely accepted definition of a recession – two consecutive quarters of shrinking output – but warn that the latest figures show the risks are mounting.

Data from the US economy in recent weeks showed an unexpected fall in consumer spending in January, a widening of the US trade deficit to a record $131bn (£101bn) in the same month, as firms rushed to move goods before the introduction of tariffs, and the biggest fall in consumer confidence in four years in February.

The Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model, which predicts growth based on available economic data, suggests the US economy could contract by 2.4% in the first quarter (annualised). The reading can be volatile and is influenced heavily by the ballooning US trade deficit, which is likely to be unwound in future months.

“Markets are now starting to get concerned about the prospects for growth in 2025,” said Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS global wealth management. “Trump’s tariff policy has been unpredictable, with a series of retreats so rapid they almost collide with the next tax hike announcement.

“The rather chaotic US tariff policy still allows companies to sell a story to their customers to cover for price increases, and some may also try to raise prices in anticipation of tariffs that actually end up being retreated from.”

Stephen Moore, who contributed to Project 2025, urges Congress to pass tax cuts by Memorial Day

Donald Trump’s focus on tariffs as an economic weapon is “misguided”, and the US economy is “very wobbly”, a former adviser and longtime supporter of the president said.

“I think that the president’s emphasis on tariffs right now is misguided,” Stephen Moore told Fox News on Sunday night. “I think we have a very wobbly economy. We saw a not-very-good jobs report on Friday. The consumer confidence numbers are sinking, and other indicators are not positive.

“The economy needs [a] pick-me-up, and tariffs are not a pick-me-up. What is, is the Trump tax cut. Congress has to get this passed as soon as possible – by Memorial Day. That will provide the stimulus the economy needs.”

Long an advocate of tax cuts, Moore is the author of books including Trumponomics: Inside the America First Plan to Revive Our Economy, from 2018.

In 2019, Trump picked Moore for a seat on the Federal Reserve board. Moore eventually withdrew, after the Guardian reported tax and legal issues including underpayment of alimony – and other outlets reported allegedly sexist and racist remarks.

Moore said “unrelenting attacks on my character” had made seeking a Fed role “untenable for me and my family”. But he told Trump he would “continue to be a loud economic voice advocating your policies” and would “always [be] at your disposal”.

Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Moore was a chapter co-author for Project 2025, the vast policy plan coordinated by the hard-right Heritage Foundation that Trump disavowed on the campaign trail but which is now influencing White House policy after his victory in the race.

Trump and key allies insist the US economy is strong and that imposing tariffs on erstwhile allies such as Canada and Mexico as well as competitors like China is right – notwithstanding Trump’s own warning to Fox News on Sunday, in which he said the US “may” go into recession.

Moore has previously shown willingness to depart the party line.

In March 2024, after what turned out to be Joe Biden’s last State of the Union address, Moore told Fox Business: “Let me just say one thing positive about where we are right now. One thing that Biden said last night was true. It is true that the United States today has the strongest economy. There is no question about it.

“If you look at what’s happening in Europe today, Germany, Britain, France, if you look at Japan and China, they’re not growing. And so it is true … the way I like to put it is we are the least rotten apple in the cart and that’s … important to cheer.”

On Sunday, as Trump’s tariffs policy continued to heat up trade wars with Canada, Mexico and China, Moore told Fox News host Katie Pavlich: “Well, you used the word ‘complicated’ and that’s exactly what it has been over the last week, where one day the tariffs are going to go up and then there’s going to be a delay in the tariffs, and then there’s going to be a tariff on another country; and it’s been up and down and up and down. And, by the way, the stock market went up and down and up and down with these things.”

Elon Musk said X (formerly Twitter) was hit by a massive cyberattack on Monday, suggesting that a large, coordinated group or even a nation-state could be behind it. The attack led to three outages throughout the day, each lasting nearly an hour.

"There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against X. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing...," Elon Musk posted on X.

According to Downdetector, the platform faced three outages throughout the day, with interruptions peaking around 3:00 pm with nearly 2,200 reports from Indian users, surging again at 7:30 pm with 1,500 reports, and continuing later around 9:00 pm as users faced further access issues.

Elon Musk acquired X in 2022 for $44 billion. In 2023, he became the first person to reach 200 million followers on X.

The tracking website showed that nearly 52 percent of problems were related to the website, 41 percent to the app and 8 percent had to do with server connection problems.

Amid a series of global outages of social media platform ‘X’, its CEO Elon Musk on Monday claimed that there was and still is a “massive cyberattack” against the microblogging medium. He suspected that either a large, coordinated group or a country is involved in this.

“Tracing…” Musk wrote in a post on X.

Earlier in the day, the Elon Musk-owned platform was facing multiple outages as per Downdetector, restricting thousands of users in the US from accessing their handles.

The number of outage reports increased to around 26,579 after a brief down trend, the user data on the outage tracker website said. This number in the day went as high as 40,000 users.

In the United Kingdom as well, more than 10,800 users reported an outage earlier in the day. However, the cause of this said outage was not immediately clear.

Several users had complained about not being able to load pages or refresh their timelines on X. They posted saying, "Twitter went down for an hour but seems to be okay now?", while another wrote, "Everyone going to X now Twitter is down".

The services to the microblogging platform, however, resumed shortly after the global outage.

According to Downdetector, 56 per cent of the issues were reported for the X app, while 33 per cent were reported for the website. The tracker website's data is based on reports submitted by users, which means that the actual numbers of affected numbers may vary.

The social media platform, which was previously known as Twitter, experienced a series of glitches back in March 2023 for more than an hour, with links not working and some users unable to even log in to their accounts.

Musk had took over Twitter in 2022, following which he renamed the platform to 'X'. The rebranding of site lead to 'tweets' being called as 'posts' and 'retweets' as 'reposts'.

Musk also switched the iconic blue bird logo with a white X on a black background.

The Emilia Pérez actor, whose offensive resurfaced tweets sank the film’s hopes for awards glory, says public hatred left her ‘on the edge’

Karla Sofía Gascón, the first out trans actor to be nominated for an Oscar, whose hopes of winning were dashed after offensive social media posts were surfaced a month before the ceremony, has spoken out about the “unexpected, devastating storm” of awards season.

The Spanish actor says that the final stretch of the race, was the “most exposed” period of her life. She faced widespread criticism for her tweets, and despite repeated apologies, was cold-shouldered by the cast and crew of Emilia Pérez, while studio Netflix dropped her from campaigns and cut off funds allowing her to travel to ceremonies. A contract with her Spanish publisher was cancelled, and senior politicians in her home country spoke of their disappointment in her.

“Absurd and even delirious accusations were thrown at me, which deeply hurt my spirit. Things escalated to a point, and so quickly, that I couldn’t even breathe.

“Amid this unexpected, devastating storm, there have been moments when the pain has been so overwhelming that I contemplated the unthinkable,” Gascón continues.

“I harboured darker thoughts than those I considered in some of my previous, no less intimate and personal struggles. And I asked myself: if I, with all my strength and preparedness to deal with rage and rejection, am on the edge, what would have become of someone with fewer emotional resources to resist this onslaught? Somehow, I made it. Others would not have survived this brutal winter I am about to wrap up.”

A fortnight before the Oscars ceremony, Netflix and the director of Emilia Pérez, Jacques Audiard, appeared to rethink their previous strategy. The studio offered to fund Gascón’s expenses to attend the César awards in Paris while Audiard – who had previously said that he hadn’t spoken to his star and “didn’t want to” – shouted out affectionately to the absent Gascón in a Bafta acceptance speech.

Some have speculated that this U-turn may have been prompted by concerns over Gascón’s mental health. A number of senior publicists who spoke to the Guardian expressed anxiety over whether the studio and Gascón’s publicists had performed due diligence over their client’s social media history, as well as fulfilling a duty of care towards a newcomer to international fame.

Emilia Pérez went into the Oscars with a record-breaking 13 nominations but ended up with just two awards: supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña and best song, for El Mal.

At the ceremony, host Conan O’Brien made reference to the controversy in a joke saying that: “Anora uses the F-word 479 times. That’s more than the record set by Karla Sofía Gascón’s publicist.” He also asked the actor to refer to him as Jimmy Kimmel.

After the ceremony, Gascón told the Hollywood Reporter that she “loved the ceremony, honestly, I found it very enjoyable”.

“I would have liked to experience it more normally, from the happiness of being nominated, of celebrating, as I am now, full of love, a person who puts her soul and her being into her work and who gives herself to others,” she added. “I am very grateful to return and for how my colleagues and the professionals of the Hollywood industry received me. I am grateful to the academy, to Netflix and to the production.”

In her lengthy statement, Gascón said she had learned a lot from the experience, including that “hatred, like fire, cannot be put down with more hatred”.

“Offences cannot be erased with more offences, and mistakes cannot clean up other mistakes, especially when lies and falseness proliferate all around and when all they send back to me is pure rage, blatant bullying, vexation, scorn and even death threats.”

She concludes by saying that she will continue to fight the corner for oppressed minorities, as “a trans woman trapped in the worst possible place: the body of a criminal immersed in an extreme patriarchy”.

“You will always find me on the opposite side of fanaticism, imposition, patriarchy, fascism, dictatorships, terror, abuse and irrationality,” she says. “I do not bind myself to any political flag; I only try to be a human being in constant evolution, with successes and failures, but with an unbreakable will to learn, listen, admit mistakes, apologise and forgive others as I forgive myself for the unnecessary pain I have caused.”

Sometimes, we put on a shield to protect ourselves, so that harm does not reach our hearts, our skin, or our souls. I have my own armour too, like anyone else. It’s not pretty, but it has saved my life a couple of times. The problem is, precisely, that shields can be cold and hard on the outside and can also hurt those around you. That is what happened to me, to those who love me, and to those who believed in me.

Lately, as I have been the target of harmful words, I have also said hurtful things throughout my life that have caused others to feel offended – things done and said from fear, from my own ignorance, from my own pain, from the outside of that cold, upsetting shield.

With no excuse, and without any intention to justify any of my past actions, I apologise to all I have offended at any point in my life and throughout my journey. I humbly ask for their forgiveness and, to honour their kindness and understanding, I promise I will commit to continuing to learn and listen, so as not to make the same mistakes in the future.

For the last few years of my life, I went out into the world and gave my best to bring visibility to a historically overlooked group – a group that is part of my identity and my own reality. I have been defending and reflecting the life of a trans woman trapped in the worst possible place: the body of a criminal immersed in an extreme patriarchy. While doing so, my purpose was always to do it with as much dignity as possible, showing a story of struggle and resistance that deserved to be told. I poured my soul, my life, and my essence into this project, working side by side with great Mexican friends who helped me convey a message of hope: we can all be better people, no matter our starting point or our beginnings in this quest called life.

Mexico holds an indelible place in my heart. In this magnetic and amazing country, I was allowed to establish my career as an actor, and I have received friendship, affection, and human warmth I will never forget. Since the day my dear Julián Pastor, a legendary film director, opened his doors to me, my love for this land and its people became eternal.

My commitment to stand for Mexico, all Mexicans, and for the rights of the most disadvantaged remains strong. You will always find me on the opposite side of fanaticism, imposition, patriarchy, fascism, dictatorships, terror, abuse, and irrationality. I do not bind myself to any political flag; I only try to be a human being in constant evolution, with successes and failures, but with an unbreakable will to learn, listen, admit mistakes, apologise, and forgive others as I forgive myself for the unnecessary pain I have caused.

Because of my daughter, and for future generations, I want to open an honest discussion and reflection on mental health. Throughout different stages of my life, I have gone through dark moments – episodes in which despair led me to unexpected places. In this last episode, the most talked about and most exposed of my life, several fake accounts were created in my name to add to the pain and confusion. Absurd and even delirious accusations were thrown at me, which deeply hurt my spirit. Things escalated to a point, and so quickly, that I couldn’t even breathe.

Amid this unexpected, devastating storm, there have been moments when the pain has been so overwhelming that I contemplated the unthinkable. I harboured darker thoughts than those I considered in some of my previous, no less intimate and personal struggles. And I asked myself: if I, with all my strength and preparedness to deal with rage and rejection, am on the edge, what would have become of someone with fewer emotional resources to resist this onslaught? Somehow, I made it. Others would not have survived this brutal winter I am about to wrap up.

Now that the storm is calming down a bit, and the worst has passed (or so I hope), I start seeing clearly what I have learned. I’ve learned that hatred, like fire, cannot be put down with more hatred. Offences cannot be erased with more offences, and mistakes cannot clean up other mistakes, especially when lies and falseness proliferate all around and when all they send back to me is pure rage, blatant bullying, vexation, scorn, and even death threats.

Fortunately, I have kept my one inch of sanity to see the light at the end of this tunnel of hate and understand that I must be and do better, and correct my past faults, without engaging in more darkness. Otherwise, if I play their game, and reciprocate and amplify all that hate others project on me, I will get lost; I will never move forward, and I won’t be able to keep helping others still stuck in the storm.

The responsibility to care for ourselves as a society lies with each one of us. As Martin Luther King Jr said, “Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.” Therefore, if there is something that must guide us in these difficult days, it is empathy with those, like me, who have walked on the edge most of our lives, who believed we were a mistake, and then, we made mistakes. As Albert Camus stated, “there is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide,” because it confronts us with the very meaning of existence. I am not quoting these words to insinuate anything or point at myself, but for those others who would not have been able to endure what I just have endured.

Only through understanding, compassion, forgiveness and empathy can we build a world where difference is not synonymous with condemnation, but with richness. A world where we can learn and grow as we go. A world where we can all put our shields aside and be ourselves.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Polish prime minister tells ‘friends’ to cast aside arrogance after his foreign minister and Marco Rubio trade barbs online

Donald Tusk, Poland’s prime minister, has called on “friends” to respect their allies and not be arrogant in a post on X that mentioned nobody by name but was published a day after an extraordinary social media spat between top officials in the US and Poland over Starlink satellites.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, accused Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, of “making things up” and suggested on Sunday he was ungrateful, in a strong rebuke after Sikorski said Ukraine may need an alternative to Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite service if it becomes unreliable.

Poland pays for Ukraine to use Starlink, which provides crucial internet connectivity to Kyiv and its military.

“True leadership means respect for partners and allies. Even for the smaller and weaker ones,” Tusk wrote in English on X. “Never arrogance. Dear friends, think about it.”

Rubio had also said that “no one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink”.

“And say thank you because without Starlink Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now,” Rubio added.

Sikorski had later replied: “Thank you, Marco, for confirming that the brave soldiers of Ukraine can count on the vital internet service provided jointly by the US and Poland.”

Sikorski had been told to “be quiet” and labelled a “small man” by Musk after he suggested that Poland, which says it pays $50m a year for Ukraine’s Starlink services, may need to find another provider if Musk’s service was deemed unreliable.

The US government has already revoked some access to satellite imagery for Ukraine and paused intelligence sharing, piling pressure on Kyiv as Trump seeks a swift end to the war, which is now in its fourth year after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Shares in the Franco-British satellite operator Eutelsat soared by as much as 650% last week amid speculation the company could replace Starlink in providing internet access to Ukraine.

Musk, a high-profile figure in Donald Trump’s administration, said in a post on his X social media platform early on Sunday that Ukraine’s “entire frontline would collapse if I turned it [Starlink] off”.

In a series of posts on X on the subject, that lasted through the day, Musk said later he would not turn off Starlink in Ukraine.

“To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals … We would never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip.”

US President Donald Trump said on Monday that the arrest of a Palestinian graduate student who has played a prominent role in pro-Palestinian protests at New York's Columbia University will be followed by others.

"This is the first arrest of many to come. We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it. Many are not students, they are paid agitators. We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country - never to return again," Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

Indian-origin NASA astronaut Sunita Williams (Suni), who has been dubbed as the "stranded astronaut" over his stay in space since June last year, has done some "amazing experiments" and indulged in over 900 hours of research.

Having spent over 600 days in space so far, for three different missions, the 59-year-old also did spacewalks for 62 hours and nine minutes, leading the women astronaut corps in spending maximum time on the activity. 

Ms Williams and her fellow astronaut Barry (Butch) Wilmore have been at the International Space Station (ISS) for several months. The duo had launched aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 5 last year for its first crewed flight, and reached the space station on June 6 - for what was supposed to be an eight-day mission that eventually got extended. 

They, however, faced delays, space debris threats, helium leaks and technical glitches on the Starliner spacecraft on which they travelled.

Ms Williams is likely to be back on Earth in the next few weeks.

So what is it that Ms Williams is doing while orbiting the Earth, nearly 400 kilometres above?

On the way up to the ISS, the astronaut piloted the Boeing Starliner she helped develop, and which cost NASA 4.2 billion dollars. She, along with Mr Wilmore, saw the Starliner depart from the ISS and land safely on Earth on September 7. She also became the first woman astronaut to test a space capsule. 

At the ISS, Ms Williams helped with a lot of maintenance and cleaning of the football field-sized space station. She and her colleague helped replace many old instruments on the ISS and send back a lot of trash to Earth.

According to NASA, Ms Williams, Mr Wilmore and another astronaut, Nick Hague, "completed more than 900 hours of research between over 150 unique scientific experiments and technology demonstrations during their stay aboard the orbiting laboratory". 

As Ms William's stay got extended from weeks to months, the veteran of the three-space flight was then promoted to the role of ISS Commander, a rare distinction that placed the safety and security of the ISS on her shoulders. The ISS is possibly the single-most expensive engineering experiment ever to be undertaken by humans. It has continuously been inhabited by humans for the last 25 years.

Ms Williams had to accommodate extensive weight training in space, in her schedule, to keep her body fit and in shape as she floated around in near zero gravity in space. At  one point, there were swirling "rumours" about her health till she issued a clarification, saying she weighs the same as she did when she arrived at the ISS. Her "wild hair" also garnered worldwide attention, with US President Donald Trump saying: "I see the woman with the wild hair, good, solid head of hair she's got. There's no kidding, there's no games with her hair."

The astronaut has also taken a long spacewalk, also called an extra vehicular activity (EVA), and has completed 62 hours and nine minutes on the activity. 

On her last space walk on January 30, Ms Williams spent five hours and 26 minutes on EVA in an effort to upgrade the ISS. A fortnight before that, on January 16, she did a six-hour spacewalk.

She has also done some tests and experiments on her own physiology to have a better understanding of how the body reacts to the space environment. On an earlier visit, she ran a marathon in space.

As part of her outreach activities, Ms Williams sent Diwali, Christmas and New Year greetings to humans on Earth and even held a session with students of a school named after her. She even wished the participants of the 2024 Paris Olympics good luck from space.

Among other activities, the astronaut helped with some gardening in space by watering lettuce plants and studying them, in an effort which, according to NASA, could "show how less-than-ideal conditions affect plant growth and help scientists design systems to produce safe and nutritious food for crew members on future space journeys".

Ms Williams also carried out experiments on how to recover water at the ISS through what NASA described as the packed bed reactors, referring to systems that "pack" materials such as pellets or beads inside a structure to increase contact between any liquids and gasses flowing through it. 

She installed hardware for the Packed Bed Reactor Experiment: Water Recovery Series (PBRE-WRS) investigation, to examine how gravity affects these systems aboard the ISS. The results could help scientists design better reactors for water recovery, thermal management, fuel cells and other applications.

While Mr Wilmore swabbed the exterior of the ISS, searching for life on the inside of the space station, his colleague experimented with other microbes. According to NASA, Ms Williams posed with bacteria and yeast samples for Rhodium Biomanufacturing 03, part of an ongoing examination of microgravity's effects on bio-manufacturing engineered bacteria and yeast aboard the ISS. 

NASA says microgravity causes changes in microbial cell growth, cell structure and metabolic activity that can affect bio-manufacturing processes. This investigation could explain the extent of these effects and advance the use of microbes to make food, pharmaceuticals and other products in space, reducing the cost of launching equipment and consumables from Earth.

Ms Williams also carried out the BioNutrients investigation that demonstrated technology to produce nutrients during long-duration space missions using engineered microbes like yeast. Food stored for long periods can lose vitamins and other nutrients, and this technology could provide a way to make supplements on demand. She prepared specially designed growth packets for the investigation aboard the ISS.

Once she returns to Earth, Ms Williams will make another record having flown four different space capsules - Space Shuttle, Soyuz, Boeing Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon.

Incidentally, during her long stay at the ISS, a seismic shift happened in the politics and governance in the US, and she became an unwarranted accomplice in the war between the Democrats and the Republicans. She did not wade into the war of words, steering clear and focusing on her singular job as an astronaut.

        The teacher, who maintains her innocence, is reported to have regularly humiliated Evaëlle, 11, in front of her peers.
    

A French school teacher is to appear in court on Monday and Tuesday after being accused of harassing an 11-year-old pupil who later took her own life. 

Six years ago, Evaëlle's father found his daughter dead in her bedroom in the northwest Parisian suburb of Herblay-sur-Seine. 

He discovered diaries in which Evaëlle had written about being harassed at school, listing the names of people who had “bothered" her. 

One of Evaëlle's teachers — who denies the allegations — is suspected of harassment.

The teacher is alleged to have “regularly humiliated her in front of the class", according to a court referral order seen by French outlet FranceInfo. 

The document also stated that this “repeated behaviour“ led to “a very significant deterioration in the living conditions of the young girl, who became increasingly isolated and defensive". 

The teacher, who is being tried in the Pontoise Criminal Court, worked at a secondary school in the Val-d'Oise department, which Evaëlle attended for six months between September 2018 until February 2019. 

The girl's parents filed a police complaint over the teacher's actions, and decided to move their daughter to a different school. 

Evaëlle died in June 2019.

Know your market, deliver the goods, mind your looks and manners, and leave emotions at the door. Had Vladimir Zelensky relied on those tips from Donald Trump’s ‘The Art of the Deal’, the now historic spat in the Oval Office may have resulted in something more amicable. But the Ukrainian leader chose a different tactic, one also used by Trump – never admitting to mistakes and repeating the same thing over and over again. Where does this leave the two presidents and their countries? We ask Dmitry Suslov, the deputy director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow.

Ontario, Canada's most populous province, announced a 25% hike in electricity export tariffs for nearly 1.5 million American consumers living in Minnesota, New York, and Michigan. The move is a retaliation against US President Donald Trump's decision to levy import tariffs on some Canadian goods and energy.

The revised prices will be effective on Monday. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said, “I will not hesitate to increase this charge. If the United States escalates, I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely.”

“Believe me when I say I do not want to do this. I feel terrible for the American people who didn't start this trade war. It’s one person who is responsible, it’s President Trump,” he added.

The provincial government expects to generate a revenue of $300,000 Canadian dollars ($208,000) to CA$ 400,000 ($277,000) per day by imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity supplied to American consumers. Ford's office said the increased revenue “will be used to support Ontario workers, families and businesses.”

Ontario's electricity tariffs are in addition to the federal government's $21 billion worth retaliatory tariffs on several American products, which will not be revoked unless Trump rescinds his tariffs completely. The US president has suspended his 25% levies on most Canadian imports under the trade agreement for a month as trade disputes ignited fears of inflation and economic downturn.

The provincial premier called for US tariffs to end. “Until these tariffs are off the table, until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario will not relent,” he said, vowing to maximise pain on the Americans as Trump keeps changing his stance “every day” and continues to attack Canada.

“I will do whatever it takes to maximize the pain against Americans,” Ford said.

Trump's decision to provoke a tariff war with the country's three biggest trading partners drew immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China and sent financial markets into a tailspin.

Lots of talk and little action has been the story of the day, as a delegation of US officials made their way to Saudi Arabia for peace talks with Ukraine.

On Tuesday, discussions between the US and Ukraine will take place with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and top Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak among the key players at the table.

Kyiv is set to propose a ceasefire in the sea and sky during the truce meeting, a Ukrainian official says, as Trump tells reporters he believes the talks will result in "a lot of progress".

On the flight over, Rubio suggested that the US hopes to resolve the military aid pause for Ukraine, but tempered expectations that a minerals deal - long considered a key condition for US involvement in a ceasefire - might be signed tomorrow.

Also making his way through the arrivals gates at Jeddah, Volodymr Zelensky shook hands as he met with Saudi officials. The Ukrainian president is meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman but won’t be sticking around for peace negotiations with some of Trump's top team.

Instead, Zelensky will return to Ukraine, as his commander-in chief denies reports that his troops are at risk of being encircled by Russians amid fierce fighting in Kursk.

Following reports of rapid Russian advances in the Kursk region, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky says Ukrainian forces are not in danger of being encircled there.

They are “taking timely steps to redeploy to areas advantageous for defence”, he said in a statement, external.

According to Gen Syrsky, the offensive in Kursk region involves “a significant number of Russian troops reinforced with North Korean infantry”.

Responding to reports of Russian forces trying to cross from Kursk region into Ukraine, he said the Ukrainian army was in control of the border.

Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in August 2024. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think-tank, Russian forces “are collapsing the northern part of the Ukrainian salient, external”. 

The ISW said it was “noteworthy” that Russian advances in the area coincided with the suspension of US intelligence sharing with Ukraine.

Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent

A senior Ukrainian politician has said the cost of President Trump’s decision to halt the supply of weapons and some intelligence sharing with Ukraine will be measured “in the life of our soldiers”.

 Yehor Cherniev, the Deputy Chairman of Ukraine’s Defence and Intelligence Committee told the BBC the US pause “will mean that we’ll lose more and more soldiers”.

However, he did not think the impact will be felt immediately on the frontline. That will depend on the intensity of the fighting. Currently he believes Ukraine has sufficient stocks  to fight on for  another six months. 

More pressing, he says, is  the supply of missiles for US made air defence systems like Patriot batteries – one of the few systems capable of shooting down Russian ballistic missiles. 

As for long range  US supplied ATACMS missiles, used to hit high value targets behind enemy lines, Mr Cherniev thinks most, if not all, have already been used.

Ukraine is now less reliant on US supplied weaponry  and ammunition than it was at the start of Russia’s full scale invasion. Mr Cherniev said that Ukraine’s own arms production had increased more than 20 times. The focus has been on domestically produced drones.

Ukraine has still been conducting its own long range drone strikes inside Russia, since the US decision. That suggests it still has access to some intelligence. How and where it’s getting that information from is unclear. 

Ivan Stupak, a former Ukrainian Security Service Officer believed  Ukraine “did not have a clue of what is going on” – in terms of intelligence sharing. He said it was a sign of the break down in relations between Kiev and Washington – with “no direct communication”.

Yaroslav warns that Ukraine will run out of missiles amid US aid cuts

Ukraine is still clearly getting some intelligence. Enough
to sound the air raid warnings in Kyiv before another Russian attack. But
defending Ukraine’s  towns and cities will become more difficult
without American support.

Russia appears to be making the most of the Trump
administration’s pause in weapons deliveries – launching scores of drones and
missiles.

Ukrainian soldiers defending the skies around the capital
are engaging targets most nights. 

Oleksandr, a soldier with Ukraine’s Central Air Defence
Command, says he was “upset” by President Trump’s decision to halt the supply
of weapons and intelligence to Ukraine. “We were counting on US support, he
says. But if it stops “we’ll carry on fighting with what we’ve got”.

His small unit relies on older Soviet era shoulder launched missiles and a Ukrainian made heavy machine gun. They’re
effective against slower moving Russian drones. Over the past weekend they’ve
successfully destroyed two.

Hidden away are the more sophisticated western supplied
air defence systems needed to bring down faster moving targets. The US made
Patriot is one of the few systems capable of intercepting Russian ballistic
missiles and essential  to protecting the capital and key military
sites. President Zelensky has long been pleading for more batteries. But
Ukraine’s immediate worry is running out of Patriot interceptor
missiles.

Yaroslav, the mobile battery commander, says the US
administration’s decision will hurt Ukraine. “We haven’t felt it yet” he
says “but I think we will feel it. Sooner or later we’ll run out of missiles”.

There is still hope that President Trump will reverse his
decision. But regardless of what he decides Ukraine knows that it can no
longer always count on continued US support. 

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has landed in Saudi Arabia ahead of peace talks with Ukrainian officials on Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters just before touching down in Jeddah, Rubio was quizzed on whether Ukraine could expect to start receiving military aid from the US again. 

"I think the notion of the pause in aid, broadly, is something I hope we can resolve. Obviously what happens tomorrow will be key to that," he says.

As for the minerals deal, Rubio says this is something that Trump "wants to see done", but he adds, "it doesn't necessarily have to happen tomorrow". 

He adds that the US delegation will be in "listening mode" and hope to get a "general sense" of what concessions Ukraine is willing to make. 

"You're not going to
get a ceasefire and an end of this war unless both sides make concessions," he explains, adding that the US will then find out what the Russian position is. 

"That'll give us a
pretty good assessment of how far apart we are," he suggests.

We're now hearing from Downing Street, after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with US President Trump ahead of Tuesday's talks in Saudi Arabia between the US and Ukraine.

A spokeswoman from Downing Street says Starmer told Trump that Ukraine officials "remain committed to a lasting peace". 

She adds that during the conversation, Starmer said "he hoped there would be a positive outcome to the talks that would enable US aid and intelligence sharing to be restarted".

“The two leaders also spoke about the economic deal they had discussed at the White House and the Prime Minister welcomed the detailed conversations that had already happened to move this forward. 

"Both leaders agreed to stay in touch," she adds.

As a reminder, Starmer is set to host a second meeting, expected to be a virtual gathering on Saturday, for leaders of countries that may contribute to a "coalition of the willing" for Ukraine.

As we reported a little earlier, Steve Witkoff says the US never shut off intelligence for "anything defensive that the Ukrainians needed". 

Donald Trump told reporters last night that the US has "just about" lifted its pause on sending military intelligence to Ukraine. 

The pause, which came into effect on 5 March, means Ukraine would not be able to make such effective use of long-range Western weaponry or have access to valuable advance information on incoming threats.

'We just about have' - Trump on lifting Ukraine intelligence pause

We're seeing images now of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with Saudi officials, after he recently landed in Saudi Arabia.

Zelensky is meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but he will not be attending talks on Tuesday between US and Ukrainian officials.

Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, says the US never shut off intelligence for "anything defensive that the Ukrainians needed".

Witkoff is part of the US delegation due to meet Ukrainian officials in Jeddah tomorrow.

"There's been a lot of discussion between our teams and the Ukrainians and the Europeans who are relevant to these discussions as well," Witkoff says in an interview with Fox News.

"I would like to describe it as progress."

Witkoff adds that he hopes a deal on critical minerals will be signed off during this week's meetings.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has arrived in Jeddah ahead of talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman today, AFP and Reuters news agencies report, both citing a Ukrainian official.

As a reminder, he will not attend talks between the Ukrainian and US delegations on Tuesday.

In Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, the fighting continues

Ukraine is expected to push for a truce with Russia in the sea and the sky during the upcoming peace talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, an official says.

Ukrainian and US officials will discuss how to bring peace, though neither US President Donald Trump nor his Ukrainian counterpart will be in attendance - Russia will also be absent.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov says Russia is at "an initial stage of restoring bilateral relations" with the US. He adds that it is "important to understand if Ukrainian authorities want peace or not".

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says “Ukraine has been striving for peace since the first second of the war". He is due to meet the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Jeddah today.

Meanwhile, the war on the ground continues as Russian forces are reportedly trying to encircle thousands of Ukrainian soldiers in Russia's Kursk region, where they recaptured three settlements on Sunday.

As the build-up to Tuesday's peace talks continues, we'll bring you the latest updates. Stay with us.

Fierce fighting continues in Kursk, where Ukraine's military reports more than 100 clashes with Russian forces on Saturday.

Trump spoke to reporters on Air Force One shortly before landing at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland

US President Donald Trump says he believes "a lot of progress" will be made during talks between the US and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump added that he's expecting to see "pretty good results" in the "not so distant future".

Trump also said that "eventually, we have to have peace".

As a reminder, Trump will not be in attendance at the talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Instead, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz will be at the table.

Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent

Prime Minister Keir Starmer will this week host a second meeting, expected to be on Saturday, for leaders of countries that may contribute to a "coalition of the willing" for Ukraine, Downing Street has said. 

The meeting, led by Starmer, will be a "virtual" one held online. It follows the recent summit he chaired at Lancaster House. 

Around 20 countries are believed to have expressed interest in possibly joining the coalition, though it's understood not all would be willing to send troops to Ukraine.

The Prime Minister's official spokesperson told reporters that, beyond European states, "Commonwealth allies" such as Australia were part of the talks, adding "clearly all of those involved discussions are interested in exploring exactly what they're able to contribute, but, still, discussions are ongoing". 

The spokesperson said the UK Defence Secretary John Healey will also be travelling to Paris this week. 

On Tuesday, Healey will, alongside his French counterpart, host a 'military meeting' of possible members of the"'coalition of the willing". 

On Wednesday, Healey will take part in a meeting of defence ministers from E5 countries, the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Poland.

Serhiy Leshchenko (pictured in 2016) is an adviser to Volodymyr Zelensky

Ukraine is proposing a ceasefire in the sky and at sea, but
not on the ground, presidential adviser Serhiy Leshchenko has said.

“You want a ceasefire? We’re ready, but not on the ground,
where Putin would be able to cease fire for a few months and treat his wounded,
recruit infantry from North Korea and resume this war,” Leshchenko tells Ukrainian TV.

“He [Trump] is asking: have you got a ceasefire plan? We say
we do. We suggest ceasing fire in the sky – we’re talking about drones,
missiles and ballistic missiles. 

"We are also proposing to cease fire at sea. We
undertake the pledge not to attack. Which is paradoxical, by the way, because
we hold the initiative in the Black Sea. We are also suggesting that the energy
sector is not attacked,” he says.

Oleksiy Goncharenko also says the Ukrainian delegation will report to Zelensky, who will make the final decision, during talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday

Ukrainian opposition MP Oleksiy Goncharenko has called for a ceasefire "on the ground" as well as in the sea and sky, as suggested by Volodymyr Zelensky. 

As our colleague Vitaliy Shevchenko reports, the Ukrainian president suggests a ceasefire in the sea and sky could initially be agreed, before fighting comes to a complete halt. 

Zelensky is also pushing for US security guarantees as part of a deal to bring about the end of the war, but Goncharenko tells the BBC Ukraine should be "reasonable" about this.

Vitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC Monitoring

As US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia draw near, it remains unclear
what Washington is prepared to offer Ukraine in exchange for access to the
country’s mineral wealth demanded by Donald Trump. 

But we have a better idea of what Ukraine wants. On Friday, President Volodymir
Zelensky said, external initial steps towards peace should include “quiet” in the sky
(i.e. no more Russian missiles, bombs and drones) and at sea to guarantee
unhindered shipping.

Today, the AFP news agency quoted a Ukrainian official
speaking on condition of anonymity as also saying that Kyiv would propose a
ceasefire in the sky and at sea in Saudi talks because such a ceasefire is
“easy to install and to monitor”.

Earlier, on 24 February, President
Zelensky said, external a comprehensive exchange of all prisoners of war held by
Russia and Ukraine should be the first step towards peace.

As for Russia’s stance, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria
Zakharova rejected proposals for a truce, saying the war would only resume
“with renewed force” afterwards.

There is still no sign that Russia’s appetites have in any
way diminished. Officials in Moscow still say the “special military operation”
will go on to capture more Ukrainian territory, and Russia’s missiles and
drones continue attacking towns and cities across Ukraine. 

The strikes on Dobropillya in Donetsk region destroyed several residential blocks

As we've reported, Ukrainian military drones are reported to have hit a Russian oil refinery. This follows an intense wave of Russian strikes have killed at least 25 people since Friday, according to various Ukrainian officials on Saturday.

The deadliest strikes occurred late on Friday in Dobropillya, Donetsk. Local officials say a Russian attack killed at least 11 people and wounded 40, including six children.

Following the strikes, Polish PM Donald Tusk said: "This is what happens when someone appeases barbarians."

Other attacks in the region killed nine people and wounded 13 on Friday and Saturday, local officials said.

Russian drones also struck a company in Kharkiv, killing three people, and hit civilian and energy infrastructure in Odesa, according to the regions' heads.

BBC Monitoring

Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) attack drones have hit the Novokuybyshevsk oil refinery in Russia's Samara Region, according to a Ukrainian media outlet.

News website Ukrayinska Pravda reports that Samara residents reported loud explosions, adding that the nets built to protect the plant from drone attacks were not fully installed.

Andriy Kovalenko, from Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council (NSDC), wrote on Telegram that the plant's capacity totalled 8.8m tonnes of oil per year, "making it one of the 10 largest refineries in the Russian Federation". 

The refinery produces petroleum products -  including gasoline, diesel fuel and fuel oil - as well as transport and military equipment, Kovalenko adds. 

Russian forces are reportedly trying to encircle thousands of Ukrainian soldiers in Russia's Kursk region, where they recaptured three settlements on Sunday. 

Ukraine seized Kursk seven months ago, hoping to use it as leverage in peace talks. 

It follows reports by Russian bloggers that Russian special forces had crept for miles through a gas pipeline near the town of Sudzha in an attempt to surprise Ukrainian forces.

A further thrust there, combined with recent advances in Ukraine's Sumy region in north-east Ukraine, could force Ukrainian troops to retreat or surrender in western Russia. 

Ukraine says there have been more than a hundred and fifty clashes with Russian forces in the past day, with the heaviest fighting around the industrial city Pokrovsk, eastern Ukraine.

Republican faces backlash for saying Democrat shook ‘his pimp cane’ at Trump during congressional address

The extremist Republican US House member Lauren Boebert has been accused of racism, ableism and hypocrisy in one fell swoop after criticizing a Black Democrat for “shaking his pimp cane” at Donald Trump during the president’s recent speech to Congress.

“Al Green was given multiple opportunities to stand down, to sit down, to behave, to show decorum,” Boebert told Real America’s Voice, a far-right outlet, while discussing the Texas Democratic congressman’s ejection from the House chamber for shouting about Trump’s threats to social benefits spending on 6 March.

Boebert added:“For him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent.”

The Tennessee Holler, a progressive outlet, said simply: “Effortless racism.”

One Bluesky user said: “It’s not a pimp cane. It’s a cane. Al Green is a politician who uses a tool to help him walk, just like many of his constituents who are dependent on Medicaid assistance. Lauren Boebert is being ableist with her statements.”

Green, 77, said he heckled the president as a way of standing up “for those who need Medicaid, Medicare and social security”.

Democrats would never abandon the fight to make sure every American has a safe, healthy, and financially secure life,” Green said.

Later, he said: “I heard the speaker when he said that I should cease. I did not, and I did not with intentionality. It was not done out of a burst of emotion.”

House Republicans censured him, with support from 10 Democrats.

Boebert also invited accusations of hypocrisy by comparing Green’s actions to her own during the 2022 State of the Union address when Joe Biden was president.

Boebert said: “You had some folks on the left trying to come out early and defend [Green’s] behavior and compare it to an image of Marjorie Taylor Greene and myself, who were chanting ‘Build the wall’ while all other Republicans were chanting the same phrase, and they just got that one image and acted like we completely disrupted the State of the Union.”

Then, Greene and Boebert’s chanting and heckling led one Democrat to tell them to “sit down”. Later, when Biden referred to the coffins of US service members killed in Afghanistan, Boebert prompted loud boos when she shouted: “You put them in – 13 of them!”

Boebert earned rebukes from her own party. Mike Braun, an Indiana senator, said: “It’s something that I think that there’s a place. That’s not the place to do that.”

With her attack on Green, Boebert also drew criticism for speaking about breaches of public decorum in light of her own auditorium ejection, in Denver in 2023 – for vaping, dancing, singing and groping her date during the Beetlejuice musical.

Boebert first denied behaving inappropriately. After surveillance video surfaced, also showing her giving ushers the middle finger while being escorted out, she apologized.

“Whether it was the excitement of seeing a much-anticipated production or the natural anxiety of being in a new environment,” she said, “I genuinely did not recall vaping that evening when I discussed the night’s events with my campaign team while confirming my enthusiasm for the musical.”

President tells Republicans to support measure boosting defense and deportation budgets before Saturday deadline

Republican lawmakers are scrambling to avert a government shutdown set to begin on Saturday, with Donald Trump’s backing for a temporary funding measure having suddenly silenced the usual conservative opposition.

The stopgap funding bill, known as a continuing resolution (CR), would maintain government operations at current funding levels through 30 September, the end of the fiscal year. Republican US House speaker Mike Johnson said he plans to hold a procedural vote on Monday, aiming for a passage vote on Tuesday before sending lawmakers home for recess.

Trump instructed reluctant fellow Republicans to fall in line behind the stopgap bill that would fund the government through September. “All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week,” the president wrote on Saturday on his Truth Social platform.

“It could happen. It shouldn’t have happened, and it probably won’t,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday when asked about the possibility of a shutdown. “I think the CR is going to get passed.”

The bill would boost defense spending by $6bn while slashing non-defense programs by $13bn and maintaining a $20bn freeze on IRS funding – priorities that align with Trump’s agenda but were previously insufficient to secure hardliner support.

The measure also provides additional funding for immigration enforcement, deportations and veterans’ healthcare, and it could grant Trump expanded authority to redirect funds between programs at his discretion – which is a no-go for most Democrats who worry it could enable the administration’s reshaping of federal priorities without congressional approval. The funding bill makes no mention of social security or Medicare, essential programs that operate automatically and separate from the government’s day-to-day budget.

The House Republicans’ paper-thin 218-214 majority has repeatedly threatened government funding over the last year. Congressman Thomas Massie has declared his opposition, while House representatives Tony Gonzales, Brian Fitzpatrick and Cory Mills remain undecided.

However, Trump’s support appears to have shifted the dynamic for his most ardent backers.

Congressman Andy Harris, the chair of the far-right House Freedom caucus, which attempted to sabotage other funding bills over the last few months, abandoned his earlier reluctance after a meeting at the White House.

“I am firmly 100% in his corner,” Harris told reporters, while former skeptic representative Victoria Spartz, who nearly blocked a budget blueprint last month, said: “I don’t think we have time to do anything else. I’m being realistic.”

Democratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said his side of the aisle is unwavering in its disapproval, saying he expects “that Republicans are going it alone”.

But Democratic responses have fractured in the US Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. Republican senator Rand Paul is expected to vote against the bill, meaning at least eight Democratic votes will be needed to overcome the hurdles – though the lawmakers are already facing intense pressure from within their party to resist Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk’s unilateral cuts to federal agencies, which have already eliminated more than 100,000 jobs.

In indicating his support for the bill, the Pennsylvania Democratic US senator John Fetterman said a shutdown would be “chaos”. “I’ll never vote for chaos,” he said.

Oregon’s Democratic senator, Ron Wyden also signalled support, saying: “Shutdowns are a bad idea. I’m not a shutdown guy.”

Swing state Democratic senator Elissa Slotkin, however, told NBC News on Sunday she would be withholding her vote “until I see some assurances that whatever we pass … is going to ensure that the money is spent the way Congress intends”.

The last government shutdown was the longest in US history, stretching 35 days during Trump’s first presidency and stemming from disagreements over building a border wall to block off Mexico.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabia is to host talks on Tuesday between the United States and Ukraine in a new diplomatic push after an argument erupted during President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s Feb. 28 visit to the White House. 

The oil-rich kingdom may seem like an unusual venue for talks aimed at smoothing over relations after the blowup. But Saudi Arabia under its assertive Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been positioning itself as an ideal location for possible peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow — and even the first face-to-face talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump. 

Here’s what to know about why this meeting is taking place and Saudi Arabia’s role:

U.S. and Ukrainian officials will meet after the Oval Office meeting between Zelenskyy, Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance descended into an extraordinary 10-minute argument before journalists. 

Trump at one point admonished Zelenskyy by angrily saying: “You’re gambling with World War III, and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country.” Zelenskyy ended up leaving the White House without signing a deal that included granting the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals. Kyiv hoped that deal would ensure the continued flow of U.S. military support that Ukraine urgently needs as it battles Russia in the war that began after Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.




Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry in a statement on Friday identified the location for the talks as Jeddah, a port city on the Red Sea. It’s not clear why the kingdom picked Jeddah as opposed to Riyadh, the Saudi capital where the initial Russia-U.S. talks took place on Feb. 18. However, Jeddah has hosted other diplomatic engagements in the past and is home to royal palaces. 

The Foreign Ministry said the kingdom would continue to pursue “a lasting peace to end the Ukrainian crisis.” 

“The kingdom has continued these efforts over the past three years by hosting many meetings on this matter,” the ministry said. 

Zelenskyy plans to visit Saudi Arabia on Monday ahead of the talks. He earlier delayed a trip to the kingdom after traveling to the neighboring United Arab Emirates, which also has been considered as a possible venue for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow. 

“We continue working on the relevant steps with our partners who want peace, who want it just as much as we do,” Zelenskyy said Friday. “There will be a lot of work here in Europe, with America in Saudi Arabia — we are preparing a meeting to accelerate peace and strengthen the foundations of security.”

Zelenskyy wrote online that a team including his chief of staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov traveling with him to Saudi Arabia will take part in the talks. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead the American team for the Ukrainian talks and meet with Prince Mohammed.

Sybiha also spoke on Friday with Rubio ahead of the talks. Sybiha described it as a “constructive call.” A two-sentence readout from the State Department said Rubio “underscored President Trump is determined to end the war as soon as possible and emphasized that all sides must take steps to secure a sustainable peace.”

Trump himself sounded upbeat on Air Force One on Sunday when speaking to journalists.

“I think you’re gonna have eventually — and maybe not in the distant future — you’re gonna have some pretty good results coming out of Saudi Arabia this week,” Trump said. 

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked on Monday about the talks, said: “It doesn’t matter what we’re expecting. It matters what the United States is expecting.”

Since assuming power in Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed took an aggressive posture both at home and abroad. His public image reached its nadir with the 2018 slaying of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, believed by the United States and others to be at the prince’s orders. 

In the last two years, however, Prince Mohammed instead has reached a détente with Iran, hosted Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit and been involved in negotiations over the wars in Sudan and the Gaza Strip. Riyadh also maintained ties to Russia through the OPEC+ oil cartel while Western nations levied sanctions against it. That’s reasserted the role the kingdom long has perceived itself as having — being the leader of the Sunni Muslim world and a dominant force in the Middle East. 

Hosting Russia-U.S. talks, possibly drawing Trump to the kingdom for his first foreign trip in this term through investments and other possible meetings only raise Saudi Arabia’s profile further as a neutral territory for high-stakes negotiations. Saudi Arabia’s autocratic government, compliant media and distance from the war also allows for talks to take place in a tightly controlled country with relative privacy. 

Trump remains focused on reaching some kind of peace deal to stop the war. His approach toward Ukraine so far has relied far more on stick than carrot — limiting their access to intelligence and weaponry. While conciliatory toward Putin, Trump recently also threatened new sanctions against Russia over its ceaseless attacks on Ukrainian cities. 

If Ukraine and the U.S. reach some sort of understanding acceptable to Trump, that could accelerate his administration’s push to talks. However, the rest of Europe remains skeptical as they have been sidelined from the talks. The European Union last week agreed to boost the continent’s defenses and to free up hundreds of billions of euros for security.

        An oil tanker and cargo ship collided off the UK coast near Hull, causing a fire. A major rescue operation is under way involving lifeboats and helicopters.
    

An oil tanker and a cargo ship collided in the North Sea off the UK coast on Monday, triggering a major rescue mission.

UK authorities launched lifeboats and firefighting vessels to the scene some 10 nautical miles out from the city of Hull after an alarm was sounded at around 11 am CET, authorities said.

"A coastguard rescue helicopter from Humberside was called, alongside lifeboats ... an HM Coastguard fixed-wing aircraft, and nearby vessels with firefighting capability," a coastguard spokesperson said on Monday.

At least 32 casualties have been brought ashore, according to Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East. Their condition is not immediately clear. 

Initial reports showed fire and thick black smoke pouring from both ships. Boyers said that there had been a "massive fireball" when the vessels collided. 

The incident involved a US-registered oil tanker, Stena Immaculate, and a Portuguese container ship called the Solong, registered in Madeira, according to ship tracking website Vessel Tracker. 

The tanker was listed as sailing from the Greek port of Agioi Theodoroi, while the cargo vessel was on course from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. 

The Stena Immaculate is the larger of two ships, listed as being 183 metres long and 32 metres wide. The Solong is 140.6 metres long and 21.8 metres wide, according to ship tracking site Marine Traffic. 

The site data shows Solong was drifting at 0.3 knots according to its last tracked position.

The UK Coastguard says it was assessing a "likely" counter-pollution response, although it isn't known what the oil tanker was carrying at the time of the incident. 

UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was "concerned" to hear of the collision between the two vessels. She thanked "all emergency service workers involved in their continued efforts in responding to the incident."

The Met Office said visibility was poor in its morning forecast for Yorkshire and Humber. 

“Areas of fog and low cloud lifting as winds increase through the morning, with some warm, if rather hazy sunny spells expected in places for a time,” the weather agency said.

PARIS (AP) — Military officials from more than 30 nations will take part in Paris talks on the creation of an international security force for Ukraine, a French military official said Monday.

Such an international force would aim to dissuade Russia from launching another offensive after any ceasefire in Ukraine comes into effect.

The long list of participants in Tuesday’s discussions will also include Asian and Oceania nations that will join remotely, the French official said. The international makeup of the meeting offers an indication of how broadly France and Britain — which are working together on plans for the force — are casting their net as they aim to build what the French official described as a coalition of nations “able and willing” to be part of an effort to safeguard Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire.

The French military official spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the blueprint for the force that is shrouded in secrecy and the Paris talks that will consider it.

The force being envisaged by France and Britain would aim to reassure Ukraine and deter another large-scale Russian offensive after any ceasefire, the official said. It could include heavy weaponry and weapons stockpiles that could be rushed within hours or days to aid in Ukraine’s defense in the event of a Russian attack that shatters any truce, the official said.

The French-British blueprint will be presented to military officials from more than 30 nations in the first part of Tuesday’s talks, the official said.




The talks’ second part will include “more precise and concrete” discussions where the participants will be invited to say whether and how their militaries might be able to contribute, the official said.

“It’s not, ‘This is what we need,’” the official said. “It’s more, ‘What are you bringing to the pot?’”

The official stressed, however, that the ultimate decision on whether nations take part in the force would be taken at a political level, by government leaders. 

Army chiefs or their representatives from nearly all of the 32 nations of the NATO military alliance will attend the Paris talks — with the notable exception being the United States.

The official said the United States wasn’t invited because European nations want to demonstrate that they can take responsibility for a large part of the post-ceasefire security framework for Ukraine.

Also attending will be the chiefs of staff of Ireland and Cyprus and a representative from Austria — all nations that are not NATO members but are in the European Union.

Australia and New Zealand, which are Commonwealth nations, as well as Japan and South Korea, will listen into the talks remotely, the official said. 

Ukraine will be represented by a military official who is also a member of the country’s security and defense council.

NUUK, Greenland (AP) — When U.S. President Donald Trump first suggested buying Greenland in 2019, people thought it was just a joke. No one is laughing now.

Trump’s interest in Greenland, restated vigorously soon after he returned to the White House in January, comes as part of an aggressively “America First” foreign policy platform that includes demands for Ukraine to hand over mineral rights in exchange for continued military aid, threats to take control of the Panama Canal, and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.

Increasing international tensions, global warming and the changing world economy have put Greenland at the heart of the debate over global trade and security, and Trump wants to make sure that the U.S. controls this mineral-rich country that guards the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America.




Greenland is a self-governing territory of Denmark, a long-time U.S. ally that has rejected Trump’s overtures. Denmark has also recognized Greenland’s right to independence at a time of its choosing.

Amid concerns about foreign interference and demands that Greenlanders must control their own destiny, the island’s prime minister called an early parliamentary election for Tuesday.

The world’s largest island, 80% of which lies above the Arctic Circle, is home to about 56,000 mostly Inuit people who until now have been largely ignored by the rest of the world.

Climate change is thinning the Arctic ice, promising to create a northwest passage for international trade and reigniting the competition with Russia, China and other countries over access to the region’s mineral resources.

“Let us be clear: we are soon entering the Arctic Century, and its most defining feature will be Greenland’s meteoric rise, sustained prominence and ubiquitous influence,’’ said Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative.

“Greenland — located on the crossroads between North America, Europe and Asia, and with enormous resource potential — will only become more strategically important, with all powers great and small seeking to pay court to it. One is quite keen to go a step further and buy it.”

The following are some of the factors that are driving U.S. interest in Greenland.

Following the Cold War, the Arctic was largely an area of international cooperation. But climate change, the hunt for scarce resources and increasing international tensions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are once again driving competition in the region.

Greenland sits off the northeastern coast of Canada, with more than two-thirds of its territory lying within the Arctic Circle. That has made it crucial to the defense of North America since World War II, when the U.S. occupied Greenland to ensure that it didn’t fall into the hands of Nazi Germany and to protect crucial North Atlantic shipping lanes. 

The U.S. has retained bases in Greenland since the war, and the Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Force Base, supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO. Greenland also guards part of what is known as the GIUK (Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom) Gap, where NATO monitors Russian naval movements in the North Atlantic.

Greenland has large deposits of so-called rare earth minerals that are needed to make everything from computers and smartphones to the batteries, solar and wind technologies that will power the transition away from fossil fuels. The U.S. Geological Survey has also identified potential offshore deposits of oil and natural gas. 

Greenlanders are keen to develop the resources, but they have enacted strict rules to protect the environment. There are also questions about the feasibility of extracting Greenland’s mineral wealth because of the region’s harsh climate.

Greenland’s retreating ice cap is exposing the country’s mineral wealth and melting sea ice is opening up the once-mythical Northwest Passage through the Arctic. 

Greenland sits strategically along two potential routes through the Arctic, which would reduce shipping times between the North Atlantic and Pacific and bypass the bottlenecks of the Suez and Panama canals. While the routes aren’t likely to be commercially viable for many years, they are attracting attention.

In 2018, China declared itself a “near-Arctic state” in an effort to gain more influence in the region. China has also announced plans to build a “Polar Silk Road” as part of its global Belt and Road Initiative, which has created economic links with countries around the world.

Then-U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected China’s move, saying: “Do we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a new South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?” A Chinese-backed rare earth mining project in Greenland stalled after the local government banned uranium mining in 2021.

The legislation that extended self-government to Greenland in 2009 also recognized the country’s right to independence under international law. Opinion polls show a majority of Greenlanders favor independence, though they differ on exactly when that should occur. The potential for independence raises questions about outside interference in Greenland that could threaten U.S. interests in the country.

Thirty-six people have been brought ashore after a cargo vessel collided with an oil tanker off the East Yorkshire coast

It's emerged that the cargo ship was carrying 15 containers of the toxic chemical sodium cyanide

The tanker was carrying jet fuel for the US government, some of which is spilling into the North Sea

The incident occurred before 10:00 GMT, with the Stena Immaculate tanker apparently hit while at anchor by the container Solong, tracking data analysed by BBC Verify suggests

Alastair Smith, head of operations for Lincolnshire at East Midlands Ambulance Service, says emergency crews assessed 36 people at Grimsby's North Quay earlier after receiving a call at 11:28 GMT.   

He adds that nobody was required to go to hospital.  

Earlier, MP Graham Stuart said one person had been hospitalised.

As we've reported, the Solong cargo ship was carrying 15 containers of the chemical sodium cyanide when it collided with the Stena Immaculate tanker.

Sodium cyanide has a variety of commercial uses, from being used to plate metals to dye production.

Dr Mark Hartl, associate professor of marine biology at Herriot Watt University, explains that sodium cyanide is very soluble in water and can be toxic because it interferes with the respiration of animals, and if the sodium cyanide is heated up it can generate a toxic gas.

At this point it is not clear if any has entered the water or been burnt, but it has the potential to kill aquatic organisms through ingestion.

Dr Hartl did explain that marine organisms like fish have a major avoidance reaction so may have already vacated the area.

This morning, the Humber Coastguard appeared to make a distress call via radio to alert other ships in the area that "Solong has collided with tanker Stena Immaculate".  

The Coastguard asked for vessels with firefighting equipment or search and rescue capabilities to assist, at the time when crews were evacuating. You can listen to that recording here:

The Solong vessel was carrying 15 containers of the chemical sodium cyanide among other cargo, when it collided with the Stena Immaculate tanker in the North Sea earlier, according to a report from maritime data provider Lloyd’s List
Intelligence.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), describes sodium cyanide as a white crystal-like solid with a faint almond odour. It is used in industry for metal cleaning, plating and extraction, and photography. It can also be used to make other chemicals.

The agency says exposure to cyanide salts can cause headache, nausea, dizziness, nervousness, confusion, changes in heart rate and drowsiness. In the most serious cases, there can be heart and breathing problems or even death, it adds. 

As we've been reporting, the two ships involved in the collision are the oil tanker MV Stena Immaculate and a cargo ship called Solong. Here is a graphic to help you understand how they compare:

One of the ships involved in today's collision, the MV Stena Immaculate oil tanker, was carrying cargo for the US Department of Defense, US officials have confirmed.

"The collision and ensuing explosions will not impact operations or combat readiness. We do not have a single point of failure," the officials say.

We've also heard from the ship company's owner that the vessel was carrying jet fuel when it was hit by the Solong.

Rowan BridgeReporting from Grimsby

It's very much a closed off scene here at the moment.  

The dock behind me has now been shut and no commercial vessels are going in or out of it. 

In the last hour, we've had a statement from the owners of the Stena Immaculate saying there were multiple explosions on the tanker and it is now pouring jet fuel into the North Sea.   

The coastguard say they are assessing what pollution response might be needed. 

There will be questions about what conditions were like out at sea this morning, but this happened during daylight. 

The Stena Immaculate was anchored off the coast of Hull, when it and the cargo ship Solong collided. 

We are yet to hear any response from its owners about what has happened here today. 

Downing Street says details of the cause of the collision are "still becoming clear", with a spokesperson for the prime minister describing the crash as an "extremely concerning situation".

The spokesperson adds: "We thank the emergency services for their rapid response. I understand the Department for Transport is working closely with the coastguard to help support the response to the incident.


"We're obviously monitoring the situation, we'll continue to co-ordinate the response and we're grateful to emergency personnel for their continued efforts."


The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has deployed a team to conduct a preliminary assessment, as we reported earlier.

Baroness Susan Hayman, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Environment, says she is "extremely shocked and concerned" about the North Sea collision.

Speaking in Parliament, Hayman calls the situation an "emerging picture" and says the department is speaking closely with the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for Transport and Maritime and Coastguard Agency. 

Hayman also says the Environment Agency is engaging with any clean-up needed. 

Independent maritime safety consultant David Mcfarlane tells BBC News that more will become clear once investigators can get on board the vessels and recover data recorders. 

But, he says, "there should be no reason for two ships to collide".

There are collision regulations in place to avoid situations like this - and Mcfarlane says "something has gone very badly wrong". 

These vessels are "quite manoeuvrable", and the speed the Solong was travelling at was about average speed. 

He says it is common for ships to be on autopilot, but there should always be someone on watch. 

It will take "weeks if not months to come to any proper conclusion". 

On the spill of jet fuel, Mcfarlane says it is "fairly light" compared to the likes of crude oil. This means there will be less pollution than if it were another type, but there will "still be another oil spill, there's no doubt about that", he adds.

Dave O’Hara, senior site manager at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) Bempton Cliffs, says the incident has taken place in an area home to England's largest gannet colony and internationally important populations of seabirds. 

"Naturally, we are extremely concerned about the potential for a leak from the tanker as oil pollution can seriously damage habitats and be lethal to seabirds," he says.  

They are keeping a close eye on the situation.  

Around half a million seabirds, including Gannets, Kittiwakes, Guillemots, Razorbills and Puffins breed in the area each year, on the 400-foot-high (122 metre) chalk cliffs. 

The Cleethorpes Wildlife Rescue committee is preparing in case they are needed to rescue wildlife affected by the fuel spill caused by the collision this morning. 

In a post online, it says they have met to discuss how best to help wildlife, particularly birds, that may reach Cleethorpes Beach. 

The group says it is adapting its oil spill response protocols to be prepared for this incident and has set up "a dedicated oiled wildlife hotline for reporting affected animals in Cleethorpes: 01472 472662".

They have also scheduled a meeting with partner rescue group and will be closed for the rest of Monday to work on preparation. 

"If you spot an oiled bird along our coast, please do not attempt to handle it. Instead, report the sighting via the hotline, and a volunteer will respond as soon as possible", the committee says.

Greenpeace UK says it is "too early" to know the extent of any environmental damage caused by the incident, but "both the high speed of the collision and the footage of the aftermath are cause for great concern".

A spokesperson says any impact relies on a number of factors, including what type of oil was released and how much of it is in the water.

"Sea and weather conditions will also be important in determining how any spill behaves", the spokesperson says.

"In the case of an oil spill or any loss of hazardous cargo from the container ship involved, the speed of the response will also be crucial in limiting any impact." 

Niall Stevenson saw crews arriving at the scene

We've just heard that only one crew member is in hospital following the incident earlier. 

Local worker Niall Stevenson tells the BBC he saw a "load of ambulances" and search and rescue crews pulling up shortly after 09:30 GMT this morning. 

He says there were about eight or nine ambulances, and some police on the scene too. 

"It was a full hands on deck" situation, he adds. 

Local MP Graham Stuart says he has spoken to the transport secretary and only one person has been hospitalised. 

"The other 36 mariners across both crews are safe and accounted for," he adds. 

Everyone is now on shore, but Stuart says he is concerned about the "potential ecological impact".

He says he is "calling for a unified command structure, to bring together government, police, Coast Guard, the Environment Agency, local authorities and your MPs".

As we've been reporting, an oil tanker involved in the collision with a cargo vessel off East Yorkshire's coast is on fire.

The two ships involved are the oil tanker MV Stena Immaculate and a cargo ship called Solong. The Immaculate was carrying jet fuel - the company that owns the ship says this is now leaking into the sea.

All of the crew from the Immaculate have been rescued safely - there were more than 20 people on board. 

So far, 32 people have been brought to shore. They are being taken away in ambulances and their condition is unknown. 

A coastguard rescue helicopter from Humberside has been on scene alongside a Coastguard fixed-wing aircraft and nearby vessels with firefighting capability and lifeboats have been dispatched from Skegness, Bridlington, Mablethorpe and Cleethorpes.

The alarm was first raised at 09:48 this morning, and marine inspectors are already gathering evidence to determine the next steps. 

We'll continue to bring you the latest as soon as we have it.

US logistics firm Crowley, which is the operator and joint owner of the MV Stena Immaculate, says the vessel was carrying jet fuel when it was hit by the Solong in the North Sea at approximately 10:00 GMT.

All of its crew of more than 20 are now safe and accounted for - but there are fears that jet fuel is now pouring into the sea.

In a statement, the Florida-based company said: “A fire occurred as a result of the allision, and fuel was reported released. The Stena Immaculate crew abandoned the vessel following multiple explosions onboard. All Crowley mariners are safe and fully accounted for.”

I understand this jet fuel was owned by the US government. That’s consistent with the vessel being part of a US government programme designed to supply the armed forces with fuel during times of armed conflict or national emergency.

The US Air Force has several bases in the UK.

We're starting to get some more images from the scene of the collision now. 

They show a large fire that is spread across the North Sea and thick black smoke billowing upwards. A rescue vessel appears to be spraying the blaze with water.

Evidence is being gathered and next steps are being determined
following the collision of the two vessels in the North Sea, marine inspectors say.

A spokesperson for the Marine Accident Investigation Branch says it has deployed a team to
Grimsby following this morning's collision of the container ship
Solong and the oil tanker Stena Immaculate.

"Our team of inspectors and support staff are gathering
evidence and undertaking a preliminary assessment of the accident to determine
our next steps," it adds.

        The one day walk out has already left thousands of flights grounded at hubs including Berlin, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf and Munich.
    

A one-day strike by workers at 13 German airports, including the Frankfurt and Munich hubs and all the country's other main destinations, has caused the cancellation of most flights on Monday 10 March.

More than half a million people could face travel disruption today across the country, with more than 3,400 expected flight cancellations, according to German Airports Association ADV. 

Passengers have been urged not to travel to airports and are being advised to contact their airline or tour operator for information about rebooking or alternative travel options. 

The 24-hour walkout, which started at midnight, involves public-sector employees at the airports as well as ground and security staff. The strike is part of an ongoing dispute over wages and working conditions. 

The operator of Frankfurt Airport, Germany's busiest, has said that no passenger flights will depart from there on Monday. Transfers are also likely to be affected.

At Frankfurt Airport, 1,054 of the day's 1,116 scheduled takeoffs and landings had been canceled, German news agency dpa reported, citing airport traffic management.

The airport operator says delays and cancellations may also be possible on Tuesday. 

The Lufthansa Group, which has its main hub at Frankfurt Airport, has confirmed that it is facing "delays and extensive cancellations" across all of its airlines. This includes German flag carrier Lufthansa, Eurowings, Austrian Airlines and Swiss International Air Lines. 

Flights have also been cancelled at Berlin Brandenburg Airport, as it warned that "all regular departures and arrivals will be affected by the strikes and therefore cannot take place." Affected passengers have been advised to contact their airline or tour operator for information about rebooking options and alternative travel options.

The airport is expecting to resume regular and scheduled airport operations on Tuesday 11 March. 

Hamburg Airport has said no departures would be possible with strikes affecting several areas including aircraft handling and passenger security checks. Arrivals may still be possible but, it adds, "significant disruptions and cancellations are expected". Late night check-in for Tuesday flights also won't be possible on 10 March. 

It has advised passengers planning to depart on Monday not to come to the airport and to contact their airline. 

Cologne/Bonn Airport said there was no regular passenger service on 10 March, adding that "passengers who have booked a flight for Monday should contact their airline or travel agent before travelling to find out about the status of their flight." 

Munich Airport advised travelers to expect a "greatly reduced flight schedule", saying passengers are "strongly advised to check the flight status with their airline". 

Hannover Airport has asked all passengers who are going to depart from or arrive in Hannover on 10 March to contact their airline or tour operator.

The ver.di service workers union's strike targeted the Hamburg, Bremen, Hannover, Berlin, Duesseldorf, Dortmund, Cologne/Bonn, Leipzig/Halle, Stuttgart and Munich airports. 

At the smaller Weeze and Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden airports, only security workers were called out. The union announced the strike on Friday. 

At Hamburg Airport, ver.di added a short-notice walkout on Sunday 9 March to the strike on Monday, arguing that it must ensure the measure was effective. 

Staff walked out early on Sunday morning, leaving thousands of passengers facing disruption, and airlines forced to cancel or redirect flights. Almost all flights to and from the airport were cancelled. 

Some passengers had reportedly already checked in their luggage and were having problems getting it back, according to public broadcaster NDR. 

The so-called "warning strike," a common tactic in German wage negotiations, relates to two separate pay disputes: negotiations on a new pay and conditions contract for airport security workers, and a wider dispute over pay for employees of federal and municipal governments.

The latter already has led to walkouts at Cologne/Bonn, Duesseldorf, Hamburg and Munich airports. 

Pay talks in that dispute are due to resume on Friday, while the next round of talks for airport security workers is expected to start on 26 March.

The United States is closing 83 percent of USAID programmes that do not meet Washington’s interests. The announcement was made by the head of the US State Department Marco Rubio on Monday.

Rubio said that the “5200 contracts that are now canceled spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States.”

“In consultation with Congress, we intend for the remaining 18 percent of programs we are keeping (approximately 1,000) to now be administered more effectively under the State Department,” he added.

The decision came after a six week review of the programs, Rubio set out, citing their funding as antithetical to the core interests of the United States:

“After a 6 week review we are officially cancelling 83% of the programs at USAID.

The 5200 contracts that are now cancelled spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States.

In consultation with Congress, we intend for the remaining 18% of programs we are keeping (approximately 1000) to now be administered more effectively under the State Department.

Thank you to DOGE and our hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform.”

In February this year, President Donald Trump’s administration announced that it was cutting off more than 90 percent of foreign aid provided through USAID. According to media reports, a total of about 5,800 grants were canceled, and more than 500 USAID grants were frozen.

Earlier this month, the US Supreme Court rejected the authorities’ request to suspend the payment of about $2 billion to foreign organizations through USAID for already completed projects.

Canada's Incoming PM Carney Faces Trump, Tariffs and Looming Election

By David Ljunggren and Anna Mehler Paperny

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Former central banker Mark Carney claimed a landslide victory on Sunday to lead Canada's Liberal Party and become its next prime minister, setting him up for a clash with the Trump administration.

Liberal party members bet on Carney as the man best placed to take on U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened annexation as well as launching a trade war and punishing tariffs on the longtime ally.

Liberal sources say Carney - who arrived on Parliament Hill on Monday to meet outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - will soon call for a general election.

"The Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country ... if they succeed, they will destroy our way of life," Carney said in his acceptance speech late Sunday.

Carney, who supports dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs in response to Trump's measures, could speak to Trump as early as Monday, Politico said.

Carney, who has no political experience, is normally more reserved than Trudeau, who often had a combative relationship with Trump.

The United States is due to slap a 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum on Wednesday. Ottawa imposed a 25% tariff on C$30 billion worth of U.S. imports when Trump last month announced his initial tariff plans.

"My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect," Carney said on Sunday.

Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said on Monday it was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to New York state, Michigan and Minnesota in protest.

"President Trump's tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They're making life more expensive for American families and businesses," Premier Doug Ford said in a statement.

"Until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario won't back down."

Ford told reporters that he would not hesitate to cut off electricity exports if need be. The surcharge affects power exports to 1.5 million homes in the three U.S. states.

Trump's move to impose tariffs has triggered an angry backlash in Canada, where provinces pulled U.S. alcohol off the shelves and urged people to buy Canadian.

MAINTAINING MOMENTUM

Carney won with 86% of the votes cast by party members. The Governor General, the representative of Britain's King Charles in Canada, will soon invite him to form a government and formally replace Trudeau as prime minister.

The Globe and Mail newspaper said the official handover could take place on Thursday or Friday.

The reconstituted Liberal government is likely to be short-lived. If Carney does not call an election, his political opponents have said they would defeat the government at their first opportunity when Parliament reconvenes in late March.

For months the opposition Conservatives led in the polls, often by double-digits ahead of the governing Liberals.

However, the political landscape shifted with the return of Trump to the White House, the prospect of tariffs and the threat of annexation. This coincided with a surge of support for the Liberals, who have ridden a wave of renewed national unity to come neck-and-neck with the opposition party, according to the latest polls.

Now the challenge will be to maintain that momentum and convince Canadians to give a party that spent a decade in power another go - while fighting a trade war on multiple fronts.

"Without overstating it, the challenges are almost unique in Canadian history, if not unique in the post-war period," said Cameron Anderson, a politics professor at Western University.

Carney, former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, will be the first person to become Canada's prime minister with no prior experience in electoral politics.

He has promised to scrap an unpopular consumer tax on carbon, stop a planned increase in the capital gains tax and pledged to remove barriers to trade within Canada.

Liberals sought to compare Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre to Trump in a recent advertisement. Poilievre in turn ramped up attacks on Carney on Sunday.

A 15-year-old Wisconsin boy accused of killing his mother claims he was inspired by a Netflix documentary about the Menendez brothers.

Reed Gelinskey will be tried as an adult for the March 4 killing of his mother, Suzanne Gelinskey, at their home in Caledonia, Wis., according to a criminal complaint.

The complaint says Gelinskey sent a photo of his deceased mother lying on her back to a girl on Snapchat, which led to her call the Caledonia Police Department. When officers arrived at the Gelinskey home, the complaint states that he was sitting on the front stoop of the house in bloody clothing while holding onto a knife.

“She is dead,” he told officers, according to the complaint. “She is dead from what I did.”

Just before the killing, Gelinskey told officers he was watching the Menendez brothers documentary, about the 1989 double murder, on Netflix.

“Gelinskey stated he then developed the plan to kill his parents. He stated it came to him while he watched the ‘shotgun scene,'” referencing the beginning of Monsters: The Lyle And Erik Menendez Story — a recreated scene depicting Lyle and Erik Menendez gunning down their parents in their California living room.

The complaint says Gelinskey “felt depression and an urge to kill his parents” and that he had been taking his brother’s anxiety medication for about a month.

Gelinskey told officers that he hid his sleeping medication and asked his mother to help search for it. When she turned her back, he allegedly “struck his mother over the head with a dumbbell in an attempt to knock her out so he could stab her with the knife.”

He then shoved his mother to the floor and jumped on top of her with the knife in his hand, the complaint states.

He allegedly stabbed his mother five times, three in the chest and twice in the neck, according to the complaint.

“Gelinskey stated his mother asked him, ‘Why?’ and he replied, ‘pain,'” the complaint reads.

Suzanne Gelinskey was found unresponsive “on the ground in the foyer near the front entrance with apparent stab wounds and blood-soaked clothing,” according to the complaint.

“Gelinskey stated he searched the home for a hammer because he was going to kill his father when he came home from work but could not find one large enough,” the complaint adds.

Reed Gelinskey’s father, Ryan Gelinskey, appeared at his son’s Friday court hearing by Zoom but did not make any statements.

Gelinskey has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide and faces life imprisonment if convicted.

A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Wednesday and Gelinskey’s bail was set at $1 million. He was also allowed monitored contact with his father.

Erik and Lyle Menendez have remained in prison for 30 years following the shotgun killings of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, on Aug. 20, 1989, in their Beverly Hills mansion, which captured the public’s attention.

Prosecutors argued the Menendez brothers killed their parents for financial gain. The brothers’ lawyers never disputed that the pair killed their parents, but argued that they acted out of self-defence after years of emotional and sexual abuse by their father.

After an initial mistrial, the brothers were convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Los Angeles County prosecutors recommended resentencing for the brothers in October 2024, arguing that they had demonstrated good behaviour and rehabilitation in prison. They have support from their family, and lawyers have presented new evidence of the sexual abuse the brothers allege they suffered at the hands of their father.

In February, lawyers for the Menendez brothers said California Gov. Gavin Newsom had ordered the state parole board to investigate whether the brothers would pose a risk to the public if they were released after nearly three decades in prison for the 1989 killing of their parents.

The state’s legal standard for parole is whether an inmate poses an unreasonable risk to public safety. That must be determined before the governor can make a decision on commutation.On March 10, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said he’s asking the court to withdraw the previous district attorney’s motion for resentencing for the Menendez brothers, calling their claims of self-defence “lies.”

“We are prepared to go forward” with the hearing regarding their resentencing case, Hochman said at a news conference Monday. “However, we are asking the court to withdraw the previous district attorney’s motion for resentencing, because we believe there are legitimate reasons and the interests of justice justifies that withdrawal.”

The resentencing hearing is set for March 20 and 21.

The U.S. stock market’s sell-off is worsening Monday as Wall Street questions how much pain President Donald Trump is willing for the economy to endure in order to get what he wants.

The S&P 500 was down 2.1 per cent in midday trading, coming off its worst week since September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 405 points, or 0.9 per cent, as of 11:20 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 3.6 per cent lower.

The main measure of the U.S. stock market is on track for a seventh swing of more than one per cent, up or down, in the last eight days following a scary stretch dominated by Trump’s on -and- off -again tariffs. The worry is that the whipsaw moves will either hurt the economy directly or create enough uncertainty to drive U.S. companies and consumers into an economy-freezing paralysis. The S&P 500 is down eight per cent from its all-time high set on Feb. 19.

The economy has already given some signals of weakening, mostly through surveys showing increased pessimism. And a widely followed collection of real-time indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests the U.S. economy may already be shrinking.

Asked over the weekend whether he was expecting a recession in 2025, Trump told Fox News Channel: “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing.” He then added, “It takes a little time. It takes a little time.”

Trump says he wants to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, among other reasons he’s given for tariffs. His Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has also said the economy may go through a “detox” period as it weans itself off an addiction to spending by the government.

The U.S. job market is still showing stable hiring at the moment, to be sure, and the economy ended last year running at a solid rate. But economists are marking down their forecasts for how the economy will perform this year.

At Goldman Sachs, for example, David Mericle cut his estimate for U.S. economic growth to 1.7 per cent from 2.2 per cent for the end of 2025 over the year before, largely because tariffs look like they’ll be bigger than he was previously forecasting.

He sees a one-in-five chance of a recession over the next year, raising it only slightly because “the White House has the option to pull back policy changes” if the risks to the economy “begin to look more serious.”

“There are always multiple forces at work in the market, but right now, almost all of them are taking a back seat to tariffs,” according to Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.

The worries hitting Wall Street have so far been hurting some of its biggest stars the most. Big Tech stocks and companies that rode the artificial-intelligence frenzy in recent years have slumped sharply.

Nvidia fell another 4.9 per cent Monday to bring its loss for the year so far to 20.2 per cent. It’s a steep drop-off from its nearly 820 per cent surge over 2023 and 2024.

Elon Musk’s Tesla fell 8.7 per cent to deepen its loss for 2025 to more than 40%. After getting an initial post-election bump on hopes that Musk’s close relationship with Trump would help the electric-vehicle company, the stock has since slumped on worries that its brand has become intertwined with Musk. Protests against the U.S. government’s efforts to cull its workforce and other moves have targeted Tesla dealerships, for example.

Stocks of companies that depend on U.S. households feeling good enough about their finances to spend also tumbled sharply. United Airlines lost 8.3 per cent, and cruise-ship operator Carnival fell 8.2 per cent.

It’s not just stocks struggling. Investors are sending prices lower for all kinds of investments whose momentum had earlier seemed nearly impossible to stop at times, such as bitcoin. The cryptocurrency’s value has dropped back toward US$80,000 from more than US$106,000 in December.

Instead, investors have been herding into U.S. Treasury bonds as they look for things whose prices can hold up better when the economy is under pressure. That has sent prices for Treasurys sharply higher, which in turn has sent down their yields.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled again to 4.21 per cent from 4.32 per cent late Friday. It’s been dropping since January, when it was approaching 4.80 per cent, as worries about the economy have grown. That’s a major move for the bond market.

All the uncertainty, though, hasn’t shut down dealmaking on Wall Street. Redfin’s stock jumped 68.1% after Rocket said it would buy the digital real estate brokerage in an all-stock deal valuing it at US$1.75 billion. Rocket’s stock sank 14.9 per cent.

ServiceNow fell 6.3 per cent after the AI platform company said it was buying AI-assistant maker Moveworks for US$2.85 billion in cash and stock.

In stock markets abroad, European indexes largely fell following a mixed session in Asia.

Indexes fell 1.8 per cent in Hong Kong and 0.2 per cent in Shanghai after China said consumer prices fell in February for the first time in 13 months. It’s the latest signal of weakness for the world’s second-largest economy, as persistent weak demand was compounded by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.

Ontario, Canada's most populous province, is adding a 25% surcharge to all electricity exports sent to the U.S. as part of retaliation against the Trump administration's tariffs on Canadian products.

The 25% surcharge will be effective as of March 10, and will affect consumers and businesses in Michigan, Minnesota and New York, the province said in a Monday statement. The new fee will add as much as $400,000 Canadian dollars ($277,000) in daily costs for 1.5 million U.S. homes and businesses, it added.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford estimated it will add about CA$100, or $69 a month, to the bills of each American affected.

On March 8, Ford told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe that President Trump's tariff plan was creating "mass chaos," and added that a trade war between the U.S. and Canada was "unacceptable." During the interview, he also said that while he has a great relationship with the governments of Michigan, Minnesota and New York, he planned to impose a 25% surcharge on energy products starting March 10 unless the trade dispute came to an end.

"President Trump's tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They're making life more expensive for American families and businesses," Premier Doug Ford said in Monday's statement. "Until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario won't back down. We'll stand strong, use every tool in our toolkit and do whatever it takes to protect Ontario."

On Monday, the Michigan Public Service Commission said it was concerned about the surcharge, "including both pricing and reliability concerns."

"While the vast majority of Michigan's electricity is either produced by the electric utilities or purchased under long-term power contracts, the imposition of these tariffs could have some impact on prices in the regional energy markets, though the ultimate impact on Michigan customers is likely to be small," the regulatory agency said in a statement. 

Mr. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico went into effect last week, although on Thursday he said he would delay the levies by one month, until April 2. On Monday, Ford said Ontario's electricity surcharge would remain in place despite the one-month reprieve from Trump, noting a one-month pause means nothing but more uncertainty.

On March 8, Ford told CBS News that Mr. Trump has declared "an economic war on his closest friends."

Ford's office said the new market rules require any generator selling electricity to the U.S. to add a 25% surcharge. Ontario's government expects it to generate revenue of CA$300,000 ($208,000) to CA$400,000 ($277,000) per day, "which will be used to support Ontario workers, families and businesses."

The new surcharge is in addition to Canada's initial CA$30 billion's ($21 billion's) worth of retaliatory tariffs have been applied on items like American orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, appliances, footwear, cosmetics, motorcycles and certain pulp and paper products.

National Review editor-in-chief Rich Lowry discusses how the Trump campaign can respond to Vice President Kamala Harris' changing stances on key issues on 'America Reports.'

The U.S. Postal Service unveiled a new postage stamp Thursday featuring conservative icon William F. Buckley, Jr., the founder of the conservative editorial magazine National Review. 

Buckley, a leading voice for the modern conservative movement, founded National Review in 1955 to publish conservative commentary and analysis focused on politics, current events and culture. The magazine still exists today and publishes 12 magazines annually, in addition to its daily news site. 

The stamp features a graphite and charcoal portrait of Buckley, drawn by Dale Stephanos, according to the U.S. Postal Service. 

Historian George Nash described Buckley as "arguably the most important public intellectual in the United States in the past half century" in 2008 following Buckley’s death. 

"For an entire generation he was the preeminent voice of American conservatism and its first great ecumenical figure," Nash wrote in National Review. 

The magazine forged together several ideological branches and provided an outlet for views including free-market capitalism, libertarianism, traditionalism and anti-communism, according to the Bill of Rights Institute.

In addition to spearheading National Review, Buckley also hosted the Emmy Award–winning television program "Firing Line" from 1966 to 1999, which became well-known for its ideological diversity of guests ranging from former President Ronald Reagan, former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, economist Friedrich Hayek, scholar Noam Chomsky and liberal author Gore Vidal. 

"The success and long run of Firing Line proved that there was a place on television for civilized debate between conflicting ideologies that could entertain and inform the American public," according to Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. 

The public policy think tank, led by former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, houses a massive videotape collection of "Firing Line’s" more than 1,500 episodes, in addition to program preparation materials, photographs, transcripts and sound recordings. 

Buckley, a devout Catholic, also authored dozens of books, including "God and Man at Yale: The Superstitions of ‘Academic Freedom,’" published in 1951, about his experience attending Yale University. The book offered a harsh assessment of Yale’s secular academic climate, and Time magazine cited it in 2011 as one of the top 100 "best and most influential" books written in English since 1923.

New York Times columnist David Brooks, who launched his career as an intern with National Review, wrote after Buckley’s death in 2008 that Buckley’s "greatest talent was friendship," and that the conservative icon was an avid writer of letters.

"His second great talent was leadership," Brooks wrote in the New York Times. "As a young man, he had corralled the famously disputatious band of elders who made up the editorial board of National Review. He changed the personality of modern conservatism, created a national movement and expelled the crackpots from it."

"He loved liberty and felt it must be constrained by the invisible bonds of the transcendent order," Brooks wrote.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it is reinstating a plan to recover 100% of overpayments to beneficiaries, a policy the agency abandoned last year after an outcry over cases in which the practice led some Americans to receive shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars.  

In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The agency is required by law to claw back overpaid benefits.

Because of public backlash over the 100% recovery policy, the agency last year had capped the withholding rate for someone who had been overpaid at 10% of the person's monthly benefit. On Friday, the SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments, while the withholding rate for people with overpayments before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.

"People who are overpaid after March 27 will automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment," the agency said.

The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. In some cases, the bills were for tens of thousands of dollars. If beneficiaries were unable to immediately pay the bill, the agency could dock their entire monthly Social Security payment, leaving some people financially destitute, as reported by "60 Minutes," KFF Health News and other media outlets,

In many cases, the overpayments were the fault of SSA. A 2022 report by the agency's inspector general found that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of "effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy."

In the agency's new statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said it is the agency's "duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding."

He added, "We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people."

Raising the clawback rate to 100% from its current 10% will increase the amount of recovered funds by $7 billion over the next decade, the agency said. SSA pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year. 

The revised policy will lead to financial hardships for many people faced with Social Security overpayments, according to the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare. 

"This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices — usually through no fault of their own," a spokesperson for the advocacy group said in a statement. "Many overpayments are the result of errors on SSA's part."

Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, noted the advocacy group supports the government recouping improper overpayments, but said an immediate 100% cut in benefits would take a toll on older Americans. 

"The 'clawback' of payments is especially unfair to seniors who do not have external support to help manage their finances and track their benefits," she told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. "Many beneficiaries may not be aware of an overpayment and could suddenly find themselves without a check."

The reversal comes as the Social Security Administration is undergoing widespread job cuts and a reorganization under the Trump administration. With its staff already at a 50-year low, employees at the agency have told CBS News that the cuts could disrupt or delay services, including customer service delays and longer waits to qualify for some benefits.

While on the campaign trail, President Trump vowed not to touch Social Security, a promise he repeated Sunday on Fox News, although he added that his administration wants to root out "fraud" from the benefit system. 

"I'm not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we're going to get fraud out of there," he said. "We have people 250 years old and all, you know, tremendous fraud," he added, referring to a false claim that people who are beyond the human lifespan are receiving benefits."

The cuts to Social Security's workforce could mean that more beneficiaries are subject to overpayment errors, the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare said in the statement. 

"Trump's SSA also is closing field offices across the country, meaning beneficiaries will have to wait longer and possibly travel farther to resolve their overpayment cases," the group said.

President Trump may want more than the long-anticipated minerals and economic partnership deal to end the pause he has put on U.S. military and intelligence support for Ukraine in its war against Russia, but his specific terms for restarting aid remain murky.

"The president of the United States did not say it has ended. He said it is paused. That is transitional," U.S. envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg told Margaret Brennan in conversation at Council on Foreign Relations on Thursday. The envoy indicated he personally was unaware of what would determine that decision.

"That's his call. And I would leave it up to him to make the decision when he thinks it's equitable or when a pause should be lifted," Kellogg added. 

Diplomatic sources told CBS News on Sunday that there is no indication that U.S. aid will be switched back on.

"I think we can see the impact. It's certainly, on the one hand, emboldened Russia to really step up the attacks. And it's also not just blindsided, but also partially blinded Ukraine," said Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the U.S. National Security Council during Mr. Trump's first administration, on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan."

"And frankly, I think it's going to be an impetus to other allies to start stepping up their own capabilities and questioning themselves about the virtues of sharing with the United States," Hill added. "I mean, this is a two way street. We have to remember that other countries also share pretty vital information with the United States, even if the scale is not quite the same."

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to meet with Ukrainian officials this week in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for the first face-to-face discussions since the explosive Oval Office confrontation between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that triggered the U.S. cutoff. National security adviser Mike Waltz made remarks Friday in the Oval Office that raised expectations that he would discuss not only reviving a minerals deal but also try to get a ceasefire in place, and "drive peace home." Trump friend and envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff separately announced that he'd be part of the team. 

Ukraine's Zelenskyy will not be in the Tuesday meeting. He announced that he would be in Saudi Arabia on Monday, and that a Ukrainian delegation — including key aide Andry Yermak, along with Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, and deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa — would meet with the Americans.

"The fact they are coming here at senior levels is a good indication to us that they want to sit down and they're ready to move forward," a senior State Department official told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.

Ukraine envoy Kellogg told Brennan on Thursday that the Trump administration was waiting on what he referred to as Ukraine's "term sheet" for ending the war, and said the Russian version had already been received. Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokesperson, said in a statement on Friday that Rubio spoke with Ukraine's foreign minister about "all sides" taking steps to secure a sustainable peace, which would suggest a request for Ukrainian concessions. It is not clear if Russia has offered any at all. Kellogg said that Trump has talked about the potential of Ukraine getting territory back from the Russians, but acknowledged that the U.S. president did not specify which territory.

It is also unclear what would trigger any U.S. pressure on Russia. Mr. Trump posted on social media that he would consider sanctions on Russian energy and banking, but then later said in the Oval Office that Putin's stepped up attacks on Ukraine during the U.S. pause was something "anybody would do."

"I don't believe what he said for a second about the sanctions," said Fiona Hill on "Face the Nation." "I believe more what he just said there in the Oval Office, sitting behind, you know, the resolute desk."

"He sees, you know, obviously, the Ukraine- Ukrainians, and he said that in the Oval Office during the meeting with President Zelensky, that he sees them on the back foot, as losing, and he's basically telling them that they have to capitulate. Very clear," she continued

Kellogg said Thursday that there was room for further U.S. pressure on Moscow especially when it comes to enforcement of existing sanctions.

"I think it was between one to 10, we're probably at a seven. The problem is with enforcement, we're probably at a three," Kellogg said. "I think the most important thing is the enforcement sanctions, not to serve the sanctions themselves."

CBS News confirmed via three U.S. officials that the U.S. has paused lethal intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which includes no longer providing coordinates for targeting of Ukrainian strikes for U.S.-provided weapons like HIMARS.

National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency on Sunday confirmed to CBS News it had suspended sharing satellite imagery with Ukraine.

"In accordance with the Administration's directive on support to Ukraine, NGA has temporarily suspended access to the Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery system, or GEGD, which is the primary portal for access to U.S. government-purchased commercial imagery," an NGA spokesperson said.

In a statement Saturday, private sector imagery company Maxar confirmed that the U.S. government had "temporarily suspended Ukrainian accounts" in its Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery program, which provides Ukraine access to commercial satellite imagery collected by U.S. intelligence.

The Trump administration also halted the transfer of any of the $3.85 billion in remaining military equipment designated for delivery to Ukraine. In addition, the European Command told CBS in a statement that it had been ordered to mothball deliveries of weapons already in transit from past shipments approved by the Biden administration prior to January 20th.

Two U.S. officials confirmed that the government is still sharing some intelligence with Ukraine to allow its forces to protect themselves against Russian attacks. Republican Rep Brian Fitzpatrick, of Pennsylvania, a member of the intelligence committee, told "Face the Nation" on Sunday that lawmakers would be briefed on the specifics of the Trump intel cutoff this coming week.

Margaret Brennan is moderator of "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on CBS. Based in Washington, D.C., Brennan is also the Network's chief foreign affairs correspondent and a contributing correspondent to 60 Minutes. Additionally, she appears regularly on the "CBS Evening News," leading coverage from Washington when news breaks on the political and foreign affairs fronts.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is signaling that the Trump administration has finished its six-week dismantling of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development

WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday the Trump administration had finished its six-week purge of programs of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development, and said he would move the 18% of aid and development programs that survived under the State Department.

Rubio made the announcement in a post on X. It marked one of his relatively few public comments on what has been a historic shift away from U.S. foreign aid and development, executed by Trump political appointees at State and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency teams.

Rubio in the post thanked DOGE and “our hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform” in foreign aid.

President Donald Trump on Jan. 20 issued an executive order directing a freeze of foreign assistance funding and a review of all of the tens of billions of dollars of U.S. aid and development work abroad. Trump charged that much of foreign assistance was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.

Rubio's social media post Monday said that review was now “officially ending," with some 5,200 of USAID's 6,200 programs eliminated.

Those programs “spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States,” Rubio wrote.

“In consultation with Congress, we intend for the remaining 18% of programs we are keeping ... to be administered more effectively under the State Department,” he said. Democratic lawmakers and others call the shutdown of congressionally-funded programs illegal, saying such a move requires Congress' approval.

The State Department in one of multiple lawsuits it is battling over its rapid shutdown of USAID had said earlier this month it was killing more than 90% of USAID programs. Rubio gave no explanation for why his number was lower, and no details of what programs were spared or how the State Department would run them.

The dismantling of USAID that followed Trump's order upended decades of policy that humanitarian and development aid abroad advanced U.S. national security by stabilizing regions and economies, strengthening alliances and building goodwill. 

In the weeks after Trump's order, one of his appointees and transition team members, Pete Marocco, and Musk pulled USAID staff around the world off the job through forced leaves and firings, shut down USAID payments overnight and terminated aid and development contracts by the thousands. 

Contractors and staffers running efforts ranging from epidemic control to famine prevention to job and democracy training stopped work. Aid groups and other USAID partners laid off tens of thousands of their workers in the U.S. and abroad.

Lawsuits brought by some of the nonprofit groups and businesses that had partnered with USAID say the form-letter contract terminations purge eliminated even programs that Rubio had said he wanted to save, violated the contract terms and stiffed aid groups and businesses of billions of dollars.

The shutdown has left many USAID staffers and contractors and their families still overseas, many of them awaiting U.S.-paid back payments and travel expenses back home.

Late last month, a six-year-old boy waiting for a bus in Halifax was attacked and stabbed repeatedly in a completely random assault committed in broad daylight. The suspect, 19-year-old Elliott Chorny, was described by her own mother in a Facebook post as a “severely unwell person” whose family had tried for years to put her in treatment or custody in a bid “to try and protect the community.”

Chorny was also free despite having just been charged with another allegedly violent assault, against a psychiatrist at a Halifax day hospital.

Although the Halifax stabbing became national news, its details are far from atypical. It seems like every week in Canada yields a violent crime committed by a suspect who could conceivably have been in custody. The system also routinely releases violent offenders despite a high likelihood that they will harm more victims.

Below is just a cursory sample of such cases. To give a sense of how often this occurs, all of these are just from the last six weeks. And the list is far from comprehensive.

Freedom for a neo-Nazi who stomped a random handicapped man to death

In 2010, 47-year-old Calgary man Mark Mariani paused briefly in an alleyway to empty his colostomy bag; a consequence of his Crohn’s disease. This caught the attention of two white supremacists who were spraying graffiti nearby. They were members of the group Western European Bloodline, and had multiple neo-Nazi face and neck tattoos. Without provocation, both of them proceeded to fatally kick and stomp Mariani; the brutally beaten man was able only to crawl to his car before dying.

Just 15 years later, one of those white supremacists, Robert Reitmeier, has been granted unescorted absences from William Head Institution, a Victoria-area minimum security prison compound often described as one of the country’s most comfortable. It’s the same prison where, in 2019, two inmates were able to easily escape the prison by walking around its fence. They proceeded to murder a nearby homeowner.

 

Immediate bail for an Albertan who allegedly attacked his two children with a knife

This case received a mention from Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who described it in a social media post as “a sicko who attacked two children with a knife has been released back out on bail thanks to Liberal catch-and-release laws.”

Many of the details of the case have been sealed by a publication ban in order to protect the identity of the victims, who are the young children of the accused. But an eight-year-old and a seven-year-old in Grande Prairie, Alta., were attacked by a knife – the former suffering a severed esophagus.

With one of the children still in hospital, their alleged attacker was released on bail and was reportedly back to uploading video game livestreams within two days of the assault.

Court rules that jail for man who bludgeoned ex to death is “cruel and unusual punishment”

This is a bit different from the other cases on this list in that the violent offender remains in custody. But in a late January decision, B.C. Supreme Court justice David Crossin ruled that it’s “cruel and unusual” punishment to expect first degree murderers to serve 25 years in jail before obtaining parole.

The case surrounded Luciano Mariani, who broke into the Vancouver Island home of his ex-girlfriend in 2021 and – in a meticulously pre-planned attack – bludgeoned her to death with a baseball bat.

Crossin ruled that since a mass-murderer would also serve a 25-year sentence, it was unfair to expect the same of someone who had only killed one person. Of course, mass-murderers used to serve longer sentences; 25 years for every person they killed. But this was slapped down by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2022 on the grounds that it constituted “cruel and unusual punishment.”

Bail for suspect in a vicious near-fatal group attack of a young woman

Last September, a trio of quad riders outside Westlock, Alta., were suddenly approached by a severely bloodied woman screaming for help. In a scene the riders would compare to a “horror movie,” the woman had shredded clothes, puncture wounds all across her back, and a laceration at the back of her neck that was several inches wide.

Police believe that four boys, all under the age of 18, had taken the woman into the woods, stabbed her repeatedly and left her for dead. On Jan. 23, one of those accused boys was granted bail, despite pleas from the prosecution that he was a flight risk and was likely to reoffend.

Released child attacker charged with new attacks on children

Starting in mid-February, multiple children in Toronto’s west end reported near-identical encounters of a strange man tapping them on the shoulder before telling them to “accompany him to an unknown location.” In three instances, children escaped the man by screaming to attract attention and then either pushing him or running in the opposite direction.

The accused in these incidents is 34. When Petrini was 18, he snatched a nine-year-old boy off the street in Brampton, Ont., under circumstances very similar to those described above. The boy was then subjected to six hours of sexual assault, including repeated anal and oral rape.

Freed just eight years after the crime, Petrini has repeatedly violated the terms of his supervision order, including being found in the possession of a phone containing cartoons of children being orally penetrated. In one Parole Board review, it was determined “that no appropriate program of supervision can be established that would adequately protect society from the risk of your reoffending.”

Regardless of the number of violations, Petrini has continued to obtain release; each one being accompanied by a police warning that he is likely to seek out new victims.

Bail for a man accused of attacking and sexually assaulting strangers

Leikeze Cheruiyot, 22, is accused of two particularly horrifying sex assaults that occurred in the Hamilton area between 2022 and 2023.

In July 2022, he is accused of ambushing a woman who was out for a walk on a forest trail, binding her wrists and sexually assaulting her until the attack was interrupted by a passerby. A year later, in August 2023, he is accused of breaking into the home of a sleeping 74-year-old woman and sexually assaulting her for an hour.

Cheruiyot was given bail on Feb. 10. Only after the Crown brought a bail review to the Superior Court of Justice was it revoked 17 days later.

Notorious child rapist and “dangerous offender” granted unescorted leave from prison

Corey Newton was convicted for sexually assaulting 11 children in the Niagara Region between 1996 and 2002 – although he has admitted he had as many as 30 victims. He targeted boys between the age of 8 and 14, and specifically sought out children from dysfunctional families – entering into relationships with single mothers for the singular purpose of abusing their sons.

To psychiatrists, Newton showed no remorse, and accused the justice system of trying to “screw me over.” For all this, Newton was declared a “dangerous offender” in 2006, a rare status that is often incorrectly understood to impose a permanent prison sentence.

This month, a CBC story reported that Newton has been repeatedly given unescorted absences out of prison. As per Correctional Service of Canada protocol, the public has not been informed of the absences, or even told where they’re happening.

Another dangerous offender granted community release

Child sex offender Harvey Venus, 38,  also a dangerous offender, is considered a “very high risk to reoffend” and has a history of obtaining release only to swiftly violate his release conditions. His record also contains instances of him completing a sentence for a child sex assault, only to be arrested and charged for another child sex assault.

One of his first crimes was committed at age 19, when he broke into the home of a 14-year-old girl and tried to cut off her clothes with scissors as she slept. One of his most recent involved dating a single mother in order to gain access to her 16-year-old daughter – Venus needed only to go by an alias to conceal his history of sex crimes.

In late February, despite his dangerous offender status, Venus was granted another round of leave privileges, with a Parole Board of Canada document saying it would give him “an opportunity to reconnect with community and pro-social peers in a controlled manner so as not to jeopardize public safety.”

A month ago, Elon Musk called for Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to be shut down, tweeting: "It's just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of US taxpayer money."

It's in keeping with Musk's DOGE initiative, prompting the administration to slash jobs, cut programs and even seek to sever funds for contracts already in progress throughout the federal government.

In the weeks since, Trump administration officials have asserted greater control over the Voice of America's parent, the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Several DOGE aides have been sent to the agency, which has commenced an initial batch of firings of probationary employees at Voice of America. And leaders at other U.S.-funded networks that broadcast overseas fear Musk's grander wish — for a full shutdown — may be coming true.

Those outlets include such storied networks as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia, started up to counter Communist propaganda.

These institutions, unlike the government-owned Voice of America, are separate not-for-profit entities. Yet they are fully funded by the U.S. government through the same federal parent agency.

Were the government to withhold money for any appreciable length of time, "We would bleed out," an official at one of the international broadcast networks said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fear of reprisal.

(NPR has no affiliation with the U.S. Agency for Global Media and typically receives about 1% of its annual budget from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.)

This account is based on interviews with 12 people with knowledge of developments at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which is the federal agency that oversees all these international broadcasters and distributes money to them. All spoke on condition they not be named for fear of recrimination, given the backdrop of government firings and budget cuts. The agency did not reply to two requests for comment for this story.

The networks' mission is to deliver news coverage and cultural programming to places where a free press is threatened or doesn't exist. They are also designed as a form of soft diplomacy, by modeling independent journalism that incorporates dissent from government policy. Together, according to the agency, the networks reach 420 million people in 63 languages and more than 100 countries each week.

That comes with diplomatic complications. The reporting of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has vexed autocratic-minded leaders in Russia and Hungary as well as their allies. The networks' journalists have been imprisoned or detained in Russian-controlled Crimea, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Russia itself.

The network's Farda news service reports intensely on life in Iran and is a thorn in the side of the regime there. The Iranian government, a sworn enemy of the U.S. and frequent irritant to President Trump, is allied with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In December, the regime sentenced former Radio Farda reporter Reza Valizadeh to 10 years in prison for "cooperating with a hostile government."

"Clearly, this regime feels threatened by the forces of freedom, including independent journalism," Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty chief Steve Capus said at the time. "It's why Radio Farda's mission of providing uncensored news and other programming to the Iranian people is more important than ever. Journalism is not a crime."

Similarly, Radio Free Asia's reports on the oppression of Uighur Muslims by Chinese authorities helped to bring their plight to international attention. In 2020, North Korean officials executed the owner of a fishing fleet for secretly listening to broadcasts by Radio Free Asia while at sea, the network reported. Authorities brought in 100 of his peers to watch the execution as a warning of the dangers of tuning in.

According to six people with knowledge, officials at the international broadcasters are closely monitoring deep cuts at the U.S. State Department to international relief efforts for which money has already been contracted. (Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.)

They also see parallels to the financial crisis at the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit organization that awards grants to strengthen democracy in 100 countries. Like the networks, it receives a direct appropriation annually from Congress.

The endowment is suing the Trump administration, saying the White House has unlawfully withheld nearly $240 million in congressionally approved funding, the bulk of it already obligated. 

No concrete proof of such broad intentions at USAGM has publicly surfaced. The question of whether the agency could cut off funding for the networks is further complicated by two countervailing facts: Congress directly appropriates money for them, granting the agency only a small degree of latitude to redirect funds; on the other hand, Congress has not passed a budget for the current year in progress, and the current stop-gap measure is set to run out on Friday.

Trump has announced he wants Kari Lake, a former Phoenix local TV news anchor turned two-time unsuccessful MAGA political candidate, to be the next director of Voice of America; hers, by law, is not a presidential appointment. She legally must await the Senate confirmation of Trump's pick to lead USAGM — the conservative media critic Brent Bozell III. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has not yet set a date for a confirmation hearing. Then Lake has to be approved by a bipartisan board overseeing the network; the White House fired its members upon Trump taking office.

In the meantime, Lake is helping to lead the agency as a senior adviser to Trump. She has made conciliatory remarks to the journalists and networks in her official communications, while signaling changes and cuts may be in store.

"I understand the challenges faced by those who cover news both in front of and behind the camera, and I have immense respect for the men and women who do the job with honesty and integrity," Lake wrote in a memo to staff obtained by NPR.

"Sadly, journalism is experiencing dark days right now," she continued. "The public has lost almost all trust in the media. For those reading this — it is critical we recognize our agency is funded by hardworking American taxpayers, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet."

"I am committed to quickly reforming and modernizing the agency into something the American people are willing to support," she wrote.

In outside statements, Lake has been blunter. "We won't become Trump TV," she said at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, "but it sure as hell will not be 'TDS TV.' You can find all the Trump Derangement Syndrome that you want over on CNN, MSNBC, PBS, 60 Minutes, The Washington Post and The New York Times."

That said, journalists throughout the agency's networks say she has not met to talk substance or her plans with their newsrooms or senior executives. (They spoke on condition of anonymity given a climate of fear.)

Following the DOGE playbook, the U.S. Agency for Global Media has demanded that agency and VOA employees give weekly updates of their accomplishments, in correspondence reviewed by NPR. Several VOA staffers, speaking on condition of anonymity due to fears of repercussions, say there have been offers of buyouts, which they believe will be followed by broader layoffs. 

In addition, the agency has also fired nine journalists at Voice of America who held probationary status. The agency also fired two journalists from the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, which is similarly fully owned by the U.S. government and runs Radio and TV Martí. The agency did so over the objections of Voice of America's senior management, according to three people with knowledge of events, speaking on condition they not be named for fear of reprisal. Voice of America did not reply to requests for comment.

Ostap Yarysh, a host and correspondent for the Ukrainian language service of the Voice of America, was among those fired. He tells NPR that he was pulled in a few hours before his show last Thursday and told not to do any more work. Yarish says the network hired him as a contractor in 2019, but promoted him in 2023 to a full-time employee. He says he was still in the last legs of a two-year probationary period, and hence vulnerable.

"I was given no notice, basically," Yarysh says. "There's speculation this was political retribution. I don't think that was the case. It was just a probationary employee directive and they got everyone."

He said the U.S. Agency for Global Media first tried to fire him two weeks earlier but Voice of America leaders objected, designating him as an employee critical to its mission. This time, Yarysh says, he received a termination notice saying he had not been designated as mission-critical - despite what news executives at Voice of America said.

During the final year of Trump's first presidential term, his appointee as chief executive of the U.S. Agency for Global Media similarly tried to upend it and its networks. Many of the efforts of then-CEO Michael Pack were overturned in court and found to have broken laws.

Pack's acting vice president of legal, compliance and risk was cited by a 2023 federal investigative report as having failed to observe federal law in several instances. That executive, Mora Namdar, wrote the chapter on USAGM and international broadcasting in Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation's suggested blueprint for Trump's second term. Though Trump disavowed it during the campaign, many of his administration's actions have closely hewed to its suggestions.

In her chapter for Project 2025, Namdar called for consolidation of many of the foreign language services, stricter scrutiny of visas for journalists who are citizens of other countries, and the scrapping of many "firewall" provisions intended to protect the journalists who work for the networks from political meddling.

In fall 2020, Pack assigned two political appointees at the agency to investigate senior White House correspondent Steve Herman; it was decried as a witch hunt and found by a federal judge to be an unconstitutional breach of the firewall's free speech protections. Similarly, in early 2021, veteran reporter Patsy Widakuswara had been shifted from her assignment after pressing then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over the January 6th siege of the U.S. Capitol.

Two weeks ago, Herman, was suspended and is being once more investigated over his social media posts of articles critical of the Trump administration. The network also reassigned Widakuswara from her beat covering the White House.

Both moves were said to have been done by the network's news leaders, not political appointees at the agency; VOA's director, Michael Abramowitz is a veteran editor at the Washington Post and former head of Freedom House, the free speech and journalism advocacy organization.

As of this month, Namdar appears to be back on board, spotted last week at USAGM, according to four people with knowledge who spoke on condition they not be named, citing fear of retribution. Namdar is said to be advising Lake.

USAGM did not respond to NPR's questions about Namdar's role at the agency.

George Washington law professor and Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss courts blocking President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's DOGE cuts as Democrats celebrate.

The onslaught of legal challenges to President Donald Trump's early actions brought by federal workers and advocacy groups have found their way into mostly friendly courts, overseen, for the most part, by sympathetic judges.

These plaintiffs have employed a well-known, pervasive strategy used by both sides of the political aisle, known as forum or "judge shopping"– that is, to have a case tried in a certain district court, and one that falls under the jurisdiction of a U.S. appeals court with a certain political makeup.

This strategy serves a distinct legal purpose. While the Supreme Court is the nation’s highest court, most cases don't make it there. That’s because the Supreme Court hears an average of less than 100 cases annually, according to federal judiciary data. In contrast, the 13 U.S. appeals courts handle an average of more than 50,000 cases per year – meaning that these courts often get to rule on the most pressing legal issues.

And while plaintiffs suing the federal government used to have to establish a local, geographic connection to the district where they were filing their lawsuit, Congress broadly moved to lift that requirement more than 30 years ago – allowing the practice to quickly gain prominence. 

As president, Trump "is exercising Article II power to take care that our federal laws are faithfully executed," Mike Davis, the founder and president of the Article III Project, or A3P, told Fox News Digital in an interview.

"That's his constitutional duty. And that includes weeding out waste, fraud and abuse. That’s what he's doing with Elon Musk and with DOGE," said Davis, a former Supreme Court clerk for Justice Neil Gorsuch.

But recent years have seen a wave of new efforts to reform the system and stop the process of "judge shopping," with detractors pointing to a spate of recent examples where cases were filed specifically in certain districts in an effort to yield more favorable outcomes.

It's a strategy both Republican and Democrat plaintiffs have used with increasing regularity. Most recently, groups of Democratic-led plaintiffs filed three separate court challenges to Trump's executive order seeking to ban birthright citizenship within the jurisdiction of the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals, or the Boston-based appeals court whose bench is composed primarily of Democratic-appointed judges.  

Other groups seeking to overturn Trump's early actions have focused on courts within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has a reputation for liberal decisions. 

Judges on that bench moved unanimously to block the Trump administration's birthright citizenship order from taking force, leaving in place the decision of a Seattle district court, and potentially kicking the matter to the Supreme Court for consideration.

Other notable examples include a wave of anti-abortion cases filed in the rural Texas town of Amarillo, where the sole federal judge, Matthew Kacsmaryk, is known for his anti-abortion beliefs and for siding on behalf of pro-life groups. (Texas is also under the jurisdiction of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, where 75% of the 26 judges on the bench are Republican-appointed.)

Kacsmaryk’s attempt to ban the abortion pill, mifepristone, in 2023 was upheld but narrowed by the Fifth Circuit Court. It was later dismissed completely by the Supreme Court, which noted that the plaintiffs in the case lacked proper standing. 

Still, judicial reform advocates have pointed to this case – and many others – as evidence of the lengths individuals will go to in an attempt to reshape the federal policy landscape by way of case law and legal precedent.

"Allowing plaintiffs to pick their judge is contrary to the bedrock federal court principle of randomly assigning cases to judges through an electronic version of drawing names from a hat," Russell Wheeler, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Governance Studies program, wrote in an op-ed.

Davis, for his part, told Fox News that his organization, A3P, is currently working with the Senate Judiciary Committee to draft legislation to end the flurry of temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions that have come before single judges.

"The legislation will require a three-judge panel randomly assigned from around the country; a lottery system" to hear various cases and prevent the uptick in forum shopping, Davis said. Federal judiciary leaders and members of Congress have also introduced efforts within the last year aimed at stopping or curtailing the pervasiveness of judge-shopping.

Senate Democrats introduced a bill last spring that would require cases to be randomly assigned within a federal court district, though it has failed to gain traction in the rest of Congress. 

Last March, the U.S. Judicial Conference, the body that sets policy for the federal courts, issued fresh guidance urging courts to assign certain high-profile cases at random in a bid to stop judge shopping and restore public trust in the court system.

"The random case-assignment policy deters judge-shopping and the assignment of cases based on the perceived merits or abilities of a particular judge," Judge Robert J. Conrad, the U.S. Judicial Conference secretary, said in a statement at the time.

Rather, he said, the feature "promotes the impartiality of proceedings and bolsters public confidence in the federal Judiciary."

At 83 years old, Bernie Sanders has emerged as an unlikely leader of the Democratic resistance to Donald Trump

WARREN, Mich. -- Bernie Sanders is standing alone on the back of a pickup truck shouting into a bullhorn.

He's facing several hundred ecstatic voters huddled outside a suburban Detroit high school — the group that did not fit inside the high school's gym or two overflow rooms. The crowd screams in delight when he tells them that a combined total of 9,000 people had shown up for the rally.

“What all of this tells me, is not just in Michigan or in Vermont, the people of this country will not allow us to move toward oligarchy. They will not allow Trump to take us into authoritarianism,” Sanders yelled. “We’re prepared to fight. And we’re going to win.”

At 83 years old, Sanders is not running for president again. But the stooped and silver-haired democratic socialist has emerged as a leader of the resistance to Donald Trump's second presidency. In tearing into Trump's seizure of power and warning about the consequences of firing tens of thousands of government workers, Sanders is bucking the wishes of those who want Democrats to focus on the price of eggs or “roll over and play dead.”

For now, at least, Sanders stands alone as the only elected progressive willing to mount a national campaign to harness the fear and anger of the sprawling anti-Trump movement. 

He drew a crowd of 4,000 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Friday night. He faced another 2,600 or so the next morning a few hours away in Altoona, Wisconsin, a town of less than 10,000 residents. And his crowd of 9,000 in suburban Detroit exceeded his own team's expectations. By design, each stop was in a swing U.S. House district represented by a Republican.

Sanders, who was just elected to his fourth Senate term from Vermont, conceded that this is not the role he expected to play at this stage of his career.

In fact, his team intentionally waited in the early weeks of the Trump presidency to launch what they are now calling his “stop oligarchy tour” to see if a high-profile Democrat would fill the leadership void. Instead, Sanders — who is not a Democrat himself despite allying with Senate Democrats and running twice for the party's presidential nomination — has people wondering if he's considering another White House bid.

“This is like presidential campaign rallies, isn’t it? But I’m not running for president, and this is not a campaign,” Sanders told The Associated Press. “You gotta do what you gotta do. The country’s in trouble and I want to play my role.” 

Since losing the White House, Democrats across Washington have struggled to coalesce behind a consistent message or messenger to stop Trump's aggressive moves to slash the government workforce, weaken federal oversight and empower tech titan Elon Musk to execute his vision. 

There has been no centralized movement to organize the anti-Trump resistance.

“You look around — who else is doing it? No one,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said of Sanders' efforts. “My hope is that the dam will break in terms of Democrats going on the offense ... We need to take the argument directly to the people.” 

Ocasio-Cortez, a longtime Sanders ally, said she would join him on the road in the coming weeks. She's also planning solo appearances in Republican-held congressional districts in Pennsylvania and New York — and perhaps others in places where Republicans have declined to hold in-person town halls where they might face protests. 

“It’s not about whether Bernie should or shouldn’t be doing this. It’s about that we all should,” she said. “But he is unique in this country, and so long as we are blessed to have that capacity on our side, I think we should be thankful for it.”

Beyond Sanders' tour, angry voters have so far relied on grassroots groups like Indivisible to organize a series of local protests. They have been effective in pressuring Trump's allies in some cases. A number of House Republicans facing angry questions have criticized Musk or questioned the cuts being carried out at his allies' behest.

Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, who has been critical of many Democratic leaders, praised Sanders for stepping up.

“I wish more Democrats were traveling the country, including to red states, to rally the the majority against Musk and Project 2025,” Levin said. “Sure as hell beats (House Democratic leader Hakeem) Jeffries traveling the country for his children’s book tour during a constitutional crisis.”

During last month's congressional recess, Jeffries made two appearances to promote a children's book about democracy. He has also traveled to support House Democrats. This past weekend, he was in Selma, Alabama, to mark the 60th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.

The truth is that few, if any, Democratic leaders have the capacity to draw such crowds on short notice or organize the related logistics on a national scale. The party’s nascent class of 2028 presidential prospects, a group that includes California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, have limited national profiles and they have been reluctant to step too far into the national spotlight so far. 

Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, among the more outspoken Trump critics in Congress, said that Democrats must be better organized. 

“People are desperate to be plugged into action right now. People see the threat. They are anxious and angry and motivated and they want to be sent in a direction to help,” he said. 

Murphy acknowledged that Sanders still has plenty of detractors within the Democratic Party who view him and his progressive policy ideas — replacing private and job-based health insurance with a government-funded “Medicare for All” plan, free public college, and the “Green New Deal” on climate policy — as too radical.

Indeed, it was just five years ago when Democrats coalesced around Joe Biden to effectively block Sanders from winning the party's 2020 presidential nomination. 

“There still are a lot of folks who view Bernie as a danger to the party," Murphy said, "whereas I see his message as the core of what we need to build on.”

Sanders was a staunch supporter of Biden over the last four years but criticized the Democratic Party in the aftermath of Kamala Harris' loss last fall, declaring that Trump's victory was possible only because Democrats had “abandoned” the working class.

United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who introduced Sanders in Michigan, said more Democrats need to "follow his lead to focus on working-class people and working-class issues."

“They’ve got to take a hard look in the mirror, in my opinion, and decide who the hell they want to represent," Fain said of Democrats. “We’ve been clear as a union, if they aren’t looking out for working-class people, we’re not going to be there for them.”

The voters who packed venues across Wisconsin and Michigan over the weekend composed a diverse group, including some who did not support Sanders’ past presidential campaigns. Most said that Democratic leaders have not done enough to stop Trump. 

“I’m here because I’m afraid for our country. The last six weeks have been horrible,” said Diana Schack, a 72-year-old retired lawyer who attended her first Sanders rally on Saturday. “I am becoming a more avid Bernie fan, especially in light of the work he’s doing traveling around the country. These are not normal times.”

In Kenosha the night before, Amber Schulz, a 50-year-old medical worker, demanded that her party “step up and do something.” 

“Bernie is the only politician I trust,” she said.

Tony Gonzales, 56, an independent from Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, said he's worried that Trump will “dismantle historic American standards” and try to stay in office beyond this term. The Constitution bars presidents from serving more than two terms, even as Trump has suggested he deserves a third.

“It's a dangerous time right now,” Gonzales said. “What Bernie has to say — and the turnout — is important. His voice is still being heard.”

Sanders delivered the same fiery populist message over the weekend that he has for decades, seizing on the nation's economic inequality to call for free health care, free public higher education and stronger social safety net programs. Sanders was especially focused on the team of billionaires Trump has appointed to serve as leaders in his administration, including Musk and a half dozen others. 

“They want to dismantle the federal government and cut programs that working people desperately need," Sanders warned. 

“Yes, the oligarchs are enormously powerful. They have endless amounts of money. They control our economy. They own much of the media, and they have enormous influence over our political system,” he continued. “But from the bottom of my heart, I believe that if we stand together, we can beat them.”

It’s unclear how long that Sanders, an octogenarian who was hospitalized for a heart condition during his 2020 campaign, will continue in this role. A spokesperson said Sanders hasn't had any health issues since the 2019 episode. 

He is not expected to slow down anytime soon. Sanders is leaning on his 2020 presidential campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, to organize his stops, backed by a handful of former presidential campaign staffers working on a contract basis. 

Shakir, who lost his bid to become the new chair of the Democratic National Committee, acknowledged strategic differences within the party about how best to combat Trump.

Last month, veteran political strategist James Carville penned an opinion piece calling for Democrats to “roll over and play dead,” betting that Trump and his party would ultimately suffer a political backlash from voters for going too far. 

“One theory is you can play dead; you can strategically retreat,” Shakir said. “Or, you play alive, and you go out to people and you talk to them with conviction and integrity.”

The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) continues falling despite efforts by President Trump to give the crypto world more of what it wants, including a strategic bitcoin reserve that the administration touted at the end of last week while hosting crypto executives at the White House.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell near $78,000 on Monday, hitting its lowest level since the days following Trump's election victory last November. It is now down 28% from its all-time high above $109,000 the day of Trump's inauguration in January.

Other digital assets beyond bitcoin also fell Monday, including ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP).

Trump’s pro-crypto stance was enough to lift digital assets higher in the period after his November election due to widespread optimism about a more favorable approach to the industry in Washington, D.C.

But that pro-crypto stance is no longer enough to overcome a variety of other economic worries, including growing concerns about the US economy and Trump’s unpredictable trade policy.

"While the early parts of the crypto sell-off in January and early February had nothing to do with the global macro picture, the last two weeks have 100% been driven by the equity market tantrum," Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer for crypto asset manager Arca, said in a Monday note.

There was also some disappointment within the crypto industry about Trump’s bitcoin reserve announcement last week. Some were hoping the government would make it clear that it would be buying more digital assets, as opposed to simply seeding the stockpile with crypto already seized in legal proceedings.

"The market reaction reflects a reset in expectations," Haider Rafique, chief marketing officer for crypto exchange OKX, said via email.

While Rafique said he considers the reserve a "milestone" that “cements bitcoin’s legitimacy on the global stage," he pointed out that the order won’t immediately drive more demand for the world’s largest cryptocurrency — thus "disappointing those expecting aggressive accumulation" by the US government.

Monday’s move down was the latest example of how bitcoin’s price has whipsawed in recent weeks as it experienced its worst correction since a 2022 meltdown.

"Crypto is still a risk asset, and also it needs more liquidity," MarketVector’s Martin Leinweber told Yahoo Finance last week.

The bitcoin strategic reserve announced last week was one of Trump's biggest promises to the crypto world, something he touted while on the campaign trail last year while pledging to make the US the "crypto capital of the planet."

Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks said on X that the US government owns an estimated 200,000 bitcoins worth over $17 billion after selling off about half of what it acquired through criminal seizures, although he said there has never been a complete audit.

Had the government not sold that sum for roughly $360 million over the last decade, according to White House officials, its bitcoin holdings would potentially be worth $17 billion more.

Sacks said the US will not sell any bitcoin once it is in the reserve and that it will be kept as a store of value.

The reserve, he added, "is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called 'digital gold.'"

One unknown question about the reserve announced last week by Sacks and Trump is whether it will be used to buy more bitcoin beyond the assets already held by the US government.

Sacks said that the secretaries of Treasury and Commerce have the authorization “to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC Friday that seized crypto assets would go into the reserve first and "then we'll see what the way forward is for more acquisitions for the reserve. And we're starting with bitcoin, but it's an overall crypto reserve."

But Sacks made it clear the government would not acquire additional assets for that stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings.

Coinbase Global (COIN) CEO Brain Armstrong told Yahoo Finance that because "the United States government is now a holder of bitcoin, maybe a buyer," he thinks "the rest of the G20 [countries] are going to see that as a signal that bitcoin is really the successor to the gold standard."

Trump, he added, “really breathed life back into this industry."

            The rout on Wall Street steepened Monday afternoon as US stocks plunged and the Dow fell 1,000 points — its largest single-day decline since December.
    


            The widespread selloff was mostly driven by concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on economic growth. In an interview that aired Sunday, Trump said the US economy would see “a period of transition” and refused to rule out a recession.
    


            When asked on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo” if he was expecting a recession this year, Trump said “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big.”
    


            The Dow’s losses equal 2.5%. The broader S&P 500 also plunged, dropping by 3.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite plummeted 4.6%.
    


            Tech stocks were leading the selloff Monday, weighing on the S&P 500 and dragging the Nasdaq into correction territory. As of the afternoon, the S&P 500 was down 9% from its record high on February 19, and the Nasdaq was on track for its worst day since September 2022.
    


            The “Magnificent Seven” of tech stocks — Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) — were all in the red on Monday, driving the broad selloff.
    


            “President Trump’s comments not necessarily taking a recession off the table unnerved investors who were already unnerved,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise.
    


            Tesla was down 14.8% on Monday. After the US presidential election in November, shares of Tesla surged. However, Tesla stock is down more than 44% this year, wiping out its gains since November.
    


            The company’s shares have taken a massive hit in recent weeks amid protests against CEO Elon Musk for his oversized role in the Trump administration, as well as slumping sales in Europe.

            Nvidia fell 5% and Palantir (PLTR), another star of the artificial intelligence trade, slid 10%.
    


            “When stocks overextend on the upside, they overextend on the downside,” said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email.
    


            The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged to its highest level this year. “Extreme fear” has been the sentiment driving markets for the past two weeks, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index.
    


            “This uncertainty has been swirling in the market,” Saglimbene said.
    


            Stocks have been hammered so far this month amid uncertainty around Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff policy. The S&P 500 slid 3.1% last week, posting its worst week since September.
    


            Trump threatened a massive tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico but then announced a reprieve until April 2. He doubled the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20% from 10%, and a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports is set to take effect March 12. In addition, Trump threatened last week to enact a 250% tariff on Canadian dairy products and a “tremendously high” tariff on its lumber. On Sunday he told Fox that tariffs may still “go up as time goes by.”



            “The talk of tariffs is, in a lot of ways, worse than the implementation of them,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group. “The tariff talk, reversal, speculation, and chaos only fosters uncertainty.”
    


            “I do not believe the administration knows how the tariff situation will play out, but if I were a betting man I would say that it will persist long enough to do damage to economic activity for at least a quarter or two, and ultimately result in a deal with different countries that make everyone wonder why we went through all the fuss,” he said in a note Monday.

            The yield on the 10-year US Treasury slid to 4.215% as investors snapped up government bonds, signaling concerns about uncertainty and economic growth.

            A recession is commonly defined by two consecutive negative quarters of gross domestic product growth. The National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee, the official arbiters, says a recession “involves a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.”
    


            “How long this period of investor caution persists depends on how quickly it will take the global trade clouds, and the resulting threat of recession, to dissipate,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, in a note Monday.

Not every sector is getting pummeled by the Trump tariff rout that is currently enveloping the broader markets.

Consumer staples — from companies that sell soda to those offering healthcare services and energy — continue to attract their fair share of inflows as traders seek out businesses less tied to economic cyclicality. Case in point in Monday's highly volatile trading session.

Shares of Coca-Cola (KO) are up 2% on the session, while rival PepsiCo (PEP) is up 3%. Procter & Gamble (PG) shares are up 1.2%. The iShares US Healthcare ETF (IYH) is up slightly, powered by gains in top holdings Merck (MRK) and Amgen (AMGN).

The IYH has tacked on 1.2% in March. The three aforementioned stocks have all notched gains so far in March, compared to a 3.1% drop for the S&P 500.

Watch: Gap CEO is monitoring tariffs every hour

The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) — comprised of key US utilities like Duke Energy (DUK) and Constellation Energy (CEG) — is up about 1%. It's relatively unchanged in March, outperforming the S&P 500.

Health Care (XLV), Utilities (XLU), and Consumer Staples (XLP) are some of the best-performing sectors of the S&P 500 this year.

The shift to staples has been dramatic enough to push the ratio of consumer staples stocks to consumer discretionary stock from a multiyear low to a multi-month high, according to new data from Sundial Capital Research.

"On a relative basis, staples are more defensive, and portfolio managers live in a relative world. And as much as tariff concerns are dominating, the market is growing increasingly concerned about an economic slowdown. So traders are going back to the traditional playbook, irrespective of tariffs, toward staples, in which products will still need to be bought even if the economy slows," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told me.

Meantime, the broader market continues to take it on the chin.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) plunged more than 600 points in afternoon trading Monday as traders grew antsy on the economic growth outlook with Trump tariffs lurking. Trump not ruling out a recession in a Sunday Fox News interview hasn't helped the increasingly bearish sentiment.

The Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) finished below its closely watched 200-day moving average last week for the first time in nearly two years, per data from Creative Planning chief market strategist Charlie Bilello. The 200-day moving average is a technical measure of longer-term sentiment on an index or stock.

It represented the end of the second-longest uptrend in history for the Nasdaq 100 at 497 days. During this stretch, the Nasdaq 100 notched a 73% return.

The Dow, Nasdaq Composite, and S&P 500 (^GSPC) are all lower on the year. The Nasdaq has been the worst performer with a nearly 10% drop.

"Anything is possible in Trump World. We can't rule out the possibility that a bear market started on Feb. 20, the day after the S&P 500 rose to a record high. It could be like the 'flash crashes' that occurred during 1962 and 1987. It could happen quickly and reverse just as quickly. So the sell-off could provide buying opportunities, especially in overvalued names that are now less so," said longtime market watcher Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research.

Listen: Why this toy CEO is worried about tariffs

BCA Research's veteran strategist Peter Berezin said in a new piece of research that he sees a 75% chance of a recession within the next three months. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius has raised his US recession probability to 20% from 15%.

"In this administration, there's a different focus, I think, on the tariff discussion where the administration is looking at trade imbalances and trying to use tariffs against many different companies in a more universal fashion. And so that has created, at least in the short term, a lot more uncertainty," Newell Brands (NWL) CEO Chris Peterson told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.

Deribit-listed bitcoin (BTC) futures set to expire this Friday now trade marginally below the exchange’s index price, flashing a discount in a sign of weak demand for the cryptocurrency.

“What we have seen is that near-tenor (7d and shorter) yields have dipped to the negative for the first time in over a year,” Andrew Melville, a research analyst at Block Scholes told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “This means that futures prices are trading below spot, which we take as a significantly bearish indicator.”

Deribit is the world’s leading crypto options exchange and a preferred venue for sophisticated traders looking to employ synthetic strategies involving futures, options and spot markets.

Three separate outages appeared to hit Elon Musk's X social media site Monday, as the tech titan claimed it was suffering a "massive cyberattack." 

Thousands of reports of trouble accessing or using the site were first registered by Downdetector.com around 5:30 a.m. ET Monday. It took about an hour before those issues subsided.

Then, around 9:30 a.m., the issues appeared to flare up again, with as many as 40,000 outage reports detected. It again took about an hour for that incident to dissipate. 

Finally, around 11:10 a.m., the issues cropped up again, according to Downdetector. 

A representative for X could not immediately be reached for comment.

On Monday afternoon, Musk posted to X that there had been a "massive cyberattack" against the site. 

"We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources," Musk said. "Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved." 

Though he didn’t post any evidence of a cyberattack, experts said that the outage was consistent with a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, a rudimentary but sometimes effective hacker tactic to overwhelm a website with traffic, effectively knocking it offline.

Isik Mater, the director of research at NetBlocks, a company that tracks global internet connectivity, told NBC News that X had suffered intermittent outages since Monday morning. While establishing a DDoS attack with certainty can be difficult, Mater said Musk’s claim was plausible.

“It’s difficult to be certain, but given the pattern of three observed outages, a denial service attack targeting X’s infrastructure can’t be ruled out,” she said. “It’s certainly one of the longest X/Twitter outages in our records.”

Goldman Sachs is the latest Wall Street firm to grow more concerned about the path forward for the US economy as President Trump's tariff policies become reality.

In a research note on Monday, Goldman's economics team led by Jan Hatzius slashed its 2025 GDP forecast to 1.7% from 2.4%.

"The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse," Hatzius wrote.

In its note, Goldman also boosted its projection for the Fed's preferred inflation gauge to end the year at 3%, up from a prior call in the mid 2% range.

Hatzius noted these updates mark the first time in about two and a half years that his team has projected GDP growth below Bloomberg consensus data, which currently calls for GDP growth north of 2% this year.

Goldman is the latest in a slew of forecasting teams that now see a more dire outlook for the US economy.

In a note to clients on Friday, Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen moved his 2025 growth forecast down to 1.5% from 1.9% previously.

Gapen also sees the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — the "core" Personal Consumption Expenditures index — ending the year higher, projecting core PCE to end 2025 at 2.7%, up from a previous projection of 2.5%.

In its note on Monday, Goldman's team said it now sees the average US tariff rate rising by 10 percentage points this year, twice their previous forecast and five times the level seen during Trump's first administration.

Tariffs weigh on the overall economic outlook through three key levers, Hatzius wrote.

First, the new duties are expected to push up consumer prices and, therefore, cut real income for consumers. Second, they usually come alongside tighter financial conditions. And third, the uncertainty surrounding the tariff implementation will likely prompt businesses to "delay investment."

Hatzius believes the combination of slower growth and sticky inflation can still leave room for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice this year in June and December.

But for now, Trump's policy uncertainty likely keeps the central bank holding rates steady.

"Our near-term view is that the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] will want to stay on the sidelines and make as little news as possible until the policy outlook has become clearer," Hatzius said.

And while still not the base case, discussions of recession have also picked up from various sources.

Former PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian told Yahoo Finance Monday he now sees a 25% to 30% chance the US economy enters recession this year, up from a 10% chance seen before the Trump tariff bonanza began.

Betting markets are pricing in an increasing chance the US economy tips into recession, with Polymarket placing the odds that a US recession is officially called by year-end at roughly 40% as of Monday, up from a 23% chance on Feb. 27.

The downshift in economic growth forecasts has also coincided with a broad risk-off trade in the stock market. On Monday, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down more than 3%, led by large losses in popular tech names like Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA).

If you receive more Social Security benefits than you are owed, you may face a 100% default withholding rate from your monthly checks once a new policy goes into effect.

The change announced last week by the Social Security Administration marks a reversal from a 10% default withholding rate that was put in place last year after some beneficiaries received letters demanding immediate repayments for sums that were sometimes tens of thousands of dollars.

The discrepancy — called overpayments — happens when Social Security beneficiaries receive more money than they are owed.

The erroneous payment amounts may occur when beneficiaries fail to report to the Social Security Administration changes in their circumstances that may affect their benefits, according to a 2024 Congressional Research Service report. Overpayments can also happen if the agency does not process the information promptly or due to errors in the way data was entered, how a policy was applied or in the administrative process, according to the report.

The Social Security Administration paid about $6.5 billion in retirement and disability benefit overpayments in fiscal year 2022, which represents 0.5% of total benefits paid, the Congressional Research Service said in its 2024 report. The agency also paid about $4.6 billion in overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, benefits in that year, or about 8% of total benefits paid.

The Social Security Administration recovered about $4.9 billion in Social Security and SSI overpayments in fiscal year 2023. However, the agency had about $23 billion in uncollected overpayments at the end of the 2023 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Research Service.

By defaulting to a 100% withholding rate for overpayments, the Social Security Administration said it may recover about $7 billion in the next decade.  

"We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people," Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, said in a statement. "It is our duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding, as it was during the Obama administration and first Trump administration, to properly safeguard taxpayer funds."

The new 100% withholding rate will apply to new overpayments of Social Security benefits, according to the agency. The withholding rate for SSI overpayments will remain at 10%.

Social Security beneficiaries who are overpaid benefits after March 27 will automatically be subject to the new 100% withholding rate.

Individuals affected will have the right to appeal both the overpayment decision and the amount, according to the agency. They may also ask for a waiver of the overpayment, if either they cannot afford to pay the money back or if they believe they are not at fault. While an initial appeal or waiver is pending, the agency will not require repayment.

Beneficiaries who cannot afford to fully repay the Social Security Administration may also request a lower recovery rate either by calling the agency or visiting their local office.

For beneficiaries who had an overpayment before March 27, the withholding rate will stay the same and no action is required, the agency said.

The new overpayment policy goes into effect about one year after former Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley implemented a 10% default withholding rate.

The change was prompted by financial struggles some beneficiaries faced in repaying large sums to the Social Security Administration.

At a March 2024 Senate committee hearing, O'Malley called the policy of intercepting 100% of a benefit check "clawback cruelty."

At the same hearing, Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Georgia, recalled how one constituent who was overpaid $58,000 could not afford to pay her rent after the Social Security Administration reduced her monthly checks.

Following the Social Security Administration's announcement that it will return to 100% as the default withholding rate, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare said it is concerned the agency may be more susceptible to overpayment errors as it cuts staff.

"This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices — usually through no fault of their own," the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy organization, said in a statement.

President Donald Trump this weekend demurred on the question of whether his administration’s trade policies could send the US economy into recession, following up his recent acknowledgement that they may cause a “little disturbance.”

Some consistent — albeit equally vague — messaging is emerging, however. The US president and his economic team have been priming markets and the American people to expect some pain as a result of their trade policies, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warning of a “detox” period and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying there are certain to be “distortions.”

The question is how much pain is involved with "disturbances," "distortions," and "detox." The economy grew by 2.8% last year. For this year, the average of economists’ forecasts gathered by Bloomberg shows an expectation of 2.3% growth. Recently, estimates have been coming down as a result of first quarter tariff turmoil.

At a “stall speed” of 1% GDP growth or below, what the Trump administration is trying to achieve looks a lot less palatable, Mohamed El-Erian, president at Queens College, Cambridge, and former PIMCO CEO, told Yahoo Finance in an interview.

“We’re getting closer to stall speed,” El-Erian said. “And if we get to stall speed, then the journey becomes too difficult for the destination. And that’s going to be the big question as we look forward.”

For now, El-Erian sees growth this year ending up at 1.5% to 2%. He’s factoring in the chance of a recession at 25% to 30%, up from an earlier probability forecast of only 10%.

But he emphasizes that a recession is “not the baseline" due to the "structural strength of the US economy," as well as promises of deregulation, tax cuts, and cheap energy.

As El-Erian sees it, the Trump administration’s vision for remaking the economy and the federal government is four-pronged:

“A fairer trading system so that US goods are not discriminated against in global trade.”

“They want to detox the economy from its high dependence on the public sector.”

“They want to enhance the efficiency of government.”

“They want to unleash the private sector through deregulation and favorable tax treatment.”

Investors seemed broadly on board with those goals after the election, sending stocks soaring. But the volatile and uneven application of tariffs has now sent markets tumbling and increased the importance of the administration’s planned tax-cut extension and other policies to try to juice growth.

As El-Erian said, “You're getting a sequencing where the negative effects are being felt first and the positive effects are promised in the future. And that's what the market is getting used to.”

If the negative effects slow economic growth to 1% or below, the habituation process could be even rockier.

Tesla stock (TSLA) fell more than 10% on Monday as another bearish call from Wall Street sent shares to their lowest level since the day before the presidential election and 50% from its record closing high of $479 seen on Dec. 17.

In a note to clients on Monday, analysts at UBS lowered their price target on the stock to $225 from $259, citing lower delivery forecasts for the first quarter it sees resulting from softer demand for Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The firm maintained a Sell rating on the stock.

UBS now expects the company to deliver 367,000 cars in the first quarter, down from the 437,000 it said it had "plugged in as a placeholder" after Tesla's fourth quarter results in late January.

The firm now sees deliveries falling 5% over last year and 26% from the prior quarter in Q1, adding: "Our UBS Evidence Lab data shows low delivery times for the Model 3 and Model Y (generally within 2 weeks) in key markets which we believe is indicative of softer demand."

The stock was also pressured by news that shipments in China fell 49% from last year in February to the lowest level in almost three years.

With Monday's drop, Tesla stock has now forfeited more than all of its post-election gains, with this decline another piece of the persistent unwind of the "Trump trade" that has defined market action in recent weeks.

Tesla stock has dropped about 18% since the start of March alone.

Still, the plunge has prompted some of Tesla's biggest bulls to come out in defense of the name in recent days. Last Thursday, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives doubled down on his pro-Tesla views, calling the current slump a "gut check moment for the Tesla bulls (including ourselves)."

Ives added Tesla to the firm's "Best Ideas List" and reiterated his Outperform rating and $550 price target. He also noted this is not the first time Tesla has seen a drawdown of this magnitude, writing, "There have been a number of times in the Tesla story over the past decade that negative sentiment and Street worries have overshadowed the narrative of this unique disruptive global tech story."

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas also recently reiterated his bullish view on Tesla, forecasting shares will rise to $430 as the company diversifies into artificial intelligence and robotics. The analyst reinstated Tesla as a top pick for the auto sector.

"Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics," wrote Jonas in early March. He added the company's 2025 deliveries could decline year over year, but that this would be "creating an attractive entry point" for investors.

As Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian recently pointed out, while new competition has eaten into Tesla's sales, there is also the effect of CEO Elon Musk and his foray into politics. Musk became one of Trump's key surrogates on the campaign trail in the final months of the 2024 election.

Registration data shows Tesla car sales falling in Europe while the firing of government workers by the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have prompted protests at showrooms across the country.

Recent surveys show that many voters disapprove of Musk's actions, with a Quinnipiac poll from late January finding that voters oppose Musk playing a prominent role in the Trump administration by a 53% to 39% margin.

Tesla is expected to report its first quarter results on April 22.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Genmab A/S (Nasdaq: GMAB) announced today that Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has decided that it will not exercise its option to receive a worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize HexaBody-CD38 (GEN3014). While the initial HexaBody-CD38 clinical data is promising and showed robust clinical efficacy, following a thorough evaluation of the data, the market landscape, and Genmab’s rigorous portfolio prioritization, Genmab will not pursue further clinical development of HexaBody-CD38.





“While we are disappointed that J&J has decided not to advance HexaBody-CD38, the data confirms the clinical potential of the HexaBody platform, reinforcing its value for future applications,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab. “With EPKINLY® (epcoritamab) moving from strength to strength and two wholly owned assets, rinatabart sesutecan (Rina-S™) and acasunlimab in Phase 3 development, we are confident in the potential of our existing pipeline of innovative antibody therapeutics. Genmab intends to maintain its laser sharp focus on and disciplined investments in our promising late-stage proprietary clinical pipeline and continues to execute against our capital allocation framework ensuring future growth.”



As stipulated by the development and option agreement between Genmab and J&J for HexaBody-CD38, Genmab provided J&J with data from a clinical proof-of-concept study in multiple myeloma, including a head-to-head comparison with DARZALEX FASPRO® (daratumumab and hyaluronidase fihj).



The Phase 2 expansion Part B of the study assessed the objective response rate (primary endpoint) of intravenous HexaBody-CD38 versus subcutaneous daratumumab in patients with anti-CD38 antibody- naïve relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.



Preliminary data submitted by Genmab to J&J, inclusive of 88 patients who received a study treatment and 84 patients who were response evaluable (42 in each arm), demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 55% (95% CI: 39%, 70%) in the HexaBoby-CD38 IV arm vs. 52% in the daratumumab SC arm (95% CI: 36%, 68%); very good partial response (VGPR) or better rate was 29% vs. 17%; and complete response (CR) or better rate was 7% vs. 2%.



Due to the relatively short follow-up time, secondary efficacy endpoints including duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were not mature yet. Treatment emergent Adverse events (TEAEs) above 20% in the Hexabody-CD38 arm were neutropenia, infusion related reactions, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. No new safety findings were observed in the daratumumab arm of the study. TEAEs leading to death included one patient in the HexaBody-CD38 IV arm and two patients in the daratumumab SC arm; none of these deaths was related to the study treatment. Follow-up is ongoing and more mature data will be presented at a future medical conference.



This news does not impact Genmab’s 2025 Financial Guidance.

About the 3014-01 Trial



3014-01 is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center trial to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of HexaBody-CD38 as a monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and other blood cancers. The trial consists of three parts: a dose-escalation phase (Phase 1) and an expansion phase (Part A and Part B). The primary objective of Phase 1 is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose and the maximum tolerated dose as well as establish the safety profile of HexaBody-CD38 monotherapy. The purpose of Phase 2 Expansion Part A is to assess the objective response rate of HexaBody-CD38 for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and other blood cancers. The purpose of Phase 2 Expansion Part B is to assess the objective response rate of HexaBody-CD38 versus subcutaneous daratumumab in patients with CD38 antibody naïve relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. More information on this trial can be found at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04824794).

PHILADELPHIA & PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Comcast Business today announced the launch of a new multichannel brand campaign, titled “Powering the Engine of Modern Business,” highlighting its capabilities as a global enterprise technology partner. Debuting today, the campaign includes three TV spots depicting real-world scenarios the company has deployed for its customers. The TV spots feature cameos from Billy Horschel, golf legend Tom Watson and Golf Channel’s Rich Lerner, with narration from Josh Brolin. Comcast Business also announced a new two-year agreement with eight-time PGA TOUR event winner Billy Horschel as brand ambassador ahead of the return to his hometown tournament, THE PLAYERS® Championship.





"This new campaign reflects the evolution of the Comcast Business brand as a global technology solutions partner, demonstrating not just what could be possible, but what we’re actively doing for customers across industries today,” said Eileen Diskin, Chief Marketing Officer, Comcast Business. “And as our new Comcast Business brand ambassador, the confidence, swagger and roll-up-your-sleeves mentality Billy brings to the golf course aligns perfectly with how we approach our customers’ needs every day, and our partnership with THE PLAYERS Championship and the PGA TOUR couldn’t be a better launch platform.”



The campaign’s three playfully scripted spots bring Comcast Business’ capabilities to life through a series of vignettes depicting experiences the company is making possible for customers today from small businesses to large enterprises including the PGA TOUR and THE PLAYERS Championship. Narrated by Josh Brolin, the spots demonstrate how Comcast Business helps transform companies into “seamlessly-restocking, frictionless-paying, poke-bowl-ordering, line-skipping” models of service and efficiency. Whether it’s retailers, restaurants, hotels, hospitals – or even the PGA TOUR – businesses all rely on leading connectivity and networking, advanced cybersecurity, and expert partnership. Comcast Business keeps their complex networks running like engines of modern business.

				Greenkeeping & Agronomy•Interviews 

Héctor Forcén, The R&A’s Sustainable Agronomy Service’s newly appointed agronomist for Central and Northern Europe, talks about his role and the services that he offers to help golf club owners and course managers meet the challenges of maintaining their facilities in this part of the world



Can you tell us about your background and your journey to becoming The R&A’s Agronomist for Central and Northern Europe?

My journey in golf began with a deep passion for the game, which led me to study agronomy to further my career in the golf industry. For my final project studying agronomy, I worked on the construction of a public golf course, sparking my interest in specialising in golf course management skills  which I find valuable every day in my role as an agronomist. 

To develop my expertise, I joined professional associations and trained at Gleneagles, where I gained a strong foundation in greenkeeping. The mix of experience in practical greenkeeping and technical skills from studies has given me a rounded skillset and understanding of everyone’s role in golf. 

During Spain’s golf boom, I worked on several major projects, collaborating with leading designers while furthering my knowledge through specialised turfgrass management studies at the University of Georgia. I then joined a British company on the Tour, gaining valuable experience in global tournament preparation and course conditioning.

In 2009, I moved to Switzerland, where I managed golf course maintenance, consultancy and sustainability initiatives, refining my skills and a particular passion for environmental stewardship. These experiences ultimately prepared me for my current role as The R&A’s Agronomist for Central and Northern Europe.

What do you see as the biggest agronomic challenges for golf courses in Central and  Northern Europe, and how do you plan to address these through The R&A Sustainable Agronomy Service?

The biggest agronomic challenges for golf courses in Central and  Northern Europe stem from climate change, water management and pesticide regulation, and biodiversity pressures.

Climate change is causing drought issues through increased competition for the use of water due to population growth. We also see more frequent extreme weather events, and increased disease pressure because of environmental stress and the demands placed on the turf from golfers. To address this, we promote the development of drought-tolerant turf species through careful management of the golf course environment and maintenance strategies. The successful implementation of appropriate irrigation strategies and integrated pest management practices will be at the heart of success. 

Our access to irrigation water is facing greater restriction due to regulation and public perception. We see inefficient use of irrigation in many situations because of ageing infrastructure.  Supporting clubs in reasoning for upgrading their irrigation systems and becoming more astute with the application of water is one of the main areas of how we help clubs implement actions for raising the standards on the golf course. This may include water recycling solutions and audits to improve long-term sustainability.





Our drive to reduce the use of chemicals is key with regulation tightening and likely to become even more restrictive . We advocate for naturalised areas, precise nutrition, and the use of non-synthetic plant protection products to improve soil health practices and enhance turf resilience. We must ensure that the turf conditioning is healthy and strikes the balance with appropriate and sustainable standards for performance of the playing surfaces. For instance,  soil compaction and nutrient imbalances can also impact turf vitality. We implement soil testing, tailored fertilisation plans and efficient aeration programmes in a well-managed microclimate.

Biodiversity conservation is increasingly important. Our work at The R&A promotes biodiversity using many different strategies in creating pollinator-friendly habitats, incorporating native planting and monitoring biodiversity gains. 

Bringing all of this together in clear and actionable communication is needed for all areas of the golf club and the wider industry. We provide ongoing training through workshops, webinars and field demonstrations to ensure best practices are shared and adopted.

Sustainability is an increasingly significant concern in the golf industry. How will your services support clubs in adopting more environmentally responsible and sustainable practices while maintaining playability?

The R&A Sustainable Agronomy Service is supporting clubs in adopting sustainable practices while maintaining high standards of playability.

Integrated turf management helps minimise resource use and optimising mowing and cultural management practices. We find the balance between intensively managed playing areas and lower-input naturalised zones. We understand the need for setting achievable and optimum standards for each and every course. No two courses are the same either in their environment or resourcing. 

Water conservation is a key priority as already discussed but it’s an important point to reiterate as greenkeeping has come a long way with the introduction of technology such as soil moisture assessment and mapping. We encourage clubs to adopt the collection of meaningful and accurate, measurements to promote the use of efficient irrigation systems.

Improving soil health reduces the need for chemical inputs. We focus on organic matter management, efficient drainage, precision nutrient programmes and productive microclimate conditions to enhance turf resilience. These are intrinsically linked and one will not succeed on its own if the holistic management is not managed with care and understanding.

We also support carbon reduction efforts through minimal-maintenance landscapes, renewable energy adoption and carbon-sequestering practices such as tree and grassland habitat management. 



Which specific innovations or technologies do you believe hold the most promise for promoting sustainability in turf management over the next decade?

Several emerging technologies hold great potential, including:

Precision irrigation using soil moisture sensors and climate-based controllers conserve water by targeting irrigation needs in real-time.

Autonomous and electric equipment reduces emissions and optimises labour efficiency.

Advanced turfgrass breeding has produced drought- and salt-tolerant varieties, which reduce water use and withstand extreme conditions. This will be important for the resilience of turfgrass against increasing disease pressure.

Data-driven management through drones and AI improves turf monitoring and predictive maintenance.

Organic and bio-based solutions – including bio-stimulants, compost and biological pest control – reduce chemical reliance while improving turf resilience.

Carbon sequestration technologies like biochar enhance soil health and carbon storage, and a greater understanding of the benefits of grassland management.

We also see innovation in digital platforms for sustainability tracking, habitat restoration using GIS and drones, and renewable energy adoption for irrigation systems.

These advancements, combined with collaboration and knowledge sharing, will position golf courses to lead by example in sustainability. Our goal is to make these technologies accessible and effective for clubs worldwide.

President Donald Trump has dismissed the growing chorus of CEOs, investors and policymakers who are pleading with the White House for greater clarity about his sweeping tariff agenda.

"They always say that. 'We want clarity,'" Trump said in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday.

"They have plenty of clarity," the president told "Sunday Morning Futures" host Maria Bartiromo.

Appeals to the White House from the business community to provide more concrete guidance, Trump said, are little more than talking points. "They just use that — like almost a sound bite."

Pressed by Bartiromo on whether there would be "clarity for the business community," Trump's reply was telling.

"I think so, but you know, the tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up, and you know, I don't know if it's predictability."

Bartiromo interjected: "That's not clarity."

A day after the full interview aired, the start of a new week of tariff-fueled fears and heightened economic uncertainty sent stocks lower at Monday's opening. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 400 points, or 1%. The S&P 500 slipped 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite shed 2%. Later in the morning, both the 500-stock S&P and tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped to their lowest levels since September 2024.

Trump's comments capped off a week marked by unpredictability about both his tariffs and the broader strength of the U.S. economy.

The S&P 500 fell 3.10%, for its worst weekly mark since September. The Dow fell 2.37%, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 3.45%.

At the center of the storm were Trump's stiff 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which were initially paused for a month, then restarted Tuesday, only to be reined in Wednesday and then partially paused for another month on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Trump and multiple officials in his administration warned that Americans could be in store for some economic strain — including higher prices. But they insisted any adverse impacts would be temporary.

Confusion surrounding Trump's constantly shifting trade plans has left investors uncertain about what's coming next.

While Trump has downplayed the impact of his unpredictable trade policies on domestic markets, Wall Street analysts have not.

"We still have no clarity on the economy moving forward with the Trump turmoil," wrote Byron Anderson, head of fixed income at Laffer Tengler Investments.

"The longer we have chaos and turmoil from Trump, the higher the probability that we will eventually have data trend negative," he wrote in a Friday note.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Trump's latest remarks about his tariffs, or about the widespread confusion surrounding his agenda.

The coming week promises plenty of new economic data to test the competing theories.

Due out Monday is the New York Fed survey of consumer expectations, followed by the Wednesday release of February's consumer price index.

Thursday will see a fresh set of producer price data, before finishing the week with a University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading on Friday.

Now, as the Trump administration embarks on a monthlong reassessment of America's trade relationships around the world, the negative impacts of uncertainty, felt over the past few weeks, could be magnified.

"Markets fear uncertainty more than they fear bad news," wrote Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial. "25% tariffs are easier to price in than 'maybe 10%, maybe more, maybe less.'"

It's not just companies and investors who need greater clarity before they make major decisions.

The Federal Reserve does, too.

Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday said the central bank is "well positioned to wait for greater clarity" while the Trump administration implements "significant policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation."

Speaking at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, Powell said it would be "the net effect of these policy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy."

For now, he said, "uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high."

The Fed, like so many others, is "focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves," he added.

Hello A-J readers!

Three months in to 2025, Lubbock has already seen some shakeups in the business community. This week brought a review of February developments and a feature on a woman who has made a name for herself in the Landman business.

February was a relatively slow month for business updates, with the A-J reporting on six notable developments over the month. However, it did bring some unexpected losses, with the closures of Cinemark Southwest Lubbock Movies 16 and XD, 5721 58th St., and On The Border Mexican Grill and Cantina, 6709 Slide Road.

I spoke with Kathy Robertson, senior vice president and manager of Oil & Gas Property Operations for PlainsCapital Bank, about her nearly 20-year career as a landman. Robertson told me of her journey into the business, which helps people understand their mineral rights and much more. She also offered some advice for anyone looking to get into the career path.

"I got into it and fell in love with it," Robertson said. "It was a little bit accidental, one of those things where you're in the right place at the right time."

I have several messages out to companies regarding tariffs at grocery stores, upcoming locations and rumored new businesses. Nothing is on the books yet, but I hope my contacts get back to me in time for the next weekend edition.

As always, thank you for reading and supporting the A-J.

The prospect of wealthy individuals purchasing a path to U.S. residency through a “gold card” initiative has raised eyebrows in the world of cryptocurrency. But what if Bitcoin—one of the world’s most popular digital assets—could be used as a form of payment for this coveted card? This proposal, put forward by David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc., suggests that Bitcoin could help fuel the United States’ growing Bitcoin reserve, all while offering an innovative approach to the Trump administration’s gold card initiative.



The idea of a “gold card” was first brought into the public eye by former President Donald Trump in February 2025. His vision was to create a paid alternative to the traditional green card, offering the ultra-wealthy a fast track to U.S. residency and potential citizenship. The proposed cost of entry? A hefty $5 million.

Trump’s statement resonated with high-net-worth individuals, especially those from emerging markets, who might find it challenging to move significant amounts of money, such as $5 million, out of their home countries. The gold card would not only allow entry to the U.S. but would also offer green card privileges, which include the ability to live, work, and eventually gain citizenship in the country.

But the road to residency via this gold card isn’t as straightforward as it may seem. Many of the potential buyers—wealthy elites from places like Russia and China—face stiff regulations when it comes to transferring large sums of money across borders. This is where cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, comes into play.

David Bailey, who attended the Trump administration’s recent crypto summit, saw an opportunity to merge two of Trump’s policies: the proposed gold card and the strategic Bitcoin reserve (SBR) initiative. Bailey suggests that Bitcoin could offer a viable and practical way for these wealthy individuals to pay for their gold card without navigating the traditional banking system, thus sidestepping potential restrictions on international money transfers.

On social media, Bailey commented on the advantages of using Bitcoin as a payment method for the gold card:

“Many elites in emerging markets want to live in the U.S. but struggle to move $5M in USD out of their home countries. Bitcoin offers a simpler, safer, and more discreet solution.”

This proposal isn’t just a convenience for foreign investors—it could also serve a larger economic strategy. By allowing Bitcoin to be used for the purchase of gold cards, the U.S. could potentially add to its strategic Bitcoin reserve without the use of taxpayer funds. The reserve would be built from the influx of Bitcoin payments from wealthy individuals, contributing to the country’s growing stockpile of the digital currency, which could be valuable for both economic and geopolitical purposes.

The idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve has gained traction, especially with the ongoing efforts by the U.S. government to integrate more cryptocurrency-related policies into its financial infrastructure. This reserve would serve as a national stockpile of Bitcoin, which could be utilized for various purposes, including reinforcing the U.S.’s standing in global financial markets and providing an alternative store of value to traditional assets like gold.

Bailey’s proposal would align with the broader vision of the Trump administration, which has been keen on building the reserve to bolster the nation’s economic standing. By incorporating Bitcoin payments for the gold card program, the U.S. could further increase its strategic stockpile without needing to divert taxpayer resources, presenting a win-win scenario for both the government and foreign investors.

Bitcoin’s potential to revolutionize financial systems is no secret. As a decentralized, borderless digital asset, it offers a secure and efficient way to transfer wealth across borders. For the wealthy individuals seeking U.S. residency through the gold card initiative, Bitcoin provides a solution that avoids the cumbersome regulations typically involved in traditional currency transfers.

In addition, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge against inflation and economic instability, making it a desirable asset for those seeking to diversify their portfolios. By allowing Bitcoin to be used in this context, the U.S. would be positioning itself as a leader in the global cryptocurrency movement, attracting international investors and strengthening its own digital reserve.

The idea of using Bitcoin to purchase a path to U.S. residency could be the first step in a larger shift toward integrating cryptocurrency into official government programs. While the concept of a Bitcoin-based gold card is still in its early stages, the growing interest in cryptocurrency and its potential to reshape financial and immigration policies suggests that this idea could gain momentum in the coming years.

Furthermore, as more countries begin to adopt crypto-friendly policies, the U.S. might find itself competing for the attention of wealthy global citizens looking for more flexible and secure ways to move their money and assets. By embracing Bitcoin and integrating it into national programs, the U.S. could set a precedent for other nations to follow.

David Bailey’s suggestion to use Bitcoin for the proposed gold card offers a glimpse into the future of cryptocurrency integration with national policies. By allowing wealthy individuals to use Bitcoin to pay for residency privileges, the U.S. could both attract global elites and bolster its own Bitcoin reserves without relying on taxpayer funding. Whether or not this idea will become a reality remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the intersection of cryptocurrency and immigration policy could usher in a new era of global finance and residency programs.

Cryptocurrency prices fell further on Monday amid disappointment with the plans for a strategic bitcoin reserve.

Bitcoin was down about 4.2% at 12:30 ET to about $79,500, bringing the slide over the past week to 12%, per Coinbase.

Ether and XRP both fell about 3%. They are two cryptos that will go into a separate fund rather than be combined with the bitcoin reserve. Some commentators had criticised the decision to put lesser-known coins into the strategic reserve.

President Donald Trump posted earlier this month that the reserve would make the US the "Crypto Capital of the World." However, the executive order he signed on Thursday indicated that the reserve will only include bitcoin already held by the government — mostly from asset forfeitures in criminal and civil cases.

Many in the crypto world thought bitcoin would be purchased to add to the fund. That seems unlikely in the short term, but the door has been left open.

"The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce shall develop strategies for acquiring additional Government BTC [bitcoin] provided that such strategies are budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers," the order stated.

David Sacks, the Trump administration's "crypto czar," wrote on X that using the government's bitcoin holdings meant the reserve "will not cost taxpayers a dime."

"The government will not acquire additional assets for the stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings."

Sacks has also ordered an audit of the government's crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 bitcoin alone, BBC News reported. That holding would be worth about $16.5 billion.

When Arthur Hayes speculated that Bitcoin could fall as low as $75,000 last month many investors probably rolled their eyes. 

The leading cryptocurrency, after all, was bound to get a bounce from the Trump administration’s support for a Bitcoin strategic reserve, plus an end to the crackdown on the industry. 

With Bitcoin dropping more than 5% in the last 24 hours and slipping below $79,000, Hayes’ prediction now looks prescient. 

On Monday, the BitMEX co-founder and crypto influencer reiterated his call for Bitcoin to slide to $75,000. Worse may be on the way.

He said the volume of open interests for options contracts at that price range was flashing red.

“An ugly start of the week,” Hayes, the chief investment officer at Maelstrom, posted online. “If we get into that range, it will be violent.” 

In a way, it already is. 

Investors across the capital markets are spooked by President Donald Trump’s flip-flopping tariff policies toward the US' two biggest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. 

Trump also deepened a trade war with China by ratcheting up import duties another 10%. China countered with tariffs of its own.

If that wasn’t enough, Trump’s much-hyped crypto summit at the White House underwhelmed investors by setting up a Bitcoin reserve stocked with coins seized by the government in criminal cases.

Investors had been hoping Trump would order the government to start buying Bitcoin.

Zach Burks, CEO of NFT marketplace Mintology, said he expects Bitcoin to “drop as low as $72,000” amid inflation concerns for investors and the fading allure of the asset as a so-called Trump trade.

“Many investors are pulling out of Bitcoin, viewing it as a risky asset class for the first time since Trump took the White House,” Burks told DL News.

‘It’s no longer playing its role as a store of value.'

The failure of crypto to decouple from the stock market is proving worrisome yet again during a market crisis. If anything, investors should be flocking to Bitcoin to safeguard their wealth the same way they use gold. 

But investors are shunning that idea. 

“It’s no longer playing its role as a store of value,” Burks said. “Gold prices have spiked as many go back to the original doomsday asset, which is no surprise as tariff grenades continue to get thrown across the free world.”

Most of the investors ditching Bitcoin are new buyers of the asset, crypto research outfit 10x Research said in a Monday report.

The report stated that these new buyers likely punted on Donald Trump’s presidency being a boon for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies ― that hasn’t materialised.

Despite the present market turmoil, analysts still hold bullish expectations for Bitcoin.

Hayes previously told DL News that Trump’s policies will devalue the dollar and send Bitcoin’s price to $250,000 this year as investors return to the asset to safeguard their money.

For Burks, a Bitcoin recovery to $110,000 this year is possible.

“But we must weather this MAGA-inflicted mini recession before we get to move up the layer cake,” Burks said.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reaffirmed that cryptocurrency activities are permissible in the federal banking system, namely crypto-asset custody, certain stablecoin activities, and participation in independent node verification networks such as DLTs.

More specifically, the OCC published Interpretive Letter 1183 which confirms that a number of key crypto activities are permissible for national banks and federal savings associations.

Specifically, Interpretive Letter 1183 states that OCC-supervised institutions may engage in crypto-asset custody, certain stablecoin activities, and participation in independent node verification networks such as DLT.

Also, critically, Interpretive Letter 1183 confirms the removal of the requirements to receive supervisory nonobjection and demonstrate that they have adequate controls in place before they can engage in these cryptocurrency activities.

Additionally, the OCC withdrew its participation in the joint statement on crypto-asset risks and liquidity risks to banking organizations resulting from crypto-asset market vulnerabilities.

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood said:



“The OCC expects banks to have the same strong risk management controls in place to support novel bank activities as they do for traditional ones. Today’s action will reduce the burden on banks to engage in crypto-related activities and ensure that these bank activities are treated consistently by the OCC, regardless of the underlying technology. I will continue to work diligently to ensure regulations are effective and not excessive, while maintaining a strong federal banking system.”



A very important announcement, which means that banking institutions and other OCC accountable entities have been given the green light to an unprecedentedly wide range of crypto activities, and the entire crypto sector that they had been totally blocked from.

We can probably expect a very large-scale integration of new players into the crypto industry in the near future, and the market will have a lot of liquidity to swallow. Stay tuned for updates and be aware of the rapidly evolving regulation and crypto landscape.

Ethereum (ETH) is down 2% on Monday, trading near the $2,000 psychological level despite increased exchange net outflows. The sustained negative market sentiment is potentially coming from crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) investors who have continued to scale down their holdings.

Ethereum saw one of its highest exchange weekly net outflows last week following its decline to the $2,000 psychological level. Crypto exchanges witnessed an ETH net outflow of about $1.8 billion last week, the highest weekly amount since December 2022, according to IntoTheBlock's data.

"Despite ongoing pessimism around Ether prices, this trend suggests many holders see current levels as a strategic buying opportunity," wrote IntoTheBlock analysts in an X post on Monday.

An increase in exchange net outflows indicates high buying pressure, while vice versa for inflows.

The increased buy-the-dip attitude near $2,000 suggests ETH could be primed for a recovery, but institutional investors' selling pressure is weighing on the crypto market.

While crypto-native investors are buying the dip, institutional investors are depleting their holdings. This is visible in US spot ETH ETFs' flows, which show a net outflow of about $94 million last week, per Coinglass data. Unlike exchange net outflows, rising ETF outflows indicate higher selling pressure.

A potential reason for the selling activity is crypto's rising correlation to traditional stocks and macroeconomic conditions. The S&P 500 has declined by over 450 points since hitting an all-time high on February 19, showing increased risk-off sentiments amid President Donald Trump's tariff decisions on US international trading partners.

With the same traditional stock players also treading the crypto market via Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the prices of top cryptos may remain subdued by their investment sentiment. According to a CoinShares report on Monday, crypto ETFs have lost $4.75 billion in the past four weeks.

Ethereum experienced $117.96 million in futures liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of long and short liquidations accounted for $81.01 million and $36.94 million, respectively.

ETH is struggling to hold the $2,000 psychological level after sustaining a weekly candlestick close below the $2,200 critical level last week. If the bearish pressure extends throughout the new week, ETH could decline toward the next key support level at $1,500.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators are below their neutral levels, indicating dominant bearish momentum.

However, the Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) is deep in the oversold region, signaling a potential reversal. As a result, ETH could flip the bearish pressure if it pulls a high volume move above $2,200 and smashes a key ascending trendline resistance.

A weekly candlestick close below $1,500 will invalidate the thesis and potentially send ETH below the $1,000 psychological level.

Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain with smart contracts functionality. Its native currency Ether (ETH), is the second-largest cryptocurrency and number one altcoin by market capitalization. The Ethereum network is tailored for building crypto solutions like decentralized finance (DeFi), GameFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), etc.

Ethereum is a public decentralized blockchain technology, where developers can build and deploy applications that function without the need for a central authority. To make this easier, the network leverages the Solidity programming language and Ethereum virtual machine which helps developers create and launch applications with smart contract functionality.

Smart contracts are publicly verifiable codes that automates agreements between two or more parties. Basically, these codes self-execute encoded actions when predetermined conditions are met.

Staking is a process of earning yield on your idle crypto assets by locking them in a crypto protocol for a specified duration as a means of contributing to its security. Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism on September 15, 2022, in an event christened “The Merge.” The Merge was a key part of Ethereum's roadmap to achieve high-level scalability, decentralization and security while remaining sustainable. Unlike PoW, which requires the use of expensive hardware, PoS reduces the barrier of entry for validators by leveraging the use of crypto tokens as the core foundation of its consensus process.

Gas is the unit for measuring transaction fees that users pay for conducting transactions on Ethereum. During periods of network congestion, gas can be extremely high, causing validators to prioritize transactions based on their fees.

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

Many countries have strategic reserves in case of shortages or as a way to keep prices stable. The U.S. has its strategic oil reserves. China has tens of thousands of tons of frozen, raw pork. The newest reserve - bitcoin. Last week, President Trump signed an order to create a strategic reserve of cryptocurrency. To explain how this might work, we called up Zeke Faux. He’s an investigative reporter with Bloomberg and author of the book “Number Go Up, ” about the crypto industry. He joins us now. Good morning.

ZEKE FAUX: Morning.

RASCOE: Typically, these strategic reserves are commodities - oil, grain, pork. But cryptocurrencies exist in ledgers on computers. So how will a digital currency reserve work?

FAUX: What the administration officials have said the plan is, is that the U.S. already digitally holds quite a lot of bitcoin. There’s a lot of crime involving bitcoin, and it often results in the bitcoins being seized by the U.S. government. And in the past, these have been auctioned off by the U.S. Marshals Service for regular U.S. dollars, which can be used for whatever. Now the government is going to hold onto these bitcoins. The purpose of that is not entirely clear, but Donald Trump has hinted if the price goes up a lot, this could help pay off the national debt.

RASCOE: How much would - the amount of bitcoin they have now, how much is that in, like, U.S. dollars at this point?

FAUX: It’s about $20 billion. And even if you believe that the U.S. government should be gambling on the price of bitcoin, this is not nearly enough to have an impact on anything.

RASCOE: And what is the argument that this would be helpful?

FAUX: The crypto industry is really good at creating this impression that this is the future and that the U.S. government needs to get on this or will be left behind. I’ve spent years traveling the world, investigating this industry, and what I’ve found is there’s nothing there. Crypto has been around for 15 years. It’s as old as Uber. It’s as old as WhatsApp, but pretty much no one is using it for anything but financial speculation. The crypto industry is basically a giant offshore casino. Even if you believe that these are winning bets, the U.S. government has never been in the business of speculating on financial assets.

RASCOE: Just a few years ago, Trump called cryptocurrency a scam. So what changed?

FAUX: During his most recent campaign, a few dozen of the richest bitcoiners got together, and they engaged in this concerted lobbying effort to change his mind. And last July, they held a fundraiser that reportedly raised $25 million for Trump. And after that, Trump went onstage at this bitcoin conference and promised them he would deregulate the crypto industry. He’d make the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet. And that’s where he first floated this strategic reserve plan, which has been a pipe dream of bitcoin advocates for years.

RASCOE: President Trump and first lady Melania Trump, they both have their own coins. The family has its own crypto business called World Liberty Financial. Is that a conflict of interest?

FAUX: Yeah. When you’ve got the U.S. government spending its money on these assets, and you’ve got people who are in the administration investing in the assets, yeah, it’s a clear conflict of interest.

RASCOE: The Securities and Exchange Commission had been investigating the crypto industry, but under Trump, those investigations ended. What were they focused on?

FAUX: The SEC under the Biden administration - they’re basically saying that some of these cryptocurrencies count as securities, meaning things that we regulate, and that the industry had not been following the long-established rules around securities, which mandate that you have to file these detailed disclosures. There’s rules around trading. Industry has said cryptocurrencies are different. We need new rules. And right now, the Trump administration has said they agree with that position, and they’re in the process of working out these new rules, whatever they’re going to be.

RASCOE: That’s Zeke Faux. He’s an investigative reporter with Bloomberg, and his book about cryptocurrency is called “Number Go Up.” Thanks so much for joining us.

FAUX: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

Digital asset market faces $4.75 billion monthly outflow, hitting lowest AUM since 2024.

Digital asset investment products continued their losing streak for the fourth consecutive week, with outflows reaching $876 million, according to CoinShares‘ latest report.

James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, noted that while the rate of capital flight has slowed, investors remain cautious amid the bearish market situation.

He said the outflow brought the total outflows for the past month to $4.75 billion, while year-to-date inflows slipped to $2.6 billion.

At the same time, total assets under management (AUM) also fell by $39 billion, settling at $142 billion—the lowest level since mid-November 2024.

The US accounted for the largest share of outflows, with investors withdrawing approximately $922 million.

This came despite President Donald Trump’s announcement of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, making the top crypto a major financial asset for the global financial system.

During the period, institutional investment vehicles were among the hardest hit. Fidelity’s FBTC, BlackRock’s IBIT, and Ark21Shares all saw outflows exceeding $133 million each.

Meanwhile, investors in Switzerland, Canada, and Germany took advantage of the dip, contributing inflows of $23 million, $47 million, and $13.3 million, respectively.

Across digital assets, Bitcoin experienced the heaviest outflows, with $756 million exiting the top crypto.

The downturn coincided with a sharp price drop, as BTC fell nearly 15% last week, sliding from around $94,318 to as low as $80,085, according to CryptoSlate data. This decline triggered a wave of liquidations across the crypto market, further dampening sentiment.

Meanwhile, short-Bitcoin products saw outflows of $19.8 million—their largest since December 2024.

Ethereum, Tron, and Aave suffered outflows of $89 million, $32 million, and $2.4 million, respectively. On the other hand, Solana, XRP, and Sui attracted inflows of $16.4 million, $5.6 million, and $2.7 million.

Additionally, blockchain-related equity exchange-traded products (ETPs) were not spared from the broader market decline, recording $48 million in outflows last week.

In what's being touted as a first for the American casino industry, Choctaw Casinos & Resorts has partnered with Bitline and Everi to offer cryptocurrency as a source of liquidity for gaming patrons. The collaboration introduces a new financial option for casino visitors, marking the first time digital assets can be directly used for casino chip access in the U.S. regulated market.

Bitline, a Miami-based company, specializes in providing casino chip access directly from cryptocurrency, enabling transactions of up to $10 million in casino chips within minutes, depending on blockchain network demand. 

This new functionality is made possible through Bitline’s integration with Everi’s CashClub payment infrastructure, which offers a compliant process for boarding, screening, and verifying patrons who wish to leverage digital assets.

The partnership aims to meet the growing demand for cryptocurrency solutions in the gaming industry. It creates a replicable model that offers casinos and their patrons alternative ways to manage funds, access liquidity, and utilize digital assets.

The rollout of this technology at Choctaw Casinos & Resorts sets a new precedent for financial accessibility and convenience in the sector, according to the partners.

“This collaboration is just the beginning of our vision to modernize casino payment capabilities on a global scale,” said Richard Jones, CEO of Bitline. “We’re entering an era where digital assets can fundamentally enhance the gaming experience, providing casino operators with a future-ready financial framework.”

Everi’s SVP of Product Management, Payments Solutions, Victor Newsom, emphasized the compliance and security benefits of the integration. “Choctaw’s patrons are now no longer limited to the access, times, amount, and speed constraints of the legacy financial systems,” he said, highlighting how the solution reduces risks for casinos.

The Choctaw Casinos & Resorts integration is the first step in Bitline’s broader mission to bring cryptocurrency payment options to the global casino sector. As digital assets gain momentum in the gaming market, Bitline plans to expand its services to other major casinos and markets, aiming to establish cryptocurrency as a standard feature of the gaming experience.

The service officially launched on March 7, 2025, with the first transaction completed at Choctaw’s Durant, Oklahoma location. Patrons can use popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and Circle (USDC), as outlined in Choctaw Casinos’ cryptocurrency FAQ page.

Thomas McDonald, Senior Director of Cage and Credit at Choctaw Casinos & Resorts, expressed excitement about the new offering. “Through our long-term relationship with Everi, a leader in fintech solutions, we will continue to invest in innovative offerings that provide the discerning gaming VIP access to funds in a safe and secure manner,” he said.

Blockchain firm Movement's public mainnet is set to launch in beta, continuing the progress toward deploying Movement Virtual Machine (MoveVM) on Ethereum.

The mainnet will roll out Monday with over $233 million worth of BTC, ETH, and native assets, MOVE, in liquidity raised through Movement's Cornucopia program.

Movement's mainnet will allow smart contract deployment and allows anyone to build on and use the network for the first time, the Movement Network Foundation announced via email on Monday.

Move was developed by Facebook as part of its plans to develop its own digital currency, which was abandoned in early 2022. 

The technology was subsequently used to create layer-1 networks Sui and Aptos, as well as Movement Labs extending the programming language to develop an Ethereum layer 2.

 Shares of Strategy (MSTR) and other companies tied to cryptocurrencies sank along with the price of digital coins on concerns about President Donald Trump's federal bitcoin strategic reserve plan and worries about the U.S. economy. 


 Trump on Friday signed an executive order establishing the new reserve, which he said was part of his effort to make America the "cypto capital of the planet." However, the proposal only calls for the reserve to include assets already seized by the government through legal action, and doesn't suggest additional purchases.


 Another factor weighing on the crypto market is the economic impact of Trump's tariffs, and the response by other countries to them, including the future of interest rates. Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech that policymakers will be taking a wait-and-see approach to rate cuts until the effect of the president's moves are better understood. 


 Strategy, the biggest corporate holder of bitcoin, saw its shares sink 13% Monday morning. Shares of crypto trading platform Coinbase Global (COIN) and bitcoin miner MARA Holdings (MARA) also tumbled by about 12% and 13%, respectively.

The price of Bitcoin crashed below $80,000 on Monday morning as financial markets reacted to ongoing concerns over inflation and a possible U.S. recession, fueled by President Trump's comments over the weekend.

Asked by Fox News in a Sunday interview about whether he expects a recession this year, Trump declined to rule it out.

"I hate to predict things like that," he replied, adding that there will be a "period of transition" as the economy digests his sizable tariffs on neighbors Canada and Mexico, as well as China. Trump's moves around tariffs, including delays and shifts in the scale of them, have rocked markets for weeks.

Bitcoin dove as low as $79,553 on Monday morning, rebounding slightly to $79,785 as of this writing. The leading cryptocurrency is currently down almost 5% on the day, falling 14% on the week amid volatility fueled not only by tariff moves but also speculation over Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve plans.

Ethereum is also down 5% to a current price of $2,013 after coming within a dollar of the $2,000 mark late Sunday. ETH hasn't been below $2,000 since November 2023.

Other major coins have posted much sharper losses over the last 24 hours, with Cardano (ADA) falling 10% to $0.69, Solana (SOL) down 9% to $121, and Dogecoin (DOGE) diving 8% to $0.166.

Stock markets are similarly showing losses so far Monday, with the Nasdaq plunging by more than 3% and the S&P 500 down 1.8%. Traders are pulling back ahead of crucial economic reports expected later this week—including the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) updates—that will indicate whether inflation is being kept under control.

The move reflects a trend of traditional exchanges entering the cryptocurrency derivatives market to provide a regulated platform for trading digital assets

Singapore Exchange (SGX) plans to list bitcoin perpetual futures as traditional exchanges push deeper into cryptocurrency derivative markets.

Singapore’s largest exchange group intends to launch the contracts in the second half of 2025, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The company will strictly target institutional clients and professional investors, with retail customers barred from trading the instruments.

The move was the latest sign that established exchange operators were branching out into bitcoin derivatives, as US President Donald Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency agenda boosts demand for digital assets’ exposure.

Bloomberg reported on March 4 that Japan’s Osaka Dojima Exchange Inc., which traced its roots to the 18th century, was planning to seek approval to list bitcoin futures.

SGX hoped to act as a bridge between regulated financial markets and the freewheeling world of cryptocurrency trading. The firm thinks its offering will “significantly expand institutional market access,” the spokesperson said.

The planned products were still awaiting approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

Perpetual futures – which do not have an expiry date – are a way for traders to bet on price changes in an underlying asset without needing to own the asset itself. SGX was not the only exchange looking to launch the contracts in Singapore: in January 2024, Hoboken, New Jersey-based EDX Markets LLC, a digital-asset firm backed by Citadel Securities, revealed plans to offer the instruments in the city state.

Thailand’s financial regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expanding its list of approved cryptocurrencies with the two largest stablecoins, Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC as trading pairs on digital asset exchanges.

Previously, only bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), XRP, stellar (XLM), and certain tokens used in the Bank of Thailand’s settlement system were approved by the regulator. 

The move comes after a public consultation in February, during which most respondents backed the proposal. The new rules from the  will take effect on March 16.

By recognizing USDT and USDC, Thailand is aligning itself with global trends where stablecoins play a key role in crypto trading and payments. Stablecoins are one of the fastest-growing sectors of crypto, driven by demand in developing regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America. USDT has a $142 billion market capitalization, followed by USDC with its $58 billion market cap.USDT issuer Tether said on Monday that the approval paves the way for broader acceptance of its token in Thailand’s financial sector.Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

10 March, 2025 – Tether, the largest company in the digital assets industry, has announced that Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission has granted acceptance of USD₮ as an approved cryptocurrency.

This approval enables USD₮ to be traded within the country, facilitating its listing on regulated exchanges and paving the way for USD₮ to be accepted for payments, which advances the region’s leadership in digital asset innovation.

The updated regulations aim to enhance flexibility in digital asset businesses and will take effect on March 16, 2025. The SEC had previously sought public feedback on these changes, which were finalized in February 2025 with widespread industry support.

The regulator’s recognition of USD₮ as an approved cryptocurrency marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital assets in the region and represents a major step toward clarifying and enhancing Thailand’s regulatory framework. This will provide investors with greater flexibility and choice while fostering a more dynamic and resilient industry. By enabling the seamless integration of USD₮, the decision supports the diversification and modernization of Thailand’s financial landscape.

Thailand has emerged as one of the friendliest jurisdictions for digital assets in recent years and ranks among the top 20 countries globally in terms of adoption, with USD₮ accounting for around 40% of volumes. Tether’s USD₮ with a market cap of $142 billion, is the world’s most widely used stablecoin, providing a trusted, efficient bridge between traditional fiat systems and digital economies.

“We highly value the Thai market and are continuously exploring ways to enhance our services and offerings. Our priority is to provide users in Thailand with a secure, transparent, and reliable stablecoin experience,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “We are committed to supporting the long-term success and adoption of stablecoins in Thailand and look forward to contributing to the growth of the country’s digital asset ecosystem by fostering a strong and sustainable stablecoin infrastructure.”

Thailand’s forward-thinking approach to digital asset regulation sets a global benchmark, and Tether is proud to see USD₮ play a pivotal role in driving economic progress and digital transformation in the region. This approval highlights Tether’s dedication to building bridges between traditional and decentralized economies while ensuring security, trust, and efficiency for users worldwide. Thailand’s forward-looking stance on stablecoins is reflected in its vibrant, Thai baht-backed digital asset market.

Bitcoin (BTC) hovers around $82,000 on Monday after falling nearly 15% last week. This price correction triggered a series of liquidations across the crypto market, totaling $687.73 million in the past 24 hours. A QCP Capital report highlights that momentum was derailed by the Bybit hackers cashing out at least $300 million of their record-breaking $1.5 billion crypto heist on Sunday, causing BTC to decline again.

Bitcoin price recovers slightly, trading at around $82,800, during the European session on Monday after falling nearly 15% last week. Only on Sunday, BTC dipped more than 6%, reaching a low of $80,000. 

This price correction triggered a series of liquidations across the crypto market, totaling $687.73 million in the past 24 hours. The largest single liquidation order happened on Binance- BTCUSDT, valued at $32.09 million, according to Coinglass data.

In an exclusive interview, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told FXStreet, “Bitcoin is expected to face a critical week of price movement with support levels between $70,000 and $75,000 and a pivotal resistance zone around $85,000-$87,000.”

Lee explained that a failure to maintain the $77,000 level could lead BTC to test the lower range of $70,000-$72,000. However, if the market sees a recovery, a potential bounce from $75,000 could push the price back into the $80,000-$85,000 range.

In the interview, Lee further explained that the most likely scenario for this week suggests a mid-week test of $72,000-$75,000, with Bitcoin stabilizing near $83,000 by March 18-19, depending on broader market sentiment and external factors like regulatory news and upcoming FOMC meeting.

Moreover, QCP Capital’s report highlights that risk assets, such as US equities and BTC, are currently trading near their recent lows, and with tariff risks still looming, volatility could pick up, heading into key US macro data releases — Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday and Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday.

The report continued that Friday’s Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) data last week provided some relief for equities and crypto, reinforcing expectations of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in May.

The report further explained that the stage seemed set for a steady recovery this week. However, this momentum was derailed by the Bybit hackers cashing out at least $300 million of their record-breaking $1.5 billion crypto heist during thin liquidity hours on Sunday, causing BTC to decline again.

“Today’s price selloff may also be exacerbated by holders preemptively front-running further hacker-driven supply, now that the hackers have shown a willingness to cash out rather than risk further losses — having already seen their stolen assets depreciate by 25%. In response, risk reversals have become even more bid for Puts over the past 24 hours, reflecting growing concerns over additional selling pressure,” says QCP’s analyst.

Bitcoin price broke and closed below its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,754 on Sunday, declining by 6.37%. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers at around $81,800.

If BTC continues its downward trend, it could extend the decline to test the February 28 low of $78,258. A successful close below this level would extend an additional decline to retest its next support level at $73,072.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 36, after being rejected from its neutral level of 50 last week, indicating a bearish momentum. Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator also showed a bearish crossover on Sunday, giving a sell signal and suggesting a downward trend.

On the contrary, if BTC recovers, it could extend the recovery to $85,000.

(This story was corrected on March 10 at 12:12 GMT to say that liquidations totaled $687.73 million in the past 24 hours, not $687.73 in the past 24 hours.)

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Cryptocurrencies market capitalization decreased to $2.7 trillion on Monday, shedding another 3% in the last 24 hours. DeFi protocols market capitalization grew by $3.5 billion, with Hyper Liquid, Mantle and Ethena posting significant gains.

Bitcoin (BTC) hovers around $82,000 on Monday after falling nearly 15% last week. This price correction triggered a series of liquidations across the crypto market, totaling $687.73 million in the past 24 hours.

Dogecoin (DOGE) hovers around $0.173 on Monday after crashing nearly 30% last week. The recent correction in DOGE has triggered a wave of over $22 million in liquidations in the last 24 hours and more than $78 million last week. 

The overall crypto market capitalization lost over $440 million last week; on Monday, it reads $2.66 trillion. The reaction to Trump’s announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve wasn’t what many expected as the market continued to correct. 

Bitcoin price extends its decline on Friday, falling over 5% so far this week. BTC uncertainty and volatility spikes liquidated $1.67 billion as the first-ever White House Crypto Summit takes place on Friday.

A whale, likely armed with insider info, made another $2.15M profit in just 50 minutes. The trader sold 947 ETH for $1.95M USDC and then deposited it into Hyperliquid to open a long position on ETH with 50x leverage. The position ballooned to 25,095 ETH (worth $53.7M) before the whale closed out as ETH surged, locking in the impressive profit. This is the same trader who previously netted $6.8M on BTC and ETH before Trump’s executive order.

Investor sentiment has reached levels not seen since 2022, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropping to a near three-year low of 20. This steep decline reflects heightened fear among investors, driven by regulatory uncertainty and recent price volatility. Historically, such low sentiment levels have preceded market bottoms, suggesting that this downturn may present a potential buying opportunity for contrarian investors looking to capitalize on future recovery. However, on-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that the average monthly Fear & Greed Index has declined to a more acceptable level, suggesting that selling pressure might be easing.

Bloomberg’s senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone warned that Bitcoin might plunge to $70,000 amid renewed market fear. Despite excitement over the U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve, Bitcoin-to-gold ratio has dropped to 28X and may fall to 21X, signaling underperformance. McGlone noted that if the U.S. stock market reverses some of last year’s $12 trillion advance, Bitcoin could continue to struggle. Anti-crypto commentator Peter Schiff believes the current correction is overdue and may persist through the decade.

The total crypto market cap fell by $148 billion in the past 24 hours as investor sentiment turned sharply negative. Concerns over US President Donald Trump’s ambiguous stance on a potential recession fueled uncertainty in financial markets. This lack of clear direction triggered widespread sell-offs, forcing major digital assets into decline, with Bitcoin dropping to $80,000 and Ether slipping below $2,000. Combined with broader macroeconomic worries, these factors have led to today’s steep downturn in the crypto market indeed.

March 10, 2025 08:51:06 UTC

The crypto market kicked off the week with a sharp downturn, wiping out $620.5 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin dropped as low as $80,000 over the weekend, triggering widespread margin calls and forcing many leveraged traders out of positions. Long positions suffered the most, with Bitcoin alone losing nearly $240 million. Analysts warn that if Bitcoin fails to hold around $78,000, it could fall further to about $75,000, adding to the market’s volatility. Altcoins, including Ethereum, also saw significant declines amid rising risk-off sentiment.

March 10, 2025 08:47:38 UTC

Ethereum is under strong selling pressure, dropping below $2,000 earlier today and risking a fall to around $1,250 if support fails. Over the past week, ETH has lost more than 16%, pushing its year-to-date losses over 37%. ETF outflows and significant liquidations add to the bearish outlook. However, major whales are accumulating ETH, and 600,000 tokens were withdrawn from exchanges, suggesting long-term holding. Bulls must reclaim the $2,460 resistance to spark a recovery.

March 10, 2025 08:44:41 UTC

US stock market futures fell sharply at the open, with the Dow down over 300 points and the Nasdaq 100 down 1%. This steep decline in traditional markets has been mirrored in the crypto space, where falling prices signal a growing risk-off sentiment among investors. The downturn reflects heightened caution amid current uncertainties, as market participants brace for further volatility and closely watch economic and geopolitical developments.

March 10, 2025 07:50:57 UTC

Another Sunday selloff in crypto saw Bitcoin drop to $80,000 at 7 pm ET, marking a 7% decline over 24 hours. Despite a brief bounce to $80,700, BTC is headed toward its 2025 low of about $78,000. Other major coins, including Ether, Solana, and XRP, fell similarly, while Cardano and Dogecoin dropped around 12%. On Fox News, President Trump warned his tariff and budget-cutting policies might cause disruptions. US stock index futures also declined by roughly 0.85% overall.

March 10, 2025 07:50:57 UTC

Pi Coin price fell to as low as $1.26 before rebounding to $1.41, representing a 12% daily drop and 16% weekly. This downturn reflects the broader crypto market correction, as Bitcoin briefly plunged to $80,000 and many altcoins are in the red. Additionally, Binance’s inaction on PI trading—despite an 86% community vote in favor of listing—may be dampening liquidity, while other exchanges like Bitget, OKX, and MEXC have already enabled trading.

Quantum fridges, batteries and clocks are brilliant inventions but still limited in power. Now physicist Nicole Yunger Halpern is charting a path to take them to the next level

By Thomas Lewton

The French inventor Jacques de Vaucanson is remembered for, among other things, producing three curious automata in the 18th century. A poster from the time advertised them all side by side: a figure that played a real flute, another that banged a tambourine and a duck that gobbled up corn and seemingly turned it into pellets of… well, use your imagination.

For physicist Nicole Yunger Halpern, based at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Maryland, these antiquated automata have a resonance with some of today’s most cutting-edge technology. Vaucanson’s inventions prefigured the industrial revolution, during which mechanisation went from being a quirky curiosity to a force that reshaped the globe. We may be at an analogous turning point today when it comes to quantum technology, says Yunger Halpern.

A bold new take on quantum theory could reveal how reality emerges

The steam-powered world of the industrial revolution may seem far removed from the quantum realm. But this period of dramatic change was bolstered by thermodynamics, which deals with heat, work and energy. And, recently, physicists have been applying its ideas to the subatomic realm to devise the new field of quantum thermodynamics. This has seen the development of machines like quantum fridges, batteries and clocks.

However, these are just the start of the quantum technology revolution, says Yunger Halpern. She was a co-author of a recent manifesto aiming to chart a path towards greater things. She spoke to New Scientist about what advanced quantum machines might look like, the astounding benefits they could bring and how we can work towards making them a reality.

New research suggests that a binary pair of Kuiper Belt objects, known as the Altjira system, is actually made up of three separate bodies orbiting one another in a complex triad. This rare orbital configuration is often referred to as the "three-body problem."

Astronomers may have just identified a rare example of a "three-body problem" hiding in plain sight beyond the solar system's most distant planet. If the observation can be confirmed, it suggests that many more cosmic triplets could be hiding in the outer reaches of our cosmic neighborhood, researchers say.

Back in 2001, astronomers discovered what they thought was a binary system made up of two large bodies orbiting each other approximately 3.7 billion miles (6 billion kilometers) from Earth in the Kuiper Belt — a ring of asteroids, comets and dwarf planets, including Pluto, that lies beyond the orbit of Neptune.

The two icy rocks, collectively named 148780 Altjira, are separated by around 4,700 miles (7,600 km), or roughly one-fiftieth the distance between Earth and the moon. (The system is named after the creation deity of the Aboriginal Arrernte people from Australia.)

But in a new study published March 4 in The Planetary Science Journal, researchers propose that the inner body in the Altjira system is actually a pair of smaller objects circling extremely close to one another, making this a triple system.

The study team came to this conclusion after combining images from the Hubble Space Telescope with 17 years' worth of data collected by the W. M. Keck Observatory on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano. This revealed subtle shifts in the trajectory of the outer body, suggesting that it is being gravitationally tugged on by two objects instead of one. However, the system is too far away to get visual confirmation of the separation of the inner bodies.

"A triple system was the best fit [when comparing different modeling scenarios]," study lead author Maia Nelsen, an astronomer at Brigham Young University in Utah, said in a NASA statement. However, it is also possible that the inner body could be a "contact binary" — two objects that touch each other and act as a single entity — or "something that actually is oddly flat, like a pancake," she added.

Over the next 10 years, the Altjira system will be in its "eclipsing season," where the outer body will be frequently positioned between the inner body and the sun, which could allow for more detailed observations of its orbital trajectory, the researchers wrote.

During this time, the James Webb Space Telescope is also scheduled to survey the Altjira system, which could conclusively settle the debate with its unmatched image-resolving powers, according to NASA.

When three objects with similar mass orbit one another, the mathematics involved in calculating their trajectories becomes extremely challenging and leaves very little room for error. That means the slightest change to one of the objects' trajectories can throw the whole system out of balance.

"The puzzle of predicting how three gravitationally bound bodies move in space has challenged mathematicians for centuries," NASA representatives wrote in the statement. This is often referred to as the three-body problem, which has also inspired a popular science fiction novel and a recent TV series of the same name.



Several types of triple systems have been found throughout the cosmos, including triple-star systems like our nearest stellar neighbors — the Alpha Centauri system — and "Tatooine" exoplanets with two suns, providing several solutions to this problem. However, there is no single generally accepted solution to working out the orbital mechanics of a triple system, so the "problem" is often considered unsolved.

If confirmed as a triple system, Altjira will be the second of its kind discovered in the Kuiper Belt; 47171 Lempo, which has a nearly identical configuration as the one proposed for Altjira, was also previously classified as a binary system.

There are around 40 other known binary systems in the Kuiper Belt, some of which could be unrecognized triple systems. However, there are likely many more three-body systems there.

So far, scientists have found around 3,000 Kuiper Belt objects, but they estimate that there could be "several hundred thousand more" smaller objects there, each wider than 10 miles (16 km) across, researchers wrote. Therefore, this part of the solar system could be a great place to hunt for many more of these systems.

"The universe is filled with a range of three-body systems," Nelson said. "And we're finding that the Kuiper Belt may be no exception."

A fossil first discovered over 50 years ago has finally been identified as the remains of a pony-sized dinosaur that lived about 166 million years ago.

The fossil was spotted at the base of a cliff on the Isle of Skye in Scotland in 1973, but it was not collected by paleontologists for another 45 years due to its tricky location.

Now, according to a paper published March 6 in the journal Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, this fossil — which includes fragments of a spine, ribs, and hip bones — may be the remains of a dinosaur that lived during the Jurassic Period (201.3 and 145.0 million years ago).

This fossil, nicknamed the "Elgol dinosaur" after the village near where it was found, is now considered the most complete dinosaur fossil ever discovered in Scotland, as well as being the earliest ever unearthed there.

Located off the northwestern coast of Scotland, the Isle of Skye is the location of several dinosaur fossils and footprints from the Middle Jurassic period, which is poorly represented in the global fossil record.

"This is a wonderful addition to the rapidly growing set of Jurassic finds from the Isle of Skye which are enabling us to learn more and more about the rich ecosystem of the time," study co-author Stig Walsh, a senior curator of vertebrate palaeobiology at National Museums Scotland, said in a statement.

The newly identified dinosaur may have been about the size of a pony, and was at least eight years old when it died, according to the researchers.

The fossil was first recorded by paleontologists during field trips between 1971 and 1982, with a 1973 notebook entry mentioning "bones of a dinosaur" in a cliff with a small sketch. The original discoverers didn't realize its significance, and due to its awkward location, it was exceedingly difficult to remove from the ground.



Researchers rediscovered the fragmented fossil in 2015, and itwas eventually excavated and transported from its cliff location in 2018.

"This was a really challenging extraction, in fact we'd previously felt was too difficult to collect the fossil, but I thought it was really important to study it," study lead author Elsa Panciroli, a NERC Independent Research Fellow at National Museums Scotland, said in the statement.

"I was able to persuade the team to give it a try. It took a lot of hard work from a lot of people, but we did it: finally we can confirm and publish Scotland's first recorded and most complete dinosaur, and that makes it all worthwhile."

Paleontologists then studied the fossil using a range of techniques, including micro-CT scanning, which is a non-destructive imaging technique that uses X-rays to create highly detailed 3D images of small objects at a microscopic scale.

The shape and microstructure of the bones, and the fact they were found within the Kilmaluag Formation — a geological formation dating to the Middle Jurassic — indicated that the fossil may be the remains of a cerapodan or ornithopod dinosaur.

Cerapodan dinosaurs are a major group of ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaurs, which have a pelvic structure resembling that of modern birds. Ornithopods are one herbivorous sub-group of cerapodans that lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and had beaked mouths for cropping vegetation. One of the most well-known groups of ornithopods were Iguanodons, which were one of the first dinosaurs ever named.

If this new dinosaur is indeed ornithopodan, it may be among the earliest ornithischian fossils, and possibly the oldest ornithopodan body fossil in the world.

"Some aspects of the bones indicate that the specimen may be an ornithopod, a group of plant-eating dinosaurs that are best known from the Cretaceous," study co-author Susie Maidment, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London, said in the statement.

"This specimen, however, would already have been a fossil by the time that the better-known ornithopods like Iguanodon and Hypsilophodon were walking the Earth," she said. "Recent research on the fossils of Elgol has revealed a diverse ecosystem of extraordinarily preserved Middle Jurassic animals, and I'm sure there are more exciting discoveries to come."

Some male octopuses tend to get eaten by their sexual partners, but male blue-lined octopuses avoid this fate with help from one of nature’s most potent venoms

During mating, some male octopuses inject females with their potent venom to paralyse them – and avoid being eaten by their mates.

Typically, animals use venom to kill prey or defend themselves from predators. Some species of pufferfish, for example, produce one of nature’s most potent venoms, tetrodotoxin, as a defence mechanism. Several blue-ringed octopus species use tetrodotoxin as a powerful weapon to quickly immobilise and kill their prey.

What shapes are made by a spinning needle? This seemingly innocent problem has puzzled mathematicians for decades, but now a new proof is being called the biggest result of the current century as it could help solve many other tricky problems

By Alex Wilkins

Mathematicians have solved a decades-old problem related to spinning a needle, in what has been hailed as one of the most important mathematical results in recent times. Once seen as “impossible”, the solution should now unlock answers to a slew of other difficult problems that had seemed completely out of reach. “The paper is perhaps the biggest breakthrough in mathematics of…

The common diabetes drug metformin works partly by excreting sugar from the bloodstream into the intestines, where gut bacteria then convert it into chemicals that improve the insulin response.

Since the 1990s, doctors have prescribed the drug metformin to treat type 2 diabetes, but scientists didn't fully understand how it worked.

Now, new research fills in one piece of the puzzle: Metformin triggers the body to expel glucose from the bloodstream into the intestines, where bacteria feed on the carbohydrate to make compounds that may help control blood sugar levels.

In the new study, published March 3 in the journal Communications Medicine, researchers calculated that metformin treatment increased how much glucose was released into the gut nearly fourfold. That seemed to boost the production of fatty compounds that help protect the gut and reduce inflammation.

Multiple pathways

Most research has focused on metformin's effects in the liver, where it boosts how cells respond to insulin and blocks the synthesis of the sugar glucose. But some studies have suggested that the drug also acts on the gut, perhaps by blocking glucose uptake into the bloodstream.

"Many people are working on the gut action of metformin because if you take metformin orally, the intestines are exposed to very high concentrations," said senior study author Dr. Wataru Ogawa, a medical researcher at Kobe University in Japan. (Ogawa received research support and lecture fees from the metformin manufacturer Sumitomo Pharma.)

Previously, Ogawa's team showed that the body excretes glucose into the hollow tunnel of the human gut where food and waste travel, known as the lumen. This happens in people with and without diabetes. "It means that this is a physiological function that humans have," Ogawa told Live Science.

In the new study, the researchers found that metformin nearly quadrupled the rate of glucose excretion into the gut in five people with type 2 diabetes, and they replicated those findings in mice.

Keeping glucose out of circulation by directing it to the gut might directly lower blood sugar levels, but scientists told Live Science they think this explains only part of metformin’s therapeutic effects.

Nicola Morrice, a metformin researcher at the University of Dundee in Scotland who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email, "I do not expect this to be the drug's main mechanism of action."

Besides drawing sugar out of the bloodstream, excreted glucose could also have an indirect effect on blood sugar by feeding gut bacteria, other experts told Live Science.

Dr. José-Manuel Fernández-Real, a medical researcher at the University of Girona in Spain who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email, "Some bacteria, particularly those that thrive on simple sugars, may experience increased growth, while others that rely on complex carbohydrates or fiber fermentation might be less affected."

A glucose molecule has a backbone of six carbon atoms, so to determine the rate at which gut bacteria break down glucose into other molecules, Ogawa had to find a way to keep track of these carbons. His team injected mice with glucose containing a "heavy" isotope, meaning a version of carbon that carries an extra neutron. This allowed them to trace the heavy carbons as the bacteria transformed glucose into other compounds.

Stool samples revealed that bacteria in mice treated with metformin had converted the heavy glucose into short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). "Bacterial species that produce short chain fatty acids are generally 'good' bacteria," suggesting metformin’s effects could potentially foster a healthy microbiome, Ogawa said.

Metformin treatment caused SCFAs containing heavy carbon to increase by just 1% in stool samples. However, Manuel Vázquez-Carrera, a pharmacology researcher at the University of Barcelona who was not involved with the study, told Live Science in an email that "most SCFAs are rapidly absorbed and utilized rather than excreted." That means the measurement was likely an underestimate.

And "even a slight rise in SCFA production could enhance gut barrier function, reduce inflammation, and improve insulin sensitivity, all of which are beneficial for managing diabetes," Fernández-Real speculated.

The study had a few limitations. First, the researchers did not assess how higher levels of gut SCFAs affected the health of the mice. It also included "a very small number of participants who were receiving varying doses of metformin as part of their treatment regimes," Morrice said.

The mouse work also involved only male rodents, so possible sex differences in the drug's actions were not explored. Beyond testing metformin's effects on five diabetes patients, Ogawa said he has finished a larger, gold-standard trial in humans to further study the drug's impacts on the gut. The researchers haven't completed the analysis, but as of yet, they haven't seen any sex differences.

Morrice suggested that future work could explore how metformin affects glucose excretion in mice that consume different diets, such as high-fat, high-sugar diets, which are linked to obesity.

An AI model can scan your brain with non-invasive equipment and convert your thoughts into typed sentences — with no implants required.

Scientists at Meta have used artificial intelligence (AI) and noninvasive brain scans to unravel how thoughts are translated into typed sentences, two new studies show.

In one study, scientists developed an AI model that decoded brain signals to reproduce sentences typed by volunteers. In the second study, the same researchers used AI to map how the brain actually produces language, turning thoughts into typed sentences.

The findings could one day support a noninvasive brain-computer interface that could help people with brain lesions or injuries to communicate, the scientists said.

"This was a real step in decoding, especially with noninvasive decoding," Alexander Huth, a computational neuroscientist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the research, told Live Science.

Brain-computer interfaces that use similar decoding techniques have been implanted in the brains of people who have lost the ability to communicate, but the new studies could support a potential path to wearable devices.

In the first study, the researchers used a technique called magnetoencephalography (MEG), which measures the magnetic field created by electrical impulses in the brain, to track neural activity while participants typed sentences. Then, they trained an AI language model to decode the brain signals and reproduce the sentences from the MEG data.

The model decoded the letters that participants typed with 68% accuracy. Frequently occurring letters were decoded correctly more often, while less-common letters, like Z and K, came with higher error rates. When the model made mistakes, it tended to substitute characters that were physically close to the target letter on a QWERTY keyboard, suggesting that the model uses motor signals from the brain to predict which letter a participant typed.

The team's second study built on these results to show how language is produced in the brain while a person types. The scientists collected 1,000 MEG snapshots per second as each participant typed a few sentences. From these snapshots, they decoded the different phases of sentence production.

They found that the brain first generates information about the context and meaning of the sentence, and then produces increasingly granular representations of each word, syllable and letter as the participant types.

"These results confirm the long-standing predictions that language production requires a hierarchical decomposition of sentence meaning into progressively smaller units that ultimately control motor actions," the authors wrote in the study.

To prevent the representation of one word or letter from interfering with the next, the brain uses a "dynamic neural code" to keep them separate, the team found. This code constantly shifts where each piece of information is represented in the language-producing parts of the brain.

That lets the brain link successive letters, syllables, and words while maintaining information about each over longer periods of time. However, the MEG experiments were not able to pinpoint exactly where in those brain regions each of these representations of language arises.

Taken together, these two studies, which have not been peer-reviewed yet, could help scientists design noninvasive devices that could improve communication in people who have lost the ability to speak.

Although the current setup is too bulky and too sensitive to work properly outside a controlled lab environment, advances in MEG technology may open the door to future wearable devices, the researchers wrote.

"I think they're really at the cutting edge of methods here," Huth said. "They are definitely doing as much as we can do with current technology in terms of what they can pull out of these signals."

A saucer-like space capsule touched down in the Australian outback last month, marking the first time a commercial spacecraft has landed Down Under.

Varda Space Industries' Winnebago-2 (W-2) space capsule reentered Earth's atmosphere and dropped down in South Australia on Feb. 28. In doing so, W-2 also set a world first by becoming the first commercial spacecraft to return to a commercial spaceport, according to a statement released by the Australian Space Agency.

The successful return of W-2 was a "landmark moment for the Australian space sector," Australian Space Agency representatives wrote in the statement.

The company behind W-2, Varda, is an American startup based in California. W-2 originally left Earth from California on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 14 as part of the Transporter-12 rideshare mission — the Transporter carries satellites from various customers into space. W-2 then spent 45 days in orbit, carrying payloads from the U.S. Air Force and NASA before dropping down to the Koonibba Test Range, run by Australian aerospace company Southern Launch.

W-2 weighed 265 pounds (120 kilograms) and had various technologies onboard to advance space research. For example, W-2 carried Varda’s expanded pharmaceutical reactor, which allows for the production of medicine in space, according to a statement released by Southern Launch.

The space capsule was also equipped with a heatshield developed with NASA and a spectrometer built by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory. The spectrometer, known as Optical Sensing of Plasmas in the ReEntry Environment (OSPREE), measured the environment around the capsule as it reentered at speeds exceeding Mach 25, which is 25 times the speed of sound, or around 19,000 miles per hour (31,000 kilometers per hour), according to a statement released by Varda.

"We are ecstatic to have W-2 back on our home planet safely and are proud to support significant reentry research for our government partners as we continue building a thriving foundation for economic expansion to low Earth orbit," Varda CEO Will Bruey said in the statement.

The Southern Launch team watched the W-2 reentry from the ground with advanced tracking telescopes and led the recovery operations, which included representatives from the Far West Coast Aboriginal Corporation, the traditional owners of the land where the capsule landed, according to the Southern Launch statement.

"For Australia, this mission ushers in a new era of space capabilities for the nation," Southern Launch representatives wrote in its statement. "The W-2 mission was the first time a commercial space craft re-entry was granted under Australian legislation and is just the first of many scheduled to return to the Koonibba Test Range."

Splitting water molecules takes more energy than calculations suggest, and is a key roadblock to cheap hydrogen fuel production. Now, scientists have discovered why.

For the first time, scientists have observed water molecules splitting in real time to form hydrogen and oxygen.

And right before they split, the molecules did something completely unexpected: They flipped 180 degrees.

This micro acrobatic stunt takes energy, which offers a crucial explanation for why splitting water takes more energy than theoretical calculations suggested.

The researchers say that studying this further could offer key insights into making the process of splitting water molecules more efficient — opening a pathway to cheaper clean hydrogen fuel and breathable oxygen for future Mars missions. They published their findings March 5 in the journal Science Advances.

Hydrogen has a number of key properties that make it an enticing source of green energy. The energy-rich fuel is capable of powering trucks and even cargo ships, and it is the only alternative to fossil fuels in industries such as steel and fertilizer manufacturing. When it's burned, the fuel releases water instead of carbon dioxide.

Yet the steep energy requirements for hydrogen production severely limit the scale at which the fuel is produced. According to the International Energy Authority, 322 million tonnes (354 million tons) of hydrogen fuel needs to be produced each year to meet global energy needs. But in 2023, only 97 million tonnes (107 million tons) was manufactured at a monetary cost 1.5 to six times greater than fossil fuel production — and the vast majority of it was made using fossil fuels too.

Hydrogen fuel is made by adding water to an electrode and then splitting the water with an applied voltage into hydrogen and oxygen.

This process is most efficient when the chemical element iridium is used as a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction that cleaves oxygen from water molecules. But iridium only arrives on our planet from meteorite impacts, making it costly and scarce.

But even when using iridium, the process is less efficient than scientists believe it should be.

"It ends up taking more energy than theoretically calculated. If you do the math, it should require 1.23 volts. But, in reality, it requires more like 1.5 or 1.6 volts," study lead author Franz Geiger, a professor of chemistry at Northwestern University, said in a statement. "Providing that extra voltage costs money, and that's why water splitting hasn't been implemented at a large scale."

To better understand the energy requirements of this process and why it's less efficient than theory suggests, the researchers placed water on an electrode inside a container and measured the molecules' positions using the amplitude and phase of laser light shone onto them.

When the scientists applied a voltage across the electrode, they observed that the molecules rapidly flipped and rotated so that their two hydrogen atoms touching the electrode faced up and the oxygen atom faced down.

—Solar power stations in space could be the answer to our energy needs

—EV batteries could last much longer thanks to new capacitor with 19-times higher energy density that scientists created by mistake

"Electrodes are negatively charged, so the water molecule wants to put its positively charged hydrogen atoms toward the electrode's surface," Geiger said. "In that position, electron transfer from water's oxygen atom to the electrode's active site is blocked. When the electric field becomes strong enough, it causes the molecules to flip, so the oxygen atoms point toward the electrode's surface. Then, the hydrogen atoms are out of the way, and the electrons can move from water's oxygen to the electrode."

By measuring the number of molecules that rotated and the energy required for them to do so, the researchers found that this flipping was likely a necessary and unavoidable part of the splitting process. What's more, the researchers discovered that higher pH levels made this process more efficient.

Further studying this process could help scientists to design more efficient catalysts to use in the process, and to better understand the chemical processes involved, the researchers said, while also offering fresh insights into how water behaves.

"Our work underscores how little we know about water at interfaces," Geiger said. "Water is tricky, and our new technology could help us understand it a bit better."

"By designing new catalysts that make water flipping easier, we could make water splitting more practical and cost-effective," he added.

We are in an era of disruption. The geopolitical context is increasingly adversarial, power is more widely distributed, and relationships among leading powers have become more competitive.”

These are the opening lines of Science Diplomacy in an Era of Disruption, a report published last month by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, based in Washington DC, and the Royal Society in London. The organizations clearly leave no doubt as to why the report is needed, adding: “Scientific values once thought universal are now being re-examined. Trust in science and the use of evidence in policymaking is under renewed attack across the world.”

Science diplomacy is the use of science to improve international cooperation, according to one definition. The document updates a report that the two organizations published in 2010, a different, indeed more optimistic, time for international cooperation — talks on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, for example, involving nearly 200 countries, would begin the following year. Today, by contrast, the United States, Europe and China are restricting their areas of cooperation and ramping up competition. Also different is that industry is a more visible presence in science diplomacy than in the past, and firms have resources exceeding those of many governments to promote their interests. “We need a framework on the practice of science diplomacy that recognizes the world for what it is,” the updated report notes. 

The question it doesn’t fully answer, however, is how to do science diplomacy when the integrity of science itself is under attack from national actors, including the elected government of the United States, the world science superpower of recent decades. How, when the legitimacy of global scientific institutions is increasingly being challenged, can science be deployed in diplomacy — for example, to resolve disagreements on global challenges such as protecting the environment or public health? Events even since the report was published suggest more challenges that any new approach to science diplomacy must fully meet.

Drill, baby drill? Trump policies will hurt climate ― but US green transition is underway

Take the situation with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). As Nature’s news team has been reporting, the United States, a significant supporter of the IPCC, looks to be on a path to pulling away from the underlying scientific infrastructure of world climate policy. For the first time in IPCC history, the United States did not send a delegation to attend a key meeting of the panel, in China, where the themes for the next global assessment report were being decided. This followed separate White House executive orders: one cancelled US funding for the UN climate convention; the other ordered a review of US membership of international organizations. 

Since the IPCC’s founding in 1988, governments representing all systems of political thought have invited scientists to review the literature on climate change. The results of that knowledge have fed into talks to achieve legally binding agreements, such as the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, or the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. IPCC meetings are frequently argumentative affairs for all sorts of reasons. However, and crucially, politicians do not instruct the researchers on which papers to read or what to write in their reviews. IPCC leaders past and present have been supported by their funders to follow the consensus of evidence when coming to a conclusion. The IPCC has experienced many stresses and strains over the years, but the system of governments protecting the integrity of the review process has held. Now, it seems, at least one of the panel’s sponsoring governments is no longer willing to play that part. 

Even if deprived of US input, the IPCC must continue publishing its authoritative reports. But a potential US withdrawal poses a direct challenge to science diplomacy, with a key member of the international community refusing to recognize that science has a role in resolving disagreements on climate action.

One approach to protecting science in diplomacy is outlined in a separate report by the European Union, also published last month. Entitled A European Framework for Science Diplomacy, it recommends that science move closer to the centre of EU policymaking. “There is hardly any (geo-)political development not affected by the output of research and innovation,” it says. Europe’s science, and therefore its scientists, must “become more visible and be at the core rather than at the fringe” of “foreign and security policy as well as research and innovation policy”, it says. 

Such a shift will not be straightforward for researchers. They lack incentives to participate in policy work, as a survey in Nature last year showed (Nature 636, 26–30; 2024). Researchers who do participate are more used to providing advisory evidence, while staying at arm’s length from actual policy decisions. This distance ensures that responsibility for decisions rests with politicians and not their expert advisers, and it has mostly served research well in ‘peacetime’. 

Science could solve some of the world’s biggest problems. Why aren’t governments using it?

Science could solve some of the world’s biggest problems. Why aren’t governments using it?

But now that science itself is being contested, there are persuasive arguments as to why researchers need to be in the room when big decisions are being made on subjects such as climate change, pandemic preparedness or the regulation of artificial intelligence.

If researchers accept the invitation to join the EU’s policymaking high table, their presence might also provide them with a way to protect the ‘science’ in science diplomacy should there be calls for budget cuts or attempts at the kind of interference now being seen in the United States.

One of the EU report’s weaknesses is that it assumes a shared understanding on the part of diplomats and policymakers that researchers must be able to operate without direct interference. The experience of the United States tells us that this cannot be assumed.

If the EU report’s recommendations are to be implemented, one necessary, although not sufficient, step, must be to write researchers’ ability to operate independently into law, as it already is in some countries, albeit imperfectly. 

Science diplomacy is needed more now than at any time in history, given the scale of challenges the world faces. Research is often described as a form of ‘soft power’ diplomacy, a way for nations to advance their national interests without using military means. The first step towards protecting science diplomacy must be to protect science itself.

COLLETON COUNTY, S.C. (WCSC) - One man is facing charges and another person is expected to be arrested in connection to the theft of one of the new license plate readers in Colleton County.

A release from the Colleton County Sheriff’s Office states that Timothy McWilliams, 56, is charged with felony grand larceny. He was arrested Friday.

Deputies say they successfully recovered the stolen “Flock Safety” license plate reader camera that was originally stolen last week Tuesday.

The camera is a part of a newly launched “Colleton County Safe” initiative. The technology is expected to be used as a “critical tool for law enforcement” by helping reduce crime, solve cases, recover stolen cars and even locate missing or endangered people.

The charges against McWilliams stem from an incident in which witnesses saw two men wearing traffic safety vests who were removing the camera.

“These cameras are legally installed on private property throughout Colleton County under official agreements. Tampering with or stealing them is a serious offense, and offenders will be held accountable, including facing criminal charges and potential restitution,” the release states.

“These cameras are in place to protect our community, they help us solve violent crimes such as homicides and shootings and assist in finding missing persons. We will not tolerate interference with this vital public safety resource,” Colleton County Sheriff Buddy Hill said.

Deputies say efforts remain underway to identify and charge the remaining suspect.

Microblogging platform X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday suffered a massive global outage for the third time today, leaving thousands of users unable to access the app or website. According to the outage-tracking platform Downdetector, the first disruption was recorded around 3:30 PM IST, followed by another at 7:00 PM IST and a third spike at 8:44 PM IST. X chief Elon Musk said a 'massive cyberattack' targeting the platform was the cause behind the disruption. 

The outage has impacted users across multiple countries, including the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. For the uninitiated, Downdetector monitors the operational status of internet services and has recorded a substantial spike in outage reports. 

 

Downdetector data shows that 52 per cent of users are facing issues with the app itself, 40 per cent are experiencing problems on the website, and 7 per cent have reported server connection failures. 

With X being the primary platform where users typically report disruptions on other social media services, many found themselves unable to voice their concerns about the ongoing outage.  

As the repeated service failures have led to frustration among users, X chief Elon Musk posted that the platform is facing a "massive cyberattack" and suspected the involvement of a "large, coordinated group and/or a country". 

"There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against 𝕏. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing," Elon Musk wrote.

While some regions have seen a partial restoration of services, many users continue to experience accessibility issues.  

According to Downdetector, the number of outage reports surged past 40,000 in the United States, while more than 10,800 users in the United Kingdom also reported issues earlier in the day.

More details about the global outage are awaited.

Prospective study finds AI increases cancer detection by 13.8% in single-reader settings without raising recall rates, presenting a new tool for countries relying on single-reader mammography screening.

March 10, 2025 — Lunit, a provider of AI-powered solutions for cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, has published a prospective study in Nature Communications validating the real-world effectiveness of AI-powered mammography screening in South Korea’s national breast cancer screening program. Conducted as the world’s first large-scale, multicenter prospective study in a single-reading setting, the research underscores how AI-assisted mammography interpretation significantly improves breast cancer detection rates without increasing recall rates.

The study was led by Professor Yun-Woo Chang from Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital, in collaboration with both breast and general radiologists from six leading academic hospitals in South Korea. The study analyzed 24,543 women aged 40 and above who underwent routine biennial mammography (2D full-field digital mammogram) between February 2021 and December 2022 as part of Korea's national breast cancer screening program.

The study compared the performance of breast radiologists interpreting screening mammograms with and without Lunit's AI-based computer-aided detection, Lunit INSIGHT MMG. The results revealed that AI-assisted breast radiologists detected 13.8% more screen-detected breast cancers than those relying solely on conventional interpretation methods, or without AI assistance. The cancer detection rate (CDR) increased from 5.01 (per 1,000) to 5.70 with AI assistance, while recall rates (RRs) remained statistically unchanged, ensuring improved clinical effectiveness and minimizing unnecessary additional recalls. Moreover, AI assistance led to a significant improvement in detecting small-sized tumors and node-negative cancers, key indicators of improved early detection.

Additionally, the study evaluated Lunit INSIGHT MMG’s impact on general radiologists who do not specialize in breast imaging through a simulated retrospective study. The results demonstrated that AI assistance led to an even greater improvement in CDRs for general radiologists, with an increase of 26.4% (3.87 to 4.89 per 1,000), underscoring AI’s potential to support radiologists with varying levels of expertise.

“This prospective study offers compelling real-world evidence that AI can improve early cancer detection while maintaining effectiveness and reducing unnecessary patient anxiety caused by false positives in a single-reading setting,” said Professor Chang, the lead and corresponding author of the study.

A Solution for Single and Double-Reading Screening Systems

The publication further builds upon Lunit INSIGHT MMG’s track record in improving breast cancer detection. In Sweden, Capio St. Göran Hospital conducted a prospective clinical trial to assess Lunit AI’s effectiveness in breast cancer screening when replacing one reader within a double-reading setting. Following positive trial results, Capio St. Göran Hospital became the world’s first to replace one of two radiologists in its double-reading workflow with AI, marking a paradigm shift in breast cancer screening.

“This latest prospective study in South Korea further solidifies Lunit INSIGHT MMG’s potential as an indispensable tool in breast cancer screening,” said Brandon Suh, CEO of Lunit. “Whether in a single-reader or double-reader setting, AI can serve as a powerful force multiplier, assisting radiologists in detecting cancer earlier and more accurately.”

Shaping the Future 

With mounting evidence supporting AI’s role in breast cancer screening, Lunit is driving its global adoption. Lunit INSIGHT MMG has already been deployed in national breast screening programs in Australia, Sweden, Iceland, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, helping healthcare systems enhance efficiency and optimize diagnostic accuracy.

The study’s findings are expected to influence global breast cancer screening protocols, particularly in countries where single-reading mammography interpretation is widely practiced. By demonstrating AI’s ability to enhance radiologists’ accuracy without increasing RRs, the study provides critical data supporting AI’s role in optimizing cancer detection while reducing the workload burden on radiologists. This is particularly relevant as many countries face a shortage of specialized breast imaging professionals, making AI an important tool to improve efficiency and maintain high diagnostic standards.

“As AI adoption accelerates, we remain committed to driving innovation and making AI-powered cancer screening the new standard of care,” added Suh. “By working closely with healthcare providers worldwide, we aim to ensure that AI benefits as many patients as possible.”

Brazil’s state-owned postal service, Empresa Brasileira de Correios e Telégrafos, is seeking proposals for blockchain and AI solutions to improve its logistics and operational processes. 

The move comes as rising demand for faster and more reliable delivery services places pressure on postal services to modernise their infrastructure.

On Friday, the country’s official publication Diário Oficial da União published a tender notice inviting companies and specialists to submit solutions for digitally transforming Correios’ services. The initiative, Licitação Seleção Prévia e Diálogo nº 25000001/2025 CS, seeks sophisticated technological solutions to improve business operations, supply management, and internal procedures.

Correios is facing significant operational issues, including growing parcel volumes, pressure for faster delivery times, and the need to improve tracking accuracy. These concerns could be addressed using AI and blockchain solutions that automate key processes and improve supply chain transparency.

Correios stated that its goal is to create a collaborative approach to developing AI and blockchain-based solutions to commercial and operational difficulties.

While specific use cases were not detailed, blockchain technology is often used for improving supply chain tracking, securing transactions, and verifying documents. AI applications could enhance logistics by improving data analysis and streamlining operations. Potential AI applications for Correios could include predictive analytics for improving delivery efficiency, identifying bottlenecks in the supply chain, and automating customer service through chatbots. Blockchain technology could strengthen parcel tracking, provide tamper-proof shipment data, and automate customs clearance.

Correios’ interest in blockchain and AI reflects a growing trend among logistics companies to use digital solutions to enhance efficiency and transparency. Major logistics corporations such as DHL, FedEx, and UPS have already shown how AI and blockchain may improve operational efficiency:

AI can analyse massive databases to detect inefficiencies and forecast delivery patterns, lowering costs and improving service levels. Blockchain technology provides a secure, immutable record of transactions, which can help prevent fraud and improve supply chain accountability.

The pre-selection process signals Correios’ broader strategy to modernise its infrastructure and improve service delivery. Other postal services globally have introduced similar initiatives in response to increasing demand for faster, more secure, and efficient operations.

PHILADELPHIA & PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Comcast Business today announced the launch of a new multichannel brand campaign, titled “Powering the Engine of Modern Business,” highlighting its capabilities as a global enterprise technology partner. Debuting today, the campaign includes three TV spots depicting real-world scenarios the company has deployed for its customers. The TV spots feature cameos from Billy Horschel, golf legend Tom Watson and Golf Channel’s Rich Lerner, with narration from Josh Brolin. Comcast Business also announced a new two-year agreement with eight-time PGA TOUR event winner Billy Horschel as brand ambassador ahead of the return to his hometown tournament, THE PLAYERS® Championship.





"This new campaign reflects the evolution of the Comcast Business brand as a global technology solutions partner, demonstrating not just what could be possible, but what we’re actively doing for customers across industries today,” said Eileen Diskin, Chief Marketing Officer, Comcast Business. “And as our new Comcast Business brand ambassador, the confidence, swagger and roll-up-your-sleeves mentality Billy brings to the golf course aligns perfectly with how we approach our customers’ needs every day, and our partnership with THE PLAYERS Championship and the PGA TOUR couldn’t be a better launch platform.”



The campaign’s three playfully scripted spots bring Comcast Business’ capabilities to life through a series of vignettes depicting experiences the company is making possible for customers today from small businesses to large enterprises including the PGA TOUR and THE PLAYERS Championship. Narrated by Josh Brolin, the spots demonstrate how Comcast Business helps transform companies into “seamlessly-restocking, frictionless-paying, poke-bowl-ordering, line-skipping” models of service and efficiency. Whether it’s retailers, restaurants, hotels, hospitals – or even the PGA TOUR – businesses all rely on leading connectivity and networking, advanced cybersecurity, and expert partnership. Comcast Business keeps their complex networks running like engines of modern business.

An artist’s concept shows LuGRE on Blue Ghost and its three key records

NASA, in collaboration with the Italian Space Agency, has successfully demonstrated the ability to acquire and track Earth-based navigation signals on the Moon. The breakthrough was achieved through the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE), which was delivered to the lunar surface by Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander on March 2. The achievement confirms that Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals can be detected at the Moon's distance, offering a potential advancement for future space missions, including NASA's Artemis programme. The ability to track these signals on the Moon could enhance autonomous navigation for spacecraft, reducing reliance on Earth-based tracking systems. The LuGRE payload, one of ten NASA payloads sent aboard the lander, is expected to continue gathering data for the duration of its 14-day mission.

According to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the LuGRE experiment successfully acquired and tracked signals from both GPS and Galileo constellations at 2 a.m. EST on March 3. This marked the first time that GNSS signals had been used for navigation at a distance of approximately 225,000 miles from Earth. The data collected will contribute to the development of navigation technology that could support future lunar and deep-space exploration.

Kevin Coggins, Deputy Associate Administrator for NASA's Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) programme, told NASA's official news source that the experiment demonstrated the feasibility of using GNSS signals for navigation beyond Earth. He highlighted that the same technology used in aviation and mobile devices on Earth could now be leveraged for lunar missions.

The LuGRE payload had already set records during its journey to the Moon. On January 21, it achieved the highest altitude GNSS signal acquisition at 209,900 miles from Earth, surpassing the previous record set by NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission. By February 20, as LuGRE entered lunar orbit, the altitude record had been extended to 243,000 miles. These milestones suggest that spacecraft operating in cislunar space could use GNSS signals for navigation, providing greater autonomy for missions beyond Earth's orbit.

Developed through a partnership between NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the Italian Space Agency, Qascom, and Politecnico di Torino, the LuGRE payload represents a significant step toward advanced space navigation systems. Data collected from the ongoing mission will inform future efforts to expand GNSS coverage for lunar and Martian exploration.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — When artificial intelligence-backed tractors became available to vineyards, Tom Gamble wanted to be an early adopter. He knew there would be a learning curve, but Gamble decided the technology was worth figuring out.

The third-generation farmer bought one autonomous tractor. He plans on deploying its self-driving feature this spring and is currently using the tractor’s AI sensor to map his Napa Valley vineyard. As it learns each row, the tractor will know where to go once it is used autonomously. The AI within the machine will then process the data it collects and help Gamble make better-informed decisions about his crops — what he calls “precision farming.”

“It’s not going to completely replace the human element of putting your boot into the vineyard, and that’s one of my favorite things to do,” he said. “But it’s going to be able to allow you to work more smartly, more intelligently and in the end, make better decisions under less fatigue.”

Gamble said he anticipates using the tech as much as possible because of “economic, air quality and regulatory imperatives.” Autonomous tractors, he said, could help lower his fuel use and cut back on pollution.

As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce. New agricultural tech like AI can help farmers to cut back on waste, and to run more efficient and sustainable vineyards by monitoring water use and helping determine when and where to use products like fertilizers or pest control. AI-backed tractors and irrigation systems, farmer say, can minimize water use by analyzing soil or vines, while also helping farmers to manage acres of vineyards by providing more accurate data on the health of a crop or what a season’s yield will be.




Other facets of the wine industry have also started adopting the tech, from using generative AI to create custom wine labels to turning to ChatGPT to develop, label and price an entire bottle.

“I don’t see anybody losing their job, because I think that a tractor operator’s skills are going to increase and as a result, and maybe they’re overseeing a small fleet of these machines that are out there, and they’ll be compensated as a result of their increased skill level,” he said.

Farmers, Gamble said, are always evolving. There were fears when the tractor replaced horses and mules pulling plows, but that technology “proved itself” just like AI farming tech will, he said, adding that adopting any new tech always takes time.

Companies like John Deere have started using the AI that wine farmers are beginning to adopt. The agricultural giant uses “Smart Apply” technology on tractors, for example, helping growers apply material for crop retention by using sensors and algorithms to sense foliage on grape canopies, said Sean Sundberg, business integration manager at John Deere.

The tractors that use that tech then only spray “where there are grapes or leaves or whatnot so that it doesn’t spray material unnecessarily,” he said. Last year, the company announced a project with Sonoma County Winegrowers to use tech to help wine grape growers maximize their yield.

Tyler Klick, partner at Redwood Empire Vineyard Management, said his company has started automating irrigation valves at the vineyards it helps manage. The valves send an alert in the event of a leak and will automatically shut off if they notice an “excessive” water flow rate.

“That valve is actually starting to learn typical water use,” Klick said. “It’ll learn how much water is used before the production starts to fall off.”

Klick said each valve costs roughly $600, plus $150 per acre each year to subscribe to the service.

“Our job, viticulture, is to adjust our operations to the climatic conditions we’re dealt,” Klick said. “I can see AI helping us with finite conditions.”

Angelo A. Camillo, a professor of wine business at Sonoma State University, said that despite excitement over AI in the wine industry, some smaller vineyards are more skeptical about their ability to use the technology. Small, family-owned operations, which Camillo said account for about 80% of the wine business in America, are slowly disappearing — many don’t have the money to invest in AI, he said. A robotic arm that helps put together pallets of wine, for example, can cost as much as $150,000, he said.

“For small wineries, there’s a question mark, which is the investment. Then there’s the education. Who’s going to work with all of these AI applications? Where is the training?” he said.

There are also potential challenges with scalability, Camillo added. Drones, for example, could be useful for smaller vineyards that could use AI to target specific crops that have a bug problem, he said — it would be much harder to operate 100 drones in a 1,000 acre vineyard while also employing the IT workers who understand the tech.

“I don’t think a person can manage 40 drones as a swarm of drones,” he said. “So there’s a constraint for the operators to adopt certain things.”

However, AI is particularly good at tracking a crop’s health – including how the plant itself is doing and whether it’s growing enough leaves – while also monitoring grapes to aid in yield projections, said Mason Earles, an assistant professor who leads the Plant AI and Biophysics Lab at UC Davis.

Diseases or viruses can sneak up and destroy entire vineyards, Earles said, calling it an “elephant in the room” across the wine industry. The process of replanting a vineyard and getting it to produce well takes at least five years, he said. AI can help growers determine which virus is affecting their plants, he said, and whether they should rip out some crops immediately to avoid losing their entire vineyard. 

Earles, who is also cofounder of the AI-powered farm management platform Scout, said his company uses AI to process thousands of images in hours and extract data quickly — something that would be difficult by hand in large vineyards that span hundreds of acres. Scout’s AI platform then counts and measures the number of grape clusters as early as when a plant is beginning to flower in order to forecast what a yield will be.

The sooner vintners know how much yield to expect, the better they can “dial in” their wine making process, he added.

“Predicting what yields you’re going to have at the end of the season, no one is that good at it right now,” he said. “But it’s really important because it determines how much labor contract you’re going to need and the supplies you’ll need for making wine.”

Earles doesn’t think the budding use of AI in vineyards is “freaking farmers out.” Rather, he anticipates that AI will be used more frequently to help with difficult field labor and to discern problems in vineyards that farmers need help with.

“They’ve seen people trying to sell them tech for decades. It’s hard to farm; it’s unpredictable compared to most other jobs,” he said. “The walking and counting, I think people would have said a long time ago, ‘I would happily let a machine take over.’”

In the blink of an eye, the internet has evolved from a groundbreaking tool of knowledge, connectivity, and progress to a hotbed of crime, scams, cyberbullying, theft, fake news, unregulated content and fraud.

  

Once a beacon of promise, the net now feels like a lawless, chaotic wild west where dangerous predators roam free, thriving in the dark corners of the web. What happened? Where did things go so wrong?

  

Let’s start with the obvious: crime. From hacking rings to identity theft, cybercrime has exploded. Every day, thousands of people fall victim to criminal activities online. Hackers are no longer the lone wolves in their basements—they’re highly organized syndicates with deep pockets, professional tools, and no conscience.

  

  

Personal data is sold on the black market like hotcakes, businesses are held ransom with ransomware attacks, and phishing schemes are more sophisticated than ever. These criminals know how to exploit every flaw, every weakness in the system, and they do so without fear of real consequence.

  

Then, there’s the growing plague of scams. Have you received an email recently offering you millions of dollars for helping a “rich billionaire” move money? How about a message from an overseas “prince” who just needs your bank details to transfer a fortune into your account?

  

Scams aren't just isolated incidents anymore. They’re an everyday occurrence. From fake job offers to fraudulent investment schemes promising "too good to be true" returns, the internet is flooded with schemes designed to separate people from their hard-earned cash.

  

And the worst part? These scammers don’t even bother to hide their malicious intent anymore. Their deception is blatant, and platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and even LinkedIn are rife with scam ads and fraudulent accounts.

  

But it doesn’t stop there—cyberbullying has become a pandemic of its own. Once a victim of bullying steps outside the walls of their home, they’re not safe anymore. In fact, they’re more vulnerable than ever.

  

Social media platforms, which should be spaces for self-expression and connection, have instead become breeding grounds for hate, cruelty, and harassment. Kids and adults alike are subjected to relentless online torment—often with no way to escape it.

  

The worst part? It’s hard to escape a situation that follows you everywhere. Cyberbullying doesn’t just stop at comments on a post. It’s personal attacks, death threats, stalking, and sometimes even the weaponization of personal information. It’s a toxic environment that’s turning people against each other, tearing apart communities, and ruining lives.

  

We also have theft—not the kind with masks and getaway cars, but the type that happens in broad daylight, digitally. Data breaches are a daily occurrence, affecting individuals and large corporations alike.

  

What’s more concerning is how these breaches are handled. It’s one thing to hear about the hack; it’s another to find out that your personal information—your passwords, your financial records, your private messages—have been stolen and are now in the hands of criminals.

  

And let’s not forget about the rise of digital theft through malware and ransomware attacks, where individuals, companies, and even governments are extorted for access to their own files. The sheer audacity of it is staggering. Theft, but with a 21st-century twist, where the victim may never even know what’s been taken until it’s too late.

  

And let’s not even get started on fake news. The internet has become a breeding ground for misinformation, conspiracy theories, and the deliberate distortion of truth. In an era where everyone can publish their “opinions” as fact, discerning what's true from what's false is harder than ever.

  

It doesn’t matter if it’s politics, health, science, or entertainment—the lines between fact and fiction are continuously blurred. Algorithms prioritize sensationalism over truth, ensuring that the loudest, most outrageous voices are heard the most. Meanwhile, responsible journalism gets buried under the noise, struggling to be seen.

  

The internet is now swarming with unregulated content fraud—you know, those shady articles and sites that have no real authority or credibility, but they somehow manage to climb to the top of search results. These are the websites selling counterfeit products, the ones offering misleading medical advice, or the ones convincing you that their miracle weight loss pills will change your life.

  

There are no rules anymore. Anyone can create anything and pass it off as truth. And because they’re so good at manipulating SEO algorithms and exploiting loopholes, these frauds go unchecked for far too long, costing unsuspecting victims their time, money, and sometimes even their health.

  

At this point, it's clear: the internet has spiraled out of control. Where’s the accountability?

  

Where are the consequences for these criminals who operate with impunity? Why aren’t platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter stepping up to stop the flood of scams, harassment, and fraud that’s poisoning their platforms? Why do we continue to let these digital marketplaces run wild, knowing full well the destruction they’re causing to individuals and businesses alike?

  

Here’s an extensive list of various types of criminal activities that occur online:

  

Hacking Unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data. Exploiting vulnerabilities in software or hardware. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to disrupt services. Credential stuffing (using stolen usernames and passwords).

  

Phishing Sending fraudulent emails that appear to be from legitimate sources to steal personal information like passwords and credit card details. Spear phishing (targeting specific individuals or organizations). Smishing (phishing through SMS/text messages). Vishing (phishing via phone calls).

  

Identity Theft Stealing personal information (e.g., name, social security number) to commit fraud. Using stolen identities to open fraudulent accounts, take out loans, or apply for credit cards. Creating fake identities to manipulate social media or access restricted information.

  

Ransomware Encrypting a victim’s data and demanding payment for decryption keys. Ransomware-as-a-service, where attackers sell or rent out ransomware tools. Targeting businesses, government agencies, and individuals for high-value ransom payments.

  

Malware Distribution Spreading malicious software like viruses, worms, spyware, adware, and trojans. Creating and distributing botnets to conduct further attacks or steal data. Ad fraud through malware that generates fraudulent ad clicks or impressions.

  

Online Scams Investment scams: Offering fake investment opportunities with promises of large returns. Romance scams: Fraudsters pretending to be in a romantic relationship to manipulate victims into sending money. Lottery scams: Claiming that a victim has won a lottery or sweepstakes but requires a fee to claim the prize. Tech support scams: Fraudsters pretending to be from tech companies, offering fake services to steal money or data. Fake charities: Scams targeting people’s goodwill by pretending to be a charitable cause.

  

Credit Card Fraud Using stolen credit card information for unauthorized purchases. Skimming credit card details using fake POS terminals or malicious apps. Account takeover to make fraudulent purchases. Carding (selling stolen credit card information).

Dan Cohen, president of Adhere+

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has proposed draft guidance to establish a framework for prescribing controlled substances via telemedicine.

The proposal introduces three types of special registrations. Telemedicine prescribing registration allows qualified practitioners to prescribe Schedule III-V controlled substances via telemedicine. Advanced telemedicine prescribing registration permits specialized practitioners, such as psychiatrists and hospice care physicians, to prescribe Schedule II-V controlled substances via telemedicine. And telemedicine platform registration enables online telemedicine platforms to dispense Schedule II-V controlled substances through registered practitioners.

The guidance proposes allowing patients to receive a six-month supply of buprenorphine, used to treat opioid use disorder, through a telephone consultation with a provider. Subsequent prescriptions would require an in-person visit.

Practitioners would be required to conduct Prescription Drug Monitoring Program checks for the states where both the patient and the practitioner are located, as well as any other relevant states with PDMP reciprocity.

Detailed records must be maintained for in-person evaluations, telehealth prescriptions and referrals. The proposal also includes safeguards for prescribing high-risk medications, such as Schedule II substances.

These measures aim to expand patient access to controlled substances via telemedicine while implementing safeguards to prevent misuse and diversion.

Dan Cohen, president of Adhere+, a vendor of remote therapeutic monitoring technology and services, says the DEA's draft language needs to be clarified that healthcare practitioners make treatment decisions – the DEA needs to limit its role to ensure patient safety and prevent misuse, not to dictate clinical decision making for practitioners.

"The concern here is about ensuring the role of the DEA is clearly defined when it comes to overseeing healthcare practitioners' treatment decisions, particularly in the context of prescribing Scheduled medications," Cohen explained. "The primary responsibility of healthcare practitioners – doctors, nurses, pharmacists, etc. – is to make clinical decisions based on their professional judgment, patient needs and medical guidelines.

"If the DEA's role is not properly limited, there could be an overreach where the agency influences or even dictates how healthcare practitioners make these decisions, which could undermine the autonomy of medical professionals and potentially impact patient care," he continued. "The DEA's main mission should be to prevent drug misuse, addiction and illegal distribution while safeguarding patient safety. However, it should not be in the position of making clinical decisions or prescribing protocols for legitimate medical treatments."

The language in any proposed regulation or legislation should therefore make it clear that while the DEA can enforce laws related to drug control and ensure that medications are prescribed and distributed safely and appropriately, healthcare practitioners remain the ones who make decisions about what treatment is appropriate for their patients, based on medical evidence, their expertise and individual patient needs, he said.

Cohen contended that Congress make permanent COVID Public Health Emergency concessions, rather than renewing the concessions biannually.

"Making the COVID-19 PHE concessions permanent, rather than renewing them biannually, could provide several advantages," he explained. "Doing so would provide stability and certainty, avoid legislative bottlenecks, enable continued access to healthcare, encourage long-term innovation, enable efficient use of resources, and continue lessons learned from the pandemic."

On another note, telehealth encounters via electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) should have clear, clinical content that develops over the treatment period for several key reasons, Cohen said.

"This is because it tracks patient progress, improves clinical decision making, enhances patient-clinician communication, enables personalized treatment, improves outcome measurement, aids regulatory and reimbursement purposes, enables early identification of complications," he explained.

"The lack of ePROs in a telehealth 'visit' compromises patient care," he continued. "Conversely, ePROs with clear, evolving clinical content are essential for monitoring patient progress, making informed clinical decisions, personalizing care, and improving overall treatment outcomes. They provide a comprehensive and accurate picture of the patient's health, which is critical for effective, evidence-based care."

Cohen also offered views on how regulatory policies should be adapted and updated to allow for clinical decision making based in part on an artificial intelligence analysis of patients' ePROs data.

"For AI/ML analysis of ePROs data to be a valuable part of clinical decision making, regulatory policies need to ensure these tools are accurate, transparent, equitable, and integrated into a system that prioritizes patient safety and clinician oversight," Cohen said. "Establishing strong standards for validation, data security and bias mitigation, while fostering innovation and patient engagement, will be key to maximizing the benefits of AI/ML in healthcare."

— Top-tier institution —

Cleveland Clinic has been ranked the No. 2 hospital globally for the seventh consecutive year, according to Newsweek’s World’s Best Hospitals 2025.

Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital also earned a place among the best hospitals in the United States, ranking 48th overall and holding the title of the highest-ranked hospital in South Florida and second in Florida.

“This recognition reflects the exceptional dedication of our caregivers, who consistently go above and beyond to deliver world-class care to our patients every single day,” said F. Scott Ross, M.D., vice president and Chief Medical Officer for Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital, which was also named a top hospital in the nation in 2024. “It reaffirms our unwavering commitment to excellence in patient care, groundbreaking research and innovation and improving lives.”

Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital also received recognition in Newsweek’s 2025 rankings of World’s Best Smart Hospitals and World’s Best Specialized Hospitals, with accolades in key areas including cardiac surgery, cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, obstetrics and gynecology and urology. The hospital was also honored on the inaugural list of America’s Best Weight Loss Clinics & Centers.

The World’s Best Hospitals rankings are based on surveys and data from hospitals in 30 countries. Newsweek partners with Statista to compile the annual rankings. Data sources include opinions from more than 85,000 medical experts globally, publicly available data on patient experience and hospital quality metrics and patient-reported outcomes measures.



— Pass/fail —

Nursing students at the University of West Florida (UWF) receive a unique education and perform uniquely compared to other schools.

The UWF School of Nursing graduates outperformed other nursing schools in Florida and similar institutions nationwide. Some 97.67% of UWF School of Nursing graduates passed the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses on their first attempt. That’s the second highest percentage of passing rate in Florida’s university system.

UWF nursing graduates who earned a Bachelor of Science degree also surpassed the national average for those who took the exam. For the first two quarters of 2024, all UWF nursing grads passed the exam. UWF nursing majors passed it with 100%. There was a total of 129 UWF nursing graduates who earned their license to practice by passing that exam. “The success of our students is a testament to their dedication, the tireless efforts of our faculty, community support from local partnerships, and the strong leadership within the college,” said Renee Davis, who was recently hired as the new director of UWF’s School of Nursing. “Our faculty take pride in providing a rigorous and supportive learning environment that allows our students’ hard work and determination to shine. It’s their commitment that ultimately drives their success.”



— Grand Opening —

BayCare recently opened the state’s first behavioral health urgent care center in New Port Richey. This outpatient facility, funded by a $3.6 million grant from the Pasco County Commission, offers walk-in and same-day appointments for adults facing urgent mental health and substance use issues.

The center aims to bridge a critical gap in mental health services by providing timely access to trained professionals and helping individuals avoid crises that might otherwise lead them to emergency rooms or law enforcement. BayCare’s Director of Clinical Operations, Tracey Kaly, emphasized the importance of this facility as a safe space for urgent care and ongoing support.

“When we evaluated how we could better deliver mental health services to the community, we recognized that there was a piece of the puzzle missing,” Kaly said.

“Often, people do not seek help until they are in crisis and feel their only options are to call law enforcement or visit the ER. This center is a bridge — a safe space where people in urgent need of mental health or addiction care can be seen in a timely manner by a trained professional who can evaluate their needs and connect them with ongoing services in their area, hopefully mitigating the need for hospitalization.”

BayCare Behavioral Health Urgent Care patients undergo screenings and clinical evaluations to determine their immediate needs. They can also connect with recovery support specialists, who provide guidance based on personal experiences.

The project received significant backing from the Pasco County Commission, which allocated a large portion of the county’s opioid settlement funds to support it. BayCare leadership and County Commissioners, including Jack Mariano, attended a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Feb. 26. Mariano highlighted the center’s potential to save lives and reduce costs for taxpayers by keeping individuals out of jail.

Since its opening three weeks ago, the center has successfully provided comprehensive care to all patients, including safety plans and follow-up appointments, effectively mitigating the need for hospitalization. The BayCare Behavioral Health Urgent Care operates Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Same-day appointments can be made by calling (727) 281-3350.

“‘Forced medication’: Ron DeSantis wants fluoride out of water” via A.G. Gancarski of Florida Politics — DeSantis isn’t holding back on fluoride in water supplies, believing it’s “forced medication.” “When you’re forcing it into the water supply, that’s not really giving people the choice. If people want to be able to purchase fluoridated water or do more, then they already have the ability to do it,” DeSantis said. Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo had previously said putting fluoride in water was “insane,” given the compound’s “caustic” nature and the fact that toothpaste and other consumer products contain it and give people the option to self-administer. He recommended against community water fluoridation last year. DeSantis said Tuesday that he expects the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to “lean in the direction of Ladapo under Bobby Kennedy,” presumably offering similar guidance.

“Families praise Clay Yarborough’s proposed ‘free kill’ repeal, but health care pros say it’s inoperable” via Jesse Scheckner of Florida Politics — Legislation that would upend Florida’s unique law barring many medical malpractice lawsuits is again advancing in the Senate. Families who had little recourse after losing loved ones say change is needed to bring overdue justice to the state’s health care market. Opponents, most of them in the medical or insurance fields, warn it will make an already expensive industry unaffordable for patients and practitioners. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 9-2 to advance SB 734, which would repeal a 35-year-old state statute — 768.21(8) — prohibiting adult children and their parents from collecting negligence and noneconomic damages for medical malpractice. The law, which detractors have dubbed “free kill,” applies to anyone over 25 seeking medical care in the state, including residents and visitors.

“House passes Vern Buchanan-backed expansion of chronic disease coverage” via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics — The House has passed legislation championed by U.S. Rep. Buchanan that could expand chronic disease coverage nationwide. The Chronic Disease Flexible Coverage Act (HR 919) cleared the House chamber. If the bill becomes law, it will allow employers to offer high-deductible health plan coverage for employees, including pre-deductible coverage for certain health care services that treat common chronic illnesses. “With six in 10 Americans living with at least one chronic disease, it is clear that we must expand options for people to manage their chronic health conditions,” said Buchanan, Chair of the House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee. In remarks on the floor, Buchanan said the cost of chronic diseases accounts for $1 trillion in spending in the American economy. It also accounts for a high percentage of preventable deaths, he said.

“Measles confirmed in Miami teenager, the first in Florida this year” via Christopher O’Donnell of the Orlando Sentinel — A teenager in Miami-Dade has a confirmed case of measles, the first such infection in Florida since a small outbreak of the disease in South Florida in 2024. The infection was reported in the Florida Department of Health database for Florida’s infectious and reportable diseases. A Miami-Dade County Public Schools spokesperson confirmed that a Miami Palmetto Senior High School student was infected. The school district has notified the parents of other students at the school. Florida Department of Health officials are working to trace anyone the student may have come into contact with, according to a letter sent to school parents by Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo. “Due to the high immunity rate in the school, as well as the burden on families and the educational cost of healthy children missing school, DOH is deferring to parents or guardians to make decisions about school attendance,” the letter states.

“New bill aims to end Florida contract with controversial pregnancy centers” via Cindy Krischer Goodman of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel — Democrat Rep. Kelly Skidmore has introduced a bill to end the state’s $29.5 million contract with a controversial pregnancy care provider. While Skidmore of Boca Raton has targeted the Florida Pregnancy Care Network and its lucrative contract in the past, this time is different. That’s because DeSantis also wants to end this same state contract. The Florida Pregnancy Care Network is a private nonprofit with over 95 locations statewide. Critics say centers in the network can be mistaken for reproductive health clinics that provide pregnancy care but are actually nonmedical facilities.

Cardinal Health recently appointed Robert Musslewhite and Sudhakar Ramakrishna to its Board of Directors, which may have reinforced investor confidence, culminating in a 5% share price increase over the last quarter. These appointments enhance the company's governance with expertise from healthcare and cybersecurity sectors. Despite the Dow Jones and other major indices facing declines due to economic concerns and tariff-related uncertainty, Cardinal Health sustained positive momentum. The company's Q2 2025 earnings demonstrated an increase in net income to $400 million from $368 million YoY, and diluted EPS rose to $1.65. Additionally, the firm's affirmation of a quarterly dividend of $0.51 and their active share buyback program of $75 million indicate a commitment to returning value to shareholders, potentially contributing to the stock's upward trajectory amid a backdrop of broader market challenges.

See the full analysis report here for a deeper understanding of Cardinal Health.

The past five years have been rewarding for Cardinal Health's shareholders, with the company achieving a 231.41% total return, including share price appreciation and dividends. While accounting for its performance, several key developments have emerged. In 2024, Cardinal Health successfully expanded its operational footprint, opening a 350,000 sq. ft. facility in South Carolina. The earnings growth over the past year was impressive at a sensational pace compared to the healthcare industry average, contributing to a favorable outlook. Notably, the company maintained attractive valuations, trading at good value relative to both its peers and the estimated fair value, further enhancing its long-term appeal. Additionally, the successful execution of share buyback programs, with over 3.4 million shares repurchased by the end of 2024, signaled management's focus on enhancing shareholder value.

Despite reporting a 4% decline in sales in early 2025, net income for the quarter increased, underscoring the company's ability to boost profitability even in challenging circumstances. Furthermore, Cardinal Health's earnings per share guidance for 2025 was raised, reflecting successful acquisitions that positively impacted revenue. Alongside strategic client partnerships, such as the agreement with T2 Biosystems for selling rapid sepsis diagnostics, these efforts have fortified the company's market position. While Cardinal Health's one-year return lagged behind the overall US market by a small margin, it markedly outpaced the US healthcare industry, which bore a 4.4% decrease over the same period. This performance underscores Cardinal Health's resilience and adaptability in a rapidly evolving landscape.

The president’s deregulatory bent means more responsibility rests on the shoulders of healthcare stakeholders to get artificial intelligence right.

Healthcare companies struggling to adopt artificial intelligence amid a lack of federal standards are unlikely to get any help from the Trump administration, placing the burden of responsible implementation squarely on the industry’s shoulders.

That mandate is becoming increasingly difficult as the technology grows more complex, experts said during the HIMSS healthcare conference in Las Vegas.

“One thing that’s clear is that this administration is not going to regulate AI. Good or bad, take that for what it is,” Tanay Tandon, the CEO of provider automation company Commure, said during a panel.

President Donald Trump’s hands-off approach to AI governance means hospitals turning to the tools to save money and give overworked clinicians some relief will likely be operating in a regulatory gray area for at least the next four years.

The president says his goal is to free up U.S. developers to innovate. But that comes with downsides for tech developers and healthcare companies desperate for guardrails given AI’s proclivity to make mistakes, degrade over time and exacerbate existing bias.

Not to mention, a lack of national standards might actually hamper AI development and adoption, according to some experts.

“When there isn’t a federal framework, it can just absolutely cause all kinds of problems,” said Leigh Burchell, the chair of the Electronic Health Records Association. “We all just want to know what our rules are. And then we can comply.”

To date, a handful of federal agencies, including the HHS’ technology office, the CMS and the Food and Drug Administration, have published targeted rules around the use and quality of AI in healthcare. But neither Congress nor the executive branch have zeroed in on a comprehensive framework to regulate the models — despite some progress during the Biden administration, when an HHS task force was working to build a unified regulatory structure.

That task force unveiled a strategic plan in January — just 10 days before Trump’s inauguration. However, Trump nixed the blueprint in one of his first executive orders.

Meanwhile, federal employees working on AI oversight, including at the FDA, have been caught up in the Trump administration’s purge of the government’s workforce. Amid the turmoil, the future of the HHS office that oversees AI policy remains unclear.

As a result, what little momentum there was in Washington to create a concrete strategy for overseeing health AI appears to have stalled out, at least for now. In its place, Trump has announced the Stargate Project, a $500 billion investment deal with private companies to prioritize AI development and maintain U.S. supremacy in the space — a high-stakes bet that was immediately complicated by the release of DeepSeek, a high-performing and inexpensive open source model from China.

"The current administration — the brakes have come off and the accelerator has come down."

Brian Spisak

Program director of AI and leadership, Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative

The Trump administration did issue a request for information in early February to get public input on a potential national AI action plan. However, the plan’s wording makes clear the administration’s priorities: to “sustain and enhance America’s AI dominance, and to ensure that unnecessarily burdensome requirements do not hamper private sector AI innovation.”

The revocation of the Biden-era AI plan was largely symbolic, as agencies hadn’t yet gotten around to imposing any requirements on developers or users.

But in “the current administration — the brakes have come off and the accelerator has come down,” said Brian Spisak, program director of AI and leadership at Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative, at HIMSS. “There’s a lot of responsibility to leadership of health systems to find the optimal balance between innovation and speed and safety and tradition.”

That responsibility — which also rests on AI developers creating the models, software vendors weaving them into health records and the clinicians using them — is not negligible.

Currently, even the most futuristic AI at healthcare institutions is being used to automate administration, and only peripherally touches patient care. But that appears to be changing: There’s growing interest among medical organizations in more clinical use cases for AI, like tailoring treatment plans or helping clinicians arrive at a diagnosis, according to a survey from HIMSS conducted in the fall.

Many of those use cases involve generative AI, which can create original text and images. But such models are known to hallucinate, or provide answers that are factually incorrect or irrelevant. AI can leave important information out, an error known as omission. Models can also drift, a term for when an AI’s performance changes or degrades over time.

Given the increasing prevalence of AI in pulling data from EHR systems, transcribing doctor-patient visits and more, errors like these could interfere with clinicians’ ability to care for patients, experts say.

Meanwhile, the technology is advancing at a stunning rate. Last year, the healthcare industry was just beginning to come to terms with governance for generative AI. But now, the conversation has already moved onto AI agents, which can complete complex tasks largely unsupervised by humans.

Commure’s Tanay equated the current moment to when America moved from kerosene to electricity at the end of the 19th century.

“The way that we did things six months ago is completely irrelevant,” he said.

Because of the breakneck speed of development, federal standards from any administration would likely need to be flexible, experts say. 

The Biden administration’s HHS task force suggested the government could create guidelines around testing and piloting tools, along with some support for adoption. However, it shied away from a prescriptive approach.

That’s in line with the wish list from many stakeholders. Numerous executives at tech companies and hospital systems said any federal standards should be stratified by the level of risk an AI model imposes — for example, stricter oversight for algorithms that help doctors diagnose diseases, and looser restrictions for algorithms that help hospital staff allocate patients to beds.

“We have to weigh the balance between underregulation, which can potentially increase risk, and overregulation, which will stunt innovation,” said Anthony Chang, the chief intelligence and innovation officer at the Children’s Hospital of Orange County in California, during a panel.

“The current administration is more likely to be on the underregulation side. So we have to be careful as a profession that we don’t allow that to happen,” Chang said.

The lack of a playbook from Washington has left hospitals and medical groups scrambling to build their own internal controls amid a patchwork of state laws and voluntary standards released by industry groups.

States including Colorado, Utah and California have already enacted legislation establishing disclaimer requirements for AI systems. More states are considering similar laws: The Electronic Health Records Association is tracking 150 different state bills related to health AI, according to Burchell.

“There is a massive explosion of bills,” Burchell said.

But differing standards could stop health AI developers and software companies from rolling out products in specific states, potentially disadvantaging patients depending on where they live. More risk-averse software companies may avoid AI, or certain states, altogether, she added.

“Legislation of a lot of sizes and shapes at the state level is a risk to us, because it means we have to do all kinds of different development. We would rather develop one system that can be used broadly and accepted across the country,” Burchell said.

Health AI standards groups are also stepping into the gap left by the federal government. The groups — often made up of leading hospitals, digital health companies and tech giants — include the Health AI Partnership, an AI learning network for the industry, and the Coalition for Health AI, which recently launched an AI registry for hospitals.

”I think we’ll probably see more of these non-government organizations like Health AI Partnership and some of those emerge as maybe our north stars today, as here’s some leadership in the space,” said Rachel Wilkes, the corporate lead for generative AI initiatives at EHR vendor Meditech.

But standards from industry consortia hold little weight without the heft of the federal government behind them, experts say. Historically, voluntary standards aren’t particularly effective.

“There’s room for people to act in their own best interest, whatever that may be, without any sort of federal framework,” Wilkes said.

EHR vendors and hospital operators say they’re building up rigorous internal standards for AI tools, including validation and frequent auditing.

“Government oversight has its place, but I do think the way that clinical practice evolves tends to be more driven by what’s happening at a health system,” said Seth Howard, the executive vice president of research and development for Epic, the largest EHR company in the U.S.

In interviews, executives with Epic, Oracle, Meditech and eClinicalWorks said they’re making AI available to doctors with rigorous oversight, including back-end accuracy checks and ongoing monitoring.

However, tech leaders stressed that it’s also the hospital and the clinicians’ responsibility to make sure everything is working as planned.

“We are working in an industry that deals with human life. It cannot be trivial. It cannot be under-exaggerated on what guardrails and checks and balances and what discussions need to happen,” said Girish Navani, the CEO of eClinicalWorks.

Technology behemoths betting heavily on AI feel similarly. Google, for example, has worked with for-profit hospital giant HCA on an evaluation framework to catch any errors generated by its AI models and ensure their reliability, according to Aashima Gupta, the head of healthcare for Google Cloud.

“We provide those tools for an evaluation framework, and for all of this there’s a human in the loop capturing the feedback, and that feedback loop then makes the model more effective,” Gupta said. “That’s what gives me comfort.”

"We are working in an industry that deals with human life. It cannot be trivial. It cannot be under-exaggerated on what guardrails and checks and balances and what discussions need to happen."

Though some in the private sector say they’ve got governance handled, modern AI is incredibly hard to oversee, according to AI engineers. The main advantage of generative AI — its creativity — also introduces subjectivity, making grading its outputs complicated.

For example, if two clinicians are tasked to summarize a patient’s medical history based on clinical notes, their results could be incredibly different, albeit still accurate. It’s the same with generative AI, experts say: How do you measure quality in a standardized way when there’s that degree of variability?

“AI governance is still very much a maturing process,” said Harvard’s Spisak.

Hospital executives say they’re tackling oversight carefully. But some research suggests governance systems for simpler predictive AI models already aren’t rigorous enough. Hospitals with explicit procedures for the use and assessment of AI tools are still struggling to identify and mitigate problems, according to a study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Even some of the most well-resourced and tech-savvy systems are struggling.

The Cleveland Clinic has an AI governing body that includes stakeholders from across the academic medical center, according to Rohit Chandra, the Cleveland Clinic’s chief digital officer. The task force oversees AI’s impact on the organization’s patients and workers while ensuring clinical safety and discussing thorny questions of privacy, legality and bias.

But “I don’t think we’ve figured it all out,” Chandra said during a panel. “The term hallucination, for one, has just shown up in the last two, three years. And we still don’t quite know how to deal with it.”

Hospitals should try to make specific people accountable for the performance of the tools, as part of a larger governing body that includes executives, lawyers, doctors and nurses, according to Brenton Hill, the head of operations at standards group CHAI.

Hospitals need to decide how to monitor AI effectively and report that information, which can depend on the products they have in place. They also need to consider what resources the AI will use and develop appropriate data use agreements with AI vendors, Hill said during a panel.

But “there’s not one silver bullet governance structure that you can put out there that will solve all your problems,” Hill said.

Though a road map from federal regulators would be helpful, stakeholders working to integrate AI tools into healthcare said they’re not holding their breath.

“While self-regulation is good, we don’t believe that’s sufficient. We believe AI is too important not to be regulated,” said Google’s Gupta.

But when asked what she expects from the Trump administration, Gupta was noncommittal. “It’s hard to say at this point. We are trying to figure out how we best work with them, share our best practices with them ... Too early to say. I think the entire healthcare community is waiting for that,” Gupta said.

Other experts said the Trump administration is a wake-up call for hospital executives who believed Washington could assume responsibility for overseeing AI.

Instead, the mandate should be on everyone touching the technology to ensure AI algorithms — given their shifting nature and innate opacity — perform as they’re designed, especially in an industry where any mistakes could impact patient health.

“The easy answer is, if this regulatory body says it’s safe, then I can trust it. I think people were hoping that might happen for AI,” said Aaron Neinstein, the chief medical officer of agentic AI company Notable. “I think that was a pipe dream.”

Regulators’ assessment of customer support centers has spurred recent lawsuits from insurers. But the metric “is going to have a smaller weighting on star ratings moving forward,” the director of Medicare said.

On March 7, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that its Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is investigating four medical schools and hospitals under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (Section 1557).

The investigations are in response to allegations OCR received that certain medical schools and hospitals that receive HHS funding may operate medical education, training, or scholarship programs that discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex. 

HHS stated that the investigations align with President Trump’s Executive Order 14173, Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity. 

“Today’s actions restore merit-based opportunities in medicine and signify that hard-working health care professionals and high-achieving students in the pipeline for medical and nursing fields should not be demeaned at work, or excluded from professional or scholarship opportunities, because of their race or sex,” said Anthony Archeval, Acting Director of the OCR at HHS, in a statement.

5 On Your Side at Noon

MISSOURI, USA — A growing crisis has swallowed numerous nursing homes around Missouri. Growing threats of Medicaid cuts nationwide threaten to plunge that crisis into catastrophe.

Five major nursing homes throughout the state shut down over the past year, including Festus Manor and Northview Village near St. Louis. Both closed due to reported financial issues.

Around 67% of Missouri's nursing homes are largely funded by Medicaid, including over 95% of nursing homes in St. Louis, according to Lenny Jones, the Missouri state director of Service Employees International Union Healthcare, which represents workers in health care, child care, home care and nursing homes throughout the Midwest.

The state's nursing homes are now bracing for Republicans' proposed billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, which could end health care for millions of adults and children. The Medicaid cuts would fund tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, while leaving the poorest Americans without access to life-saving medical care. 

"They're trying to make these $800 billion worth of cuts in Medicaid programs to fund tax cuts for the wealthy," Jones told 5 On Your Side. "This is a very perverse demand that says that wealthy people need even more money. How are they going to get more money? They're going to take it from hardworking Missourians."

The state's nursing homes already suffer from staffing shortages, poor care standards and lack of federal compliance. 

Missouri has the smallest number of hours of care per day per resident of any other state in the nation, and a 2024 St. Louis Board of Alders report said all of the city's nursing homes are run by for-profit enterprises, which have severely cut costs to boost profits.

Proposed Medicaid cuts would only worsen the already present problems, according to Jones.

"If lawmakers go into a setting where nursing homes already have problems that are a direct result of poor staffing and cut funding, nursing homes will have to cut staffing," Jones said. "When you cut back on staffing, the care gets worse. When you cut back on staffing, it puts more burden on nursing home workers who have to take care of more residents, and then they feel the brunt of the pain from family members when their loved one isn't getting the care they deserve because the staff is stretched so thin."

Shunda Whitfield works for the Estates of Spanish Lake Nursing and Rehabilitation Facility and is also a member of SEIU. While she does worry about what Medicaid cuts mean for nursing home care's future, she worries more about the hundreds of thousands of children and people with disabilities who would no longer have health care if the cuts are approved.

"There would be 1.3 million Missourians affected if Medicaid is cut, with over 600,000 children in Missouri alone who rely on Medicaid," Whitfield said. "It would affect my job, but it's not just about my job. It's about what the people who are disabled, children, seniors, people with in-home health care ... where would these cuts leave them? That's my biggest worry."

In a new plan, CVS is cutting its traditional stores in half and sweeping out the skincare, pretzels, and stationery you would expect at a standard location.

The drugstore giant is preparing to open 12 new mini-stores in cities and towns across the U.S. by this time next year focusing on a full-service pharmacy with healthcare products, including over-the-counter pain medications and first-aid supplies, per a Saturday report from The Wall Street Journal.

The mini-stores will not offer other consumer goods usually expected in a CVS like shampoo and greeting cards.

At around 5,000 square feet, the new stores will be less than half the size of a typical CVS, which ranges from 11,000 to 15,000 square feet. CVS is in the early phase of developing the new stores and plans to have the first few locations operating by the end of 2025.

Julie Utterback, senior equity analyst for Morningstar, told WSJ that 80% of CVS's sales last year came from its pharmacy department — so focusing mini-stores on that division made sense.

"That is where most of the value is generated," Utterback told the outlet. "The front of the store operations has been in question for a while."

In 2023, 78.9% of CVS's revenue came from prescription drugs while 21.1% came from front store and other products. CVS's latest earnings report, released last month for the final quarter of 2024, showed that the drugstore chain saw sales growth of 4.2% from the same time a year ago, partly due to growth in its pharmacy business. CVS sales hit $97.71 billion in Q4 2024.

CVS and other drugstore chains like Walgreens have struggled recently to contend with foot traffic and heightened competition from retailers like Walmart.

According to CNN Business, the front end of drugstores, with snacks and toiletries, have seen fewer sales as shoppers turn to Amazon, Walmart, and Target to fill those needs. In response to these challenges, CVS has closed stores and undertaken cost-cutting measures.

CVS laid off nearly 3,000 workers in October 2024 and closed 900 stores (while opening 100 new locations) over the past three years as part of a plan announced in November 2021. It plans to close another 270 stores, and open 30, in 2025.

Rival Walgreens has also been closing stores. In October 2024, the company said that it would shut 1,200 locations over the next three years, with 500 stores slated to close in 2025.

Walgreens also agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners last week in a $10 billion deal as part of its turnaround plan.

CVS had more than 9,000 locations as of December 31 making it the biggest pharmacy in the U.S.

KKR stock is sliding after making an improved bid for U.K. healthcare group Assura

Shares in private equity group KKR & Co were off over 7% today after it sweetened a multi-billion dollar deal for British healthcare property developer Assura.

KKR has followed the old Scottish adage of “if you don’t succeed once, then try, try again,” by making a fifth attempt to buy Assura since last September. All four previous bids have been turned down.

In a statement today Assura said it is now considering an indicative, non-binding proposal from KKR and Stonepeak Partners of 49.4p per share. That is a premium of about a third to Assura’s closing share price on February 13th and values the company at around $2.08billion. It is also higher than the last offer KKR made at 48p per share. The Assura board said it is likely to recommend the offer to shareholders and will engage in discussions with KKR and Stonepeak.

Assura, running more than 600 properties with an investment value of about £3.2 billion as of last September, counts the UK’s state-backed and under-pressure National Health Service as a customer. Analysts said that the higher price means that KKR is very keen to get the deal over the line. Significantly it did not include involvement from pension fund USS Investment Management which joined KKR in making the February bid.

Despite the uncertainty over the deal shown by KKR investors today, a successful conclusion might see more moves from private equity firms on the downtrodden U.K. real estate sector.

On TipRanks, KKR has a Strong Buy consensus based on 11 Buy and 3 Hold ratings. Its highest target price is $214. KKR stock’s consensus price target is $173.77 implying an 63.06% upside.

A recent Finnish study suggests that limiting screen time and promoting physical activity from childhood may help safeguard mental health in adolescence. The findings are particularly significant given that mental health problems affect up to 30% of young people and pose a growing societal challenge.

The study, conducted by the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences at the University of Jyväskylä and the Institute of Biomedicine at the University of Eastern Finland, followed 187 adolescents over an eight-year period. Researchers found that children who spent more time on screens -especially mobile devices - were more likely to experience higher levels of stress and depressive symptoms in adolescence.

Conversely, higher levels of physical activity and participation in organized sports were associated with lower stress and fewer depressive symptoms. However, the link between physical activity and depressive symptoms was weaker than that of screen time and depressive symptoms. Adolescents with both high screen time and low physical activity had the highest levels of stress and depressive symptoms.

Several international, evidence-based recommendations suggest that the leisure screen time of children and adolescents should be limited to two hours per day.

Personally, I think that even this figure is high, as it amounts to almost one month of screen time per year."

Eero Haapala, Senior Lecturer from the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, University of Jyväskylä 

These findings emphasize the need to promote healthy lifestyle habits early in life. Encouraging children to engage in physical activity and setting reasonable limits on screen time could play a crucial role in preventing mental health challenges later in life.

"The modern sedentary lifestyle, with high screen exposure, challenges the mental health of children and adolescents," says Dr Eero Haapala.

"Recent discussions have rightly focused on screen time and social media, but I hope our findings encourage adults in young people's lives to promote a broad spectrum of healthy habits - especially by balancing screen time and physical activity."

"Achieving change requires collaboration," Haapala emphasizes.

"Society as a whole - from families to policymakers - must invest in promoting healthy lifestyles for children and adolescents by ensuring balanced screen time, sufficient physical activity, adequate sleep, and a nutritious diet."

The PANIC Study is part of the Metabolic Diseases Research Community at the University of Eastern Finland. The research community is dedicated to investigating major cardiometabolic diseases. By leveraging genetics, genomics, translational research, and lifestyle interventions, the community aims to provide robust evidence on disease mechanisms and advance early diagnosis, prevention, and personalized treatment. The research community consists of 20 research groups, spanning basic research to patient care.

(OTCQB: AVAI), Tempus AI, Inc. (NASDAQ: TEM), Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC), Aclarion, Inc. (NASDAQ: ACON), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT).

Fortune Business Insights continued: “The expansion of AI in the healthcare industry due to investments made by private and government enterprises in the sector and advancements in medicine, research, innovation, and technology are expected to drive the market's growth… Such collaborations or investments are projected to contribute to the growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the healthcare market growth. In recent years, artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the global healthcare industry. It has brought unprecedented tools for diagnosing, treating, and patient care. With this growing demand, providers are focusing on advancements in technology, which enhances the diagnosis and treatment of various clinical indications. Along with this, the use of various tools, such as virtual assistants, can be used to improve patient care by transforming patient symptom checking, providing e-consultation, tracking patient health and sending medication alerts, and many more. Additionally, national spending on healthcare in several countries, including both developed and developing countries, is rising. This shows the growing adoption of artificial intelligence in various industries, including healthcare.”

Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI) and JV Partner, Ainnova, Strategically Align with Apollo Hospitals to Advance AI in Healthcare - Avant Technologies, Inc. (“Avant” or the “Company”) and its partner, Ainnova Tech, Inc., (Ainnova), a leading healthcare technology company focused on revolutionizing early disease detection using artificial intelligence (AI), today announced that Apollo Hospitals (Apollo) and Ainnova have officially established a strategic collaboration that marks a significant step forward in the integration of artificial intelligence into disease detection and prediction.

As part of this alliance, Ainnova has secured an exclusive license for several advanced AI algorithms, which have been rigorously validated with over 2.3 million data points and now form an integral part of Ainnova’s Vision AI platform. These cutting-edge solutions enable the early and precise detection of conditions, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), liver fibrosis, type 2 Diabetes, and lung abnormalities in CT scans and X-rays, including lung cancer.

Last month, Avant and Ainnova signed a global development and licensing deal for Ai-Nova Acquisition Corp. (AAC), the joint venture formed by both companies. Given AAC’s territory now includes a global license to develop and market Ainnova's technology portfolio, this partnership with Apollo strengthens the joint venture’s efforts to advance AI in Healthcare using Ainnova’s Vision AI platform and its proprietary versatile retinal camera technology.

On February 25, 2025, President Trump signed “Making America Healthy Again with Clear, Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare Pricing Information,” an Executive Order with the stated purpose of making group health plans and health insurance issuers accountable for compliance with price transparency rules implemented during the first Trump administration.

Specifically, during his first administration, President Trump signed Executive Order 13877 – “Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First,” seeking to address what the new Executive Order describes as “opaque healthcare pricing arrangements” and insufficient accountability concerning healthcare pricing practices. Under Executive Order 13877, regulations were created requiring group health plans to:

The new Executive Order referenced an unidentified 2023 economic analysis that estimated full implementation of the regulations might result in as much as $80 million in healthcare savings by 2025 for consumers, employers, and insurers. An unidentified 2024 report was also referenced for the proposition that price transparency could help employers reduce healthcare costs across 500 common healthcare services.

To address what was described as “stalled” progress on price transparency during the intervening administration, the new Executive Order gave the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services 90 days to act to:

Power of the Herd



KEARNEY – More than 60 high school seniors will begin their studies at the University of Nebraska at Kearney this fall as members of a prestigious health science program.

Representing communities across the state, the students selected for the Kearney Health Opportunities Program (KHOP) demonstrate both academic excellence and a commitment to serving rural areas as future health care professionals.

“Improving access to health care in rural Nebraska starts with investing in the next generation of providers. Through the KHOP program, we are equipping passionate and dedicated students with the education and support they need to make an impact in the communities that need them the most,” said Peggy Abels, director of UNK Health Sciences.

According to a report from the University of Nebraska Medical Center, more than 80% of the state’s health diagnosing and treating practitioners are based in metropolitan areas, creating an accessibility issue for many rural residents.

The KHOP program was created to help even the playing field.

Launched in 2010, it’s designed to grow the state’s health care workforce by recruiting and training students from rural Nebraska who are committed to practicing in these communities as professionals. The program offers financial assistance, academic support and professional development opportunities, with many participants receiving full-tuition scholarships to attend UNK and guaranteed admission to UNMC.

KHOP members can study in the fields of dental hygiene, dentistry, medical laboratory science, medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, pharmacy, physical therapy, physician assistant and radiography.

Participants also receive a $3,000 room waiver through the KHOP Learning Community. A requirement for freshmen, the one-year residential learning community gives students a chance to explore various health care careers while receiving support and guidance as they transition to college. KHOP members meet with health care providers and tour medical facilities throughout the region, better preparing them for professional school and beyond.

More than 160 students are currently part of KHOP, and the 62 high school seniors accepted for fall 2025 represent the second-largest class in program history. A record-breaking 72 students were admitted last year.

“By growing our own health care workforce, we’re taking an important step toward addressing the provider shortage and strengthening rural health care for years to come,” Abels said. “It’s very encouraging to see such an outstanding group of students who are committed to rural health and making a real difference in their hometowns.”

KKR has partnered with Stonepeak Partners to make a £1.6bn (€1.9bn) bid for UK healthcare property investor Assura, after KKR’s previous offer with UK’s Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), which was 2.9% lower, was rejected last month.

The board of Assura said the latest possible cash offer of 49.4p per share, which consists of a declared 0.84p quarterly dividend and 48.56p cash at closing, would likely receive their recommendation to shareholders, subject to the agreement of the other terms of the offer.

Assura also disclosed receiving a non-binding all-share merger proposal from Primary Health Properties (PHP), valued at 43p per Assura share but said the KKR consortium’s 49.4p cash offer was more attractive and therefore rejected the PHP proposal.

Last month, Assura rejected a £1.56bn possible offer from KKR and USS. Following the rejection, USS said it did not intend to make an offer for Assura, as part of the consortium or otherwise.

At the time, KKR said it was considering whether to continue engaging with the board, but there is no guarantee that a firm offer will be made.

London-listed Assura, designs, builds, invests in and manages general practitioner and primary care buildings in the UK. As of the third quarter of last year, the company owned 625 healthcare buildings across the UK and Ireland, valued at  £3.2bn.

Researchers racing to develop bird flu vaccines for humans have turned to a cutting-edge technology that enabled the rapid development of lifesaving covid shots.

There's a catch: The mRNA technology faces growing doubts among Republicans, including people around President Donald Trump.

Legislation aimed to ban or limit mRNA vaccines was introduced this year by GOP lawmakers in at least seven states. In some cases, the measures would hit doctors who give the injections with criminal penalties, fines, and possible revocation of their licenses.

Some congressional Republicans are also pressing regulators to revoke federal approval for mRNA-based covid shots, which President Donald Trump touted as one of the signature achievements of his first term.

The opposition comes at a critical juncture because vaccines using mRNA have applications well beyond avian flu and covid. They hold the promise of lifesaving breakthroughs to treat many diseases, from melanoma to HIV to Zika, according to clinical trials. The proposed bans could block access to these advances.

MRNA is found naturally in human cells. It is a molecule that carries genetic material and, in a vaccine, trains the body's immune system to fight viruses, cancer cells, and other conditions. An advantage of mRNA technology is that it can be developed more quickly to target specific variants and is safer than developing a vaccine made from inactivated virus.

"Right now, if we had a bird flu pandemic, we would have a shortage of the vaccine we need," said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. "The one thing that could save us is mRNA vaccine. The challenge would be if mRNA is banned. This is truly dangerous policy."

The pushback conflicts with innovations championed by Trump. He assembled tech tycoons at the White House just after his inauguration to announce Stargate, a $500 billion artificial intelligence initiative that could help transform cancer treatment by creating tumor-targeting mRNA vaccines. The fledging partnership between Oracle, SoftBank Corp., and OpenAI, co-founded by Elon Musk, envisions leveraging AI in part to improve health outcomes. Patients would undergo blood tests and AI would be used to find cancer.

Scientists would examine the DNA and RNA (RNA and mRNA serve different functions in a cell) of a specific patient's tumor to create a vaccine to teach that person's immune system to target and destroy cells driving cancer growth.

"Imagine early cancer detection, the development of a cancer vaccine for your particular cancer aimed at you, and have that vaccine available in 48 hours," Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said at the White House event.

Scores of mRNA clinical trials for cancer vaccines are underway and some have shown dramatic results, cutting the risk of death and recurrence roughly in half for certain patients. In research led by the Yale School of Medicine, for example, patients with advanced kidney cancer remained cancer-free about three years after an mRNA-based treatment in an early-phase trial.

But some politically conservative doctors, lawmakers, and researchers question the safety of mRNA vaccines, especially covid shots made with the technology. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unsuccessfully petitioned the FDA in 2021 to rescind approval for covid shots and called them "the deadliest vaccine ever made" — a controversial statement that has been refuted.

Now that he's newly confirmed as Health and Human Services secretary, Kennedy is poised to oversee federal approvals of vaccines, with the power to shape policy such as immunization schedules and appoint vaccine opponents to committees that advise on the approval of shots.

Bloomberg reported late last month that Trump administration health officials were reevaluating a $590 million contract for bird flu shots that the Biden administration awarded to Moderna as part of its push to examine spending on mRNA vaccines.

HHS and White House spokespeople didn't return emails seeking comment.

Support for an mRNA ban is coming from other sources too. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on March 5 urged the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending the covid-19 vaccine for children and called for a state ban on mRNA vaccine mandates. In February, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said on X that the "FDA should immediately revoke approval of these shots," and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is leading an investigation into the safety of the vaccines. Trump in February signed an order to strip federal funds from schools that require covid shots for attendance.

Vaccine skepticism has become pronounced among Republicans since the pandemic. Four in 10 Republicans who responded to a KFF poll published in January said it was "probably" or "definitely true" that "more people have died from covid-19 vaccines than from the virus itself." Just a quarter of Republicans reported holding that view in 2023.

The effort is also finding traction at the local level. A district health department outside Boise, Idaho, last year banned its health department from administering covid-19 vaccines, and local lawmakers in Franklin County, Washington, passed a resolution in February against mRNA vaccines.

The CDC recommends covid vaccines for anyone 6 months and older, especially seniors and people who are immunocompromised. About 29 million doses had been administered to adults in the 2024-25 season in retail pharmacies and doctors' offices through Feb. 8, based on federal data.

Given as a shot, mRNA enters muscle cells and teaches them to produce a spike protein found on the surface of a virus. The body's immune system then targets the spike protein, priming it to identify and fight the virus — in this case, the coronavirus that causes covid. The body's cells then break down the mRNA and remove it, according to federal health researchers.

More than 13 billion covid vaccines had been administered worldwide as of August 2024.

Researchers say the vaccinations saved countless lives — estimates for the first year alone go as high as 19.8 million — in the throes of a pandemic that had hospitals ordering refrigerated mobile morgues and deliberating over which patients to put on ventilators. Two University of Pennsylvania scientists credited with developing the mRNA technology behind the shots were awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 2023.

The FDA says the covid vaccines are safe, with fewer than 1 in 200,000 vaccinated individuals experiencing a severe allergic reaction or heart problems like myocarditis or pericarditis, and the agency notes that "inaccurate information about these vaccines, particularly the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, continues to circulate."

While many people hadn't heard of the mRNA platform until the covid shots were rolled out, it was discovered in the 1960s. The first mRNA flu vaccines were tested in mice in the 1990s. A clinical trial involving direct injection of mRNA to fight cancer occurred in 2008. Clinical trials involving the covid mRNA vaccines involved tens of thousands of volunteers.

Reviews of mortality data showed "no unusual patterns of death were detected that might suggest a potential safety concern," based on a September 2024 report by a technical working group that provided guidance to the CDC.

But those calling for a ban on all mRNA vaccines say there is a dearth of long-term safety data, and they say covid vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were hastily approved without proper vetting. They assert without strong evidence that the vaccines cause serious injuries to the heart, nerves, and immune and reproductive systems, and can lead to cancer.

The vaccine has been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation and inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart, although the severity has varied and most patients fully recovered, the CDC says.

"The allegations are beyond reason," said Anne Schuchat, a career scientist who worked on covid and who twice served stints as acting director of the CDC. "The mRNA covid vaccines were extensively studied after use and do not have those problems."

"I'm concerned about the whole mRNA technology. I don't trust anything that fools the body," said Stephanie Seneff, a computer scientist and anti-vaccine activist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "I'm really glad people are waking up and realizing it's not the thing to do anymore."

Vaccines generally work by tricking the body into producing antibodies to fight illnesses.

Pfizer spokespeople didn't return an email seeking comment. A Moderna spokesperson, Chris Ridley, said legislative efforts to ban or restrict mRNA medicines are largely driven by misunderstandings about their safety profile and mechanism of action. While mRNA-based shots do not modify DNA, for example, that misconception is frequently cited in support of restrictions, Ridley said.

"If enacted, these measures could hinder important research and limit patient access to innovative treatments, potentially delaying life-changing medical advancements," Ridley said in a written statement.

Groups opposed to the mRNA technology have built a vast and well-funded legal, marketing, and social media network. Members hold conferences to discuss strategies, fund lawsuits against vaccine mandates, and produce reports on the covid vaccines.

As for state legislative efforts, measures introduced this year have varied and their progress has been mixed. Montana's measure, for instance, was blocked. Idaho lawmakers in February held a hearing on its bill, which calls for a 10-year moratorium on mRNA vaccines. Idaho's proposal, likely to be amended, as well as Iowa's and Montana's have featured criminal penalties for providers who administer all or certain mRNA vaccines. In addition, some state bills, such as legislation in Pennsylvania and Tennessee, focused on the use of the vaccine in livestock and food production.

Various bills are pending in the Texas Legislature to restrict mRNA vaccines in both livestock and humans. South Carolina's pending bill would require anyone administering certain covid mRNA vaccines to inform patients that the shot is contaminated with fragments of "bacterial plasmid DNA."

Covid mRNA shots may have minute amounts of residual DNA from production processes but they are heavily degraded and pose no risk, according to the Global Vaccine Data Network, which evaluates vaccine safety concerns.

Speakers at some legislative proceedings have included representatives from Children's Health Defense, an activist, anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy.

The Florida surgeon general in January 2024 called for a halt in the use of covid mRNA vaccines. And in Texas, Attorney General Ken Paxton in January moved to appeal a lawsuit he filed claiming Pfizer misrepresented the safety of its mRNA shot.

Efforts to restrict the shots have raised the profile of groups such as the Independent Medical Alliance, which advocates for mRNA-based covid vaccines to be withdrawn from the market.

"We should stop it and test it more before we move forward," said pediatric cardiologist Kirk Milhoan, a senior fellow at the alliance.

Groups opposed to mRNA shots are pointing to a recent study to urge more caution. Yale University researchers reported in February that they found spike protein still circulating in a subset of individuals with a debilitating, post-vaccination condition. Some of the individuals who experienced chronic illness after getting the shots had detectable levels of spike protein more than 700 days after vaccination. This study was small — 42 participants — and not peer-reviewed.

Its findings also don't show the spike protein is a health risk or a cause of vaccine injury.

"It's an initial, provocative study in which you can't draw conclusions," said William Schaffner, past medical director of National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. "This is one of the most widely used vaccines around the globe. It's the furthest thing from an experimental vaccine."

But what this growing pushback shows, according to some researchers, is that distrust isn't coming only from fringe groups anymore.

"There are truly amazing mRNA cancer vaccines out there," said Kate Broderick, chief innovation officer at Maravai LifeSciences, which works on vaccine development. "My fear as a scientist is that it's been tainted in the public."

What does America want out of its health care system in 2025?

It’s a question that’s been on Emory University professor Dr. Stephen Patrick’s mind, and now over 2,000 U.S. adults have answered back.

Patrick, chair of the Rollins School of Public Health’s Department of Health Policy, and his team recently published their findings from the Rollins-Gallup Public Health Priorities Survey, offering a look at what’s on the nation’s mind.

Emory University partnered with Gallup to conduct self-administered web interviews to U.S. adults from Dec. 2 to Dec. 15 last year. The 2,121 respondents were asked to rank public health issues — ranging from affordability to social isolation — based on what government and public health leaders should consider the highest priorities for 2025.

According to Patrick, timing was everything.

“When we started the process, we didn’t know who was going to be in office and we intentionally fielded it after the election with results to come out just shortly after we had somebody sworn in,” Patrick told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “So the goal of this was to not have our voices, but have Americans’ voices on where they wanted public health to be in the new administration.”



Over half (52%) of respondents ranked “improving health care access and affordability” as one of their top three public health concerns, making it the most unanimously agreed upon issue. Precisely a quarter of respondents ranked it as their first concern.



“They’re big problems, when we look at the top four priorities: improving health care access and affordability, reducing chronic disease, safe food and water and then protecting the safety net (Medicare, Medicaid, and free clinics),” Patrick said. “Those are things where Americans said, across party lines, there needs to be a substantial federal role.”

The survey also asked respondents if federal or state government was more effective at addressing their top public health priorities. For all three highest ranked public health issues, respondents sided with the federal government.

“But each one of those also involves state and local government,” Patrick added. “Each one of them involves an element of what we do locally. Like, we can’t improve chronic disease without being really local and doing the things that we do to help each other be healthy.”

Respondents were also asked if the U.S. made progress, lost ground or not changed over the last decade concerning eight key areas of public health.

“One of the things that struck me is, for every item we tested, there was not a single issue where more than half the country thought we had made progress,” he said. “But there were three areas in particular where they think we had lost ground.”

A majority of respondents said the nation has lost ground in the opioid epidemic. Half said the same about mental health nationwide. And nearly half (47%) believed the U.S. has lost ground with healthy dieting and lifestyles. However, 36% of people said the U.S. has made progress at improving the health outcomes of those with chronic diseases.

Lastly, respondents were asked to select their three most trusted sources of public health information. Out of 15 options, three topped the rankings: doctor, nurse or health care providers (54%), scientific research and studies (42%) and the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (37%).

While social media only earned a comparatively slender 9% of the overall votes, 16% of adults 18 to 29 placed it within their top three most trusted sources.

“Non-Hispanic Black Americans and Republican men (including Republican leaners) were also among the groups most likely to pick social media as a top trusted source for public health information — at 16% and 12%, respectively,” according to the survey report.



When asked what government leaders should take from the survey results, the Emory University professor explained that it offers direction for what the American people want this year.

“I think what Americans are telling us is that there’s a clear road map for where they want us to go,” Patrick said. “As we think about the next couple of years, we should be thinking about bolstering systems that ensure access to care, reduce costs and that are focused on the other priorities that Americans have.

“Making sure that our food and water are safe, reducing chronic disease — Americans have given us a blueprint. What they want us to do is more, not less. They want us to make sure that we are bolstering the systems that are there. And they also told us that there’s a strong federal role for that, across party lines. Whether they were Republicans or Democrats, most — by a wide margin — told us that their top priorities should have the federal government play a leading role.”

BOLIGEE, Ala. — Green lights flickered on the wireless router in Barbara Williams’ kitchen. Just one bar lit up — a weak signal connecting her to the world beyond her home in the Alabama Black Belt.

Next to the router sat medications, vitamin D pills, and Williams’ blood glucose monitor kit.

“I haven’t used that thing in a month or so,” said Williams, 72, waving toward the kit. Diagnosed with diabetes more than six years ago, she has developed nerve pain from neuropathy in both legs.

Williams is one of nearly 3 million Americans who live in mostly rural counties that lack both health care and reliable high-speed internet, according to an analysis by KFF Health News, which showed that these people tend to live sicker and die younger than others in America.

Compared with those in other regions, patients across the rural South, Appalachia, and remote West are most often unable to make a video call to their doctor or log into their patient portals. Both are essential ways to participate in the U.S. medical system. And Williams is among those who can do neither.

This year, more than $42 billion allocated in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is expected to begin flowing to states as part of a national “Internet for All” initiative launched by the Biden administration. But the program faces uncertainty after Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick last week announced a “rigorous review” asserting that the previous administration’s approach was full of “woke mandates.”

High rates of chronic illness and historical inequities are hallmarks of many of the more than 200 U.S. counties with poor services that KFF Health News identified. Dozens of doctors, academics, and advocates interviewed for this article unanimously agreed that limited internet service hinders medical care and access.

Without fast, reliable broadband, “all we’re going to do is widen health care disparities within telemedicine,” said Rashmi Mullur, an endocrinologist and chief of telehealth at VA Greater Los Angeles. Patients with diabetes who also use telemedicine are more likely to get care and control their blood sugar, Mullur found.

Diabetes requires constant management. Left untreated, uncontrolled blood sugar can cause blindness, kidney failure, nerve damage, and eventually death.

Williams, who sees a nurse practitioner at the county hospital in the next town, said she is not interested in using remote patient monitoring or video calls.

“I know how my sugar affects me,” Williams said. “I get a headache if it’s too high.” She gets weaker when it’s down, she said, and always carries snacks like crackers or peppermints.

Williams said she could even drink a soda pop — orange, grape — when her sugar is low but would not drink one when she felt it was high because she would get “kind of goozie-woozy.”

‘This Is America’

Connectivity dead zones persist in American life despite at least $115 billion lawmakers have thrown toward fixing the inequities. Federal broadband efforts are fragmented and overlapping, with more than 133 funding programs administered by 15 agencies, according to a 2023 federal report.

“This is America. It’s not supposed to be this way,” said Karthik Ganesh, chief executive of Tampa, Florida-based OnMed, a telehealth company that in September installed a walk-in booth at the Boligee Community Center about 10 minutes from Williams’ home. Residents can call up free life-size video consultations with an OnMed health care provider and use equipment to check their weight and blood pressure.

OnMed, which partnered with local universities and the Alabama Cooperative Extension System, relies on SpaceX’s Starlink to provide a high-speed connection in lieu of other options.

A short drive from the community center, beyond Boligee’s Main Street with its deserted buildings and an empty railroad depot and down a long gravel drive, is the 22-acre property where Williams lives.

Last fall, Williams washed a dish in her kitchen, with its unforgiving linoleum-topped concrete floors. A few months earlier, she said, a man at the community center signed her up for “diabetic shoes” to help with her sore feet. They never arrived.

As Williams spoke, steam rose from a pot of boiling potatoes on the stove. Another pan sizzled with hamburger steak. And on a back burner simmered a mix of Velveeta cheese, diced tomatoes, and peppers.

She spent years on her feet as head cook at a diner in Cleveland, Ohio. The oldest of nine, Williams returned to her family home in Greene County more than 20 years ago to care for her mother and a sister, who both died from cancer in the back bedroom where she now sleeps.

Williams looked out a window and recalled when the landscape was covered in cotton that she once helped pick. Now three houses stand in a carefully tended clearing surrounded by tall trees. One belongs to a brother and the other to a sister who drives with her daily to the community center for exercise, prayers, and friendship with other seniors.

All the surviving siblings, Williams said, have diabetes. “I don’t know how we became diabetic,” she said. Neither of their parents had been diagnosed with the illness.

In Greene County, an estimated quarter of adults have diabetes — twice the national average. The county, which has about 7,600 residents, also has among the nation’s highest rates for several chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, stroke, and obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows.

The county’s population is predominately Black. The federal CDC reports that Black Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and are 40% more likely than their white counterparts to die from the condition. And in the South, rural Black residents are more likely to lack home internet access, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank.

To identify counties most lacking in reliable broadband and health care providers, KFF Health News used data from the Federal Communications Commission and George Washington University’s Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity. Reporters also analyzed U.S. Census Bureau, CDC, and other data to understand the health status and demographics of those counties.

The analysis confirms that internet and care gaps are “hitting areas of extreme poverty and high social vulnerability,” said Clese Erikson, deputy director of the health workforce research center at the Mullan Institute.

Digital Haves vs. Have-Nots

Just over half of homes in Greene County have access to reliable high-speed internet — among the lowest rates in the nation. Greene County also has some of the country’s poorest residents, with a median household income of about $31,500. Average life expectancy is less than 72 years, below the national average.

By contrast, the KFF Health News analysis found that counties with the highest rates of internet access and health care providers correlated with higher life expectancy, less chronic disease, and key lifestyle factors such as higher incomes and education levels.

One of those is Howard County, Maryland, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., where nearly all homes can connect to fast, reliable internet. The median household income is about $147,000 and average life expectancy is more than 82 years — a decade longer than in Greene County. A much smaller share of residents live with chronic conditions such as diabetes.

One is 78-year-old Sam Wilderson, a retired electrical engineer who has managed his Type 2 diabetes for more than a decade. He has fiber-optic internet at his home, which is a few miles from a cafe he dines at every week after Bible study. On a recent day, the cafe had a guest Wi-Fi download speed of 104 megabits per second and a 148 Mbps upload speed. The speeds are fast enough for remote workers to reliably take video calls.

Americans are demanding more speed than ever before. Most households have multiple devices — televisions, computers, gaming systems, doorbells — in addition to phones that can take up bandwidth. The more devices connected, the higher minimum speeds are needed to keep everything running smoothly.

To meet increasing needs, federal regulators updated the definition of broadband last year, establishing standard speeds of 100/20 Mbps. Those speeds are typically enough for several users to stream, browse, download, and play games at the same time.

Christopher Ali, professor of telecommunications at Penn State, recommends minimum standard speeds of 100/100 Mbps. While download speeds enable consumption, such as streaming or shopping, fast upload speeds are necessary to participate in video calls, say, for work or telehealth.

At the cafe in Howard County, on a chilly morning last fall, Wilderson ordered a glass of white wine and his usual: three-seeded bread with spinach, goat cheese, smoked salmon, and over-easy eggs. After eating, Wilderson held up his wrist: “This watch allows me to track my diabetes without pricking my finger.”

Wilderson said he works with his doctors, feels young, and expects to live well into his 90s, just as his father and grandfather did.

Telehealth is crucial for people in areas with few or no medical providers, said Ry Marcattilio, an associate director of research at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. The national research and advocacy group works with communities on broadband access and reviewed KFF Health News’ findings.

High-speed internet makes it easier to use video visits for medical checkups, which most patients with diabetes need every three months.

Being connected “can make a huge difference in diabetes outcomes,” said Nestoras Mathioudakis, an endocrinologist and co-medical director of Johns Hopkins Medicine Diabetes & Education Program, who treats patients in Howard County.

Paying More for Less

At Williams’ home in Alabama, pictures of her siblings and their kids cover the walls of the hallway and living room. A large, wood-framed image of Jesus at the Last Supper with his disciples hangs over her kitchen table.

Williams sat down as her pots simmered and sizzled. She wasn’t feeling quite right. “I had a glass of orange juice and a bag of potato chips, and I knew that wasn’t enough for breakfast, but I was cooking,” Williams said.

Every night Williams takes a pill to control her diabetes. In the morning, if she feels as if her sugar is dropping, she knows she needs to eat. So, that morning, she left the room to grab a peppermint, walking by the flickering wireless router.

The router’s download and upload speeds were 0.03/0.05 Mbps, nearly unusable by modern standards. Williams’ connection on her house phone can sound scratchy, and when she connects her cellphone to the router, it does not always work. Most days it’s just good enough for her to read a daily devotional website and check Facebook, though the stories don’t always load.

Rural residents like Williams paid nearly $13 more a month on average in late 2020 for slow internet connections than those in urban areas, according to Brian Whitacre, an agricultural economics professor at Oklahoma State University.

“You’re more likely to have competition in an urban area,” Whitacre said.

In rural Alabama, cellphone and internet options are limited. Williams pays $51.28 a month to her wireless provider, Ring Planet, which did not respond to calls and emails.

In Howard County, Maryland, national fiber-optic broadband provider Verizon Communications faces competition from Comcast, a hybrid fiber-optic and cable provider. Verizon advertises a home internet plan promising speeds of 300/300 Mbps starting at $35 a month for its existing mobile customers. The company also offers a discounted price as low as $20 a month for customers who participate in certain federal assistance programs.

“Internet service providers look at the economics of going into some of these communities and there just isn’t enough purchasing power in their minds to warrant the investment,” said Ross DeVol, chief executive of Heartland Forward, a nonpartisan think tank based in Bentonville, Arkansas, that specializes in state and local economic development.

Conexon, a fiber-optic cable construction company, estimates it costs $25,000 per mile to build above-ground fiber lines on poles and $60,000 to $70,000 per mile to build underground.

Former President Joe Biden’s 2021 infrastructure law earmarked $65 billion with a goal of connecting all Americans to high-speed internet. Money was designated to establish digital equity programs and to help low-income customers pay their internet bills. The law also set aside tens of billions through the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, to connect homes and businesses.

That effort prioritizes fiber-optic connections, but federal regulators recently outlined guidance for alternative technologies, including low Earth orbit satellites like SpaceX’s Starlink service.

Funding the use of satellites in federal broadband programs has been controversial inside federal agencies. It has also been a sore point for Elon Musk, who is chief executive of SpaceX, which runs Starlink, and is a lead adviser to President Donald Trump.

After preliminary approval, a federal commission ruled that Starlink’s satellite system was “not reasonably capable” of offering reliable high speeds. Musk tweeted last year that the commission had “illegally revoked” money awarded under the agency’s Trump-era Rural Digital Opportunity Fund.

In February, Trump nominated Arielle Roth to lead the federal agency overseeing the infrastructure act’s BEAD program. Roth is telecommunications policy director for the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Last year, she criticized the program’s emphasis on fiber and said it was beleaguered by a “woke social agenda” with too many regulations.

Commerce Secretary Lutnick last week said he will get rid of “burdensome regulations” and revamp the program to “take a tech-neutral approach.” Republicans echoed his positions during a U.S. House subcommittee hearing the same day.

When asked about potentially weakening the program’s required low-cost internet option, former National Telecommunications and Information Administration official Sarah Morris said such a change would build internet connections that people can’t afford. Essentially, she said, they would be “building bridges to nowhere, building networks to no one.”

'That Hurt’

Over a lunch of tortilla chips with the savory sauce that had been simmering on the stove, Williams said she hadn’t been getting regular checkups before her diabetes diagnosis.

“To tell you the truth, if I can get up and move and nothing is bothering me, I don’t go to the doctor,” Williams said. “I’m just being honest.”

Years ago, Williams recalled, “my head was hurting me so bad I had to just lay down. I couldn’t stand up, walk, or nothing. I’d get so dizzy.”

Williams thought it was her blood pressure, but the doctor checked for diabetes. “How did they know? I don’t know,” Williams said.

As lunch ended, she pulled out her glucose monitor. Williams connected the needle and wiped her finger with an alcohol pad. Then she pricked her finger.

“Oh,” Williams said, sucking air through her teeth. “That hurt.”

She placed the sample in the machine, and it quickly displayed a reading of 145 — a number, Williams said, that meant she needed to stop eating.

Here’s how KFF Health News did its analysis for the “Dead Zone” series, which pinpointed counties that lag behind the rest of the United States in access to broadband service and health care providers.

To identify “dead zones,” KFF Health News consulted two main data sources.

GWU’s data for behavioral health providers reflects psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, therapists, and addiction medicine specialists, regardless of whether their patients receive Medicaid. We used data from 2021, the most recent year available.

We classified counties as “dead zones” if they met these criteria:

A total of 210 counties met those criteria. At the other extreme, we defined 203 counties as “most served” if they had the most residences with broadband access (at least 96.7%) and ranked in the top third of Medicaid primary care and behavioral health provider ratios.

We also compared the health outcomes and demographics of dead zone counties relative to others using several data sources:

Virginia has dropped three of its first four conference matchups.

Facing the top team in both the ACC and the nation, No. 1 Wake Forest, Virginia struggled to gain momentum in a 4-1 loss, dropping to 1-3 in conference play. The Cavaliers (9-5, 1-3 ACC) continued to play its new doubles pairings — freshman Rafael Jodar with graduate student James Hopper and junior Ty Switzer with freshman Jangjun Kim — in an effort to shake things up. But despite a strong effort, the Cavaliers could not overcome the Demon Deacons’ (21-0, 4-0 ACC) depth in singles, with Jodar securing Virginia’s only point. 

Virginia’s new doubles pairing of Jodar and Hopper found itself locked in a grueling battle on Court 2, ultimately falling short in a tiebreak as Wake Forest secured the doubles point.

From the beginning, the Demon Deacons applied pressure with Court 2’s lefty serve causing troubles for the Cavaliers. Struggling to find their rhythm, Jodar and Hopper quickly fell behind 1-4 as their attempts to rush the net and end points quickly proved unsuccessful. They had a chance to shift the momentum at 2-4, pushing a return game to deuce at 3-4, but Wake Forest held strong to maintain its advantage.

On the other courts, though, the Cavaliers were battling. On Court 1, sophomore Dylan Dietrich and junior Mans Dahlberg dropped their set 3-6, while Switzer and Kim on Court 3 managed to recover from a late break at 5-2 to close out a 6-3 win. 

With the doubles point on the line, Jodar and Hopper remained resilient. Down 3-4 and facing a deuce point, Jodar delivered a crucial serve to hold, leveling the score at 4-4. Wake Forest responded with a routine hold, setting up a tense finish. At 5-6, 30-40, Jodar and Hopper faced a do-or-die moment on Jodar’s second serve. Under pressure, they came in clutch, forcing deuce before Jodar delivered a big serve and Hopper put away three overheads to send the match to a deciding seven-point tiebreak.

Wake Forest jumped out to an early lead, winning the first three points, then extending its advantage to 4-1. Jodar and Hopper fought back, with Jodar crushing a massive inside-in forehand return to tie it 4-4. The Cavaliers then won two straight points to take a 6-4 lead, inching closer to the doubles point. However, Hopper lost a serve-and-volley exchange at 6-5, allowing Wake Forest back into the tiebreak. 

The Demon Deacons took advantage of this, taking a 7-6 lead before Jodar responded with two huge serves to put the Cavaliers ahead 8-7. A missed return at 8-8 gave Wake Forest another opportunity, and on the final point, Hopper’s short pickup shot at the net led to a firing of forehands from Wake Forest to finish the match. With the win, Wake Forest secured the doubles point, giving it the early edge in the matchup. 

Moving onto the singles courts, Virginia struggled to gain traction, with Jodar the lone standout in an otherwise difficult match. Even after a close doubles match where every point mattered, Jodar delivered an impressive straight-sets victory over the No. 5 singles player in the country, Suresh Ekambaram, controlling the match from start to finish with a 6-2, 6-4 win. His aggressive baseline play and consistency under pressure helped him secure the Cavaliers’ only singles victory of the day, providing a much-needed point in this very challenging matchup. 

Outside of Jodar’s win, the rest of the Cavaliers found little success. On Court 2, No. 22 Dietrich started strong, taking the first set 6-3, but his match remained unfinished after he lost the second set 3-6. Hopper also pushed his opponent to the limit, winning a tight first set in a tiebreak before his match was halted at 7-6 (7-5), 2-2. 

Virginia struggled in the lower lineup as well. Kim and freshman Stiles Brockett were quickly overpowered, with Kim falling 6-1, 6-0 on Court 4 and Brockett suffering a 6-1, 6-2 defeat on Court 6. On Court 5, Dahlberg found his footing late in the second set but ultimately fell 6-0, 7-5, while Wake Forest secured dominant victories to seal the match. 

Despite this tough loss, Virginia will look to regroup as it continues through ACC play. The Cavaliers showed flashes of promise and the competitiveness of their new doubles pairings. However, against a dominant Wake Forest team, the depth and consistency across the lineup proved to be a deciding factor. Moving forward, Virginia will need to find ways to close out tight matches as it prepares for the matches ahead. 

Virginia will hope to bounce back and secure a much-needed ACC win Friday when it faces Boston College at 3 p.m.

Love was in the air at the BNP Paribas Open on Sunday, and we're not just talking about the score.

Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner were spotted in the audience of the tennis tournament in Indian Wells, California.

Photos and videos showed the Oscar-nominated "Dune" actor, 29, and the "Kardashians" star, 27, kissing and holding hands while watching the game. Jenner's sister, Kendall Jenner, was also in attendance.

Kylie Jenner wore a red crop top and sunglasses, while Chalamet sported an Adidas jacket with a white and blue collared shirt underneath. The two were previously spotted together at the US Open in 2023, which helped fuel relationship rumors.

It was the latest public outing for the couple, who attended the Academy Awards together earlier this month. Jenner skipped the red carpet but could be seen in the audience seated next to the actor, who was nominated for his portrayal of Bob Dylan in "A Complete Unknown," and sharing kisses with him.

The Oscars broadcast also showed Jenner laughing along during an opening bit where Adam Sandler approached Chalamet and said his name in a comedic voice, a callback to the Golden Globe Awards.

Chalamet and Jenner, who sparked dating rumors in 2023, previously attended the Golden Globes together in January, again sitting together. The Kylie Cosmetics founder was seen applauding after host Nikki Glaser said the actor was "so good" in "A Complete Unknown." She also smiled and laughed when Glaser joked that Tilda Swinton was nominated "for her role as Timothée Chalamet" and told the actor he has the "most gorgeous eyelashes on your upper lip."

Jenner did not, however, attend February's Screen Actors Guild Awards, where Chalamet won best actor. That ceremony took place shortly after the death of Jenner's friend and hairstylist, Jesus Guerrero.

Chalamet generally avoids discussing his relationship with Jenner in interviews and on red carpets. During his SAG speech, he thanked his mother and shared his ambition to "be one of the greats," saying the best actor award offered him "a little more ammo to keep going."

Tennis

Welcome back to the Monday Tennis Briefing, where The Athletic will explain the stories behind the stories from the past week on court.

This week, the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, Calif. took center stage. Joao Fonseca’s amazing pull ended in disappointment for his fans, the Orange County kids did their region proud and the men’s seeds tumbled while the women’s held strong.

If you’d like to follow our fantastic tennis coverage, click here.

It has been a tournament of upsets so far on the men’s side at Indian Wells, with Novak Djokovic, Alexander Zverev and Casper Ruud all losing their first matches. On the women’s side, it’s been much calmer.

Thirteen of the top 16 WTA seeds remain as the tournament heads for the fourth round, and where the ATP No. 1 seed, Zverev, made an early exit against Tallon Griekspoor, his women’s counterpart Aryna Sabalenka was a straight-sets winner against American McCartney Kessler on Saturday. The No. 2 seed and defending champion, Iga Swiatek, has dropped just four games in her two matches so far.

The women play best-of-three sets at every event, but for the men perhaps some of the variance in a tournament that has seen 15 of the 32 seeds exit in either their first or second matches comes with the shorter format compared to the Grand Slams. Zverev had come close to defeat against Griekspoor in several of their previous meetings, most recently outlasting him across five sets at least year’s French Open. Djokovic, who said the high bounce on the main court at Indian Wells caught him off guard, would have felt more confident surviving a marathon as opposed to a shootout against Botic van de Zandschulp.

Is a format more conducive to upsets better or worse? It depends on perspective, but it makes sense that the Grand Slams would rather keep the longer format and increase their chances of keeping the big names in.

GO DEEPER

One serve? New scoring? How changing tennis might actually go down

Charlie Eccleshare

A recurring debate during tennis’ various officiating controversies in the last year has been the extent to which the sport should expect players to fess up to things that umpires miss.

At January’s Australian Open for instance, some felt that Swiatek should have admitted to not reaching an Emma Navarro drop shot before the ball bounced twice. Others felt she couldn’t have known for sure, and it’s not her responsibility to officiate the match.

On Sunday night, albeit in a different incident where there was less uncertainty, Japanese qualifier Yosuke Watanuki offered the kind of sportsmanship against Frances Tiafoe that many fans have said they would like to see.

Tiafoe was serving at deuce, down 2-3, when he was given a time violation for taking too long before serving. Watanuki walked towards umpire Mohamed Lahyani and told him that he hadn’t been ready to receive. Lahyani accepted this and canceled the time violation, two of which lead to the server being docked their first serve. That’s what happened to Tiafoe at a crucial moment of a match against Roman Safiullin in Shanghai last year, when he swore repeatedly at umpire Jeremy Pinoargote and was fined $120,000 (£92,800) as a result.

Respect 🤝@FTiafoe received a time violation, but it was cancelled after Watanuki told the referee he wasn't ready to return Tiafoe's serve.#TennisParadise pic.twitter.com/CT3kAdFktF

— BNP Paribas Open (@BNPPARIBASOPEN) March 10, 2025



Watanuki went on to win an action-packed match 6-4, 7-6(6) despite Tiafoe twice serving for the second set. One of those breaks for Watanuki came immediately after he had asked for a Pepsi when struggling for energy down 5-4. The win means that Watanuki, ranked No. 349 after missing most of last year with injury, is the lowest-ranked player in the Indian Wells last 16 since 2004. He is coached by Tiafoe’s former coach, one-time world No. 6 Wayne Ferreira.

For Tiafoe, the defeat extends his difficult start to 2025, a year in which he is yet to win more than one match at a single event. His most memorable contribution to this year’s Indian Wells came at the start of the Watanuki match when, after forgetting his rackets for his previous match against Damir Dzumhur, Tiafoe pretended he had done so again, and successfully fooled an initially stunned Lahyani, who then collapsed into laughter.

Tournament organizers are going to have to adjust to the Joao Fonseca phenomenon, maybe by paying a little less attention to his ranking.

Fonseca, the 18-year-old rising star from Brazil, is the world No. 80, but he’s also one of the biggest attractions in the sport. That could get a little awkward, since the world’s 80th-best player generally doesn’t get the most prestigious court assignments, and won’t directly qualify for about half the tournaments on the tour. But if he’s the player that thousands of fans buy tickets to see, one argument goes, then there needs to be room for them to see him.

Witness Fonseca’s second-round match against Jack Draper Saturday. Organizers put the match on Stadium 4, which seats 3,500. Lines to get in stretched into the main plaza of the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. They didn’t move, but practically no one left. Fans watched from the high bleachers of surrounding courts. They clawed the fences in the corners of the court trying to get a glimpse.

“I have to get used to this,” Fonseca said of the fanfare.

He had played his first match against Jacob Fearnley on the main stadium court, but no seeds were playing that day. That was an easy call. Fonseca’s next tournament, the Miami Open, might present some even more difficult ones, because Florida has a big Brazilian population. Itau, a Brazilian finance company is the main sponsor of the tournament.

Should Fonseca get big stadium assignments? At the moment, he is more famous than his ranking or accomplishments might suggest. If he’s the player people want to see, then he probably should. Making fans wait on lines that don’t move and leave disappointed does no one any good.

There were high hopes for California boys coming into the tournament, especially the newcomers. Ethan Quinn, Jenson Brooksby, Learner Tien, Tristan Boyer and Alex Michelsen all grew up within driving distance from Indian Wells and came here as children.

Taylor Fritz is still alive, of course. That’s expected: he’s the world No. 4. The others are out. But Marcos Giron, another California player from Thousand Oaks who went to UCLA is still in, achieving his best run at Indian Wells at 31 years old.

Giron notched his first top-five win over Casper Ruud on Friday and beat No. 26 seed, Alexei Popyrin, on Sunday to get into the round of 16.

“This place holds a lot of memories and a lot of emotion,” he said.

It was the first tournament he attended and had his first ATP breakthrough here in 2019, winning two matches.

“The last couple years I came here maybe with expectations, maybe yes, maybe no, some pressure, and I didn’t play well,” he said. “Of course there’s a lot of family, there’s a lot of friends, trying to organize tickets and all that, give everybody the time they deserve.

“This is not something I can do forever. So I know each moment, I’ve got to make the most of it.”

Michelsen had perhaps the worst luck of his California gang. Things looked troubling early for his opponent, two-time beaten finalist Daniil Medvedev. The Russian called for a medical timeout after just one game in his second match of the tournament. Michelsen, a hometown favorite from nearby Orange County, was going to have the crowd on his side. Medvedev has had trouble putting away players who meet him with energy and without fear.

After his time out, Medvedev headed back to the court. They played another game. He had a 2-0 lead. Then they were shaking hands at the net. A retirement. Surely Medvedev was done, he’d had the medic on.

But it was Michelsen grabbing his bag and walking off the court. He’d taken the court unwell with a stomach issue, having considered not playing at all. A duel against a human backboard like Medvedev in the desert sun was much too much for him to manage.

Weird things can happen in tennis matches. That was about as weird as it gets.

Tennis fans were left stunned after one of the most famous couples in the world was spotted courtside in Indian Wells on Sunday.

Two-time Oscar nominee Timothee Chalamet and reality star Kylie Jenner, who have reportedly been dating in 2023, were among the interested spectators in Tennis Paradise over the weekend.

The couple were joined by Kylie’s older sister, model Kendall, for action on Stadium 1, watching Holger Rune defeat Ugo Humbert before Mirra Andreeva’s win over Clara Tauson.

The super-couple’s appearance quickly spread over social media, and in a cheeky message, 12th seed Rune was keen to recognise their support.

Former world No 4 Rune took to Twitter/X, and posted “Love the support out here @BNPPARIBASOPEN”, quoting an ATP Tour tweet highlighting Chalamet and Jenner’s appearance.

Though they are arguably the most famous faces to be spotted in the stands so far this year, Chalamet and Jenner are far from the only celebrities to take in some tennis action in the desert over the years.

We take a look back at some of the biggest names who have been spotted in Indian Wells.

You only have to rewind twelve months to come across another modern super couple who enjoyed some tennis action at the famed ATP and WTA 1000 event.

Acting stars – and real-life couple – Zendaya and Holland were among the special guests on Finals Day in 2024, watching Iga Swiatek beat Maria Sakkari before Carlos Alcaraz downed Daniil Medvedev.

The main reason the couple were present was Zendaya’s impending starring role in Challengers, which was released just one month after action in Indian Wells concluded.

Zendaya and Swiatek in fact met, and were pictured together, after the latter claimed her second title in the space of three years.

One of tennis’ most famous fans, Ben Stiller has been a regular figure at multiple tennis events over the years; he was spotted at both Roland Garros and the US Open in 2024.

However, the Hollywood star and wife – and fellow star – Christine Taylor have also attended Indian Wells in the past.

The pair were courtside multiple times in 2022, watching multiple Rafael Nadal matches as the Spaniard went all the way to the final, ultimately falling to US star Taylor Fritz.

Stiller and Taylor were also pictured at the event in 2012 and 2019, and his love for tennis was mentioned by Coco Gauff after the two met at the Oscars last week.

She said: “I saw Ben Stiller out there. I wasn’t so surprised at him because I know he’s a tennis fan, but I told him he has to come to one of my matches because I only really see him at the men’s matches – so I told him he has to come.”

Oscar-winning icon DiCaprio might not be as famous of a tennis fan as Stiller, but the legendary star has been spotted in Indian Wells in the past.

The actor was sighted at the tournament back in 2017 and has also been spotted at the US Open over the years.

One of the biggest sporting stars to profess their love for tennis, skiing icon Lindsey Vonn attracted the wrath of some Novak Djokovic fans when she referred to Roger Federer as the ‘GOAT’ on social media.

However, she quickly silenced any criticism after meeting Djokovic in Indian Wells last year, sharing a selfie on social media.

She wrote: “Hanging with the [GOAT], and yes, I do believe he is the goat. Contrary to twitter beliefs, I think there can be more than one.”

Indoors or outdoors, the Blue Devils delivered. 

After transitioning from indoor courts at snowy Notre Dame to a cold outdoor setting at Louisville, it was the 11th-ranked Blue Devils that iced out both ACC foes, 4-1 and 4-2, respectively.

“I think overall, it's a very tricky ACC road weekend,” Duke head coach Smith said. “We're playing at Notre Dame, which is indoors and very fast … Then we drove five hours and we played outdoors in cold conditions on very slow courts today. So I thought our guys did a tremendous job adapting.” 

The Blue Devils (11-3, 4-0 in the ACC) started the road trip to No. 52 Notre Dame, featuring a new doubles and singles lineup due to junior Pedro Rodenas’ injury. Duke’s nearly season-long doubles partnership of sophomore Cooper Williams and graduate Andreja Petrovic delivered with a quick 6-2 victory, and new duo Theo Winegar and Connor Krug delivered the clinching doubles point victory 7-6 (7-4). 

“I think our biggest strength as a team is depth, and we have so many good players,” Smith said. “We were down some players this weekend, and so we had to juggle a little bit, but we also wanted to try some new things in doubles.”

Not only did Petrovic impress on the doubles court, but also the singles, delivering a spirited effort after being moved up to court two in place of Rodenas. Taking care of Fighting Irish opponent Yu Zhang, Petrovic moved the Blue Devils to a 2-0 lead with a quick 6-2, 6-1 domination. 

“I think it was Andreja's most complete match,” Smith said. “He lost a couple matches, and hasn’t played quite as sharp recently. He just had a really good week and a half of training.”

Following Petrovic’s victory, graduate Remy Dugardin also made quick work of Notre Dame’s Jameson Corsillo 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 to stretch Duke’s lead to 3-0. Then, Williams fell on court one 4-6, 5-7, and all eyes turned to senior Jake Krug on court six.

Krug, last seeing singles match action Feb. 2 against Coastal Carolina, delivered for Duke, clinching the victory for the Blue Devils after a 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) match triumph. 

To Smith, the result was a testament of Duke’s depth. 

“Jake stepped in, [he] hasn’t played many matches at all for us, and he clinches for us,” Smith said. “Just a week ago, he wasn’t even one of the 12 guys warming up for the Virginia match.”

“I just think the biggest takeaway from this weekend was flexibility, being able to get both double points and our depth and the next guys stepping up and being ready to go,” Smith said.

Moving to Sunday, Smith was forced to make a lineup change as an injury in doubles forced Williams to not play his singles match. As a result, freshman Saahith Jayaraman stepped into singles play on court six, and he delivered. The El Dorado Hills, Calif., native captured Duke’s clinching singles point via a 6-4, 7-5 takedown of Piet Steveker. 

The match was just Jayaraman’s fifth of the season, and it brings his win total to three with two undecided finishes. 

“Historically, it's been very challenging to not play early on and then get thrown in at big moments,” Smith said. “[Jayaraman] was just ready when his name was called. It's weird, he didn't seem to have many nerves.” 

Other than Jayaraman, Dugardin and sophomore Alexander Visser contributed points on courts four and five, respectively, to move Duke to an undefeated 4-0 in ACC play. 

This weekend’s victories were extra special for Smith, bringing his win total as Duke head coach to 300 and 301 over his 17 seasons as the program’s lead. Currently, Smith sits as the second-winningest head coach in Duke men’s tennis history, trailing current assistant coach Jay Lapidus with 371 victories.  

“It’s a nice recognition,” Smith said. “It really is all about the players. I’m really proud of all the great players that we have had, how much they’ve invested in the program. The wins are really, really hard.”

“I'm doing what I love to do, and I'm doing it where I love to be,” Smith added.

The Blue Devils continue on the road for their next two matches, setting up faceoffs with No. 42 Georgia Tech Friday and No. 23 Clemson Sunday.

She silenced online theories about a 'Kardashians curse' by sharing a passionate kiss with Timothée Chalamet during a date at the tennis on Sunday.

And Kylie Jenner was clearly in a confident mood after her busy day out, taking to Instagram to post a racy mirror selfie just hours after the smooch.

The cosmetics mogul, 27, put on a busty display in a cropped red shirt, unbuttoned and tied at the midriff, pairing the item with some white trousers.

She held a navy Miu Miu buttoned sweater in one hand and toted a vintage black corduroy Chanel shoulder bag worth more than £1,200, which she showed off in detail in a separate social media update. 

Kylie's vibrant top had short sleeves and was decorated with vertical white dotted lines. 

Earlier, she had completed her look with a pair of slim black sunglasses covering her impeccably made-up face, and she styled her raven tresses in thick waves cascading down her shoulders. 

Kylie joined boyfriend Timothée, 29, at the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in Indian Wells, California, earlier in the day.

She kept her cool as the Complete Unknown star shouted with excitement while they watched Holger Rune of Denmark taken on France's Ugo Humbert, with 12th-ranked Holger emerging victorious over the 18th-ranked player. 

Following Timothée's Oscars loss last week to The Brutalist star Adrien Brody, fans have claimed that her boyfriend missed out on his second chance at the prestigious award due to her surprise appearance at the ceremony.

Kylie shushed those conspiracists with plenty of PDA during the match one week on from her beau's Academy Awards snub.

In one sweet but humorous exchange caught on video, she held Timothée's face and pulled him towards her for several loving kisses, even as he tried to keep his eyes turned toward the court.

Her sister Kendall Jenner was also seen taking a seat in the row in front of the loved-up couple.

The model looked sleek and casual in a black crop top with casual white pants and a midnight blue baseball cap.

Timothée, meanwhile, was dressed casually in a preppy white shirt with vertical navy stripes, which he wore open to reveal his white undershirt.

He added a cool touch with a pair of black leather pants, after he previously caused a sensation at the Oscars by wearing a pale yellow leather suit.

Later in the day, he changed into a white Adidas windbreaker sporting the logo of French side Saint Etienne, who Timothée is believed to be a big fan of, as it appeared to get chillier.

In one cute but silly exchange caught on video, Timothée sat back with his shirt open as Kylie rubbed her hand over his stomach as if he was a baby with a tummy ache.

The couple have lately been beset by parasocial fans on social media who have revived talk of the so-called 'Kardashians curse'.

According to the invented supernatural force, any man who dates one of the Kardashian–Jenner sisters will have some kind of fall from grace during the relationship.

Kim and Khloe Kardashian previously slammed the theory as 'super sexist'.

Although Timothée did end up losing to Adrien Brody in the Best Actor category at last week's Oscars, he was not deemed the frontrunner in the category. 

The steamy trip to the tennis comes after the Dune actor watched his beloved New York Knicks play in Los Angeles on Thursday, while Kylie was mourning the death of her hairstylist Jesus Guerrero.

Timothée was spotted courtside at the Crypto.com Arena for the Knicks versus Los Angeles Lakers game, hanging out with another famous Knicks fan: Spike Lee.

The star sported a white t-shirt under a zip-up white jacket with blue jogging pants for the game in downtown LA.

His fellow Knicks fan Spike donned a blue-and-orange Knicks hat, orange glasses, an orange necklace with a grey Knicks sweatshirt and white pants.

The pair were seen engaging in conversation and shaking hands courtside, and it turned out they picked a thrilling game to attend.

The fixture ended up going to overtime, with the Lakers pulling out a dramatic 113-109 win at the death.

No. 2 Georgia women’s tennis swept Florida on Sunday, March 2, marking the Bulldogs’ 10th win against the Gators in the last 10 matches.

Doubles play began strong for the Bulldogs, with No. 25 Dasha Vidmanova and Mell Reasco quickly defeating Alicia Dudeney and Bente Spee 6-1 on court one. Florida defaulted its doubles match due to injury on court three, giving Georgia the doubles point after Vidmanova and Reasco’s win.

At the time of Vidmanova and Reasco’s win, No. 65 Guillermina Grant and Anastasiia Lopata were up 5-1 against Nikola Daubnerova and Talia Neilson-Gatenby on court two.

Florida additionally defaulted its singles match on court six, quickly putting Georgia up 2-0. Reasco secured her match on court three against Neilson-Gatenby 6-3, 6-0, making the score 3-0.

No. 66 Grant closed out the match with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Noemie Oliveras on court five. At the time of Grant’s win, No. 1 Vidmanova had won her first set against Dudeney 6-4 and was up 3-2 in the second set.

No. 39 Lopata faced Nikola Daubnerova on court two, and had a strong 6-0 first set victory. Lopata was up 5-2 in the second set. No. 56 Aysegul Mert fell short in her first set 6-4 against Spee and was tied 2-2 at the time of Grant’s win.

Following the match, Georgia headed back on the road for the start of four away matches. The Bulldogs faced Kentucky that Friday and swept the Wildcats 4-0.

The Georgia women's basketball team saw its 2025 SEC Tournament run come to an end on Thursday with a 70-52 loss to No. 10 Oklahoma in the second round.

For the first time since 2017, Georgia gymnastics is 4-0 at home after its 197.200-197.150 win over No. 10 Kentucky on March 2 at Stegeman Coliseum.

The Georgia women’s basketball team fought back from an 11-point deficit to defeat Arkansas, 79-74 in a thrilling SEC Tournament first-round matchup at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina.

No. 10 Georgia gymnastics hit a season-high 49.500 on floor in the Pete Maravich Assembly Center on Friday night in front of a 13,476 person crowd.

Kylie Jenner couldn’t keep her hands off Timothée Chalamet while taking in some tennis over the weekend.

Per photos obtained by Page Six, the couple put their romance on full display at the BNP Paribas Indian Wells Open in Indian Wells, Calif., on Sunday.

Throughout the match, Jenner made sure to pack on the PDA with the “Complete Unknown” star while posing for photos in the stands.

At one point, the 27-year-old “Kardashians” star sat with her hands in Chalamet’s lap before a friend pulled out their phone to take a few loved-up snaps.

Jenner was all smiles as she cradled Chalamet’s face and pulled him in for a kiss. However, the actor never took his eyes off the match.

The two seemed to be having a great time as they sipped on cocktails and laughed with their pals, including the makeup mogul’s sister Kendall Jenner.

Later on in the set, the Khy founder reached over to rub Chalamet’s chest as she tucked a hand in his shirt. 

The Oscar nominee seemed engrossed in the action, shouting and standing up as they watched French player Ugo Humbert take on Holger Rune from Denmark. 

Despite the 75-degree day, Chalamet wore leather pants and a white track jacket, which he took off to reveal a striped button-down.

Kylie, for her part, wore a low-cut cropped blouse and tan trousers. She added a pair of black sunglasses and opted for a black Chanel purse. 

While the reality TV star shared a few snaps from the day on her Instagram Stories, she did not include any pictures of Chalamet. 

Up until recently, the couple has kept their two-year relationship private.

While the two rarely talk about their romance, they have seemingly become more comfortable attending public events together.

Kylie has accompanied Chalamet throughout this season’s awards circuit — attending the Golden Globes, Academy Awards, the BAFTAs and other promotional events. 

Although the two have yet to make their red carpet debut, they were often photographed getting cozy inside the star-studded venues.

An insider previously told Page Six that Kylie “feels like Timothée is so different from all her other exes” and believes he may be “the one.”

“[She] has never felt like this about anybody else before and definitely sees a future with him,” the source told us in January.

The kingdom’s move to fund a year’s paid maternity leave for pregnant professional tennis players had led to accusations of sports washing.

Saudi Arabia’s move to fund a year’s paid maternity leave for pregnant professional tennis players led to accusations of sports washing. The program is the first in women’s sports, the Women’s Tennis Association said. 

Riyadh has funneled billions into the world’s biggest sports leagues to diversify its economy away from oil, though critics say the true aim is to launder its reputation: The kingdom ranks 126th out of 146 nations for gender inequality, according to a widely used index. 

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has dismissed such allegations, saying in a 2023 interview: “If sports washing [is] going to increase my GDP by way of one percent, then I will continue doing sport washing.”

Every week, countless stories and news emerge in the tennis world that don’t always make headlines but are too intriguing to overlook. These can be on-court or off-court developments that go under the radar due to bigger storylines from the past week. There were many interesting stories and news this week, and we have covered them all in this edition.

World No.31, Linda Noskova has received terrifying NSFW death threat after her early exit in Indian Wells.

The 20-year-old Czech player has endured a lot in the last one year, with her mother passing due to cancer in June of last year. This must have been terrifying for her, but she demonstrated incredible courage by sharing it and exposing the rageholic. The sad part about this is that these pathetic acts have become very common now. Most of the time, these come from gamblers who bet on the player and then lose huge sums, and take it out on the players.

This shouldn’t be dismissed as “another day in the life of a tennis player” because this shouldn’t be happening and honestly should be prosecuted as a threat against someone’s life, because that’s what it is. A sample of these types of comments should be investigated and the culprits should be charged. It would at least scare some of them enough to think twìce about threatening someone.

Marketa Vondrousova, the former Wimbledon champion, has announced via Instagram that she will be taking a break from tennis to recover from her shoulder injury. She said:

“Stepping out of the court again. I am still struggling with shoulder injury. Although it’s not easy, I now have a few months of intensive training and rehabilitation to get my arm back together. Patience and time are my priorities right now, but I believe it will all be worth it. so hopefully back on the court soon.”

Vondrousova has been plagued by injuries throughout her career, including the injury she sustained in Adelaide earlier this year which forced her to miss the Australian Open. She was playing well too in the last few tournaments and only lost to top players. Hopefully, this break would help her recover fully and play without any pain when she comes back.

The WTA will offer paid maternity leave to female players on the Tour for the first time. This is a groundbreaking step from the governing body and will help many tennis players in the future. More than 320 players will be eligible for up to 12 months paid leave through a new maternity fund. Grants will also be made available for fertility treatment. The maternity programme will be fully funded by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is a global partner of the WTA Tour.

This program empowers women tennis players, by providing the support and flexibility to pursue professional careers and build families. It’s awesome, especially for lower ranked players who can barely make it during their pregnancy.

22-time Grand Slam champion and recently retired tennis legend, Rafael Nadal will appear on former world No.1, Andy Roddick’s “Served With Andy Roddick” tennis podcast. The episode is set to go down on Tuesday, March 11th. The podcast account shared a glimpse from the podcast on X.

Nadal has brought so much joy to tennis and fans all over the world over the last 20 years, and it would be fantastic to watch him discuss many things in depth for the first time since retiring from the Davis Cup last year. Andy Roddick is as good of a podcaster as he was a tennis player. and brings humor, and a candid, unfiltered style to his discussions. He asks smart questions but also knows when to let the conversation flow naturally. One can be assured that the conversation between these two would be engaging.

World No. 11 Mirra Andreeva advanced to the fourth round at the BNP Paribas Open after defeating No. 21 Clara Tauson 6-3, 6-0 on Sunday night. The third-round encounter was a rematch of last month's final at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, which the 17-year-old won 7-6(1), 6-1 to capture her first WTA 1000 title. 

Indian Wells: Draws | Scores | Order of play

With her two wins this week at Indian Wells, Andreeva extended her active win streak to eight matches. She is the youngest player to win eight consecutive WTA 1000 matches since the format was introduced in 2009. Indian Wells is Andreeva's seventh Round of 16 showing at a WTA 1000, the most any player has made before turning 18. 

"I have been playing good recently," Andreeva said. "It just feels that I know exactly what to do on the court. For example, I would say that before on some tournaments, it depends on the match, but now I just know that I go out there, doesn't matter who I play, the ball is coming to me and I know what to do.

"I just feel like everything is clear in my head, and I know exactly what to do with the ball. It's kind of a good feeling, I can say. I hope that I can maintain this for as long as I can."

Andreeva will face 2023 champion and World No. 7 Elena Rybakina in the Round of 16 on Tuesday. Andreeva defeated Rybakina last month en route to the Dubai title. 

With Oscar-nominated Timothee Chalamet and Kylie Jenner in the crowd, Andreeva controlled the baseline from the start to improve to 2-0 over Tauson. The Dane was under pressure from the jump, digging out of a 0-40 deficit in her opening service game to hold to 1-0, but the tour's ace leader struggled to win points behind her vaunted first serve. Tauson won just 55.6 percent of her first serve points and was broken five times. In contrast, Andreeva faced zero break points and won over 70 percent of her service points to seal a tidy 63-minute win.

The victory is Andreeva's 15th of the season, putting her behind only Tauson and Iga Swiatek's tour-leading mark of 16 wins. She is tied with Australian Open champion Madison Keys, No. 4 Jessica Pegula, and her next opponent, Rybakina. 

World No. 9 Zheng Qinwen closed out the night session on Day 5 with a 6-4, 7-5 win over Lulu Sun to make her first Indian Wells Round of 16. Coupled with her straight-set win in the second round over Victoria Azarenka, Indian Wells marks the first time Zheng has secured back-to-back wins this season. She will face 18th seed Marta Kostyuk next.

Jennifer Garner's boyfriend, John Miller, was spotted at her house for the first time since news of Ben Affleck wanting to rekindle a relationship with the 13 Going on 30 actress surfaced. 

The CaliBurger CEO showed up to the standout's Brentwood residence in a New York Yankees T-shirt, boots, and a baseball cap, as seen in photos obtained by Daily Mail, on Sunday (March 9). The outlet referred to the sighting as Miller sending a "clear message" to Affleck that he's not going anywhere. 

Romance rumors between Garner and Affleck, who were together for 10 years before finalizing their divorce in 2018, began to swirl last week after a photo of the former pair embracing was taken during a paintball outing with their 13-year-old son Samuel. In the photo, the Argo star held Garner by her waist, and she did not seem to pull away. A rep for Affleck, who finalized his divorce from Jennifer Lopez in February, revealed that the actor would be interested in reigniting a spark with the Alias alum but respects Miller and realizes that it's not the right time. 

As for Garner, she is happy to maintain a strict co-parenting relationship with her ex and is enjoying her current relationship with Miller. 

"Jen has a great co-parenting relationship with Ben, and that’s where things stand on her end at the moment," a source recently shared. 

Just last month, an insider told Daily Mail how Miller really felt about his girlfriend's connection with her ex.

Andy Cohen is playing coy about Tamra Judge’s future on The Real Housewives of Orange County.

“I got the report of what happened last night,” Cohen, 56, said on the Monday, March 10, episode of SiriusXM’s Radio Andy. “All I will say is this. I can’t comment on what’s going on while we’re filming shows.”

On Sunday, March 9, Judge, 57, seemingly announced she was quitting The Real Housewives of Orange County while filming a cast trip in New Orleans.

“It was a long run!” she wrote via her Instagram Story. “When life gives you real problems this reality s— doesn’t make sense. Peace out … I’m out.”



The next day, Judge posted a selfie from an undisclosed airport with the message, “Mental health is health.” (Us Weekly has reached out to Bravo for comment.)

Cohen was quick to remind listeners that Judge’s close friend, Teddi Mellencamp, is going through a serious health scare, which could have an impact on her outlook on filming season 19.

“I guess the only thing that is at the top of my mind is that one of her best friends, if not her best friend, is going through an incredibly intense health crisis,” he shared. “So maybe keep that in mind, otherwise I really don’t have anything to say on the subject.”

Although Bravo hasn’t confirmed the final cast for the new season, Judge has been spotted in New Orleans with castmates including Shannon Beador, Heather Dubrow, Katie Ginella, Gina Kirschenheiter, Jennifer Pedranti and Emily Simpson.

Gretchen Rossi, who was previously confirmed to return to the Real Housewives of Orange County as a “friend” of the group, was also photographed with the ladies attending the New Orleans Dog Parade.

In the middle of filming season 19, Judge learned Mellencamp, 43, was going to have surgery to remove brain tumors.

While the former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star continues to recover from surgery at home, Judge is vowing not to share any personal updates about her close friend.

“You know, a lot of people are reaching out to me and they want me to get them an update,” Judge said during the February 19 episode of iHeartRadio’s “Two Ts in a Pod” podcast. “It’s not my place. What do you guys want me to do? Do you want me to take pictures from the hospital and post them? I’m not doing that.”

While speaking through tears, Judge added, “All I can do is pray on her and love her like all of her friends are doing. And that’s it.”

Fans first met Judge when she joined The Real Housewives of Orange County for its third season in 2008. The Vena CBD cofounder remained a main cast member on the reality series for 12 seasons until her exit in 2020, but she returned to the show in 2022 for season 17.

The White Lotus has found very creative ways to feature those viral full frontal scenes over the years.

HBO’s hit series, which debuted in 2021, focuses on the guests and employees at a fictional resort as they experience a slew of personal ups and downs while on vacation. The anthology series is also known for featuring a mysterious murder — or two — that is eventually revealed at the end of each season.

The structure has also allowed various characters to strip down on screen. Creator Mike White has previously recalled the trepidation he has faced when it came to directing sex scenes.

“I’m very timid about asking people to undress and get into sexual situations. It’s not my wheelhouse. There were definitely times on this shoot that I was like, ‘What have I got myself into?’ My threshold for awkwardness is very low,” he told NPR in November 2022. “The actors are much more confident and uninhibited than I am. That was new terrain for me. It just felt like it was important because it really is baked into the narrative.”



White was asked about fan reactions to those NSFW moments, saying, “It’s funny, though, how now that the show is airing, how much you realize a graphic sex scene or a sex scene that kind of is titillating for various reasons, does just spike and generate an interest in the populace, for better or worse.”

Keep scrolling for the most unfiltered quotes about those full frontal scenes:

The first season kicked off with Zahn’s character, Mark, stripping down amid a health scare. “I didn’t even have to do that part,” Zahn told The Hollywood Reporter in 2021. “It’s somebody else wearing a prosthetic. That’s about as absurd as it gets, right?”

During season 2, viewers were shocked when Harper (Aubrey Plaza) accidentally snuck a peek at Cameron (Theo James) while he undressed. Although the moment wasn’t a sex scene, the actor opened up about bringing the risqué scene to life.

“The truth of it was you go into these things and you have a conversation with the director and the producers, and they go, ‘OK, for this, we’re going to use a prosthetic, we’re gonna use something,’” James explained during a December 2022 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. “It’s a pee-pee prosthetic.”

James didn’t want the prosthetic to be too “distracting” for the audience. “He needs to be [a] regular Joe because the scene’s not about the pee-pee, it’s about power play in sex [and] whether he did it deliberately or whether it was an accident,” he continued.

As for how true to form the prosthetic was? “I mean, it’s bigger than that. It’s like she stole it off a donkey in the field,” he quipped. “The thing is ginormous.”

The third installment was set in Thailand — and this time it was Schwarzenegger’s character Saxon seen headed to the bathroom while completely nude.

“Yes, that’s my real butt. No stand-in,” he teased to Esquire in February 2025. “Once I read the script, I knew what was coming, but before that, I didn’t.”

Patrick’s father, Arnold Schwarzenegger, also had plenty to say on the matter, writing via Instagram, “I was so pumped to take a break from filming to celebrate @patrickschwarzenegger at the White Lotus Season 3 premiere. What a show! I could claim to be surprised to find out he has a nude scene, but what can I say — the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. Don’t miss it this Sunday — trust me.”

During season 3, Timothy (Isaacs) was spiraling about being sent to prison for money laundering and bribery. He tried to take his mind off the money issues by taking his wife Victoria’s (Parker Posey) anti-anxiety meds, which caused him to accidentally flash his family when his robe pops open.

“Yeah, it is now in my contract for every show I do, so we’ll see,” Isaacs joked to Entertainment Weekly in March 2025. “It’ll get easier, hopefully. He’s drugging himself into a stupor to try not to think about the fact that his entire life is blowing up and trying to work out what to do about it,” he noted. “It was actually quite challenging — I remember reading the scripts thinking, ‘Wow, I’ve got to keep my powder dry for five or six episodes, and then this s–t really kicks off.'”

He continued: “You haven’t seen other things that are coming, but I just remember thinking, ‘I better dig deep and produce something here.’ Because there’s a lot of parts you can go through and tell a very dramatic story without your character going through anything extreme. But there’s some big, old acting coming up.”

Lauren Graham is aware that Gilmore Girls fans want another revival series — but acknowledged it’s not an easy task to accomplish.

“How do you honor those people who have kept [Gilmore Girls] alive?” Graham, 57, asked host Dax Shepard on the Monday, March 10, episode of his “Armchair Expert” podcast. “Is it giving them more? Is it doing what Reese Witherspoon is doing with Legally Blonde, Elle the prequel? Is this a Captain Marvel multiverse where you wanna follow whoever? Or do you try to go back?”

Gilmore Girls ran for seven seasons on the WB from 2000 to 2007. The show starred Graham as Lorelai and Alexis Bledel as her daughter Rory. Nine years after the series finale, the drama was revived for a miniseries on Netflix titled Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. For Graham, coming back to the series after nearly a decade was a rewarding experience.

“For me, it was an incredibly satisfying, beautiful, cried every day experience,” she reflected. “I could mark some growth I felt I had in terms of that character, that time. Working with [creator] Amy [Sherman-Palladino]. It felt different so all the stuff I love about it was the same but it was better and different than a more grown-up version.”



Graham has seemingly thought about how to continue the beloved WB series, since she had an idea of how they can proceed with the narrative.

“I always say — it’s not me trying to get out of the question — it is literally what I could picture given everyone’s lives and schedules is [a] Christmas movie,” she said. “Because that’s what I think the Brits do so well with their beloved shows … You get the Christmas special. It’s not [multiple] episodes but it’s seeing all your friends together again.”

Graham added that the idea of having the cast reunite for a special holiday moment did well when she and costar Scott Patterson — who play Graham’s love interest Luke — joined forces for a WalMart commercial last year. The actress shared that she thought it was “a sweet ‘where are they now?’ thing” for the pair’s characters.”

However, Graham acknowledged that if Gilmore Girls was going to do another revival it faces a challenge, especially with how the Netflix revival ended. (Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ended on a cliffhanger where Rory revealed to Lorelai that she is pregnant.)

“The problem is where we left the characters, well not the problem,” she said. “Now Luke and Lorelai got married, Rory is maybe having a baby. It’s not necessarily going to be the two of us circling the gazebo.”

Graham added that in order for the show to have another life “it just can’t be the same,” which is why she thinks a holiday catchup would be the best bet.

While Graham is grateful that the decision is not in her hands, she said if she gets the call for another revival she’ll “do it.”

George Clooney recently said goodbye to his silver fox locks and hello to a new hair chapter. 

The Ocean's Eleven star, known for his striking salt-and-pepper hair, has officially gone brunette. That's right. Gone are the days of grays as Clooney prepares for his Broadway role as journalist Edward R. Murrow in "Good Night, And Good Luck," per Page Six. 

The standout was seen enjoying lunch at Raoul’s in New York City with wife Amal and attorney Kevin Johnson on Sunday (March 9) afternoon, and fans were quick to point out his new hair color. 

Photos obtained by the outlet show Clooney throwing a backpack into a vehicle and giving the world a first look at his brunette era. The silver screen king is no stranger to "Good Night, and Good Luck," as he starred in the film in 2005. But this time around, instead of playing a supporting role as he did two decades ago, Clooney is taking the lead. 

The 63-year-old actor was not eager to dye his hair and recently told the New York Times that he knew his wife and kids would hate it long before he got it done.

"My wife is going to hate it because nothing makes you look older than when an older guy dyes his hair. My kids are going to just laugh at me nonstop."

Andy Cohen is breaking his silence on what went down last night with RHOC's Tamra Judge.

While speaking on his SiriusXM’s show "Andy Cohen Live," he made a brief comment.

If you didn't see the news, Tamra seemingly quit the show while filming and announced the news on her social media, saying, “It was a long run! When life gives you real problems this reality shit doesn’t make sense. Peace out ✌️ Im out."

Keep reading see Andy Cohen's comment...

Andy responded to the news by saying on the air today, “I got the report of what happened last night. All I will say is this, I can’t comment on what’s going on, in you know while we’re filming shows. I guess the only thing that, the thing that is at the top of my mind is that one of her best friends, if not her best friend, is going through an incredibly intense health crisis. So maybe keep that in mind, otherwise I really don’t have anything to say on the subject.”

The best friend Andy is referring to is seemingly Teddi Mellencamp, who underwent emergency brain surgery after tumors were found. Our continued thoughts are with Teddi and her loved ones, including Tamra.

Kate Hudson and Chet Hanks go way back.

“[Hudson’s family] lives five minutes away from my parents, and Kate used to have these awesome parties at her house where she would invite a bunch of people and play games, specifically Mafia,” Chet, 34, told Bustle in an interview published on Monday, March 10.

This is hardly the first time Hudson’s famous Mafia parties have made headlines. The actress spoke about her star-studded get togethers in 2022 during the Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery press tour.

For Chet, however, knowing Hudson via her epic game nights allowed their relationship to eventually translate on screen.



“It makes it easier when you already have a rapport with someone,” he told Bustle. Chet stars as basketball star Travis Bugg alongside Hudson’s Isla Gordon in Netflix’s Running Point, which premiered late last month.

The actor noted during Monday’s interview that he was shocked that the show’s creators, including Mindy Kaling, didn’t have him in mind when writing the part — mostly because of their similarities.

“It was the character description: Travis is the white point guard. He’s covered in tattoos. He’s a wannabe rapper, but he’s a huge liability because of the controversial s— he posts on social media,” Chet recalled. “I literally said to myself, ‘If I don’t get this role, I should just quit.’”

Chet is the famous eldest son of Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson. The couple are also parents to 29-year-old actor Truman Hanks. (Tom, 68, is also a father to son Colin, 47, and daughter Elizabeth, 42, whom he welcomed with late ex-wife Samantha Lewes.)

“My dad’s an actor. My older brother’s an actor. My mom. This was the family business,” he added. “So I [knew] that was something I would go into at some point.”

What he didn’t expect was to be dubbed Tom and Wilson’s controversial son. Chet went viral in 2020 for putting on a fake Jamaican accent on the Golden Globes red carpet and releasing the song “White Boy Summer” the following year. Chet admitted that people were “perplexed” by his actions at the time and acknowledged the “long road” to find success — even with a famous family. (Chet has been sober since 2015, after checking into a rehab for a cocaine addiction.)

“It’s been blood, sweat, and tears, and I don’t take any of it for granted,” he added. “Fortune favors the bold and I just want to keep doing it all.”

Kelsey Grammer is hopeful that Frasier will be revived again — but he isn’t interested in bringing the show back on Paramount+.

“There’s a better home for it,” Grammer, 70, told The New York Post on Thursday, March 6. “I think they gave it sort of a good try, but they weren’t particularly passionate about the project. I mean, obviously, they didn’t really promote or spend much time on it.”

Grammer didn’t rule out another return, adding, “We’ll end up somewhere where people are passionate about it … Listen, it’s got a huge audience, a big following, and if people know where to find it, I think they will.”

The original Frasier series, which aired from 1993 to 2004, served as a spinoff of the hit sitcom Cheers. It followed psychiatrist Frasier Crane (Grammer) as he returned to his hometown of Seattle as a radio show host while reconnecting with his family.



Paramount+ revived the show in 2023 with stars Grammer, Jack Cutmore-Scott, Nicholas Lyndhurst, Toks Olagundoye, Jess Salgueiro and Anders Keith. Grammer told Variety at the time that he wanted a “sillier” version of the famous sitcom.

“There’s enough groundwork laid between these human beings,” he said about hoping to do “another 100 episodes” at least. “They are wonderful characters. I want to see where they go. And I want to see what happens to Frasier.”

The revival was ultimately canceled earlier this year. Despite Frasier not returning to Paramount+, Grammer wants a future installment to feature his former Cheers costar Ted Danson.

“Ted and I might actually visit something together, we’ve been talking about it,” Grammer teased. “A couple ideas, maybe on Frasier. We don’t know, but there is still certainly something, some fields to be mined there, in terms of that relationship, as long as it’s still a relevant relationship it’s still relevant for the show.”

The duo costarred on Cheers before reuniting on Frasier. A potential collaboration between Grammer and Danson, 77, wouldn’t feature Cheers, with Grammer adding on Thursday, “[It] will not come back, [cocreator] Jimmy Burrows has always said, ‘No, that bar doesn’t exist anymore.'”

Grammer also addressed his fallout with Danson, which they discussed on Danson’s “Where Everybody Knows Your Name” podcast late last year.

“It got a little blown out of proportion. It really wasn’t an argument. It was at a time in my life when I was actually going through a lot of self-doubt, self-loathing, honestly,” Grammer explained at the time. “It was when I was drinking a lot. Ted had just come up and said, ‘You know, I’m kind of mad at you that sometimes you don’t show up ready to go.'”

He added: “Maybe what happened for Ted was, he stepped away from what might have been a better friendship. Maybe he had to protect himself.”

Fraiser is currently streaming on Paramount+.

 Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

Brian Litterell's son is following in his dad's footsteps as he has embarked on a music career — and fans are weighing in.

On Sunday, March 9, the Backstreet Boys member's 22-year-old son Baylee appeared as a contestant on American Idol.

When Baylee stood before the three judges — Carrie Underwood, Lionel Richie, and Luke Bryan — he revealed who his dad was after Underwood quipped, "There's something about you that looks familiar."

Baylee chose to perform an original song that was met with positive feedback from the judges. The musical powerhouses then invited the "Shape of My Heart" musician, 50, into the room to sing with his son.

Most fans seemed to be wowed by Baylee's audition, gushing about his talent in the comment section of American Idol's Instagram post showcasing photos of the viral audition.

"Incredible!!!! And so good to see a little harmonizing with his dad!!🤩🤩," an individual commented.

"Congratulations Baylee 👏 you sounded amazing! Musical talent definitely runs in the family 🔥," someone else wrote.

A third person commented, "OMG! I enjoyed watching this❤️like father like son😍🙌."

A post shared by Ryan Seacrest (@ryanseacrest)

However, a few people stated they felt Baylee made it through just based on who his father is.

One person wrote, "✨nepotism✨ 😂😂😂😂."

"The only thing is, how is it fair? His father is in a very popular band," a separate person noted. "Well, these other people are coming on to come on and they're from a waitress background or there another kid just starting to sing when this one has his father in the business and he's already released albums."

Baylee admitted it was daunting to pursue music because of his dad's remarkable success in the business.

"I believe I get my voice from Dad, and hopefully, I can do him justice today. I guess you could say music runs in our family," he told the camera before going in for his audition. "Following in my dad's footsteps is scary because his career, to me, is one of the most extraordinary in music history. No one can ever compare."

Brian spoke about his son before he went in for the audition, saying that while people think it's easier to be born into this industry, it still comes with challenges.

"Obviously, growing up in the industry, a lot of people would look at that as a perk, but it's not easy," he remarked. "I've always told everybody that he's 10 times more talented than I ever was."

Baylee received a "yes" from all three judges so is headed to the next round.

Catch American Idol on ABC on Sundays at 8 p.m. ET.

CBS has made a decision about the fate of The Neighborhood.

The news is bittersweet: the series has been renewed, but for one final season. It will come to an end after season 8 airs in 2025-2026.

“The brilliant cast and creative team at The Neighborhood led by the incomparable Cedric the Entertainer have brought levity, laughter and poignant storylines to Monday nights for seven incredible seasons,” Amy Reisenbach, president of CBS Entertainment, shared in a statement. “The Neighborhood is a strong ratings performer for CBS and one of the top comedies on TV. We believe the show’s loyal fans deserve a proper farewell season full of the trademark humor and heartfelt moments that are synonymous with the series.” 

CBS canceled two huge fan favorites recently, and another show will also be ending.

Alex Warren is bringing his song "Ordinary" to Netflix's Love Is Blind!

The 24-year-old singer-songwriter performed the track during the highly anticipated Love Is Blind Season 8 reunion episode that premiered on Sunday (March 9), making him the first-ever performer on the show.

The song has become a global hit, garnering 81.5 million cumulative streams, as well as climbing to No. 38 on the Spotify Global Chart and landing on the Billboard Hot 100. Plus, it went Top 10 in the UK Official Songs Chart and secured the No. 1 spot in Norway and No. 2 in The Netherlands.

“Ordinary” sees Warren expressing his heartfelt belief that even angels are jealous of him and his wife, 24-year-old TikTok star and influencer Kouvr Annon, and their deeply felt love, and how while "too many people lose interest in finding 'The One,' he finds peace in having been lucky enough to find this picture-perfect kind of connection," per an official release.

The couple first met on Snapchat in 2018, when he messaged her friend saying that he thought the YouTube star was cute. They tied the knot in 2024 in a romantic garden wedding.

Vicky Kaushal's film Chhaava is running in theatres and has earned a lot since its release. However, on Sunday, the film did not perform as expected from the film on the weekend. Seems like the film was affected by the final match of the Champions Trophy, which is being played today between India and New Zealand. The match started at 2:30 and ended at around 10:20, with India lifting the ICC trophy. The film based on Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was seemingly affected by the cricket match with evening and afternoon shows. 


Chhaava box office collection

The earnings of films running in theatres usually increase on weekends. It is obvious that on Saturday and Sunday holidays, people go to theatres with their families. On top of that, when it comes to 'Chhaava', the expectations are higher because this film is performing so well on weekdays. But this Sunday, the film earned less than expected. 

Business was this low compared to Saturday

The film Chhaava, starring stars like Vicky Kaushal, Rashmika Mandanna and Akshaye Khanna, collected Rs 16.75 crore yesterday on the 23rd day, Saturday. On Sunday, the 24th day, the film collected only Rs 8.38 crore. The total net collection of the film Chhaava at the domestic box office has now become Rs 517.43 crore and the film has achieved the title of a blockbuster. 

Chhaava budget and crew

Vicky Kaushal's film was reportedly made with a budget of Rs 130–140 crore. It has already entered the 500 crore club and with no big release till Salman Khan's Sikandar release (March 28), the period drama is expected to rule the box office. 

For the unversed, Chhaava is produced by Dinesh Vijan's Maddock Films and is directed by Lakshman Utekar. This was Vicky Kaushal's second film with the director after 2023's Zara Hatke Zara Bachke. Apart from the lead actors, supporting cast like Vineet Kumar Singh and Ashutosh Rana have also played important roles in the Bollywood film.

Yes! During an interview, Keerthy revealed that she met her now husband in school when he was 7 years older than her. Moreover, the couple dated for 15 years before tying the knot. They even endured 5 years of long-distance relationship before becoming one. 

Who is Anthony Thattil?

For those who don't know, Anthony is a businessman from Kochi, Kerala, who now resides in Dubai. In addition to running a few companies registered in Keerthy's homeland of Chennai, he owns a well-known chain of resorts in his hometown. Even though Antony is wealthy and successful, he prefers to live a quiet life away from the limelight. The newlyweds have known each other for years. Moreover, they studied together in school and later started dating. Keerthy and Anthony have tied the knot after 15 years of togetherness in Goa.

On the work front

Talking about work, South actress Keerthy was last seen in the film Baby John. Apart from Keerthi Suresh, Varun Dhawan, Zara Jyana, Wamiqa Gabbi, Jackie Shroff and Rajpal Yadav have also played lead roles in the film. Baby John was the Hindi remake of Atlee's 2016 Tamil film Theri. The film is directed by Kalij and produced by Atlee. Keerthy will next be seen in Revolver Rita and Akka. Both films are scheduled for release this year.

Ben Affleck struggled with the action sequences in The Accountant 2.

The 52-year-old actor has reprised his role as Christian Wolff in the sequel to the 2016 blockbuster which will see him team up with his estranged but highly lethal brother (Jon Bernthal) to track down mysterious assassins but admitted that the shooting the stunt scenes "did not come easy" to him.

He told AccessHollywood: "It did not come easy for me, especially with a guy like Jon [Bernthal] who's so spectacular at it. Cynthia [Addai-Robinson] did an incredible job, Daniella [Pineda] is super bada** in the movie, so I was just trying to keep up.

"Gavin [O'Connor, director] does a great thing with action sequences — which is really, they're not just action for its own sake.

"I don't think it's interesting just to see people shooting or a car flipping over or something blowing up just by itself."

The Academy Award-winning star feels as if "anybody could go to enjoy" the film and is "very proud" of how it has turned out.

He said: "This is a movie where you really care about the people that are involved, and it's got an intelligence and a bit of humour and pathos to it. It's just a whole complete package. I really feel like this is a movie that anybody could go to enjoy.

"I'm really proud of it. It's a really interesting set of characters. There are great performances in it, and I feel very confident saying, go see this movie. You won't be disappointed. See it in theatres — I really think you'll love it."

Director Gavin O'Connor recently revealed how the movie almost didn't happen because of "musical chairs" behind the scenes.

He told ScreenRant: "I think there was a bit of a revolving door and musical chairs going on at Warner Brothers. We made the deal to write the next movie in 2018, and it was just, I don't know, whatever dysfunction goes on in studios these days.

"I don't know if there were complications with Warner Brothers and Artists Equity doing a co-studio kind of deal-I'm not really sure exactly what happened with all that-but we just could never get it going over there.

"Once Ben had his studio, we were like, 'If you're not going to make it, don't hijack it and not allow us to go pursue this film we've been trying to make now for eight years'."

The Accountant 2 is in cinemas from April 25.

"It was definitely slow… learning how to walk again and getting back… on the treadmill," Vassar remarked.

"They brought a piano in my room at rehab and I just sat and looked at it for a while… they said, I just started playing… it kind of came back, and I was very, very, glad to have that happen."

Vassar's medical emergency occurred in 2023 during a Christmas tour with Deana Carter. First responders shocked him 11 times and "cracked some ribs" in the process.

"The lifesaving crew, these guys… what they do is just amazing," Vassar praised the medical team. "They could have given up… but they just kept going. They blasted me back to life."

"I wish I could tell you more about it, but I don't know," he explained to Fox News Digital. "I just remember I wasn't feeling well and… just something wasn't right."

The life-altering experience came as a big surprise because the country star lived a healthy lifestyle. However, after his heart attack, Vassar decided to switch up his fitness routine.

"I'm just getting back into the working out. Do more bike riding and walking, get into the weight room a little bit," he said. "But I really thought I was in shape. I just didn't feel well. I had 3% body fat when I dropped dead."

Vassar went into cardiac arrest after he discovered he had a genetic heart disease.

On his intense road to recovery, Vassar was in rehab for more than a year. He said that with plenty of exercise and hyperbaric chamber treatments, he was able to "heal quicker."
