Numerous rivers are still in major flood stage, and there’s widespread beach erosion. An estimated 10 to 15 inches fell around Brisbane and on Moreton Island during the storm. Sydney only saw an inch or two in most of its suburbs. It was upgraded to a tropical storm two days later, and began quickly intensifying. A named storm hasn’t passed this close to Brisbane — the country’s third-largest city, with 2.7 million people — since Zoe in 1974.</p>

Ahead of Rubio’s arrival in Jeddah, U.S. officials said they were pleased at the high-level delegation Zelensky chose to send. Rubio will be joined by White House national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff. He said both sides would have to accept concessions but that the first objective for U.S. officials was understanding Ukraine’s position. On Sunday, when asked whether he would consider lifting the intelligence pause, Trump said “we just about have. “The pause in aid broadly is something I hope we can resolve, obviously what happens tomorrow will be key to that,” Rubio added.</p>

Donald Trump’s brinkmanship and stop-start approach to tariffs rattle investors Shares on Wall Street fell sharply on Monday as investors bet the president’s unpredictable tariff trade war and handling of the economy would hit growth, amid a recent plunge in business and consumer confidence. Economists said the risks of a “Trumpcession” had increased as the president’s brinkmanship and stop-start approach to tariffs rattled global investors, exemplified by last week’s decision to pause US tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico for the second time in as many months. Wall Street economists have downgraded their growth forecasts for the US, warning that Trump’s trade wars are proving more damaging for the US economy than first anticipated. “While we did expect growth-constraining policies (tariffs and immigration controls) to precede growth-supportive initiatives (tax cuts and deregulation), their severity has been greater than we anticipated.</p>

Donald Trump’s focus on tariffs as an economic weapon is “misguided”, and the US economy is “very wobbly”, a former adviser and longtime supporter of the president said. In 2019, Trump picked Moore for a seat on the Federal Reserve board. Trump and key allies insist the US economy is strong and that imposing tariffs on erstwhile allies such as Canada and Mexico as well as competitors like China is right – notwithstanding Trump’s own warning to Fox News on Sunday, in which he said the US “may” go into recession. In March 2024, after what turned out to be Joe Biden’s last State of the Union address, Moore told Fox Business: “Let me just say one thing positive about where we are right now. “If you look at what’s happening in Europe today, Germany, Britain, France, if you look at Japan and China, they’re not growing.</p>

Donald Tusk, Poland’s prime minister, has called on “friends” to respect their allies and not be arrogant in a post on X that mentioned nobody by name but was published a day after an extraordinary social media spat between top officials in the US and Poland over Starlink satellites. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, accused Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, of “making things up” and suggested on Sunday he was ungrateful, in a strong rebuke after Sikorski said Ukraine may need an alternative to Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite service if it becomes unreliable. Rubio had also said that “no one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink”. Sikorski had been told to “be quiet” and labelled a “small man” by Musk after he suggested that Poland, which says it pays $50m a year for Ukraine’s Starlink services, may need to find another provider if Musk’s service was deemed unreliable. The US government has already revoked some access to satellite imagery for Ukraine and paused intelligence sharing, piling pressure on Kyiv as Trump seeks a swift end to the war, which is now in its fourth year after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p>

Drawing on his record as a monetary policy expert, Carney said that although some variables were beyond Canada’s control — such as who occupies the White House — Canada was still master of its own destiny. Carney led two of the world’s largest central banks during particularly difficult times, which earned him a reputation as “fixer” that he has wrapped into his pitch to Canadian voters.

The results could help scientists design better reactors for water recovery, thermal management, fuel cells and other applications.

Rigd Gasser, father of 14-year-old Ahmad Rashid Jazar, said his son was hit in the chest by a single bullet on 19 January while leaving a shop in his home village of Sebastia, where he had been on an errand to get bread. All he could do was wrap her shattered body and take it to the hospital morgue. The children could not go school that morning because Israeli forces had launched a raid near their village, Tammun, and so roads were closed, Hamza’s mother, Eman Basharat, said. Israeli soldiers arrived soon after and took away all three bodies for several hours, before returning the children to their grieving families without explanation. Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has said Palestinians in the West Bank should know that “if they continue with terrorism … their fate will be like Gaza”.</p>

Boebert added:“For him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent.” Green, 77, said he heckled the president as a way of standing up “for those who need Medicaid, Medicare and social security”. Democrats would never abandon the fight to make sure every American has a safe, healthy, and financially secure life,” Green said.

Canada and Mexico have held talks with the Trump administration to stave off tariffs, but China has embarked on a tit-for-tat approach. “Beijing likely wants to avoid more instability and unpredictability in the U.S.-China relationship that could have unforeseen consequences for Chinese interests,” she said. But despite these measures, China has relatively few cards to play given that it runs an enormous trade surplus — approaching $300 billion last year — with the United States. There are more pet lovers in China today than when Tian started out three decades ago, but the United States remains his top target market. Alex Zhu, who sells soft toys to major American brands, said the 20 percent duties have all but wiped out profits for his confirmed orders, putting 3,000 employees at risk.</p>

The measure also provides additional funding for immigration enforcement, deportations and veterans’ healthcare, and it could grant Trump expanded authority to redirect funds between programs at his discretion – which is a no-go for most Democrats who worry it could enable the administration’s reshaping of federal priorities without congressional approval. Congressman Thomas Massie has declared his opposition, while House representatives Tony Gonzales, Brian Fitzpatrick and Cory Mills remain undecided. However, Trump’s support appears to have shifted the dynamic for his most ardent backers. Democratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said his side of the aisle is unwavering in its disapproval, saying he expects “that Republicans are going it alone”. Swing state Democratic senator Elissa Slotkin, however, told NBC News on Sunday she would be withholding her vote “until I see some assurances that whatever we pass … is going to ensure that the money is spent the way Congress intends”.</p>

Shares in FTSE 250 company fall by a fifth as geopolitical turmoil pushes down freight rates The world’s biggest ship broker has said that geopolitical turmoil from war and Donald Trump’s tearing up of US foreign policy have hurt its revenues, sending its share price tumbling by almost a fifth on Monday. Andi Case, the chief executive, said: “2025 has started with more uncertainty than most due to political change, ongoing regional conflicts, increased trade tensions, tariffs and sanctions, inflation and changing monetary policy across global economies.” That means some disruptions to global shipping can benefit it, such as attacks by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen in late 2023 and early 2024. It raised its dividend for 2024 to 109p a share, an increase of 7% compared with 2023.</p>

SAN JUAN ALOTENANGO, Guatemala (AP) — Guatemala’s Volcano of Fire is erupting, and authorities have evacuated nearly 300 families while warning that another 30,000 people in the area could be at risk. Claudinne Ugalde, secretary of the disaster agency, said “some 30,000 people more or less are at risk in these three (jurisdictions) and we are trying to have them evacuate or self-evacuate,” she said. Isaac García, 43, a resident of El Porvenir on the slopes of the volcano, had that tragedy in mind when he and his family decided to heed authorities’ warnings to evacuate early Monday. He came to a shelter opened in San Juan Alotenango with his mother, wife and their three children, as well as other relatives.

PARIS (AP) — Military officials from more than 30 nations will take part in Paris talks on the creation of an international security force for Ukraine, a French military official said Monday. Such an international force would aim to dissuade Russia from launching another offensive after any ceasefire in Ukraine comes into effect. It could include heavy weaponry and weapons stockpiles that could be rushed within hours or days to aid in Ukraine’s defense in the event of a Russian attack that shatters any truce, the official said. “It’s not, ‘This is what we need,’” the official said. Also attending will be the chiefs of staff of Ireland and Cyprus and a representative from Austria — all nations that are not NATO members but are in the European Union.</p>

Although the toxin can naturally leave an animal’s system over time, repeated exposure results in more severe and lasting effects. If sea lions receive care before any serious damage occurs, veterinarians can help flush the toxin from their system by administering fluids and providing domoic acid-free fish. She suggested that changes in nutrient supply, possibly propelled by global climate change, could be having ripple effects on the ecosystem. On Thursday, the MMCC reminded beachgoers in an Instagram post not to approach stranded marine mammals. Anderson said predicting domoic acid events is more complex than it looks, not only because it’s hard to forecast when the organism will bloom and produce toxins, but also because the impact on animals varies.</p>

Two US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have reportedly outlined Washington’s expectations ahead of high-level talks with a Ukrainian delegation set to convene in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. The other stressed Trump’s desire for a “realistic peace,” stating, “If they [Ukrainians] are only interested in 2014 or 2022 borders, that tells you something.” In 2014, Crimea voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia following a Western-backed armed coup in Kiev, while two eastern regions declared independence, also rejecting the new authorities. Kiev claims sovereignty over all former Ukrainian lands, insisting that the votes were “a sham” and not genuine displays of self-determination by disenfranchised citizens. They have pledged to guarantee long-term Ukrainian security, contingent on a ceasefire with Moscow and continued US support.</p>

Graham has criticized the recent pause in intelligence sharing and weapons transfers to Ukraine, arguing that stopping US assistance would have serious consequences. The Republican also reiterated his criticism of Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky, saying he “blew it” during his recent White House meeting with Trump, where he was accused of disrespecting the Oval Office and “gambling with World War III” by refusing to seek peace. However, Reuters later reported that Washington is also exploring ways to ease some restrictions on Russia’s energy sector as part of a broader peace initiative. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly stated that Moscow remains open to negotiations but insists any settlement must guarantee long-term security for Russia.</p>

Romanian presidential hopeful Calin Georgescu has said he will appeal against the decision by the country’s Central Electoral Bureau (BEC) to bar him from taking part in a new election in May, Reuters has claimed citing one of his advisers. The BEC dismissed Georgescu’s candidacy on Sunday, citing more than 1,000 challenges filed against him. Georgescu scored an unexpected win in November’s presidential election first round, receiving 23% of the vote. The firm presumably tried to derail another candidate, but accidentally boosted Georgescu instead. Last month, Georgescu was indicted on six criminal charges, including allegedly plotting “anti-constitutional acts” and “promoting fascist, racist, or xenophobic ideologies.” He has denied all the charges, insisting the criminal case against him was part of a campaign orchestrated by the Romanian “deep state.”</p>

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will discuss a resolution to the three-year conflict with a Ukrainian delegation headed by Andrey Yermak. Zelensky’s presidential term officially expired in May 2024 as he refused to hold a new election, citing martial law imposed during the conflict with Russia. Zelensky demanded security guarantees from the US, ruled out talks with Moscow and claimed that Vance could not have known anything about Ukraine’s problems due to never having visited the country. After the argument, Trump accused his guest of not wanting peace with Moscow and being ungrateful for billions assistance which Washington has provided to his country during the conflict. Trump said last week that he was “finding it more difficult... to deal with Ukraine” than with Russia when it comes to negotiating the settlement of the conflict.</p>

Enoch Burke, formerly a teacher of history and German at Wilson’s Hospital School in County Westmeath, has been at the center of a prolonged legal and ethical dispute since 2022. If approved, the move would enable authorities to collect €79,100 – an amount he has accrued through daily €700 fines for showing up at Wilson’s Hospital School in defiance of court orders to stay away. To date, he has spent a total of 512 days in jail across three separate periods for defying court orders. Recently, Justice David Nolan doubled Burke’s daily fine to €1,400 after it was revealed that he had entered the school through a student entrance and attempted to join a school assembly.</p>

Donald Trump’s withdrawal of US overseas aid will almost decimate global climate finance from the developed world, data shows, with potentially devastating impacts on vulnerable nations. “Now is the moment for wealthy nations to rise above politics and show real leadership. Trump’s newly formed “department of government efficiency”, headed by Elon Musk, has been firing USAid staff and ending shipments. This time, it is likely to fall further under the onslaught on all forms of government spending. We must hold them accountable and ensure they contribute their fair share towards global climate reparations.”</p>

In a video on Facebook, Georgescu added: “We go all the way for the same values: peace, democracy, freedom.” He urged his supporters, who clashed with police on Sunday night, to refrain from violent protests. The promotion of fascist leaders and Nazi, racist or xenophobic symbols is banned under Romanian law. Sergiu Miscoiu, a professor of political science at Babes-Bolyai University, said he believed that even if the US “reacts badly”, it would be riskier to let Georgescu run than to bar him since his victory could derail Romania’s pro-western orientation. Lasconi, 52, who has previously called on prosecutors to provide their evidence against Georgescu, said in a statement that the election bureau – which has said only that his candidacy would be “unacceptable” – must provide its reasoning as soon as possible. “Decisions must be explained,” she said, “otherwise people will become furious, suspicious and prone to conspiracies.”</p>

The Myanmar military’s promise to hold elections in December 2025 or January 2026 has been condemned as a “sham” that risks bringing even greater violence. However, most western countries and election watchdogs are highly unlikely to view the vote as credible. Opposition parties are mostly either banned from contesting or boycott elections, while almost 22,000 political prisoners remain in detention, according to a local monitoring group, including Aung San Suu Kyi, whose government was ousted in 2021. Its territorial losses have been so severe that it was only able to conduct a full census, designed to prepare voter lists, in less than half (145) of the country’s 330 townships. “We can see already preparation for the election has involved a sharp spike in violence – 2024 saw more airstrikes than 2021, 2022 and 2023 combined.</p>

Thirty-six people have been brought ashore after a cargo vessel collided with an oil tanker off the East Yorkshire coast Dr Mark Hartl, associate professor of marine biology at Herriot Watt University, explains that sodium cyanide is very soluble in water and can be toxic because it interferes with the respiration of animals, and if the sodium cyanide is heated up it can generate a toxic gas. Independent maritime safety consultant David Mcfarlane tells BBC News that more will become clear once investigators can get on board the vessels and recover data recorders. They have also scheduled a meeting with partner rescue group and will be closed for the rest of Monday to work on preparation. As we've been reporting, an oil tanker involved in the collision with a cargo vessel off East Yorkshire's coast is on fire.</p>

Smoke rises from a factory hit during clashes by Syrian security forces and gunmen loyal to former President Bashar Assad in the outskirts of Latakia, Syria, Friday, March 7, 2025. The Defense Ministry’s announcement comes after a surprise attack by gunmen from the Alawite community on a police patrol near the port city of Lattakia Thursday spiraled into widespread clashes across Syria’s coastal region, during which monitoring groups said hundreds of civilians were killed. “If you return, we will also return, and you will find before you men who do not know how to retreat and who will not have mercy on those whose hands are stained with the blood of the innocent.” Though the government’s counter-offensive was able to largely contain the insurgency, footage surfaced of what appeared to be retaliatory attacks targeting the broader minority Alawite community, an offshoot of Shia Islam whose adherents live mainly in Syria’s western coastal region. Thousands of Syrians from the coastal area fled to neighboring Lebanon, mostly through unofficial crossings.</p>

Elon Musk-run X went down on Monday in a massive global outage, including in India, as users were unable to access the micro-blogging platform. It, however, started to work for some users after facing at least a 30-40 minute outage during the day. DownDetector reported a huge spike, with users rushing to lodge their complaints about the social media site on other platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Recently, the tech billionaire raised prices of its top-tier subscription service (Premium+) for his X social media platform by a massive 35 per cent for both new and existing users in India, including across global markets.

Several users complained about not being able to load pages and refresh the timelines. “Twitter went down for an hour but seems to be okay now?" However, the X services resumed shortly after suffering a global outage. In March 2023 the social media platform then known as Twitter experienced a bevy of glitches for over an hour as links stopped working, some users were unable to log in and images were not loading for others. Elon Musk took over Twitter in 2022 and later renamed it as X.</p>

Government cost-cutting measures come ahead of an expected push to extend Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which overwhelmingly enriched the wealthy. Although it most often affects older adults, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not consider Alzheimer’s a normal part of aging. But a secondary layer of peer review called advisory councils remains delayed, gumming up grant renewals, with more chaos on the horizon. Alzheimer’s research is also threatened by an executive order targeting diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The change has private industry, researchers and institutions bracing for a more secretive department – even as health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s promised “radical transparency” in his confirmation hearing.</p>

Donald Trump’s US attorney general Pam Bondi – long an ally of the president – has moved fast to halt enforcement actions for six months under the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that bars bribes by US businesses to win overseas deals, which some American firms have long charged gives certain foreign firms a competitive edge. In another fast foreign shift at the DoJ, a Bondi memo last month indicated that two units aimed at fighting kleptocracy – including some major Russian oligarchs – were being disbanded with some lawyers redeployed to focus on new priorities involving fighting drug cartels and transnational crime. The president and Bondi, a former Florida AG who helped defend Trump during his first impeachment, have championed these moves as part of a strategic shift at the DoJ to boost other Trump priorities and ones they claim are good for business. “It makes no sense to treat kleptocracy and drug trafficking as if they were in separate silos,” said Stefan Cassella, an ex-federal prosecutor who now runs Asset Forfeiture Law. “Pam Bondi arrived and instantly closed its anti-kleptocracy work that had successfully targeted Putin’s Russian oligarchs,” said Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.</p>

Former central banker Mark Carney is set to become Canada’s next prime minister after succeeding Justin Trudeau as leader of the governing Liberal Party. Mark Carney was appointed Liberal leader after Justin Trudeau resigned, following plummeting popularity levels and criticism from his own ministers. He used his first speech to take a defiant stance against threats from US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly suggested that Canada could become the "51st state". “We didn’t ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,” Carney said.

The statement comes ahead of negotiations between American and Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

The recent failed negotiations between Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky and US President Donald Trump mark a significant break from past patterns. Most of Ukraine’s military supplies, financial aid, communications, and intelligence assistance have been provided by the US. As a result, Ukraine has become an even more vulnerable, dependent, and peripheral state than it had been before. While collaboration with the West has opened many doors for ordinary Ukrainians – making it relatively easy for them to find jobs in EU countries or study at Western universities – this model risks becoming colonial in nature, exacerbating the brain drain as skilled workers continue to leave. Should Kiev maintain its current foreign policy course, any potential ceasefire could merely serve as a temporary respite.</p>

BEIJING -China will exert utmost efforts to realise "peaceful reunification" with Taiwan, but will take all necessary steps to safeguard China's territorial integrity, its foreign ministry said on Monday. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te says only Taiwan's people can decide their future. Last week, on the sidelines of China's annual meeting of parliament, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters that Taiwan would never be a "country", and to support "Taiwan independence" was to interfere in China's internal affairs. In recent years, Beijing has ramped up its military pressure against the island, including holding several rounds of war games, keeping alive the prospect of the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.

The two Koreas remain technically at war since their 1950-1953 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. In its statement on Monday, North Korea's foreign ministry dubbed the exercises "an aggressive and confrontational war rehearsal".

Sharaa, who is Syrian and was once affiliated with al-Qaeda, rose through the ranks of insurgents. It was his rebel group, Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham, that led the operation to oust Assad in December.

“It is with a very heavy heart that my wife and I would like to inform you of the passing of our son, The POLG Foundation Founder and Creative Director, Frederik,” his father, Prince Robert of Luxembourg, revealed via the POLG Foundation website. The disease in question that claimed his life is believed to have a wide range of symptoms and affects many different organ systems, which makes it extremely difficult to diagnose and treat. Ultimately, inherited mutations in those genes compromise the mitochondria DNA’s replication. Depending on when the disease emerges, its symptoms range from mild to severe, including ophthalmoplegia, muscle weakness, epilepsy and liver failure. “As is the case for 300 million people like Frederik worldwide, these diseases are usually hard to recognise even by physicians, and patients’ families may never know what they are suffering from as they may only be identified very late in their progression,” Prince Frederik wrote.</p>

Two British diplomats have had their accreditation revoked in Russia after engaging in espionage activities, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has said. In a statement on Monday, the agency said its operatives had “discovered an undeclared intelligence presence” at the UK Embassy in Moscow. Two British diplomats were found to have been “carrying out intelligence and subversive work that threatens Russia’s security,” the statement alleged. “The FSB will continue to counter intelligence and subversive activities of foreign intelligence services using all available means,” the statement read. In November, the FSB announced the expulsion of a British diplomat for “conducting intelligence and subversive work” and intentionally providing false information when entering Russia.</p>

Punjab Police have arrested Shehnaz Singh, also known as Shawn Bhinder, an international drug trafficker wanted by the FBI for his role in a global narcotics network. Singh smuggled cocaine from Colombia into the United States and Canada. During that operation, US authorities seized a big cache of drugs and weapons, including 391 kilograms of methamphetamine, 109 kilograms of cocaine, and four firearms from multiple residences and vehicles linked to the syndicate. Following the US crackdown, Singh fled to India, where Punjab Police launched a search to locate him before arresting him. We remain committed to working with international law enforcement agencies to ensure that Punjab is not a safe haven for drug smugglers and criminals," said Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) Gaurav Yadav.</p>

According to SIPRI data, Russian arms exports have fallen sharply, dropping by 64 percent in the most recent five-year period.

Almost 1,000 civilians have been killed and hundreds more injured in military drone attacks across Africa as the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles continues unchecked on the continent, according to a report. At least 50 separate deadly strikes by armed forces in Africa have been confirmed during the three years up to November 2024, with analysts describing a “striking pattern of civilian harm” with little or no accountability. Most armed drones in Africa are imported from Turkey, along with China and Iran, with researchers sounding the alarm over the growing popularity of “medium altitude, long endurance” (MALE) drones. State-sponsored media regularly celebrated “neutralisations” of terrorists using what it described as sophisticated, precise drone technologies. However, accounts from sources on the ground often yield a different narrative, pointing to frequently high civilian deaths.</p>

The onslaught of legal challenges to President Donald Trump's early actions brought by federal workers and advocacy groups have found their way into mostly friendly courts, overseen, for the most part, by sympathetic judges. That’s because the Supreme Court hears an average of less than 100 cases annually, according to federal judiciary data. As president, Trump "is exercising Article II power to take care that our federal laws are faithfully executed," Mike Davis, the founder and president of the Article III Project, or A3P, told Fox News Digital in an interview. It's a strategy both Republican and Democrat plaintiffs have used with increasing regularity. Davis, for his part, told Fox News that his organization, A3P, is currently working with the Senate Judiciary Committee to draft legislation to end the flurry of temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions that have come before single judges.</p>

In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. "Many beneficiaries may not be aware of an overpayment and could suddenly find themselves without a check." While on the campaign trail, President Trump vowed not to touch Social Security, a promise he repeated Sunday on Fox News, although he added that his administration wants to root out "fraud" from the benefit system.

One series of electrical pulses could travel through a chip's transistors, creating various 1s and 0s along the way. See, because qubits exist at such a small scale, they're incredibly susceptible to interference from the outside world.

A group comprised of Heathrow’s biggest airlines in February submitted their objections to the UK aviation regulator. They argue the airport’s monopolistic structure has led to expensive landing charges, inadequate investment in infrastructure and a subpar passenger experience. The campaign estimates passengers and airlines are paying £1.1bn more each year than if charges were in line with equivalent European airports. Julia Lo Bue-Said, Chief Executive Officer of The Advantage Travel Partnership, said Heathrow’s passenger experience “certainly does not” live up to its expensive cost. This is more important now than ever, as the costs associated with a third runway could potentially extrapolate these high charges even further.”</p>

A bleak economic scenario in which growth stalls, inflation persists, and unemployment rises, stagflation has become the latest buzzword in financial markets as investors attempt to understand the administration's shifting trade narrative and other policy uncertainties, including recent efforts from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Although Emanuel noted there are "no overt signs" of stagflation just yet as universal tariffs remain an unlikely outcome, the possibility has become more pronounced. According to Emanuel, the S&P 500 had an annualized fall of 10% during previous stagflationary periods. Inflation has remained stubbornly elevated, with February expected to be yet another sticky month for consumer prices. On a month-over-month basis, prices are estimated to rise 0.3%, below the 0.5% increase seen in January.</p>

Its product ChatGPT has millions of users and is a household name, helping bring generative AI into the mainstream. But with competition ratcheting up from Google, Amazon and others, OpenAI needed to raise significantly more money. Musk said he invested significant money, helped recruit talent under that premise, served as co-chair and came up with the name "OpenAI." Musk bristled, writing in an email, "Either go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a non-profit," according to legal documents.

Tesla is facing increased EV competition from General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), while some consumers are opting for hybrids. The president has signed two executive orders imposing additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, both key raw materials for autos. Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either — a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies. Wall Street analysts have begun lowering their sales and profit estimates on Tesla ahead of its late April earnings release. According to our calculations, their robotaxi will be safer in the fourth quarter than human drivers are," Wood told me at a conference two weeks ago.</p>

The change announced last week by the Social Security Administration marks a reversal from a 10% default withholding rate that was put in place last year after some beneficiaries received letters demanding immediate repayments for sums that were sometimes tens of thousands of dollars. The discrepancy — called overpayments — happens when Social Security beneficiaries receive more money than they are owed. Social Security beneficiaries who are overpaid benefits after March 27 will automatically be subject to the new 100% withholding rate. The new overpayment policy goes into effect about one year after former Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley implemented a 10% default withholding rate. "This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices — usually through no fault of their own," the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy organization, said in a statement.</p>

President Donald Trump this weekend demurred on the question of whether his administration’s trade policies could send the US economy into recession, following up his recent acknowledgement that they may cause a “little disturbance.” Recently, estimates have been coming down as a result of first quarter tariff turmoil. At a “stall speed” of 1% GDP growth or below, what the Trump administration is trying to achieve looks a lot less palatable, Mohamed El-Erian, president at Queens College, Cambridge, and former PIMCO CEO, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. “A fairer trading system so that US goods are not discriminated against in global trade.” Click here for the latest economic news and indicators to help inform your investing decisions</p>

But that pro-crypto stance is no longer enough to overcome a variety of other economic worries, including growing concerns about the US economy and Trump’s unpredictable trade policy. There was also some disappointment within the crypto industry about Trump’s bitcoin reserve announcement last week. "The market reaction reflects a reset in expectations," Haider Rafique, chief marketing officer for crypto exchange OKX, said via email. "Crypto is still a risk asset, and also it needs more liquidity," MarketVector’s Martin Leinweber told Yahoo Finance last week.

That's because if the Trump administration succeeds in reducing the CFPB to a shell of its former self, banks would find themselves competing directly with nonbank financial players, from big tech and fintech firms to mortgage, auto and payday lenders, that enjoy far less federal scrutiny than Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-backed institutions. "Payment apps like PayPal, Stripe, Cash App, those sorts of things, they would get close to a free ride at the federal level." In internal emails released Friday, CFPB Chief Operating Officer Adam Martinez detailed plans to remove roughly 800 supervision and enforcement workers. At a late October bankers convention in New York, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon encouraged his peers to "fight back" against regulators. A senior CFPB lawyer who lost his position in recent weeks said that the industry's alignment with Republicans may have backfired.</p>

Deribit-listed bitcoin (BTC) futures set to expire this Friday now trade marginally below the exchange’s index price, flashing a discount in a sign of weak demand for the cryptocurrency.

“What we have seen is that near-tenor (7d and shorter) yields have dipped to the negative for the first time in over a year,” Andrew Melville, a research analyst at Block Scholes told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “This means that futures prices are trading below spot, which we take as a significantly bearish indicator.”

Meanwhile, wholesale sales of new energy vehicles in China for the month hit 840,000 units, up 82% compared to last year. Tesla only recently rolled out a limited version of autopilot in China, and it has been plagued with various issues. Bank of America analyst John Murphy slashed his price target for Tesla to $380 from $490, citing those weaker European sales and “sentiment on the brand potentially souring,” among other reasons. Political issues aside, Tesla’s troubles in China likely come down to more market-based forces: Domestic automakers like BYD and others are making cheaper products that are well-liked and include technology like autonomous driving features that Tesla can’t match.

Tesla stock (TSLA) fell more than 10% on Monday as another bearish call from Wall Street sent shares to their lowest level since the day before the presidential election and 50% from its record closing high of $479 seen on Dec. 17. In a note to clients on Monday, analysts at UBS lowered their price target on the stock to $225 from $259, citing lower delivery forecasts for the first quarter it sees resulting from softer demand for Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas also recently reiterated his bullish view on Tesla, forecasting shares will rise to $430 as the company diversifies into artificial intelligence and robotics. "Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics," wrote Jonas in early March.

Pressed by Bartiromo on whether there would be "clarity for the business community," Trump's reply was telling. At the center of the storm were Trump's stiff 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which were initially paused for a month, then restarted Tuesday, only to be reined in Wednesday and then partially paused for another month on Thursday. Confusion surrounding Trump's constantly shifting trade plans has left investors uncertain about what's coming next. While Trump has downplayed the impact of his unpredictable trade policies on domestic markets, Wall Street analysts have not. It's not just companies and investors who need greater clarity before they make major decisions.</p>

It includes some of the biggest momentum names in tech, such as Palantir (PLTR), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL). Tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada from the Trump administration could hurt corporate profits this year, experts say. Against such a backdrop, investors are selling higher-valued tech stocks and rotating into more defensive names in healthcare or companies that pay strong dividends.

US President Donald Trump’s March 7 executive order outlined a plan to create a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency seized in criminal cases rather than purchasing Bitcoin (BTC) on the market. European lawmakers’ silence on Trump’s Bitcoin reserve order is likely due to its focus on the digital euro, according to James Wo, the founder and CEO of venture capital firm DFG. Despite skepticism, ECB President Christine Lagarde is pushing ahead with the digital euro’s rollout, expected in October 2025. Lagarde has emphasized that the CBDC will coexist with cash and offer privacy protections to address concerns about government overreach.

In September, Hive Digital executives Frank Holmes and Aydin Kilic told Cointelegraph that repurposing Nvidia GPUs for AI tasks could generate up to $2.50 per hour in revenues, up from just 0.$12 per hour for crypto mining. For this reason, “institutions are much more interested in us with our AI than Bitcoin,” Holmes said.

DeFi is shrinking, with the total value of assets in decentralized protocols losing all gains since Donald Trump was elected US president. Solana has borne the brunt of criticism as its memecoin popularity fades, but Ethereum has faced its own challenges in recent cycles, with Ether (ETH) failing to reach a new all-time high despite Bitcoin (BTC) soaring past $109,000 on Jan. 20, the day Trump took office. Before March 3, Ethereum experienced net exchange inflows daily, indicating that investors were selling during the downturn, said Juan Pellicer, senior research analyst at IntoTheBlock, in comments to Cointelegraph.

A minor positive is that larger investors seem to be accumulating at lower levels. Research firm Santiment said in a post on X that wallets with 10 BTC or more have bought roughly 5,000 Bitcoin since March 3. He added that Bitcoin’s price action could become violent if it drops in the $70,000 to $75,000 zone as a lot of Bitcoin open interest is stuck in that range.

Thailand’s SEC had previously approved Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, XLM and certain tokens used for settlement by the central bank. Thailand’s SEC announced the approvals last week after soliciting feedback from the public on proposed regulatory changes that were finalized in February and scheduled to go into effect on March 16. This followed the creation of a regulatory sandbox in August 2024 for select service providers to experiment with cryptocurrencies. According to a March 10 announcement by Tether, the approval allows USDt to be adopted by digital asset businesses and be used as a payment rail within the country.

The US push to maintain the dollar’s global dominance through stablecoin adoption could have unintended benefits for Bitcoin as it emerges as a potential national reserve asset. The comments came just before Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve using cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases.

Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) announced on March 10 that it had received the nod from Spain’s securities regulator, the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), to offer Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) trading services to its customers. The lender said it will use its own cryptographic key custody platform to maintain full control over customer holdings without third-party involvement. The grandfather period, or transitional phase, for crypto firms to become MiCA-compliant lasts until July 2026. Prime brokerage Hidden Road obtained its MiCA license in the Netherlands on Dec. 30, 2024. Bybit, which suffered the largest hack in crypto history, was recently removed from France’s blacklist and has expressed intent to obtain a MiCA license next.</p>

That could be a problem for trees, since leaves can get much hotter than the surrounding air. Such constant troubleshooting is one of the main reasons people avoid studying cumulative heat exposure, which makes this work even more valuable, says Andy Leigh, a plant ecologist at University of Technology Sydney who was not involved in the research. Leaf Temperatures in an Indian Tropical Forest Exceed Physiological Limits but Durations of Exposures Are Currently Not Sufficient to Cause Lasting Damage.

Scientists at Meta have used artificial intelligence (AI) and noninvasive brain scans to unravel how thoughts are translated into typed sentences, two new studies show. In one study, scientists developed an AI model that decoded brain signals to reproduce sentences typed by volunteers.

We’ve taken a closer look at his track record with Arsenal and have found the eight managers who Arteta has never beaten. Chelsea have been hopelessly inconsistent since Christmas, but were touted as title challengers beforehand after an impressive string of results during the autumn. Given Selles is now managing Reading in League One, it seems unlikely that he’ll come face-to-face with Arteta again any time soon. Arteta has only faced Benitez as a manager on one occasion and that saw the experienced Spaniard walk away with all three points. Attacking impotence has marred Arsenal’s 2024-25 campaign, a flaw that was apparent during their 1-0 defeat to Internazionale in the Champions League group phase.</p>

NFL Free Agency officially begins on Wednesday, March 12 at 4 p.m., but as usual we’re going to start hearing about deals far before that. Dalman is an elite run blocking C, and good enough in pass pro to help take the next step forward. Haason Reddick really hasn’t been happy since he left the Eagles, and reunited with former DC Jonathan Gannon is a good place to find his footing. It’s unlikely the Raiders will commit cap space to Koonce now they’ve locked up Maxx Crosby, and that opens a window. With Drew Dalman off to Chicago — at least in these predictions — a hole will open on the interior of Atlanta’s offensive line.</p>

There are still eleven teams that I believe could go either way around the cut line. Only twice since 1994 has a team received an at-large bid that was not four games above .500. Ohio State's loss at Indiana to end the regular season puts it in a difficult spot. The Mountaineers have some big hits on their ledger, including victories over Iowa State, Arizona and at Kansas.

Barcelona are reportedly in ‘negotiations’ to sign two Liverpool stars ahead of the summer transfer window and Arne Slot has ‘asked’ for one ‘replacement’. Chelsea hero John Obi Mikel has blasted Enzo Maresca and Todd Boehly with the Blues at risk of missing out on Champions League qualification.</p>

It was Henry's third postseason contest with 175 or more rushing yards, which is an NFL record. Since Henry signed with the Ravens last March, James Conner, Chuba Hubbard, Aaron Jones, David Montgomery and Rhamondre Stevenson, who are vastly inferior, have gotten deals averaging more than his $8 million per year. Henry, who turned 31 in January, is three years older than Barkley and McCaffrey was on the verge of turning 28 when he signed his extension. Although Henry isn't showing any signs of slowing down, his 2,355 rushing attempts rank 32nd in NFL history. Henry's work ethic and professionalism give him more than a fighting chance at preventing the Ravens from having buyer's remorse because of severe diminishing returns.</p>

Nicolas Jackson has scored nine times in the Premier League this season but isn’t reliably prolific. With Nkunku not firing and Cole Palmer struggling for form in front of goal, Chelsea’s need to strengthen has been exposed. Man Utd are getting precious little return from their meagre centre forward options and will look to back Ruben Amorim in the summer. Arsenal’s woes up front have been picked over repeatedly since Kai Havertz joined Gabriel Jesus in the treatment room. Boniface’s contract runs to the summer of 2028 but he would come at a lower cost than Isak, for whom Newcastle will fight tooth and nail.</p>

At Texas, Arch Manning stepped in and led the Longhorns to two wins when Quinn Ewers went down. But while quarterback depth only gets more important in the expanded College Football Playoff era, it's never been harder to keep players on campus. Freshman Colin Hurley suffered a serious car accident in January, and there have been few updates on his status.

He hasn't been the same since, but his immense talent cannot be denied and that's why I'm taking him over Jackson Merrill here. Last year, he raised his batting average over 50 points and posted a .366 on-base percentage while leading the NL in walks. 1 spot, Aaron Judge is left to do a lot of heavy lifting with anyone else for the Yankees' top duo. I think Bellinger is really going to enjoy playing his home games in Yankee Stadium, with that violent-looking swing tailor-made for the short right-field porch. Lindor was stellar last season, finishing second in NL MVP voting to Ohtani while Soto finished third on the AL side behind Judge and Witt.</p>

1 seeds would likely be Auburn, Duke, Houston and Florida. But if Florida or Houston stumbles early in their conference tournaments, and Michigan State adds three more Quadrant 1 victories en route to winning the Big Ten Tournament, the Spartans would have a case to make. Based on current numbers, winning the Big Ten Tournament would likely have Michigan State with a 15-4 record in Q1 to go with a 5-1 record in Q2, which would have them sitting at 20-5 in the first two quadrants on Selection Sunday. Again, that might not be good enough if Auburn and Duke are locks to get No. 5 in Monday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Auburn is No.</p>

He inherited NCAA issues stemming from the FBI investigation that rocked college basketball, yet posted 20-win seasons in each of his first three years. Keatts' typically positive demeanor started to fade during this season, and in February he started to take aim at the fan base for a lack of respect or appreciation for what NC State did the previous season. So let's have some respect for that part of it," Keatts said, before encouraging fans to continue showing up even as the team was losing. Then, after snapping a nine-game losing streak against Boston College later that week, Keatts went to bat for guard Michael O'Connell, who hit the game-tying 3-point heave against Virginia in the ACC Tournament semifinals but was struggling this season.

If we assume that Saka starts and Sterling covered, then those two are a fine set of right sided wingers. I actually don’t think any narrative needs to be written about the team at all unless there is a complete meltdown. Well, I’d argue that he’s nowhere near a £100 million player, yet somehow doesn’t seem to attract much, if any criticism from the press or rival fans. And if Slot wins three trophies in his first season, he should take Klopp out for an expensive meal to say thanks. At least Amorim’s methods provide hope of a different future than the current players are able to promise.</p>

The Atlanta Falcons are parting ways with a franchise legend by releasing two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Grady Jarrett on Monday, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reports. Now, left tackle Jake Matthews is the only player remaining from Atlanta's 2016 NFC Championship season. Most importantly for owner and general manager Jerry Jones, Jarrett likely wouldn't break the bank. San Francisco released defensive tackle Javon Hargrave this offseason, and they're not exactly flush with cash while staring down the barrel of a massive extension for quarterback Brock Purdy. Adding Jarrett and having better injury fortune could turn things around for the 49ers in a hurry.</p>

Joking aside, fans of four different teams — Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull, and McLaren — all have reasons to be confident heading into 2025. While pre-season testing data is always to be taken with a grain of salt, McLaren’s race pace in Bahrain was truly impressive.</p>

Manchester United Ruben Amorim was so deeply apologetic about deploying a low block that it seems unlikely he will celebrate the first three-game unbeaten run of his tenure. When your starting forwards cost £127.5m and are not involved in either the overhit cross or penalty which crowned this comeback draw, there will be consternation at being outplayed at home by a team which cost a fraction of the price under an exciting, vibrant coach who has changed to cope with his own persistent injury issues.

Sure, this season wasn't great, but firing a coach less than 12 months after going to the Final Four is cold. Keatts can fairly blame the lack of NIL all he wants, but NC State's portal evaluations last spring were not good enough, and if you watched NC State this year, it had no semblance of an identity on a nightly basis. A key component of its Final Four run last year was unsung heroes stepping up in big moments. His 25-point, eight-rebound showing against Auburn was enormous and equally frustrating because that snarl just hasn't shown up much throughout SEC play.

Liverpool received a timely boost as Cody Gakpo returned to training ahead of their crucial Champions League second-leg tie against Paris Saint-Germain. Saturday’s victory over Southampton also went ahead without him, as Liverpool edged closer to securing the Premier League title. His potential inclusion against PSG would bolster the attacking options as they look to overturn their first-leg deficit. Beyond that, Sunday’s Carabao Cup final against Newcastle could also see him play a key role. Conor Bradley and Joe Gomez remain unavailable, but otherwise, Liverpool’s squad appears in good shape for the challenges ahead.</p>

A Moderna spokesperson, Chris Ridley, said legislative efforts to ban or restrict mRNA medicines are largely driven by misunderstandings about their safety profile and mechanism of action. "If enacted, these measures could hinder important research and limit patient access to innovative treatments, potentially delaying life-changing medical advancements," Ridley said in a written statement. South Carolina's pending bill would require anyone administering certain covid mRNA vaccines to inform patients that the shot is contaminated with fragments of "bacterial plasmid DNA."

OnMed, which partnered with local universities and the Alabama Cooperative Extension System, relies on SpaceX's Starlink to provide a high-speed connection in lieu of other options. Most days it's just good enough for her to read a daily devotional website and check Facebook, though the stories don't always load. That effort prioritizes fiber-optic connections, but federal regulators recently outlined guidance for alternative technologies, including low Earth orbit satellites like SpaceX's Starlink service. Last year, she criticized the program's emphasis on fiber and said it was beleaguered by a "woke social agenda" with too many regulations.</p>

The FDA's restraints on food ingredients are limited and relatively feeble, especially compared with those in Europe, a KFF Health News examination found. "The food industry does massive amounts of research that we have no access to," Robert Califf told a Senate committee in December on his way out as FDA commissioner. "There is good reason to be concerned about the chemicals that are routinely included in much of our food," Califf testified. Potassium bromate has been banned from food in many countries, including those of the European Union, Canada, India, and Peru.

Andy Cohen is playing coy about Tamra Judge’s future on The Real Housewives of Orange County. On Sunday, March 9, Judge, 57, seemingly announced she was quitting The Real Housewives of Orange County while filming a cast trip in New Orleans. “So maybe keep that in mind, otherwise I really don’t have anything to say on the subject.” Fans first met Judge when she joined The Real Housewives of Orange County for its third season in 2008.

White was asked about fan reactions to those NSFW moments, saying, “It’s funny, though, how now that the show is airing, how much you realize a graphic sex scene or a sex scene that kind of is titillating for various reasons, does just spike and generate an interest in the populace, for better or worse.” During season 2, viewers were shocked when Harper (Aubrey Plaza) accidentally snuck a peek at Cameron (Theo James) while he undressed. During season 3, Timothy (Isaacs) was spiraling about being sent to prison for money laundering and bribery. He continued: “You haven’t seen other things that are coming, but I just remember thinking, ‘I better dig deep and produce something here.’ Because there’s a lot of parts you can go through and tell a very dramatic story without your character going through anything extreme.

Lauren Graham is aware that Gilmore Girls fans want another revival series — but acknowledged it’s not an easy task to accomplish. “How do you honor those people who have kept [Gilmore Girls] alive?” Graham, 57, asked host Dax Shepard on the Monday, March 10, episode of his “Armchair Expert” podcast. “For me, it was an incredibly satisfying, beautiful, cried every day experience,” she reflected. Graham added that the idea of having the cast reunite for a special holiday moment did well when she and costar Scott Patterson — who play Graham’s love interest Luke — joined forces for a WalMart commercial last year.

After dating “a couple times” in the past year, Mason and Meg revealed they were better off as friends. After she left for Music City (with Ben supposedly set to join her at a later date), Sara claimed Ben removed her from Find My Friends and ended things with “three very scripted apologies.” Ben argued that the duo had a conversation that he perceived as a breakup before Sara left, but she insisted that the plans for him to move in with her were still in place. (It’s hard not to laugh thinking about Ben taking advice from Jimmy — another missed opportunity for the cameras!) Monica came out swinging in a way viewers likely didn’t expect, accusing Joey sliding into costar Madison’s DMs. “[I’m thinking to myself], ‘This man is not interested in you romantically … how could you not see?’” Joey tried to argue that Madison’s sister’s lack of acceptance was why he pulled away, Nick Lachey had a good point — it happens!</p>
