COLLETON COUNTY, S.C. (WCSC) - One man is facing charges and another person is expected to be arrested in connection to the theft of one of the new license plate readers in Colleton County.

A release from the Colleton County Sheriff‚Äôs Office states that Timothy McWilliams, 56, is charged with felony grand larceny. He was arrested Friday.

Deputies say they successfully recovered the stolen ‚ÄúFlock Safety‚Äù license plate reader camera that was originally stolen last week Tuesday.

The camera is a part of a newly launched ‚ÄúColleton County Safe‚Äù initiative. The technology is expected to be used as a ‚Äúcritical tool for law enforcement‚Äù by helping reduce crime, solve cases, recover stolen cars and even locate missing or endangered people.

The charges against McWilliams stem from an incident in which witnesses saw two men wearing traffic safety vests who were removing the camera.

‚ÄúThese cameras are legally installed on private property throughout Colleton County under official agreements. Tampering with or stealing them is a serious offense, and offenders will be held accountable, including facing criminal charges and potential restitution,‚Äù the release states.

‚ÄúThese cameras are in place to protect our community, they help us solve violent crimes such as homicides and shootings and assist in finding missing persons. We will not tolerate interference with this vital public safety resource,‚Äù Colleton County Sheriff Buddy Hill said.

Deputies say efforts remain underway to identify and charge the remaining suspect.

Microblogging platform X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday suffered a massive global outage for the third time today, leaving thousands of users unable to access the app or website. According to the outage-tracking platform Downdetector, the first disruption was recorded around 3:30 PM IST, followed by another at 7:00 PM IST and a third spike at 8:44 PM IST. X chief Elon Musk said a 'massive cyberattack' targeting the platform was the cause behind the disruption.¬†

The outage has impacted users across multiple countries, including the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. For the uninitiated, Downdetector monitors the operational status of internet services and has recorded a substantial spike in outage reports.¬†

¬†

Downdetector data shows that 52 per cent of users are facing issues with the app itself, 40 per cent are experiencing problems on the website, and 7 per cent have reported server connection failures.¬†

With X being the primary platform where users typically report disruptions on other social media services, many found themselves unable to voice their concerns about the ongoing outage. ¬†

As the repeated service failures have led to frustration among users, X chief Elon Musk posted that the platform is facing a "massive cyberattack" and suspected the involvement of a "large, coordinated group and/or a country".¬†

"There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against ùïè. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing," Elon Musk wrote.

While some regions have seen a partial restoration of services, many users continue to experience accessibility issues. ¬†

According to Downdetector, the number of outage reports surged past 40,000 in the United States, while more than 10,800 users in the United Kingdom also reported issues earlier in the day.

More details about the global outage are awaited.

Prospective study finds AI increases cancer detection by 13.8% in single-reader settings without raising recall rates, presenting a new tool for countries relying on single-reader mammography screening.

March 10, 2025¬†‚Äî Lunit, a¬†provider of AI-powered solutions for cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, has published a prospective study in Nature Communications validating the real-world effectiveness of AI-powered mammography screening in South Korea‚Äôs national breast cancer screening program. Conducted as the world‚Äôs first large-scale, multicenter prospective study in a single-reading setting, the research underscores how AI-assisted mammography interpretation significantly improves breast cancer detection rates without increasing recall rates.

The study was led by Professor Yun-Woo Chang from Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital, in collaboration with both breast and general radiologists from six leading academic hospitals in South Korea. The study analyzed 24,543 women aged 40 and above who underwent routine biennial mammography (2D full-field digital mammogram) between February 2021 and December 2022 as part of Korea's national breast cancer screening program.

The study compared the performance of breast radiologists interpreting screening mammograms with and without Lunit's AI-based computer-aided detection, Lunit INSIGHT MMG. The results revealed that AI-assisted breast radiologists detected 13.8% more screen-detected breast cancers than those relying solely on conventional interpretation methods, or without AI assistance. The cancer detection rate (CDR) increased from 5.01 (per 1,000) to 5.70 with AI assistance, while recall rates (RRs) remained statistically unchanged, ensuring improved clinical effectiveness and minimizing unnecessary additional recalls. Moreover, AI assistance led to a significant improvement in detecting small-sized tumors and node-negative cancers, key indicators of improved early detection.

Additionally, the study evaluated Lunit INSIGHT MMG‚Äôs impact on general radiologists who do not specialize in breast imaging through a simulated retrospective study. The results demonstrated that AI assistance led to an even greater improvement in CDRs for general radiologists, with an increase of 26.4% (3.87 to 4.89 per 1,000), underscoring AI‚Äôs potential to support radiologists with varying levels of expertise.

‚ÄúThis prospective study offers compelling real-world evidence that AI can improve early cancer detection while maintaining effectiveness and reducing unnecessary patient anxiety caused by false positives in a single-reading setting,‚Äù said Professor Chang, the lead and corresponding author of the study.

A Solution for Single and Double-Reading Screening Systems

The publication further builds upon Lunit INSIGHT MMG‚Äôs track record in improving breast cancer detection. In Sweden, Capio St. G√∂ran Hospital conducted a prospective clinical trial to assess Lunit AI‚Äôs effectiveness in breast cancer screening when replacing one reader within a double-reading setting. Following positive trial results, Capio St. G√∂ran Hospital became the world‚Äôs first to replace one of two radiologists in its double-reading workflow with AI, marking a paradigm shift in breast cancer screening.

‚ÄúThis latest prospective study in South Korea further solidifies Lunit INSIGHT MMG‚Äôs potential as an indispensable tool in breast cancer screening,‚Äù said Brandon Suh, CEO of Lunit. ‚ÄúWhether in a single-reader or double-reader setting, AI can serve as a powerful force multiplier, assisting radiologists in detecting cancer earlier and more accurately.‚Äù

Shaping the Future¬†

With mounting evidence supporting AI‚Äôs role in breast cancer screening, Lunit is driving its global adoption. Lunit INSIGHT MMG has already been deployed in national breast screening programs in Australia, Sweden, Iceland, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, helping healthcare systems enhance efficiency and optimize diagnostic accuracy.

The study‚Äôs findings are expected to influence global breast cancer screening protocols, particularly in countries where single-reading mammography interpretation is widely practiced. By demonstrating AI‚Äôs ability to enhance radiologists‚Äô accuracy without increasing RRs, the study provides critical data supporting AI‚Äôs role in optimizing cancer detection while reducing the workload burden on radiologists. This is particularly relevant as many countries face a shortage of specialized breast imaging professionals, making AI an important tool to improve efficiency and maintain high diagnostic standards.

‚ÄúAs AI adoption accelerates, we remain committed to driving innovation and making AI-powered cancer screening the new standard of care,‚Äù added Suh. ‚ÄúBy working closely with healthcare providers worldwide, we aim to ensure that AI benefits as many patients as possible.‚Äù

Brazil‚Äôs state-owned postal service, Empresa Brasileira de Correios e Tel√©grafos, is seeking proposals for blockchain and AI solutions to improve its logistics and operational processes. 

The move comes as rising demand for faster and more reliable delivery services places pressure on postal services to modernise their infrastructure.

On Friday, the country‚Äôs official publication Di√°rio Oficial da Uni√£o published a tender notice inviting companies and specialists to submit solutions for digitally transforming Correios‚Äô services. The initiative, Licita√ß√£o Sele√ß√£o Pr√©via e Di√°logo n¬∫ 25000001/2025 CS, seeks sophisticated technological solutions to improve business operations, supply management, and internal procedures.

Correios is facing significant operational issues, including growing parcel volumes, pressure for faster delivery times, and the need to improve tracking accuracy. These concerns could be addressed using AI and blockchain solutions that automate key processes and improve supply chain transparency.

Correios stated that its goal is to create a collaborative approach to developing AI and blockchain-based solutions to commercial and operational difficulties.

While specific use cases were not detailed, blockchain technology is often used for improving supply chain tracking, securing transactions, and verifying documents. AI applications could enhance logistics by improving data analysis and streamlining operations. Potential AI applications for Correios could include predictive analytics for improving delivery efficiency, identifying bottlenecks in the supply chain, and automating customer service through chatbots. Blockchain technology could strengthen parcel tracking, provide tamper-proof shipment data, and automate customs clearance.

Correios‚Äô interest in blockchain and AI reflects a growing trend among logistics companies to use digital solutions to enhance efficiency and transparency. Major logistics corporations such as DHL, FedEx, and UPS have already shown how AI and blockchain may improve operational efficiency:

AI can analyse massive databases to detect inefficiencies and forecast delivery patterns, lowering costs and improving service levels. Blockchain technology provides a secure, immutable record of transactions, which can help prevent fraud and improve supply chain accountability.

The pre-selection process signals Correios‚Äô broader strategy to modernise its infrastructure and improve service delivery. Other postal services globally have introduced similar initiatives in response to increasing demand for faster, more secure, and efficient operations.

An artist‚Äôs concept shows LuGRE on Blue Ghost and its three key records

NASA, in collaboration with the Italian Space Agency, has successfully demonstrated the ability to acquire and track Earth-based navigation signals on the Moon. The breakthrough was achieved through the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE), which was delivered to the lunar surface by Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander on March 2. The achievement confirms that Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals can be detected at the Moon's distance, offering a potential advancement for future space missions, including NASA's Artemis programme. The ability to track these signals on the Moon could enhance autonomous navigation for spacecraft, reducing reliance on Earth-based tracking systems. The LuGRE payload, one of ten NASA payloads sent aboard the lander, is expected to continue gathering data for the duration of its 14-day mission.

According to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the LuGRE experiment successfully acquired and tracked signals from both GPS and Galileo constellations at 2 a.m. EST on March 3. This marked the first time that GNSS signals had been used for navigation at a distance of approximately 225,000 miles from Earth. The data collected will contribute to the development of navigation technology that could support future lunar and deep-space exploration.

Kevin Coggins, Deputy Associate Administrator for NASA's Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) programme, told NASA's official news source that the experiment demonstrated the feasibility of using GNSS signals for navigation beyond Earth. He highlighted that the same technology used in aviation and mobile devices on Earth could now be leveraged for lunar missions.

The LuGRE payload had already set records during its journey to the Moon. On January 21, it achieved the highest altitude GNSS signal acquisition at 209,900 miles from Earth, surpassing the previous record set by NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission. By February 20, as LuGRE entered lunar orbit, the altitude record had been extended to 243,000 miles. These milestones suggest that spacecraft operating in cislunar space could use GNSS signals for navigation, providing greater autonomy for missions beyond Earth's orbit.

Developed through a partnership between NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the Italian Space Agency, Qascom, and Politecnico di Torino, the LuGRE payload represents a significant step toward advanced space navigation systems. Data collected from the ongoing mission will inform future efforts to expand GNSS coverage for lunar and Martian exploration.

LOS ANGELES (AP) ‚Äî When artificial intelligence-backed tractors became available to vineyards, Tom Gamble wanted to be an early adopter. He knew there would be a learning curve, but Gamble decided the technology was worth figuring out.

The third-generation farmer bought one autonomous tractor. He plans on deploying its self-driving feature this spring and is currently using the tractor‚Äôs AI sensor to map his Napa Valley vineyard. As it learns each row, the tractor will know where to go once it is used autonomously. The AI within the machine will then process the data it collects and help Gamble make better-informed decisions about his crops ‚Äî what he calls ‚Äúprecision farming.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to completely replace the human element of putting your boot into the vineyard, and that‚Äôs one of my favorite things to do,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs going to be able to allow you to work more smartly, more intelligently and in the end, make better decisions under less fatigue.‚Äù

Gamble said he anticipates using the tech as much as possible because of ‚Äúeconomic, air quality and regulatory imperatives.‚Äù Autonomous tractors, he said, could help lower his fuel use and cut back on pollution.

As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce. New agricultural tech like AI can help farmers to cut back on waste, and to run more efficient and sustainable vineyards by monitoring water use and helping determine when and where to use products like fertilizers or pest control. AI-backed tractors and irrigation systems, farmer say, can minimize water use by analyzing soil or vines, while also helping farmers to manage acres of vineyards by providing more accurate data on the health of a crop or what a season‚Äôs yield will be.




Other facets of the wine industry have also started adopting the tech, from using generative AI to create custom wine labels to turning to ChatGPT to develop, label and price an entire bottle.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see anybody losing their job, because I think that a tractor operator‚Äôs skills are going to increase and as a result, and maybe they‚Äôre overseeing a small fleet of these machines that are out there, and they‚Äôll be compensated as a result of their increased skill level,‚Äù he said.

Farmers, Gamble said, are always evolving. There were fears when the tractor replaced horses and mules pulling plows, but that technology ‚Äúproved itself‚Äù just like AI farming tech will, he said, adding that adopting any new tech always takes time.

Companies like John Deere have started using the AI that wine farmers are beginning to adopt. The agricultural giant uses ‚ÄúSmart Apply‚Äù technology on tractors, for example, helping growers apply material for crop retention by using sensors and algorithms to sense foliage on grape canopies, said Sean Sundberg, business integration manager at John Deere.

The tractors that use that tech then only spray ‚Äúwhere there are grapes or leaves or whatnot so that it doesn‚Äôt spray material unnecessarily,‚Äù he said. Last year, the company announced a project with Sonoma County Winegrowers to use tech to help wine grape growers maximize their yield.

Tyler Klick, partner at Redwood Empire Vineyard Management, said his company has started automating irrigation valves at the vineyards it helps manage. The valves send an alert in the event of a leak and will automatically shut off if they notice an ‚Äúexcessive‚Äù water flow rate.

‚ÄúThat valve is actually starting to learn typical water use,‚Äù Klick said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll learn how much water is used before the production starts to fall off.‚Äù

Klick said each valve costs roughly $600, plus $150 per acre each year to subscribe to the service.

‚ÄúOur job, viticulture, is to adjust our operations to the climatic conditions we‚Äôre dealt,‚Äù Klick said. ‚ÄúI can see AI helping us with finite conditions.‚Äù

Angelo A. Camillo, a professor of wine business at Sonoma State University, said that despite excitement over AI in the wine industry, some smaller vineyards are more skeptical about their ability to use the technology. Small, family-owned operations, which Camillo said account for about 80% of the wine business in America, are slowly disappearing ‚Äî many don‚Äôt have the money to invest in AI, he said. A robotic arm that helps put together pallets of wine, for example, can cost as much as $150,000, he said.

‚ÄúFor small wineries, there‚Äôs a question mark, which is the investment. Then there‚Äôs the education. Who‚Äôs going to work with all of these AI applications? Where is the training?‚Äù he said.

There are also potential challenges with scalability, Camillo added. Drones, for example, could be useful for smaller vineyards that could use AI to target specific crops that have a bug problem, he said ‚Äî it would be much harder to operate 100 drones in a 1,000 acre vineyard while also employing the IT workers who understand the tech.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think a person can manage 40 drones as a swarm of drones,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo there‚Äôs a constraint for the operators to adopt certain things.‚Äù

However, AI is particularly good at tracking a crop‚Äôs health ‚Äì including how the plant itself is doing and whether it‚Äôs growing enough leaves ‚Äì while also monitoring grapes to aid in yield projections, said Mason Earles, an assistant professor who leads the Plant AI and Biophysics Lab at UC Davis.

Diseases or viruses can sneak up and destroy entire vineyards, Earles said, calling it an ‚Äúelephant in the room‚Äù across the wine industry. The process of replanting a vineyard and getting it to produce well takes at least five years, he said. AI can help growers determine which virus is affecting their plants, he said, and whether they should rip out some crops immediately to avoid losing their entire vineyard. 

Earles, who is also cofounder of the AI-powered farm management platform Scout, said his company uses AI to process thousands of images in hours and extract data quickly ‚Äî something that would be difficult by hand in large vineyards that span hundreds of acres. Scout‚Äôs AI platform then counts and measures the number of grape clusters as early as when a plant is beginning to flower in order to forecast what a yield will be.

The sooner vintners know how much yield to expect, the better they can ‚Äúdial in‚Äù their wine making process, he added.

‚ÄúPredicting what yields you‚Äôre going to have at the end of the season, no one is that good at it right now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs really important because it determines how much labor contract you‚Äôre going to need and the supplies you‚Äôll need for making wine.‚Äù

Earles doesn‚Äôt think the budding use of AI in vineyards is ‚Äúfreaking farmers out.‚Äù Rather, he anticipates that AI will be used more frequently to help with difficult field labor and to discern problems in vineyards that farmers need help with.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve seen people trying to sell them tech for decades. It‚Äôs hard to farm; it‚Äôs unpredictable compared to most other jobs,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe walking and counting, I think people would have said a long time ago, ‚ÄòI would happily let a machine take over.‚Äô‚Äù

In the blink of an eye, the internet has evolved from a groundbreaking tool of knowledge, connectivity, and progress to a hotbed of crime, scams, cyberbullying, theft, fake news, unregulated content and fraud.

  

Once a beacon of promise, the net now feels like a lawless, chaotic wild west where dangerous predators roam free, thriving in the dark corners of the web. What happened? Where did things go so wrong?

  

Let‚Äôs start with the obvious: crime. From hacking rings to identity theft, cybercrime has exploded. Every day, thousands of people fall victim to criminal activities online. Hackers are no longer the lone wolves in their basements‚Äîthey‚Äôre highly organized syndicates with deep pockets, professional tools, and no conscience.

  

  

Personal data is sold on the black market like hotcakes, businesses are held ransom with ransomware attacks, and phishing schemes are more sophisticated than ever. These criminals know how to exploit every flaw, every weakness in the system, and they do so without fear of real consequence.

  

Then, there‚Äôs the growing plague of scams. Have you received an email recently offering you millions of dollars for helping a ‚Äúrich billionaire‚Äù move money? How about a message from an overseas ‚Äúprince‚Äù who just needs your bank details to transfer a fortune into your account?

  

Scams aren't just isolated incidents anymore. They‚Äôre an everyday occurrence. From fake job offers to fraudulent investment schemes promising "too good to be true" returns, the internet is flooded with schemes designed to separate people from their hard-earned cash.

  

And the worst part? These scammers don‚Äôt even bother to hide their malicious intent anymore. Their deception is blatant, and platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and even LinkedIn are rife with scam ads and fraudulent accounts.

  

But it doesn‚Äôt stop there‚Äîcyberbullying has become a pandemic of its own. Once a victim of bullying steps outside the walls of their home, they‚Äôre not safe anymore. In fact, they‚Äôre more vulnerable than ever.

  

Social media platforms, which should be spaces for self-expression and connection, have instead become breeding grounds for hate, cruelty, and harassment. Kids and adults alike are subjected to relentless online torment‚Äîoften with no way to escape it.

  

The worst part? It‚Äôs hard to escape a situation that follows you everywhere. Cyberbullying doesn‚Äôt just stop at comments on a post. It‚Äôs personal attacks, death threats, stalking, and sometimes even the weaponization of personal information. It‚Äôs a toxic environment that‚Äôs turning people against each other, tearing apart communities, and ruining lives.

  

We also have theft‚Äînot the kind with masks and getaway cars, but the type that happens in broad daylight, digitally. Data breaches are a daily occurrence, affecting individuals and large corporations alike.

  

What‚Äôs more concerning is how these breaches are handled. It‚Äôs one thing to hear about the hack; it‚Äôs another to find out that your personal information‚Äîyour passwords, your financial records, your private messages‚Äîhave been stolen and are now in the hands of criminals.

  

And let‚Äôs not forget about the rise of digital theft through malware and ransomware attacks, where individuals, companies, and even governments are extorted for access to their own files. The sheer audacity of it is staggering. Theft, but with a 21st-century twist, where the victim may never even know what‚Äôs been taken until it‚Äôs too late.

  

And let‚Äôs not even get started on fake news. The internet has become a breeding ground for misinformation, conspiracy theories, and the deliberate distortion of truth. In an era where everyone can publish their ‚Äúopinions‚Äù as fact, discerning what's true from what's false is harder than ever.

  

It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs politics, health, science, or entertainment‚Äîthe lines between fact and fiction are continuously blurred. Algorithms prioritize sensationalism over truth, ensuring that the loudest, most outrageous voices are heard the most. Meanwhile, responsible journalism gets buried under the noise, struggling to be seen.

  

The internet is now swarming with unregulated content fraud‚Äîyou know, those shady articles and sites that have no real authority or credibility, but they somehow manage to climb to the top of search results. These are the websites selling counterfeit products, the ones offering misleading medical advice, or the ones convincing you that their miracle weight loss pills will change your life.

  

There are no rules anymore. Anyone can create anything and pass it off as truth. And because they‚Äôre so good at manipulating SEO algorithms and exploiting loopholes, these frauds go unchecked for far too long, costing unsuspecting victims their time, money, and sometimes even their health.

  

At this point, it's clear: the internet has spiraled out of control. Where‚Äôs the accountability?

  

Where are the consequences for these criminals who operate with impunity? Why aren‚Äôt platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter stepping up to stop the flood of scams, harassment, and fraud that‚Äôs poisoning their platforms? Why do we continue to let these digital marketplaces run wild, knowing full well the destruction they‚Äôre causing to individuals and businesses alike?
