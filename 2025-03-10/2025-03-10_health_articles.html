Dan Cohen, president of Adhere+

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has proposed draft guidance to establish a framework for prescribing controlled substances via telemedicine.

The proposal introduces three types of special registrations. Telemedicine prescribing registration allows qualified practitioners to prescribe Schedule III-V controlled substances via telemedicine. Advanced telemedicine prescribing registration permits specialized practitioners, such as psychiatrists and hospice care physicians, to prescribe Schedule II-V controlled substances via telemedicine. And telemedicine platform registration enables online telemedicine platforms to dispense Schedule II-V controlled substances through registered practitioners.

The guidance proposes allowing patients to receive a six-month supply of buprenorphine, used to treat opioid use disorder, through a telephone consultation with a provider. Subsequent prescriptions would require an in-person visit.

Practitioners would be required to conduct Prescription Drug Monitoring Program checks for the states where both the patient and the practitioner are located, as well as any other relevant states with PDMP reciprocity.

Detailed records must be maintained for in-person evaluations, telehealth prescriptions and referrals. The proposal also includes safeguards for prescribing high-risk medications, such as Schedule II substances.

These measures aim to expand patient access to controlled substances via telemedicine while implementing safeguards to prevent misuse and diversion.

Dan Cohen, president of Adhere+, a vendor of remote therapeutic monitoring technology and services, says the DEA's draft language needs to be clarified that healthcare practitioners make treatment decisions – the DEA needs to limit its role to ensure patient safety and prevent misuse, not to dictate clinical decision making for practitioners.

"The concern here is about ensuring the role of the DEA is clearly defined when it comes to overseeing healthcare practitioners' treatment decisions, particularly in the context of prescribing Scheduled medications," Cohen explained. "The primary responsibility of healthcare practitioners – doctors, nurses, pharmacists, etc. – is to make clinical decisions based on their professional judgment, patient needs and medical guidelines.

"If the DEA's role is not properly limited, there could be an overreach where the agency influences or even dictates how healthcare practitioners make these decisions, which could undermine the autonomy of medical professionals and potentially impact patient care," he continued. "The DEA's main mission should be to prevent drug misuse, addiction and illegal distribution while safeguarding patient safety. However, it should not be in the position of making clinical decisions or prescribing protocols for legitimate medical treatments."

The language in any proposed regulation or legislation should therefore make it clear that while the DEA can enforce laws related to drug control and ensure that medications are prescribed and distributed safely and appropriately, healthcare practitioners remain the ones who make decisions about what treatment is appropriate for their patients, based on medical evidence, their expertise and individual patient needs, he said.

Cohen contended that Congress make permanent COVID Public Health Emergency concessions, rather than renewing the concessions biannually.

"Making the COVID-19 PHE concessions permanent, rather than renewing them biannually, could provide several advantages," he explained. "Doing so would provide stability and certainty, avoid legislative bottlenecks, enable continued access to healthcare, encourage long-term innovation, enable efficient use of resources, and continue lessons learned from the pandemic."

On another note, telehealth encounters via electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) should have clear, clinical content that develops over the treatment period for several key reasons, Cohen said.

"This is because it tracks patient progress, improves clinical decision making, enhances patient-clinician communication, enables personalized treatment, improves outcome measurement, aids regulatory and reimbursement purposes, enables early identification of complications," he explained.

"The lack of ePROs in a telehealth 'visit' compromises patient care," he continued. "Conversely, ePROs with clear, evolving clinical content are essential for monitoring patient progress, making informed clinical decisions, personalizing care, and improving overall treatment outcomes. They provide a comprehensive and accurate picture of the patient's health, which is critical for effective, evidence-based care."

Cohen also offered views on how regulatory policies should be adapted and updated to allow for clinical decision making based in part on an artificial intelligence analysis of patients' ePROs data.

"For AI/ML analysis of ePROs data to be a valuable part of clinical decision making, regulatory policies need to ensure these tools are accurate, transparent, equitable, and integrated into a system that prioritizes patient safety and clinician oversight," Cohen said. "Establishing strong standards for validation, data security and bias mitigation, while fostering innovation and patient engagement, will be key to maximizing the benefits of AI/ML in healthcare."

— Top-tier institution —

Cleveland Clinic has been ranked the No. 2 hospital globally for the seventh consecutive year, according to Newsweek’s World’s Best Hospitals 2025.

Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital also earned a place among the best hospitals in the United States, ranking 48th overall and holding the title of the highest-ranked hospital in South Florida and second in Florida.

“This recognition reflects the exceptional dedication of our caregivers, who consistently go above and beyond to deliver world-class care to our patients every single day,” said F. Scott Ross, M.D., vice president and Chief Medical Officer for Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital, which was also named a top hospital in the nation in 2024. “It reaffirms our unwavering commitment to excellence in patient care, groundbreaking research and innovation and improving lives.”

Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital also received recognition in Newsweek’s 2025 rankings of World’s Best Smart Hospitals and World’s Best Specialized Hospitals, with accolades in key areas including cardiac surgery, cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, obstetrics and gynecology and urology. The hospital was also honored on the inaugural list of America’s Best Weight Loss Clinics & Centers.

The World’s Best Hospitals rankings are based on surveys and data from hospitals in 30 countries. Newsweek partners with Statista to compile the annual rankings. Data sources include opinions from more than 85,000 medical experts globally, publicly available data on patient experience and hospital quality metrics and patient-reported outcomes measures.

Nursing students at the University of West Florida (UWF) receive a unique education and perform uniquely compared to other schools.

The UWF School of Nursing graduates outperformed other nursing schools in Florida and similar institutions nationwide. Some 97.67% of UWF School of Nursing graduates passed the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses on their first attempt. That’s the second highest percentage of passing rate in Florida’s university system.

UWF nursing graduates who earned a Bachelor of Science degree also surpassed the national average for those who took the exam. For the first two quarters of 2024, all UWF nursing grads passed the exam. UWF nursing majors passed it with 100%. There was a total of 129 UWF nursing graduates who earned their license to practice by passing that exam. “The success of our students is a testament to their dedication, the tireless efforts of our faculty, community support from local partnerships, and the strong leadership within the college,” said Renee Davis, who was recently hired as the new director of UWF’s School of Nursing. “Our faculty take pride in providing a rigorous and supportive learning environment that allows our students’ hard work and determination to shine. It’s their commitment that ultimately drives their success.”



— Grand Opening —

BayCare recently opened the state’s first behavioral health urgent care center in New Port Richey. This outpatient facility, funded by a $3.6 million grant from the Pasco County Commission, offers walk-in and same-day appointments for adults facing urgent mental health and substance use issues.

The center aims to bridge a critical gap in mental health services by providing timely access to trained professionals and helping individuals avoid crises that might otherwise lead them to emergency rooms or law enforcement. BayCare’s Director of Clinical Operations, Tracey Kaly, emphasized the importance of this facility as a safe space for urgent care and ongoing support.

“When we evaluated how we could better deliver mental health services to the community, we recognized that there was a piece of the puzzle missing,” Kaly said.

“Often, people do not seek help until they are in crisis and feel their only options are to call law enforcement or visit the ER. This center is a bridge — a safe space where people in urgent need of mental health or addiction care can be seen in a timely manner by a trained professional who can evaluate their needs and connect them with ongoing services in their area, hopefully mitigating the need for hospitalization.”

BayCare Behavioral Health Urgent Care patients undergo screenings and clinical evaluations to determine their immediate needs. They can also connect with recovery support specialists, who provide guidance based on personal experiences.

The project received significant backing from the Pasco County Commission, which allocated a large portion of the county’s opioid settlement funds to support it. BayCare leadership and County Commissioners, including Jack Mariano, attended a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Feb. 26. Mariano highlighted the center’s potential to save lives and reduce costs for taxpayers by keeping individuals out of jail.

Since its opening three weeks ago, the center has successfully provided comprehensive care to all patients, including safety plans and follow-up appointments, effectively mitigating the need for hospitalization. The BayCare Behavioral Health Urgent Care operates Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Same-day appointments can be made by calling (727) 281-3350.

“‘Forced medication’: Ron DeSantis wants fluoride out of water” via A.G. Gancarski of Florida Politics — DeSantis isn’t holding back on fluoride in water supplies, believing it’s “forced medication.” “When you’re forcing it into the water supply, that’s not really giving people the choice. If people want to be able to purchase fluoridated water or do more, then they already have the ability to do it,” DeSantis said. Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo had previously said putting fluoride in water was “insane,” given the compound’s “caustic” nature and the fact that toothpaste and other consumer products contain it and give people the option to self-administer. He recommended against community water fluoridation last year. DeSantis said Tuesday that he expects the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to “lean in the direction of Ladapo under Bobby Kennedy,” presumably offering similar guidance.

“Families praise Clay Yarborough’s proposed ‘free kill’ repeal, but health care pros say it’s inoperable” via Jesse Scheckner of Florida Politics — Legislation that would upend Florida’s unique law barring many medical malpractice lawsuits is again advancing in the Senate. Families who had little recourse after losing loved ones say change is needed to bring overdue justice to the state’s health care market. Opponents, most of them in the medical or insurance fields, warn it will make an already expensive industry unaffordable for patients and practitioners. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 9-2 to advance SB 734, which would repeal a 35-year-old state statute — 768.21(8) — prohibiting adult children and their parents from collecting negligence and noneconomic damages for medical malpractice. The law, which detractors have dubbed “free kill,” applies to anyone over 25 seeking medical care in the state, including residents and visitors.

“House passes Vern Buchanan-backed expansion of chronic disease coverage” via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics — The House has passed legislation championed by U.S. Rep. Buchanan that could expand chronic disease coverage nationwide. The Chronic Disease Flexible Coverage Act (HR 919) cleared the House chamber. If the bill becomes law, it will allow employers to offer high-deductible health plan coverage for employees, including pre-deductible coverage for certain health care services that treat common chronic illnesses. “With six in 10 Americans living with at least one chronic disease, it is clear that we must expand options for people to manage their chronic health conditions,” said Buchanan, Chair of the House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee. In remarks on the floor, Buchanan said the cost of chronic diseases accounts for $1 trillion in spending in the American economy. It also accounts for a high percentage of preventable deaths, he said.

“Measles confirmed in Miami teenager, the first in Florida this year” via Christopher O’Donnell of the Orlando Sentinel — A teenager in Miami-Dade has a confirmed case of measles, the first such infection in Florida since a small outbreak of the disease in South Florida in 2024. The infection was reported in the Florida Department of Health database for Florida’s infectious and reportable diseases. A Miami-Dade County Public Schools spokesperson confirmed that a Miami Palmetto Senior High School student was infected. The school district has notified the parents of other students at the school. Florida Department of Health officials are working to trace anyone the student may have come into contact with, according to a letter sent to school parents by Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo. “Due to the high immunity rate in the school, as well as the burden on families and the educational cost of healthy children missing school, DOH is deferring to parents or guardians to make decisions about school attendance,” the letter states.

“New bill aims to end Florida contract with controversial pregnancy centers” via Cindy Krischer Goodman of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel — Democrat Rep. Kelly Skidmore has introduced a bill to end the state’s $29.5 million contract with a controversial pregnancy care provider. While Skidmore of Boca Raton has targeted the Florida Pregnancy Care Network and its lucrative contract in the past, this time is different. That’s because DeSantis also wants to end this same state contract. The Florida Pregnancy Care Network is a private nonprofit with over 95 locations statewide. Critics say centers in the network can be mistaken for reproductive health clinics that provide pregnancy care but are actually nonmedical facilities.

Cardinal Health recently appointed Robert Musslewhite and Sudhakar Ramakrishna to its Board of Directors, which may have reinforced investor confidence, culminating in a 5% share price increase over the last quarter. These appointments enhance the company's governance with expertise from healthcare and cybersecurity sectors. Despite the Dow Jones and other major indices facing declines due to economic concerns and tariff-related uncertainty, Cardinal Health sustained positive momentum. The company's Q2 2025 earnings demonstrated an increase in net income to $400 million from $368 million YoY, and diluted EPS rose to $1.65. Additionally, the firm's affirmation of a quarterly dividend of $0.51 and their active share buyback program of $75 million indicate a commitment to returning value to shareholders, potentially contributing to the stock's upward trajectory amid a backdrop of broader market challenges.

See the full analysis report here for a deeper understanding of Cardinal Health.

The past five years have been rewarding for Cardinal Health's shareholders, with the company achieving a 231.41% total return, including share price appreciation and dividends. While accounting for its performance, several key developments have emerged. In 2024, Cardinal Health successfully expanded its operational footprint, opening a 350,000 sq. ft. facility in South Carolina. The earnings growth over the past year was impressive at a sensational pace compared to the healthcare industry average, contributing to a favorable outlook. Notably, the company maintained attractive valuations, trading at good value relative to both its peers and the estimated fair value, further enhancing its long-term appeal. Additionally, the successful execution of share buyback programs, with over 3.4 million shares repurchased by the end of 2024, signaled management's focus on enhancing shareholder value.

Despite reporting a 4% decline in sales in early 2025, net income for the quarter increased, underscoring the company's ability to boost profitability even in challenging circumstances. Furthermore, Cardinal Health's earnings per share guidance for 2025 was raised, reflecting successful acquisitions that positively impacted revenue. Alongside strategic client partnerships, such as the agreement with T2 Biosystems for selling rapid sepsis diagnostics, these efforts have fortified the company's market position. While Cardinal Health's one-year return lagged behind the overall US market by a small margin, it markedly outpaced the US healthcare industry, which bore a 4.4% decrease over the same period. This performance underscores Cardinal Health's resilience and adaptability in a rapidly evolving landscape.

The president’s deregulatory bent means more responsibility rests on the shoulders of healthcare stakeholders to get artificial intelligence right.

Healthcare companies struggling to adopt artificial intelligence amid a lack of federal standards are unlikely to get any help from the Trump administration, placing the burden of responsible implementation squarely on the industry’s shoulders.

That mandate is becoming increasingly difficult as the technology grows more complex, experts said during the HIMSS healthcare conference in Las Vegas.

“One thing that’s clear is that this administration is not going to regulate AI. Good or bad, take that for what it is,” Tanay Tandon, the CEO of provider automation company Commure, said during a panel.

President Donald Trump’s hands-off approach to AI governance means hospitals turning to the tools to save money and give overworked clinicians some relief will likely be operating in a regulatory gray area for at least the next four years.

The president says his goal is to free up U.S. developers to innovate. But that comes with downsides for tech developers and healthcare companies desperate for guardrails given AI’s proclivity to make mistakes, degrade over time and exacerbate existing bias.

Not to mention, a lack of national standards might actually hamper AI development and adoption, according to some experts.

“When there isn’t a federal framework, it can just absolutely cause all kinds of problems,” said Leigh Burchell, the chair of the Electronic Health Records Association. “We all just want to know what our rules are. And then we can comply.”

To date, a handful of federal agencies, including the HHS’ technology office, the CMS and the Food and Drug Administration, have published targeted rules around the use and quality of AI in healthcare. But neither Congress nor the executive branch have zeroed in on a comprehensive framework to regulate the models — despite some progress during the Biden administration, when an HHS task force was working to build a unified regulatory structure.

That task force unveiled a strategic plan in January — just 10 days before Trump’s inauguration. However, Trump nixed the blueprint in one of his first executive orders.

Meanwhile, federal employees working on AI oversight, including at the FDA, have been caught up in the Trump administration’s purge of the government’s workforce. Amid the turmoil, the future of the HHS office that oversees AI policy remains unclear.

As a result, what little momentum there was in Washington to create a concrete strategy for overseeing health AI appears to have stalled out, at least for now. In its place, Trump has announced the Stargate Project, a $500 billion investment deal with private companies to prioritize AI development and maintain U.S. supremacy in the space — a high-stakes bet that was immediately complicated by the release of DeepSeek, a high-performing and inexpensive open source model from China.

"The current administration — the brakes have come off and the accelerator has come down."

Brian Spisak

Program director of AI and leadership, Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative

The Trump administration did issue a request for information in early February to get public input on a potential national AI action plan. However, the plan’s wording makes clear the administration’s priorities: to “sustain and enhance America’s AI dominance, and to ensure that unnecessarily burdensome requirements do not hamper private sector AI innovation.”

The revocation of the Biden-era AI plan was largely symbolic, as agencies hadn’t yet gotten around to imposing any requirements on developers or users.

But in “the current administration — the brakes have come off and the accelerator has come down,” said Brian Spisak, program director of AI and leadership at Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative, at HIMSS. “There’s a lot of responsibility to leadership of health systems to find the optimal balance between innovation and speed and safety and tradition.”

That responsibility — which also rests on AI developers creating the models, software vendors weaving them into health records and the clinicians using them — is not negligible.

Currently, even the most futuristic AI at healthcare institutions is being used to automate administration, and only peripherally touches patient care. But that appears to be changing: There’s growing interest among medical organizations in more clinical use cases for AI, like tailoring treatment plans or helping clinicians arrive at a diagnosis, according to a survey from HIMSS conducted in the fall.

Many of those use cases involve generative AI, which can create original text and images. But such models are known to hallucinate, or provide answers that are factually incorrect or irrelevant. AI can leave important information out, an error known as omission. Models can also drift, a term for when an AI’s performance changes or degrades over time.

Given the increasing prevalence of AI in pulling data from EHR systems, transcribing doctor-patient visits and more, errors like these could interfere with clinicians’ ability to care for patients, experts say.

Meanwhile, the technology is advancing at a stunning rate. Last year, the healthcare industry was just beginning to come to terms with governance for generative AI. But now, the conversation has already moved onto AI agents, which can complete complex tasks largely unsupervised by humans.

Commure’s Tanay equated the current moment to when America moved from kerosene to electricity at the end of the 19th century.

“The way that we did things six months ago is completely irrelevant,” he said.

Because of the breakneck speed of development, federal standards from any administration would likely need to be flexible, experts say. 

The Biden administration’s HHS task force suggested the government could create guidelines around testing and piloting tools, along with some support for adoption. However, it shied away from a prescriptive approach.

That’s in line with the wish list from many stakeholders. Numerous executives at tech companies and hospital systems said any federal standards should be stratified by the level of risk an AI model imposes — for example, stricter oversight for algorithms that help doctors diagnose diseases, and looser restrictions for algorithms that help hospital staff allocate patients to beds.

“We have to weigh the balance between underregulation, which can potentially increase risk, and overregulation, which will stunt innovation,” said Anthony Chang, the chief intelligence and innovation officer at the Children’s Hospital of Orange County in California, during a panel.

“The current administration is more likely to be on the underregulation side. So we have to be careful as a profession that we don’t allow that to happen,” Chang said.

The lack of a playbook from Washington has left hospitals and medical groups scrambling to build their own internal controls amid a patchwork of state laws and voluntary standards released by industry groups.

States including Colorado, Utah and California have already enacted legislation establishing disclaimer requirements for AI systems. More states are considering similar laws: The Electronic Health Records Association is tracking 150 different state bills related to health AI, according to Burchell.

“There is a massive explosion of bills,” Burchell said.

But differing standards could stop health AI developers and software companies from rolling out products in specific states, potentially disadvantaging patients depending on where they live. More risk-averse software companies may avoid AI, or certain states, altogether, she added.

“Legislation of a lot of sizes and shapes at the state level is a risk to us, because it means we have to do all kinds of different development. We would rather develop one system that can be used broadly and accepted across the country,” Burchell said.

Health AI standards groups are also stepping into the gap left by the federal government. The groups — often made up of leading hospitals, digital health companies and tech giants — include the Health AI Partnership, an AI learning network for the industry, and the Coalition for Health AI, which recently launched an AI registry for hospitals.

”I think we’ll probably see more of these non-government organizations like Health AI Partnership and some of those emerge as maybe our north stars today, as here’s some leadership in the space,” said Rachel Wilkes, the corporate lead for generative AI initiatives at EHR vendor Meditech.

But standards from industry consortia hold little weight without the heft of the federal government behind them, experts say. Historically, voluntary standards aren’t particularly effective.

“There’s room for people to act in their own best interest, whatever that may be, without any sort of federal framework,” Wilkes said.

EHR vendors and hospital operators say they’re building up rigorous internal standards for AI tools, including validation and frequent auditing.

“Government oversight has its place, but I do think the way that clinical practice evolves tends to be more driven by what’s happening at a health system,” said Seth Howard, the executive vice president of research and development for Epic, the largest EHR company in the U.S.

In interviews, executives with Epic, Oracle, Meditech and eClinicalWorks said they’re making AI available to doctors with rigorous oversight, including back-end accuracy checks and ongoing monitoring.

However, tech leaders stressed that it’s also the hospital and the clinicians’ responsibility to make sure everything is working as planned.

“We are working in an industry that deals with human life. It cannot be trivial. It cannot be under-exaggerated on what guardrails and checks and balances and what discussions need to happen,” said Girish Navani, the CEO of eClinicalWorks.

Technology behemoths betting heavily on AI feel similarly. Google, for example, has worked with for-profit hospital giant HCA on an evaluation framework to catch any errors generated by its AI models and ensure their reliability, according to Aashima Gupta, the head of healthcare for Google Cloud.

“We provide those tools for an evaluation framework, and for all of this there’s a human in the loop capturing the feedback, and that feedback loop then makes the model more effective,” Gupta said. “That’s what gives me comfort.”

"We are working in an industry that deals with human life. It cannot be trivial. It cannot be under-exaggerated on what guardrails and checks and balances and what discussions need to happen."

Though some in the private sector say they’ve got governance handled, modern AI is incredibly hard to oversee, according to AI engineers. The main advantage of generative AI — its creativity — also introduces subjectivity, making grading its outputs complicated.

For example, if two clinicians are tasked to summarize a patient’s medical history based on clinical notes, their results could be incredibly different, albeit still accurate. It’s the same with generative AI, experts say: How do you measure quality in a standardized way when there’s that degree of variability?

“AI governance is still very much a maturing process,” said Harvard’s Spisak.

Hospital executives say they’re tackling oversight carefully. But some research suggests governance systems for simpler predictive AI models already aren’t rigorous enough. Hospitals with explicit procedures for the use and assessment of AI tools are still struggling to identify and mitigate problems, according to a study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Even some of the most well-resourced and tech-savvy systems are struggling.

The Cleveland Clinic has an AI governing body that includes stakeholders from across the academic medical center, according to Rohit Chandra, the Cleveland Clinic’s chief digital officer. The task force oversees AI’s impact on the organization’s patients and workers while ensuring clinical safety and discussing thorny questions of privacy, legality and bias.

But “I don’t think we’ve figured it all out,” Chandra said during a panel. “The term hallucination, for one, has just shown up in the last two, three years. And we still don’t quite know how to deal with it.”

Hospitals should try to make specific people accountable for the performance of the tools, as part of a larger governing body that includes executives, lawyers, doctors and nurses, according to Brenton Hill, the head of operations at standards group CHAI.

Hospitals need to decide how to monitor AI effectively and report that information, which can depend on the products they have in place. They also need to consider what resources the AI will use and develop appropriate data use agreements with AI vendors, Hill said during a panel.

But “there’s not one silver bullet governance structure that you can put out there that will solve all your problems,” Hill said.

Though a road map from federal regulators would be helpful, stakeholders working to integrate AI tools into healthcare said they’re not holding their breath.

“While self-regulation is good, we don’t believe that’s sufficient. We believe AI is too important not to be regulated,” said Google’s Gupta.

But when asked what she expects from the Trump administration, Gupta was noncommittal. “It’s hard to say at this point. We are trying to figure out how we best work with them, share our best practices with them ... Too early to say. I think the entire healthcare community is waiting for that,” Gupta said.

Other experts said the Trump administration is a wake-up call for hospital executives who believed Washington could assume responsibility for overseeing AI.

Instead, the mandate should be on everyone touching the technology to ensure AI algorithms — given their shifting nature and innate opacity — perform as they’re designed, especially in an industry where any mistakes could impact patient health.

“The easy answer is, if this regulatory body says it’s safe, then I can trust it. I think people were hoping that might happen for AI,” said Aaron Neinstein, the chief medical officer of agentic AI company Notable. “I think that was a pipe dream.”

On March 7, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that its Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is investigating four medical schools and hospitals under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (Section 1557).

The investigations are in response to allegations OCR received that certain medical schools and hospitals that receive HHS funding may operate medical education, training, or scholarship programs that discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex. 

HHS stated that the investigations align with President Trump’s Executive Order 14173, Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity. 

“Today’s actions restore merit-based opportunities in medicine and signify that hard-working health care professionals and high-achieving students in the pipeline for medical and nursing fields should not be demeaned at work, or excluded from professional or scholarship opportunities, because of their race or sex,” said Anthony Archeval, Acting Director of the OCR at HHS, in a statement.</p>

5 On Your Side at Noon

MISSOURI, USA — A growing crisis has swallowed numerous nursing homes around Missouri. Growing threats of Medicaid cuts nationwide threaten to plunge that crisis into catastrophe.

Five major nursing homes throughout the state shut down over the past year, including Festus Manor and Northview Village near St. Louis. Both closed due to reported financial issues.

Around 67% of Missouri's nursing homes are largely funded by Medicaid, including over 95% of nursing homes in St. Louis, according to Lenny Jones, the Missouri state director of Service Employees International Union Healthcare, which represents workers in health care, child care, home care and nursing homes throughout the Midwest.

The state's nursing homes are now bracing for Republicans' proposed billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, which could end health care for millions of adults and children. The Medicaid cuts would fund tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, while leaving the poorest Americans without access to life-saving medical care. 

"They're trying to make these $800 billion worth of cuts in Medicaid programs to fund tax cuts for the wealthy," Jones told 5 On Your Side. "This is a very perverse demand that says that wealthy people need even more money. How are they going to get more money? They're going to take it from hardworking Missourians."

The state's nursing homes already suffer from staffing shortages, poor care standards and lack of federal compliance. 

Missouri has the smallest number of hours of care per day per resident of any other state in the nation, and a 2024 St. Louis Board of Alders report said all of the city's nursing homes are run by for-profit enterprises, which have severely cut costs to boost profits.

Proposed Medicaid cuts would only worsen the already present problems, according to Jones.

"If lawmakers go into a setting where nursing homes already have problems that are a direct result of poor staffing and cut funding, nursing homes will have to cut staffing," Jones said. "When you cut back on staffing, the care gets worse. When you cut back on staffing, it puts more burden on nursing home workers who have to take care of more residents, and then they feel the brunt of the pain from family members when their loved one isn't getting the care they deserve because the staff is stretched so thin."

Shunda Whitfield works for the Estates of Spanish Lake Nursing and Rehabilitation Facility and is also a member of SEIU. While she does worry about what Medicaid cuts mean for nursing home care's future, she worries more about the hundreds of thousands of children and people with disabilities who would no longer have health care if the cuts are approved.

"There would be 1.3 million Missourians affected if Medicaid is cut, with over 600,000 children in Missouri alone who rely on Medicaid," Whitfield said. "It would affect my job, but it's not just about my job. It's about what the people who are disabled, children, seniors, people with in-home health care ... where would these cuts leave them? That's my biggest worry."</p>

In a new plan, CVS is cutting its traditional stores in half and sweeping out the skincare, pretzels, and stationery you would expect at a standard location.

The drugstore giant is preparing to open 12 new mini-stores in cities and towns across the U.S. by this time next year focusing on a full-service pharmacy with healthcare products, including over-the-counter pain medications and first-aid supplies, per a Saturday report from The Wall Street Journal.

The mini-stores will not offer other consumer goods usually expected in a CVS like shampoo and greeting cards.

At around 5,000 square feet, the new stores will be less than half the size of a typical CVS, which ranges from 11,000 to 15,000 square feet. CVS is in the early phase of developing the new stores and plans to have the first few locations operating by the end of 2025.

Julie Utterback, senior equity analyst for Morningstar, told WSJ that 80% of CVS's sales last year came from its pharmacy department — so focusing mini-stores on that division made sense.

"That is where most of the value is generated," Utterback told the outlet. "The front of the store operations has been in question for a while."

In 2023, 78.9% of CVS's revenue came from prescription drugs while 21.1% came from front store and other products. CVS's latest earnings report, released last month for the final quarter of 2024, showed that the drugstore chain saw sales growth of 4.2% from the same time a year ago, partly due to growth in its pharmacy business. CVS sales hit $97.71 billion in Q4 2024.

CVS and other drugstore chains like Walgreens have struggled recently to contend with foot traffic and heightened competition from retailers like Walmart.

According to CNN Business, the front end of drugstores, with snacks and toiletries, have seen fewer sales as shoppers turn to Amazon, Walmart, and Target to fill those needs. In response to these challenges, CVS has closed stores and undertaken cost-cutting measures.

CVS laid off nearly 3,000 workers in October 2024 and closed 900 stores (while opening 100 new locations) over the past three years as part of a plan announced in November 2021. It plans to close another 270 stores, and open 30, in 2025.

Rival Walgreens has also been closing stores. In October 2024, the company said that it would shut 1,200 locations over the next three years, with 500 stores slated to close in 2025.

Walgreens also agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners last week in a $10 billion deal as part of its turnaround plan.

CVS had more than 9,000 locations as of December 31 making it the biggest pharmacy in the U.S.

KKR stock is sliding after making an improved bid for U.K. healthcare group Assura

Shares in private equity group KKR & Co were off over 7% today after it sweetened a multi-billion dollar deal for British healthcare property developer Assura.

KKR has followed the old Scottish adage of “if you don’t succeed once, then try, try again,” by making a fifth attempt to buy Assura since last September. All four previous bids have been turned down.

In a statement today Assura said it is now considering an indicative, non-binding proposal from KKR and Stonepeak Partners of 49.4p per share. That is a premium of about a third to Assura’s closing share price on February 13th and values the company at around $2.08billion. It is also higher than the last offer KKR made at 48p per share. The Assura board said it is likely to recommend the offer to shareholders and will engage in discussions with KKR and Stonepeak.

Assura, running more than 600 properties with an investment value of about £3.2 billion as of last September, counts the UK’s state-backed and under-pressure National Health Service as a customer. Analysts said that the higher price means that KKR is very keen to get the deal over the line. Significantly it did not include involvement from pension fund USS Investment Management which joined KKR in making the February bid.

Despite the uncertainty over the deal shown by KKR investors today, a successful conclusion might see more moves from private equity firms on the downtrodden U.K. real estate sector.

On TipRanks, KKR has a Strong Buy consensus based on 11 Buy and 3 Hold ratings. Its highest target price is $214. KKR stock’s consensus price target is $173.77 implying an 63.06% upside.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>

A recent Finnish study suggests that limiting screen time and promoting physical activity from childhood may help safeguard mental health in adolescence. The findings are particularly significant given that mental health problems affect up to 30% of young people and pose a growing societal challenge.

The study, conducted by the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences at the University of Jyväskylä and the Institute of Biomedicine at the University of Eastern Finland, followed 187 adolescents over an eight-year period. Researchers found that children who spent more time on screens -especially mobile devices - were more likely to experience higher levels of stress and depressive symptoms in adolescence.

Conversely, higher levels of physical activity and participation in organized sports were associated with lower stress and fewer depressive symptoms. However, the link between physical activity and depressive symptoms was weaker than that of screen time and depressive symptoms. Adolescents with both high screen time and low physical activity had the highest levels of stress and depressive symptoms.

Several international, evidence-based recommendations suggest that the leisure screen time of children and adolescents should be limited to two hours per day.

Personally, I think that even this figure is high, as it amounts to almost one month of screen time per year."

Eero Haapala, Senior Lecturer from the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, University of Jyväskylä 

These findings emphasize the need to promote healthy lifestyle habits early in life. Encouraging children to engage in physical activity and setting reasonable limits on screen time could play a crucial role in preventing mental health challenges later in life.

"The modern sedentary lifestyle, with high screen exposure, challenges the mental health of children and adolescents," says Dr Eero Haapala.

"Recent discussions have rightly focused on screen time and social media, but I hope our findings encourage adults in young people's lives to promote a broad spectrum of healthy habits - especially by balancing screen time and physical activity."

"Achieving change requires collaboration," Haapala emphasizes.

"Society as a whole - from families to policymakers - must invest in promoting healthy lifestyles for children and adolescents by ensuring balanced screen time, sufficient physical activity, adequate sleep, and a nutritious diet."

The PANIC Study is part of the Metabolic Diseases Research Community at the University of Eastern Finland. The research community is dedicated to investigating major cardiometabolic diseases. By leveraging genetics, genomics, translational research, and lifestyle interventions, the community aims to provide robust evidence on disease mechanisms and advance early diagnosis, prevention, and personalized treatment. The research community consists of 20 research groups, spanning basic research to patient care.

“Expanding scanner access is a key element of our strategy to drive Nociscan to standard of care for patients with chronic low back pain,” said Brent Ness, Chief Executive Officer of Aclarion. “The additional sites RadNet is onboarding will help us enable more convenient access to grow scan volume in response to physician demand.

On February 25, 2025, President Trump signed “Making America Healthy Again with Clear, Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare Pricing Information,” an Executive Order with the stated purpose of making group health plans and health insurance issuers accountable for compliance with price transparency rules implemented during the first Trump administration.

Specifically, during his first administration, President Trump signed Executive Order 13877 – “Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First,” seeking to address what the new Executive Order describes as “opaque healthcare pricing arrangements” and insufficient accountability concerning healthcare pricing practices. Under Executive Order 13877, regulations were created requiring group health plans to:

The new Executive Order referenced an unidentified 2023 economic analysis that estimated full implementation of the regulations might result in as much as $80 million in healthcare savings by 2025 for consumers, employers, and insurers. An unidentified 2024 report was also referenced for the proposition that price transparency could help employers reduce healthcare costs across 500 common healthcare services.

To address what was described as “stalled” progress on price transparency during the intervening administration, the new Executive Order gave the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services 90 days to act to:

Power of the Herd



KEARNEY – More than 60 high school seniors will begin their studies at the University of Nebraska at Kearney this fall as members of a prestigious health science program.

Representing communities across the state, the students selected for the Kearney Health Opportunities Program (KHOP) demonstrate both academic excellence and a commitment to serving rural areas as future health care professionals.

“Improving access to health care in rural Nebraska starts with investing in the next generation of providers. Through the KHOP program, we are equipping passionate and dedicated students with the education and support they need to make an impact in the communities that need them the most,” said Peggy Abels, director of UNK Health Sciences.

According to a report from the University of Nebraska Medical Center, more than 80% of the state’s health diagnosing and treating practitioners are based in metropolitan areas, creating an accessibility issue for many rural residents.

The KHOP program was created to help even the playing field.

Launched in 2010, it’s designed to grow the state’s health care workforce by recruiting and training students from rural Nebraska who are committed to practicing in these communities as professionals. The program offers financial assistance, academic support and professional development opportunities, with many participants receiving full-tuition scholarships to attend UNK and guaranteed admission to UNMC.

KHOP members can study in the fields of dental hygiene, dentistry, medical laboratory science, medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, pharmacy, physical therapy, physician assistant and radiography.

Participants also receive a $3,000 room waiver through the KHOP Learning Community. A requirement for freshmen, the one-year residential learning community gives students a chance to explore various health care careers while receiving support and guidance as they transition to college. KHOP members meet with health care providers and tour medical facilities throughout the region, better preparing them for professional school and beyond.

More than 160 students are currently part of KHOP, and the 62 high school seniors accepted for fall 2025 represent the second-largest class in program history. A record-breaking 72 students were admitted last year.

“By growing our own health care workforce, we’re taking an important step toward addressing the provider shortage and strengthening rural health care for years to come,” Abels said. “It’s very encouraging to see such an outstanding group of students who are committed to rural health and making a real difference in their hometowns.”

KKR has partnered with Stonepeak Partners to make a £1.6bn (€1.9bn) bid for UK healthcare property investor Assura, after KKR’s previous offer with UK’s Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), which was 2.9% lower, was rejected last month.

The board of Assura said the latest possible cash offer of 49.4p per share, which consists of a declared 0.84p quarterly dividend and 48.56p cash at closing, would likely receive their recommendation to shareholders, subject to the agreement of the other terms of the offer.

Assura also disclosed receiving a non-binding all-share merger proposal from Primary Health Properties (PHP), valued at 43p per Assura share but said the KKR consortium’s 49.4p cash offer was more attractive and therefore rejected the PHP proposal.

Last month, Assura rejected a £1.56bn possible offer from KKR and USS. Following the rejection, USS said it did not intend to make an offer for Assura, as part of the consortium or otherwise.

At the time, KKR said it was considering whether to continue engaging with the board, but there is no guarantee that a firm offer will be made.

London-listed Assura, designs, builds, invests in and manages general practitioner and primary care buildings in the UK. As of the third quarter of last year, the company owned 625 healthcare buildings across the UK and Ireland, valued at  £3.2bn.

What does America want out of its health care system in 2025?

It’s a question that’s been on Emory University professor Dr. Stephen Patrick’s mind, and now over 2,000 U.S. adults have answered back.

Patrick, chair of the Rollins School of Public Health’s Department of Health Policy, and his team recently published their findings from the Rollins-Gallup Public Health Priorities Survey, offering a look at what’s on the nation’s mind.

Emory University partnered with Gallup to conduct self-administered web interviews to U.S. adults from Dec. 2 to Dec. 15 last year. The 2,121 respondents were asked to rank public health issues — ranging from affordability to social isolation — based on what government and public health leaders should consider the highest priorities for 2025.

According to Patrick, timing was everything.

“When we started the process, we didn’t know who was going to be in office and we intentionally fielded it after the election with results to come out just shortly after we had somebody sworn in,” Patrick told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “So the goal of this was to not have our voices, but have Americans’ voices on where they wanted public health to be in the new administration.”



Over half (52%) of respondents ranked “improving health care access and affordability” as one of their top three public health concerns, making it the most unanimously agreed upon issue. Precisely a quarter of respondents ranked it as their first concern.



“They’re big problems, when we look at the top four priorities: improving health care access and affordability, reducing chronic disease, safe food and water and then protecting the safety net (Medicare, Medicaid, and free clinics),” Patrick said. “Those are things where Americans said, across party lines, there needs to be a substantial federal role.”

The survey also asked respondents if federal or state government was more effective at addressing their top public health priorities. For all three highest ranked public health issues, respondents sided with the federal government.

“But each one of those also involves state and local government,” Patrick added. “Each one of them involves an element of what we do locally. Like, we can’t improve chronic disease without being really local and doing the things that we do to help each other be healthy.”

Respondents were also asked if the U.S. made progress, lost ground or not changed over the last decade concerning eight key areas of public health.

“One of the things that struck me is, for every item we tested, there was not a single issue where more than half the country thought we had made progress,” he said. “But there were three areas in particular where they think we had lost ground.”

A majority of respondents said the nation has lost ground in the opioid epidemic. Half said the same about mental health nationwide. And nearly half (47%) believed the U.S. has lost ground with healthy dieting and lifestyles. However, 36% of people said the U.S. has made progress at improving the health outcomes of those with chronic diseases.

Lastly, respondents were asked to select their three most trusted sources of public health information. Out of 15 options, three topped the rankings: doctor, nurse or health care providers (54%), scientific research and studies (42%) and the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (37%).

While social media only earned a comparatively slender 9% of the overall votes, 16% of adults 18 to 29 placed it within their top three most trusted sources.

“Non-Hispanic Black Americans and Republican men (including Republican leaners) were also among the groups most likely to pick social media as a top trusted source for public health information — at 16% and 12%, respectively,” according to the survey report.



When asked what government leaders should take from the survey results, the Emory University professor explained that it offers direction for what the American people want this year.

“I think what Americans are telling us is that there’s a clear road map for where they want us to go,” Patrick said. “As we think about the next couple of years, we should be thinking about bolstering systems that ensure access to care, reduce costs and that are focused on the other priorities that Americans have.

“Making sure that our food and water are safe, reducing chronic disease — Americans have given us a blueprint. What they want us to do is more, not less. They want us to make sure that we are bolstering the systems that are there. And they also told us that there’s a strong federal role for that, across party lines. Whether they were Republicans or Democrats, most — by a wide margin — told us that their top priorities should have the federal government play a leading role.”

BOLIGEE, Ala. — Green lights flickered on the wireless router in Barbara Williams’ kitchen. Just one bar lit up — a weak signal connecting her to the world beyond her home in the Alabama Black Belt.


		This story also ran on InvestigateTV. It can be republished for free.	

Next to the router sat medications, vitamin D pills, and Williams’ blood glucose monitor kit.

“I haven’t used that thing in a month or so,” said Williams, 72, waving toward the kit. Diagnosed with diabetes more than six years ago, she has developed nerve pain from neuropathy in both legs.

Williams is one of nearly 3 million Americans who live in mostly rural counties that lack both health care and reliable high-speed internet, according to an analysis by KFF Health News, which showed that these people tend to live sicker and die younger than others in America.

Compared with those in other regions, patients across the rural South, Appalachia, and remote West are most often unable to make a video call to their doctor or log into their patient portals. Both are essential ways to participate in the U.S. medical system. And Williams is among those who can do neither.

This year, more than $42 billion allocated in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is expected to begin flowing to states as part of a national “Internet for All” initiative launched by the Biden administration. But the program faces uncertainty after Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick last week announced a “rigorous review” asserting that the previous administration’s approach was full of “woke mandates.”

High rates of chronic illness and historical inequities are hallmarks of many of the more than 200 U.S. counties with poor services that KFF Health News identified. Dozens of doctors, academics, and advocates interviewed for this article unanimously agreed that limited internet service hinders medical care and access.

Without fast, reliable broadband, “all we’re going to do is widen health care disparities within telemedicine,” said Rashmi Mullur, an endocrinologist and chief of telehealth at VA Greater Los Angeles. Patients with diabetes who also use telemedicine are more likely to get care and control their blood sugar, Mullur found.

Diabetes requires constant management. Left untreated, uncontrolled blood sugar can cause blindness, kidney failure, nerve damage, and eventually death.

Williams, who sees a nurse practitioner at the county hospital in the next town, said she is not interested in using remote patient monitoring or video calls.

“I know how my sugar affects me,” Williams said. “I get a headache if it’s too high.” She gets weaker when it’s down, she said, and always carries snacks like crackers or peppermints.

Williams said she could even drink a soda pop — orange, grape — when her sugar is low but would not drink one when she felt it was high because she would get “kind of goozie-woozy.”

‘This Is America’

Connectivity dead zones persist in American life despite at least $115 billion lawmakers have thrown toward fixing the inequities. Federal broadband efforts are fragmented and overlapping, with more than 133 funding programs administered by 15 agencies, according to a 2023 federal report.

“This is America. It’s not supposed to be this way,” said Karthik Ganesh, chief executive of Tampa, Florida-based OnMed, a telehealth company that in September installed a walk-in booth at the Boligee Community Center about 10 minutes from Williams’ home. Residents can call up free life-size video consultations with an OnMed health care provider and use equipment to check their weight and blood pressure.

OnMed, which partnered with local universities and the Alabama Cooperative Extension System, relies on SpaceX’s Starlink to provide a high-speed connection in lieu of other options.

A short drive from the community center, beyond Boligee’s Main Street with its deserted buildings and an empty railroad depot and down a long gravel drive, is the 22-acre property where Williams lives.

Last fall, Williams washed a dish in her kitchen, with its unforgiving linoleum-topped concrete floors. A few months earlier, she said, a man at the community center signed her up for “diabetic shoes” to help with her sore feet. They never arrived.

As Williams spoke, steam rose from a pot of boiling potatoes on the stove. Another pan sizzled with hamburger steak. And on a back burner simmered a mix of Velveeta cheese, diced tomatoes, and peppers.

She spent years on her feet as head cook at a diner in Cleveland, Ohio. The oldest of nine, Williams returned to her family home in Greene County more than 20 years ago to care for her mother and a sister, who both died from cancer in the back bedroom where she now sleeps.

Williams looked out a window and recalled when the landscape was covered in cotton that she once helped pick. Now three houses stand in a carefully tended clearing surrounded by tall trees. One belongs to a brother and the other to a sister who drives with her daily to the community center for exercise, prayers, and friendship with other seniors.

All the surviving siblings, Williams said, have diabetes. “I don’t know how we became diabetic,” she said. Neither of their parents had been diagnosed with the illness.

In Greene County, an estimated quarter of adults have diabetes — twice the national average. The county, which has about 7,600 residents, also has among the nation’s highest rates for several chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, stroke, and obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows.

The county’s population is predominately Black. The federal CDC reports that Black Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and are 40% more likely than their white counterparts to die from the condition. And in the South, rural Black residents are more likely to lack home internet access, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank.

To identify counties most lacking in reliable broadband and health care providers, KFF Health News used data from the Federal Communications Commission and George Washington University’s Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity. Reporters also analyzed U.S. Census Bureau, CDC, and other data to understand the health status and demographics of those counties.

The analysis confirms that internet and care gaps are “hitting areas of extreme poverty and high social vulnerability,” said Clese Erikson, deputy director of the health workforce research center at the Mullan Institute.

Digital Haves vs. Have-Nots

Just over half of homes in Greene County have access to reliable high-speed internet — among the lowest rates in the nation. Greene County also has some of the country’s poorest residents, with a median household income of about $31,500. Average life expectancy is less than 72 years, below the national average.

By contrast, the KFF Health News analysis found that counties with the highest rates of internet access and health care providers correlated with higher life expectancy, less chronic disease, and key lifestyle factors such as higher incomes and education levels.

One of those is Howard County, Maryland, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., where nearly all homes can connect to fast, reliable internet. The median household income is about $147,000 and average life expectancy is more than 82 years — a decade longer than in Greene County. A much smaller share of residents live with chronic conditions such as diabetes.

One is 78-year-old Sam Wilderson, a retired electrical engineer who has managed his Type 2 diabetes for more than a decade. He has fiber-optic internet at his home, which is a few miles from a cafe he dines at every week after Bible study. On a recent day, the cafe had a guest Wi-Fi download speed of 104 megabits per second and a 148 Mbps upload speed. The speeds are fast enough for remote workers to reliably take video calls.

Americans are demanding more speed than ever before. Most households have multiple devices — televisions, computers, gaming systems, doorbells — in addition to phones that can take up bandwidth. The more devices connected, the higher minimum speeds are needed to keep everything running smoothly.

To meet increasing needs, federal regulators updated the definition of broadband last year, establishing standard speeds of 100/20 Mbps. Those speeds are typically enough for several users to stream, browse, download, and play games at the same time.

Christopher Ali, professor of telecommunications at Penn State, recommends minimum standard speeds of 100/100 Mbps. While download speeds enable consumption, such as streaming or shopping, fast upload speeds are necessary to participate in video calls, say, for work or telehealth.

At the cafe in Howard County, on a chilly morning last fall, Wilderson ordered a glass of white wine and his usual: three-seeded bread with spinach, goat cheese, smoked salmon, and over-easy eggs. After eating, Wilderson held up his wrist: “This watch allows me to track my diabetes without pricking my finger.”

Wilderson said he works with his doctors, feels young, and expects to live well into his 90s, just as his father and grandfather did.

Telehealth is crucial for people in areas with few or no medical providers, said Ry Marcattilio, an associate director of research at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. The national research and advocacy group works with communities on broadband access and reviewed KFF Health News’ findings.

High-speed internet makes it easier to use video visits for medical checkups, which most patients with diabetes need every three months.

Being connected “can make a huge difference in diabetes outcomes,” said Nestoras Mathioudakis, an endocrinologist and co-medical director of Johns Hopkins Medicine Diabetes & Education Program, who treats patients in Howard County.

Paying More for Less

At Williams’ home in Alabama, pictures of her siblings and their kids cover the walls of the hallway and living room. A large, wood-framed image of Jesus at the Last Supper with his disciples hangs over her kitchen table.

Williams sat down as her pots simmered and sizzled. She wasn’t feeling quite right. “I had a glass of orange juice and a bag of potato chips, and I knew that wasn’t enough for breakfast, but I was cooking,” Williams said.

Every night Williams takes a pill to control her diabetes. In the morning, if she feels as if her sugar is dropping, she knows she needs to eat. So, that morning, she left the room to grab a peppermint, walking by the flickering wireless router.

The router’s download and upload speeds were 0.03/0.05 Mbps, nearly unusable by modern standards. Williams’ connection on her house phone can sound scratchy, and when she connects her cellphone to the router, it does not always work. Most days it’s just good enough for her to read a daily devotional website and check Facebook, though the stories don’t always load.

Rural residents like Williams paid nearly $13 more a month on average in late 2020 for slow internet connections than those in urban areas, according to Brian Whitacre, an agricultural economics professor at Oklahoma State University.

“You’re more likely to have competition in an urban area,” Whitacre said.

In rural Alabama, cellphone and internet options are limited. Williams pays $51.28 a month to her wireless provider, Ring Planet, which did not respond to calls and emails.

In Howard County, Maryland, national fiber-optic broadband provider Verizon Communications faces competition from Comcast, a hybrid fiber-optic and cable provider. Verizon advertises a home internet plan promising speeds of 300/300 Mbps starting at $35 a month for its existing mobile customers. The company also offers a discounted price as low as $20 a month for customers who participate in certain federal assistance programs.

“Internet service providers look at the economics of going into some of these communities and there just isn’t enough purchasing power in their minds to warrant the investment,” said Ross DeVol, chief executive of Heartland Forward, a nonpartisan think tank based in Bentonville, Arkansas, that specializes in state and local economic development.

Conexon, a fiber-optic cable construction company, estimates it costs $25,000 per mile to build above-ground fiber lines on poles and $60,000 to $70,000 per mile to build underground.

Former President Joe Biden’s 2021 infrastructure law earmarked $65 billion with a goal of connecting all Americans to high-speed internet. Money was designated to establish digital equity programs and to help low-income customers pay their internet bills. The law also set aside tens of billions through the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, to connect homes and businesses.

That effort prioritizes fiber-optic connections, but federal regulators recently outlined guidance for alternative technologies, including low Earth orbit satellites like SpaceX’s Starlink service.

Funding the use of satellites in federal broadband programs has been controversial inside federal agencies. It has also been a sore point for Elon Musk, who is chief executive of SpaceX, which runs Starlink, and is a lead adviser to President Donald Trump.

After preliminary approval, a federal commission ruled that Starlink’s satellite system was “not reasonably capable” of offering reliable high speeds. Musk tweeted last year that the commission had “illegally revoked” money awarded under the agency’s Trump-era Rural Digital Opportunity Fund.

In February, Trump nominated Arielle Roth to lead the federal agency overseeing the infrastructure act’s BEAD program. Roth is telecommunications policy director for the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Last year, she criticized the program’s emphasis on fiber and said it was beleaguered by a “woke social agenda” with too many regulations.

Commerce Secretary Lutnick last week said he will get rid of “burdensome regulations” and revamp the program to “take a tech-neutral approach.” Republicans echoed his positions during a U.S. House subcommittee hearing the same day.

When asked about potentially weakening the program’s required low-cost internet option, former National Telecommunications and Information Administration official Sarah Morris said such a change would build internet connections that people can’t afford. Essentially, she said, they would be “building bridges to nowhere, building networks to no one.”

'That Hurt’

Over a lunch of tortilla chips with the savory sauce that had been simmering on the stove, Williams said she hadn’t been getting regular checkups before her diabetes diagnosis.

“To tell you the truth, if I can get up and move and nothing is bothering me, I don’t go to the doctor,” Williams said. “I’m just being honest.”

Years ago, Williams recalled, “my head was hurting me so bad I had to just lay down. I couldn’t stand up, walk, or nothing. I’d get so dizzy.”

Williams thought it was her blood pressure, but the doctor checked for diabetes. “How did they know? I don’t know,” Williams said.

As lunch ended, she pulled out her glucose monitor. Williams connected the needle and wiped her finger with an alcohol pad. Then she pricked her finger.

“Oh,” Williams said, sucking air through her teeth. “That hurt.”

She placed the sample in the machine, and it quickly displayed a reading of 145 — a number, Williams said, that meant she needed to stop eating.

Here’s how KFF Health News did its analysis for the “Dead Zone” series, which pinpointed counties that lag behind the rest of the United States in access to broadband service and health care providers.

To identify “dead zones,” KFF Health News consulted two main data sources.

GWU’s data for behavioral health providers reflects psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, therapists, and addiction medicine specialists, regardless of whether their patients receive Medicaid. We used data from 2021, the most recent year available.

We classified counties as “dead zones” if they met these criteria:

A total of 210 counties met those criteria. At the other extreme, we defined 203 counties as “most served” if they had the most residences with broadband access (at least 96.7%) and ranked in the top third of Medicaid primary care and behavioral health provider ratios.

We also compared the health outcomes and demographics of dead zone counties relative to others using several data sources:

He has fiber-optic internet at his home, which is a few miles from a cafe he dines at every week after Bible study. On a recent day, the cafe had a guest Wi-Fi download speed of 104 megabits per second and a 148 Mbps upload speed. The speeds are fast enough for remote workers to reliably take video calls.

Americans are demanding more speed than ever before. Most households have multiple devices — televisions, computers, gaming systems, doorbells — in addition to phones that can take up bandwidth. The more devices connected, the higher minimum speeds are needed to keep everything running smoothly.

To meet increasing needs, federal regulators updated the definition of broadband last year, establishing standard speeds of 100/20 Mbps. Those speeds are typically enough for several users to stream, browse, download, and play games at the same time.

Christopher Ali, professor of telecommunications at Penn State, recommends minimum standard speeds of 100/100 Mbps. While download speeds enable consumption, such as streaming or shopping, fast upload speeds are necessary to participate in video calls, say, for work or telehealth.

At the cafe in Howard County, on a chilly morning last fall, Wilderson ordered a glass of white wine and his usual: three-seeded bread with spinach, goat cheese, smoked salmon, and over-easy eggs. After eating, Wilderson held up his wrist: “This watch allows me to track my diabetes without pricking my finger.”

Wilderson said he works with his doctors, feels young, and expects to live well into his 90s, just as his father and grandfather did.

Telehealth is crucial for people in areas with few or no medical providers, said Ry Marcattilio, an associate director of research at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. The national research and advocacy group works with communities on broadband access and reviewed KFF Health News’ findings.

High-speed internet makes it easier to use video visits for medical checkups, which most patients with diabetes need every three months.

Being connected “can make a huge difference in diabetes outcomes,” said Nestoras Mathioudakis, an endocrinologist and co-medical director of Johns Hopkins Medicine Diabetes & Education Program, who treats patients in Howard County.

Paying More for Less

At Williams’ home in Alabama, pictures of her siblings and their kids cover the walls of the hallway and living room. A large, wood-framed image of Jesus at the Last Supper with his disciples hangs over her kitchen table.

Williams sat down as her pots simmered and sizzled. She wasn’t feeling quite right. “I had a glass of orange juice and a bag of potato chips, and I knew that wasn’t enough for breakfast, but I was cooking,” Williams said.

Every night Williams takes a pill to control her diabetes. In the morning, if she feels as if her sugar is dropping, she knows she needs to eat. So, that morning, she left the room to grab a peppermint, walking by the flickering wireless router.

The router’s download and upload speeds were 0.03/0.05 Mbps, nearly unusable by modern standards. Williams’ connection on her house phone can sound scratchy, and when she connects her cellphone to the router, it does not always work. Most days it’s just good enough for her to read a daily devotional website and check Facebook, though the stories don’t always load.

Rural residents like Williams paid nearly $13 more a month on average in late 2020 for slow internet connections than those in urban areas, according to Brian Whitacre, an agricultural economics professor at Oklahoma State University.

“You’re more likely to have competition in an urban area,” Whitacre said.

In rural Alabama, cellphone and internet options are limited. Williams pays $51.28 a month to her wireless provider, Ring Planet, which did not respond to calls and emails.

In Howard County, Maryland, national fiber-optic broadband provider Verizon Communications faces competition from Comcast, a hybrid fiber-optic and cable provider. Verizon advertises a home internet plan promising speeds of 300/300 Mbps starting at $35 a month for its existing mobile customers. The company also offers a discounted price as low as $20 a month for customers who participate in certain federal assistance programs.

“Internet service providers look at the economics of going into some of these communities and there just isn’t enough purchasing power in their minds to warrant the investment,” said Ross DeVol, chief executive of Heartland Forward, a nonpartisan think tank based in Bentonville, Arkansas, that specializes in state and local economic development.

Conexon, a fiber-optic cable construction company, estimates it costs $25,000 per mile to build above-ground fiber lines on poles and $60,000 to $70,000 per mile to build underground.

Former President Joe Biden’s 2021 infrastructure law earmarked $65 billion with a goal of connecting all Americans to high-speed internet. Money was designated to establish digital equity programs and to help low-income customers pay their internet bills. The law also set aside tens of billions through the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, to connect homes and businesses.

That effort prioritizes fiber-optic connections, but federal regulators recently outlined guidance for alternative technologies, including low Earth orbit satellites like SpaceX’s Starlink service.

Funding the use of satellites in federal broadband programs has been controversial inside federal agencies. It has also been a sore point for Elon Musk, who is chief executive of SpaceX, which runs Starlink, and is a lead adviser to President Donald Trump.

After preliminary approval, a federal commission ruled that Starlink’s satellite system was “not reasonably capable” of offering reliable high speeds. Musk tweeted last year that the commission had “illegally revoked” money awarded under the agency’s Trump-era Rural Digital Opportunity Fund.

In February, Trump nominated Arielle Roth to lead the federal agency overseeing the infrastructure act’s BEAD program. Roth is telecommunications policy director for the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Last year, she criticized the program’s emphasis on fiber and said it was beleaguered by a “woke social agenda” with too many regulations.

Commerce Secretary Lutnick last week said he will get rid of “burdensome regulations” and revamp the program to “take a tech-neutral approach.” Republicans echoed his positions during a U.S. House subcommittee hearing the same day.

When asked about potentially weakening the program’s required low-cost internet option, former National Telecommunications and Information Administration official Sarah Morris said such a change would build internet connections that people can’t afford. Essentially, she said, they would be “building bridges to nowhere, building networks to no one.”

'That Hurt’

Over a lunch of tortilla chips with the savory sauce that had been simmering on the stove, Williams said she hadn’t been getting regular checkups before her diabetes diagnosis.

“To tell you the truth, if I can get up and move and nothing is bothering me, I don’t go to the doctor,” Williams said. “I’m just being honest.”

Years ago, Williams recalled, “my head was hurting me so bad I had to just lay down. I couldn’t stand up, walk, or nothing. I’d get so dizzy.”

Williams thought it was her blood pressure, but the doctor checked for diabetes. “How did they know? I don’t know,” Williams said.

As lunch ended, she pulled out her glucose monitor. Williams connected the needle and wiped her finger with an alcohol pad. Then she pricked her finger.

“Oh,” Williams said, sucking air through her teeth. “That hurt.”

She placed the sample in the machine, and it quickly displayed a reading of 145 — a number, Williams said, that meant she needed to stop eating.

Here’s how KFF Health News did its analysis for the “Dead Zone” series, which pinpointed counties that lag behind the rest of the United States in access to broadband service and health care providers.

To identify “dead zones,” KFF Health News consulted two main data sources.

GWU’s data for behavioral health providers reflects psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, therapists, and addiction medicine specialists, regardless of whether their patients receive Medicaid. We used data from 2021, the most recent year available.

We classified counties as “dead zones” if they met these criteria:

A total of 210 counties met those criteria. At the other extreme, we defined 203 counties as “most served” if they had the most residences with broadband access (at least 96.7%) and ranked in the top third of Medicaid primary care and behavioral health provider ratios.

We also compared the health outcomes and demographics of dead zone counties relative to others using several data sources:
