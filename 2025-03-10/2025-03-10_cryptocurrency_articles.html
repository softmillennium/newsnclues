The prospect of wealthy individuals purchasing a path to U.S. residency through a “gold card” initiative has raised eyebrows in the world of cryptocurrency. But what if Bitcoin—one of the world’s most popular digital assets—could be used as a form of payment for this coveted card? This proposal, put forward by David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc., suggests that Bitcoin could help fuel the United States’ growing Bitcoin reserve, all while offering an innovative approach to the Trump administration’s gold card initiative.



The idea of a “gold card” was first brought into the public eye by former President Donald Trump in February 2025. His vision was to create a paid alternative to the traditional green card, offering the ultra-wealthy a fast track to U.S. residency and potential citizenship. The proposed cost of entry? A hefty $5 million.

Trump’s statement resonated with high-net-worth individuals, especially those from emerging markets, who might find it challenging to move significant amounts of money, such as $5 million, out of their home countries. The gold card would not only allow entry to the U.S. but would also offer green card privileges, which include the ability to live, work, and eventually gain citizenship in the country.

But the road to residency via this gold card isn’t as straightforward as it may seem. Many of the potential buyers—wealthy elites from places like Russia and China—face stiff regulations when it comes to transferring large sums of money across borders. This is where cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, comes into play.

David Bailey, who attended the Trump administration’s recent crypto summit, saw an opportunity to merge two of Trump’s policies: the proposed gold card and the strategic Bitcoin reserve (SBR) initiative. Bailey suggests that Bitcoin could offer a viable and practical way for these wealthy individuals to pay for their gold card without navigating the traditional banking system, thus sidestepping potential restrictions on international money transfers.

On social media, Bailey commented on the advantages of using Bitcoin as a payment method for the gold card:

“Many elites in emerging markets want to live in the U.S. but struggle to move $5M in USD out of their home countries. Bitcoin offers a simpler, safer, and more discreet solution.”

This proposal isn’t just a convenience for foreign investors—it could also serve a larger economic strategy. By allowing Bitcoin to be used for the purchase of gold cards, the U.S. could potentially add to its strategic Bitcoin reserve without the use of taxpayer funds. The reserve would be built from the influx of Bitcoin payments from wealthy individuals, contributing to the country’s growing stockpile of the digital currency, which could be valuable for both economic and geopolitical purposes.

The idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve has gained traction, especially with the ongoing efforts by the U.S. government to integrate more cryptocurrency-related policies into its financial infrastructure. This reserve would serve as a national stockpile of Bitcoin, which could be utilized for various purposes, including reinforcing the U.S.’s standing in global financial markets and providing an alternative store of value to traditional assets like gold.

Bailey’s proposal would align with the broader vision of the Trump administration, which has been keen on building the reserve to bolster the nation’s economic standing. By incorporating Bitcoin payments for the gold card program, the U.S. could further increase its strategic stockpile without needing to divert taxpayer resources, presenting a win-win scenario for both the government and foreign investors.

Bitcoin’s potential to revolutionize financial systems is no secret. As a decentralized, borderless digital asset, it offers a secure and efficient way to transfer wealth across borders. For the wealthy individuals seeking U.S. residency through the gold card initiative, Bitcoin provides a solution that avoids the cumbersome regulations typically involved in traditional currency transfers.

In addition, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge against inflation and economic instability, making it a desirable asset for those seeking to diversify their portfolios. By allowing Bitcoin to be used in this context, the U.S. would be positioning itself as a leader in the global cryptocurrency movement, attracting international investors and strengthening its own digital reserve.

The idea of using Bitcoin to purchase a path to U.S. residency could be the first step in a larger shift toward integrating cryptocurrency into official government programs. While the concept of a Bitcoin-based gold card is still in its early stages, the growing interest in cryptocurrency and its potential to reshape financial and immigration policies suggests that this idea could gain momentum in the coming years.

Furthermore, as more countries begin to adopt crypto-friendly policies, the U.S. might find itself competing for the attention of wealthy global citizens looking for more flexible and secure ways to move their money and assets. By embracing Bitcoin and integrating it into national programs, the U.S. could set a precedent for other nations to follow.

David Bailey’s suggestion to use Bitcoin for the proposed gold card offers a glimpse into the future of cryptocurrency integration with national policies. By allowing wealthy individuals to use Bitcoin to pay for residency privileges, the U.S. could both attract global elites and bolster its own Bitcoin reserves without relying on taxpayer funding. Whether or not this idea will become a reality remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the intersection of cryptocurrency and immigration policy could usher in a new era of global finance and residency programs.

Cryptocurrency prices fell further on Monday amid disappointment with the plans for a strategic bitcoin reserve.

Bitcoin was down about 4.2% at 12:30 ET to about $79,500, bringing the slide over the past week to 12%, per Coinbase.

Ether and XRP both fell about 3%. They are two cryptos that will go into a separate fund rather than be combined with the bitcoin reserve. Some commentators had criticised the decision to put lesser-known coins into the strategic reserve.

President Donald Trump posted earlier this month that the reserve would make the US the "Crypto Capital of the World." However, the executive order he signed on Thursday indicated that the reserve will only include bitcoin already held by the government — mostly from asset forfeitures in criminal and civil cases.

Many in the crypto world thought bitcoin would be purchased to add to the fund. That seems unlikely in the short term, but the door has been left open.

"The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce shall develop strategies for acquiring additional Government BTC [bitcoin] provided that such strategies are budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers," the order stated.

David Sacks, the Trump administration's "crypto czar," wrote on X that using the government's bitcoin holdings meant the reserve "will not cost taxpayers a dime."

"The government will not acquire additional assets for the stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings."

Sacks has also ordered an audit of the government's crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 bitcoin alone, BBC News reported. That holding would be worth about $16.5 billion.

When Arthur Hayes speculated that Bitcoin could fall as low as $75,000 last month many investors probably rolled their eyes. 

The leading cryptocurrency, after all, was bound to get a bounce from the Trump administration’s support for a Bitcoin strategic reserve, plus an end to the crackdown on the industry. 

With Bitcoin dropping more than 5% in the last 24 hours and slipping below $79,000, Hayes’ prediction now looks prescient. 

On Monday, the BitMEX co-founder and crypto influencer reiterated his call for Bitcoin to slide to $75,000. Worse may be on the way.

He said the volume of open interests for options contracts at that price range was flashing red.

“An ugly start of the week,” Hayes, the chief investment officer at Maelstrom, posted online. “If we get into that range, it will be violent.” 

In a way, it already is. 

Investors across the capital markets are spooked by President Donald Trump’s flip-flopping tariff policies toward the US' two biggest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. 

Trump also deepened a trade war with China by ratcheting up import duties another 10%. China countered with tariffs of its own.

If that wasn’t enough, Trump’s much-hyped crypto summit at the White House underwhelmed investors by setting up a Bitcoin reserve stocked with coins seized by the government in criminal cases.

Investors had been hoping Trump would order the government to start buying Bitcoin.

Zach Burks, CEO of NFT marketplace Mintology, said he expects Bitcoin to “drop as low as $72,000” amid inflation concerns for investors and the fading allure of the asset as a so-called Trump trade.

“Many investors are pulling out of Bitcoin, viewing it as a risky asset class for the first time since Trump took the White House,” Burks told DL News.

‘It’s no longer playing its role as a store of value.'

The failure of crypto to decouple from the stock market is proving worrisome yet again during a market crisis. If anything, investors should be flocking to Bitcoin to safeguard their wealth the same way they use gold. 

But investors are shunning that idea. 

“It’s no longer playing its role as a store of value,” Burks said. “Gold prices have spiked as many go back to the original doomsday asset, which is no surprise as tariff grenades continue to get thrown across the free world.”

Most of the investors ditching Bitcoin are new buyers of the asset, crypto research outfit 10x Research said in a Monday report.

The report stated that these new buyers likely punted on Donald Trump’s presidency being a boon for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies ― that hasn’t materialised.

Despite the present market turmoil, analysts still hold bullish expectations for Bitcoin.

Hayes previously told DL News that Trump’s policies will devalue the dollar and send Bitcoin’s price to $250,000 this year as investors return to the asset to safeguard their money.

For Burks, a Bitcoin recovery to $110,000 this year is possible.

“But we must weather this MAGA-inflicted mini recession before we get to move up the layer cake,” Burks said.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reaffirmed that cryptocurrency activities are permissible in the federal banking system, namely crypto-asset custody, certain stablecoin activities, and participation in independent node verification networks such as DLTs.

More specifically, the OCC published Interpretive Letter 1183 which confirms that a number of key crypto activities are permissible for national banks and federal savings associations.

Specifically, Interpretive Letter 1183 states that OCC-supervised institutions may engage in crypto-asset custody, certain stablecoin activities, and participation in independent node verification networks such as DLT.

Also, critically, Interpretive Letter 1183 confirms the removal of the requirements to receive supervisory nonobjection and demonstrate that they have adequate controls in place before they can engage in these cryptocurrency activities.

Additionally, the OCC withdrew its participation in the joint statement on crypto-asset risks and liquidity risks to banking organizations resulting from crypto-asset market vulnerabilities.

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood said:



“The OCC expects banks to have the same strong risk management controls in place to support novel bank activities as they do for traditional ones. Today’s action will reduce the burden on banks to engage in crypto-related activities and ensure that these bank activities are treated consistently by the OCC, regardless of the underlying technology. I will continue to work diligently to ensure regulations are effective and not excessive, while maintaining a strong federal banking system.”



A very important announcement, which means that banking institutions and other OCC accountable entities have been given the green light to an unprecedentedly wide range of crypto activities, and the entire crypto sector that they had been totally blocked from.

We can probably expect a very large-scale integration of new players into the crypto industry in the near future, and the market will have a lot of liquidity to swallow. Stay tuned for updates and be aware of the rapidly evolving regulation and crypto landscape.

Ethereum (ETH) is down 2% on Monday, trading near the $2,000 psychological level despite increased exchange net outflows. The sustained negative market sentiment is potentially coming from crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) investors who have continued to scale down their holdings.

Ethereum saw one of its highest exchange weekly net outflows last week following its decline to the $2,000 psychological level. Crypto exchanges witnessed an ETH net outflow of about $1.8 billion last week, the highest weekly amount since December 2022, according to IntoTheBlock's data.

"Despite ongoing pessimism around Ether prices, this trend suggests many holders see current levels as a strategic buying opportunity," wrote IntoTheBlock analysts in an X post on Monday.

An increase in exchange net outflows indicates high buying pressure, while vice versa for inflows.

The increased buy-the-dip attitude near $2,000 suggests ETH could be primed for a recovery, but institutional investors' selling pressure is weighing on the crypto market.

While crypto-native investors are buying the dip, institutional investors are depleting their holdings. This is visible in US spot ETH ETFs' flows, which show a net outflow of about $94 million last week, per Coinglass data. Unlike exchange net outflows, rising ETF outflows indicate higher selling pressure.

A potential reason for the selling activity is crypto's rising correlation to traditional stocks and macroeconomic conditions. The S&P 500 has declined by over 450 points since hitting an all-time high on February 19, showing increased risk-off sentiments amid President Donald Trump's tariff decisions on US international trading partners.

With the same traditional stock players also treading the crypto market via Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the prices of top cryptos may remain subdued by their investment sentiment. According to a CoinShares report on Monday, crypto ETFs have lost $4.75 billion in the past four weeks.

Ethereum experienced $117.96 million in futures liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of long and short liquidations accounted for $81.01 million and $36.94 million, respectively.

ETH is struggling to hold the $2,000 psychological level after sustaining a weekly candlestick close below the $2,200 critical level last week. If the bearish pressure extends throughout the new week, ETH could decline toward the next key support level at $1,500.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators are below their neutral levels, indicating dominant bearish momentum.

However, the Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) is deep in the oversold region, signaling a potential reversal. As a result, ETH could flip the bearish pressure if it pulls a high volume move above $2,200 and smashes a key ascending trendline resistance.

A weekly candlestick close below $1,500 will invalidate the thesis and potentially send ETH below the $1,000 psychological level.

Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain with smart contracts functionality. Its native currency Ether (ETH), is the second-largest cryptocurrency and number one altcoin by market capitalization. The Ethereum network is tailored for building crypto solutions like decentralized finance (DeFi), GameFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), etc.

Ethereum is a public decentralized blockchain technology, where developers can build and deploy applications that function without the need for a central authority. To make this easier, the network leverages the Solidity programming language and Ethereum virtual machine which helps developers create and launch applications with smart contract functionality.

Smart contracts are publicly verifiable codes that automates agreements between two or more parties. Basically, these codes self-execute encoded actions when predetermined conditions are met.

Staking is a process of earning yield on your idle crypto assets by locking them in a crypto protocol for a specified duration as a means of contributing to its security. Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism on September 15, 2022, in an event christened “The Merge.” The Merge was a key part of Ethereum's roadmap to achieve high-level scalability, decentralization and security while remaining sustainable. Unlike PoW, which requires the use of expensive hardware, PoS reduces the barrier of entry for validators by leveraging the use of crypto tokens as the core foundation of its consensus process.

Gas is the unit for measuring transaction fees that users pay for conducting transactions on Ethereum. During periods of network congestion, gas can be extremely high, causing validators to prioritize transactions based on their fees.

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

Many countries have strategic reserves in case of shortages or as a way to keep prices stable. The U.S. has its strategic oil reserves. China has tens of thousands of tons of frozen, raw pork. The newest reserve - bitcoin. Last week, President Trump signed an order to create a strategic reserve of cryptocurrency. To explain how this might work, we called up Zeke Faux. He’s an investigative reporter with Bloomberg and author of the book “Number Go Up, ” about the crypto industry. He joins us now. Good morning.

ZEKE FAUX: Morning.

RASCOE: Typically, these strategic reserves are commodities - oil, grain, pork. But cryptocurrencies exist in ledgers on computers. So how will a digital currency reserve work?

FAUX: What the administration officials have said the plan is, is that the U.S. already digitally holds quite a lot of bitcoin. There’s a lot of crime involving bitcoin, and it often results in the bitcoins being seized by the U.S. government. And in the past, these have been auctioned off by the U.S. Marshals Service for regular U.S. dollars, which can be used for whatever. Now the government is going to hold onto these bitcoins. The purpose of that is not entirely clear, but Donald Trump has hinted if the price goes up a lot, this could help pay off the national debt.

RASCOE: How much would - the amount of bitcoin they have now, how much is that in, like, U.S. dollars at this point?

FAUX: It’s about $20 billion. And even if you believe that the U.S. government should be gambling on the price of bitcoin, this is not nearly enough to have an impact on anything.

RASCOE: And what is the argument that this would be helpful?

FAUX: The crypto industry is really good at creating this impression that this is the future and that the U.S. government needs to get on this or will be left behind. I’ve spent years traveling the world, investigating this industry, and what I’ve found is there’s nothing there. Crypto has been around for 15 years. It’s as old as Uber. It’s as old as WhatsApp, but pretty much no one is using it for anything but financial speculation. The crypto industry is basically a giant offshore casino. Even if you believe that these are winning bets, the U.S. government has never been in the business of speculating on financial assets.

RASCOE: Just a few years ago, Trump called cryptocurrency a scam. So what changed?

FAUX: During his most recent campaign, a few dozen of the richest bitcoiners got together, and they engaged in this concerted lobbying effort to change his mind. And last July, they held a fundraiser that reportedly raised $25 million for Trump. And after that, Trump went onstage at this bitcoin conference and promised them he would deregulate the crypto industry. He’d make the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet. And that’s where he first floated this strategic reserve plan, which has been a pipe dream of bitcoin advocates for years.

RASCOE: President Trump and first lady Melania Trump, they both have their own coins. The family has its own crypto business called World Liberty Financial. Is that a conflict of interest?

FAUX: Yeah. When you’ve got the U.S. government spending its money on these assets, and you’ve got people who are in the administration investing in the assets, yeah, it’s a clear conflict of interest.

RASCOE: The Securities and Exchange Commission had been investigating the crypto industry, but under Trump, those investigations ended. What were they focused on?

FAUX: The SEC under the Biden administration - they’re basically saying that some of these cryptocurrencies count as securities, meaning things that we regulate, and that the industry had not been following the long-established rules around securities, which mandate that you have to file these detailed disclosures. There’s rules around trading. Industry has said cryptocurrencies are different. We need new rules. And right now, the Trump administration has said they agree with that position, and they’re in the process of working out these new rules, whatever they’re going to be.

RASCOE: That’s Zeke Faux. He’s an investigative reporter with Bloomberg, and his book about cryptocurrency is called “Number Go Up.” Thanks so much for joining us.

FAUX: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.</p>

Digital asset market faces $4.75 billion monthly outflow, hitting lowest AUM since 2024.

Digital asset investment products continued their losing streak for the fourth consecutive week, with outflows reaching $876 million, according to CoinShares‘ latest report.

James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, noted that while the rate of capital flight has slowed, investors remain cautious amid the bearish market situation.

He said the outflow brought the total outflows for the past month to $4.75 billion, while year-to-date inflows slipped to $2.6 billion.

At the same time, total assets under management (AUM) also fell by $39 billion, settling at $142 billion—the lowest level since mid-November 2024.

The US accounted for the largest share of outflows, with investors withdrawing approximately $922 million.

This came despite President Donald Trump’s announcement of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, making the top crypto a major financial asset for the global financial system.

During the period, institutional investment vehicles were among the hardest hit. Fidelity’s FBTC, BlackRock’s IBIT, and Ark21Shares all saw outflows exceeding $133 million each.

Meanwhile, investors in Switzerland, Canada, and Germany took advantage of the dip, contributing inflows of $23 million, $47 million, and $13.3 million, respectively.

Across digital assets, Bitcoin experienced the heaviest outflows, with $756 million exiting the top crypto.

The downturn coincided with a sharp price drop, as BTC fell nearly 15% last week, sliding from around $94,318 to as low as $80,085, according to CryptoSlate data. This decline triggered a wave of liquidations across the crypto market, further dampening sentiment.

Meanwhile, short-Bitcoin products saw outflows of $19.8 million—their largest since December 2024.

Ethereum, Tron, and Aave suffered outflows of $89 million, $32 million, and $2.4 million, respectively. On the other hand, Solana, XRP, and Sui attracted inflows of $16.4 million, $5.6 million, and $2.7 million.

Additionally, blockchain-related equity exchange-traded products (ETPs) were not spared from the broader market decline, recording $48 million in outflows last week.

In what's being touted as a first for the American casino industry, Choctaw Casinos & Resorts has partnered with Bitline and Everi to offer cryptocurrency as a source of liquidity for gaming patrons. The collaboration introduces a new financial option for casino visitors, marking the first time digital assets can be directly used for casino chip access in the U.S. regulated market.

Bitline, a Miami-based company, specializes in providing casino chip access directly from cryptocurrency, enabling transactions of up to $10 million in casino chips within minutes, depending on blockchain network demand. 

This new functionality is made possible through Bitline’s integration with Everi’s CashClub payment infrastructure, which offers a compliant process for boarding, screening, and verifying patrons who wish to leverage digital assets.

The partnership aims to meet the growing demand for cryptocurrency solutions in the gaming industry. It creates a replicable model that offers casinos and their patrons alternative ways to manage funds, access liquidity, and utilize digital assets.

The rollout of this technology at Choctaw Casinos & Resorts sets a new precedent for financial accessibility and convenience in the sector, according to the partners.

“This collaboration is just the beginning of our vision to modernize casino payment capabilities on a global scale,” said Richard Jones, CEO of Bitline. “We’re entering an era where digital assets can fundamentally enhance the gaming experience, providing casino operators with a future-ready financial framework.”

Everi’s SVP of Product Management, Payments Solutions, Victor Newsom, emphasized the compliance and security benefits of the integration. “Choctaw’s patrons are now no longer limited to the access, times, amount, and speed constraints of the legacy financial systems,” he said, highlighting how the solution reduces risks for casinos.

The Choctaw Casinos & Resorts integration is the first step in Bitline’s broader mission to bring cryptocurrency payment options to the global casino sector. As digital assets gain momentum in the gaming market, Bitline plans to expand its services to other major casinos and markets, aiming to establish cryptocurrency as a standard feature of the gaming experience.

The service officially launched on March 7, 2025, with the first transaction completed at Choctaw’s Durant, Oklahoma location. Patrons can use popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and Circle (USDC), as outlined in Choctaw Casinos’ cryptocurrency FAQ page.

Thomas McDonald, Senior Director of Cage and Credit at Choctaw Casinos & Resorts, expressed excitement about the new offering. “Through our long-term relationship with Everi, a leader in fintech solutions, we will continue to invest in innovative offerings that provide the discerning gaming VIP access to funds in a safe and secure manner,” he said.</p>

Movement's mainnet will allow smart contract deployment and allows anyone to build on and use the network for the first time, the Movement Network Foundation announced via email on Monday.

Move was developed by Facebook as part of its plans to develop its own digital currency, which was abandoned in early 2022. 

The technology was subsequently used to create layer-1 networks Sui and Aptos, as well as Movement Labs extending the programming language to develop an Ethereum layer 2.

 Shares of Strategy (MSTR) and other companies tied to cryptocurrencies sank along with the price of digital coins on concerns about President Donald Trump's federal bitcoin strategic reserve plan and worries about the U.S. economy. 


 Trump on Friday signed an executive order establishing the new reserve, which he said was part of his effort to make America the "cypto capital of the planet." However, the proposal only calls for the reserve to include assets already seized by the government through legal action, and doesn't suggest additional purchases.


 Another factor weighing on the crypto market is the economic impact of Trump's tariffs, and the response by other countries to them, including the future of interest rates. Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech that policymakers will be taking a wait-and-see approach to rate cuts until the effect of the president's moves are better understood. 


 Strategy, the biggest corporate holder of bitcoin, saw its shares sink 13% Monday morning. Shares of crypto trading platform Coinbase Global (COIN) and bitcoin miner MARA Holdings (MARA) also tumbled by about 12% and 13%, respectively.

The price of Bitcoin crashed below $80,000 on Monday morning as financial markets reacted to ongoing concerns over inflation and a possible U.S. recession, fueled by President Trump's comments over the weekend.

Asked by Fox News in a Sunday interview about whether he expects a recession this year, Trump declined to rule it out.

"I hate to predict things like that," he replied, adding that there will be a "period of transition" as the economy digests his sizable tariffs on neighbors Canada and Mexico, as well as China. Trump's moves around tariffs, including delays and shifts in the scale of them, have rocked markets for weeks.

Bitcoin dove as low as $79,553 on Monday morning, rebounding slightly to $79,785 as of this writing. The leading cryptocurrency is currently down almost 5% on the day, falling 14% on the week amid volatility fueled not only by tariff moves but also speculation over Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve plans.

Ethereum is also down 5% to a current price of $2,013 after coming within a dollar of the $2,000 mark late Sunday. ETH hasn't been below $2,000 since November 2023.

Other major coins have posted much sharper losses over the last 24 hours, with Cardano (ADA) falling 10% to $0.69, Solana (SOL) down 9% to $121, and Dogecoin (DOGE) diving 8% to $0.166.

Stock markets are similarly showing losses so far Monday, with the Nasdaq plunging by more than 3% and the S&P 500 down 1.8%. Traders are pulling back ahead of crucial economic reports expected later this week—including the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) updates—that will indicate whether inflation is being kept under control.

The move reflects a trend of traditional exchanges entering the cryptocurrency derivatives market to provide a regulated platform for trading digital assets

Singapore Exchange (SGX) plans to list bitcoin perpetual futures as traditional exchanges push deeper into cryptocurrency derivative markets.

Singapore’s largest exchange group intends to launch the contracts in the second half of 2025, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The company will strictly target institutional clients and professional investors, with retail customers barred from trading the instruments.

The move was the latest sign that established exchange operators were branching out into bitcoin derivatives, as US President Donald Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency agenda boosts demand for digital assets’ exposure.

Bloomberg reported on March 4 that Japan’s Osaka Dojima Exchange Inc., which traced its roots to the 18th century, was planning to seek approval to list bitcoin futures.

SGX hoped to act as a bridge between regulated financial markets and the freewheeling world of cryptocurrency trading. The firm thinks its offering will “significantly expand institutional market access,” the spokesperson said.

The planned products were still awaiting approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

Perpetual futures – which do not have an expiry date – are a way for traders to bet on price changes in an underlying asset without needing to own the asset itself. SGX was not the only exchange looking to launch the contracts in Singapore: in January 2024, Hoboken, New Jersey-based EDX Markets LLC, a digital-asset firm backed by Citadel Securities, revealed plans to offer the instruments in the city state.</p>

10 March, 2025 – Tether, the largest company in the digital assets industry, has announced that Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission has granted acceptance of USD₮ as an approved cryptocurrency.

This approval enables USD₮ to be traded within the country, facilitating its listing on regulated exchanges and paving the way for USD₮ to be accepted for payments, which advances the region’s leadership in digital asset innovation.

The updated regulations aim to enhance flexibility in digital asset businesses and will take effect on March 16, 2025. The SEC had previously sought public feedback on these changes, which were finalized in February 2025 with widespread industry support.

The regulator’s recognition of USD₮ as an approved cryptocurrency marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital assets in the region and represents a major step toward clarifying and enhancing Thailand’s regulatory framework. This will provide investors with greater flexibility and choice while fostering a more dynamic and resilient industry. By enabling the seamless integration of USD₮, the decision supports the diversification and modernization of Thailand’s financial landscape.

Thailand has emerged as one of the friendliest jurisdictions for digital assets in recent years and ranks among the top 20 countries globally in terms of adoption, with USD₮ accounting for around 40% of volumes. Tether’s USD₮ with a market cap of $142 billion, is the world’s most widely used stablecoin, providing a trusted, efficient bridge between traditional fiat systems and digital economies.

“We highly value the Thai market and are continuously exploring ways to enhance our services and offerings. Our priority is to provide users in Thailand with a secure, transparent, and reliable stablecoin experience,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “We are committed to supporting the long-term success and adoption of stablecoins in Thailand and look forward to contributing to the growth of the country’s digital asset ecosystem by fostering a strong and sustainable stablecoin infrastructure.”

Thailand’s forward-thinking approach to digital asset regulation sets a global benchmark, and Tether is proud to see USD₮ play a pivotal role in driving economic progress and digital transformation in the region. This approval highlights Tether’s dedication to building bridges between traditional and decentralized economies while ensuring security, trust, and efficiency for users worldwide. Thailand’s forward-looking stance on stablecoins is reflected in its vibrant, Thai baht-backed digital asset market.

A whale, likely armed with insider info, made another $2.15M profit in just 50 minutes. The trader sold 947 ETH for $1.95M USDC and then deposited it into Hyperliquid to open a long position on ETH with 50x leverage. The position ballooned to 25,095 ETH (worth $53.7M) before the whale closed out as ETH surged, locking in the impressive profit. This is the same trader who previously netted $6.8M on BTC and ETH before Trump’s executive order.

Investor sentiment has reached levels not seen since 2022, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropping to a near three-year low of 20. This steep decline reflects heightened fear among investors, driven by regulatory uncertainty and recent price volatility. Historically, such low sentiment levels have preceded market bottoms, suggesting that this downturn may present a potential buying opportunity for contrarian investors looking to capitalize on future recovery. However, on-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that the average monthly Fear & Greed Index has declined to a more acceptable level, suggesting that selling pressure might be easing.

Bloomberg’s senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone warned that Bitcoin might plunge to $70,000 amid renewed market fear. Despite excitement over the U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve, Bitcoin-to-gold ratio has dropped to 28X and may fall to 21X, signaling underperformance. McGlone noted that if the U.S. stock market reverses some of last year’s $12 trillion advance, Bitcoin could continue to struggle. Anti-crypto commentator Peter Schiff believes the current correction is overdue and may persist through the decade.

March 10, 2025 08:51:06 UTC

The total crypto market cap fell by $148 billion in the past 24 hours as investor sentiment turned sharply negative. Concerns over US President Donald Trump’s ambiguous stance on a potential recession fueled uncertainty in financial markets. This lack of clear direction triggered widespread sell-offs, forcing major digital assets into decline, with Bitcoin dropping to $80,000 and Ether slipping below $2,000. Combined with broader macroeconomic worries, these factors have led to today’s steep downturn in the crypto market indeed.

March 10, 2025 08:51:06 UTC

The crypto market kicked off the week with a sharp downturn, wiping out $620.5 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin dropped as low as $80,000 over the weekend, triggering widespread margin calls and forcing many leveraged traders out of positions. Long positions suffered the most, with Bitcoin alone losing nearly $240 million. Analysts warn that if Bitcoin fails to hold around $78,000, it could fall further to about $75,000, adding to the market’s volatility. Altcoins, including Ethereum, also saw significant declines amid rising risk-off sentiment.

March 10, 2025 08:47:38 UTC

Ethereum is under strong selling pressure, dropping below $2,000 earlier today and risking a fall to around $1,250 if support fails. Over the past week, ETH has lost more than 16%, pushing its year-to-date losses over 37%. ETF outflows and significant liquidations add to the bearish outlook. However, major whales are accumulating ETH, and 600,000 tokens were withdrawn from exchanges, suggesting long-term holding. Bulls must reclaim the $2,460 resistance to spark a recovery.

March 10, 2025 08:44:41 UTC

US stock market futures fell sharply at the open, with the Dow down over 300 points and the Nasdaq 100 down 1%. This steep decline in traditional markets has been mirrored in the crypto space, where falling prices signal a growing risk-off sentiment among investors. The downturn reflects heightened caution amid current uncertainties, as market participants brace for further volatility and closely watch economic and geopolitical developments.

March 10, 2025 07:50:57 UTC

Another Sunday selloff in crypto saw Bitcoin drop to $80,000 at 7 pm ET, marking a 7% decline over 24 hours. Despite a brief bounce to $80,700, BTC is headed toward its 2025 low of about $78,000. Other major coins, including Ether, Solana, and XRP, fell similarly, while Cardano and Dogecoin dropped around 12%. On Fox News, President Trump warned his tariff and budget-cutting policies might cause disruptions. US stock index futures also declined by roughly 0.85% overall.

March 10, 2025 07:50:57 UTC

Pi Coin price fell to as low as $1.26 before rebounding to $1.41, representing a 12% daily drop and 16% weekly. This downturn reflects the broader crypto market correction, as Bitcoin briefly plunged to $80,000 and many altcoins are in the red. Additionally, Binance’s inaction on PI trading—despite an 86% community vote in favor of listing—may be dampening liquidity, while other exchanges like Bitget, OKX, and MEXC have already enabled trading.
