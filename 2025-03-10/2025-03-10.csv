Lots of talk and little action has been the story of the day, as a delegation of US officials made their way to Saudi Arabia for peace talks with Ukraine.

On Tuesday, discussions between the US and Ukraine will take place with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and top Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak among the key players at the table.

Kyiv is set to propose a ceasefire in the sea and sky during the truce meeting, a Ukrainian official says, as Trump tells reporters he believes the talks will result in ""a lot of progress"".

On the flight over, Rubio suggested that the US hopes to resolve the military aid pause for Ukraine, but tempered expectations that a minerals deal - long considered a key condition for US involvement in a ceasefire - might be signed tomorrow.

Also making his way through the arrivals gates at Jeddah, Volodymr Zelensky shook hands as he met with Saudi officials. The Ukrainian president is meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman but won’t be sticking around for peace negotiations with some of Trump's top team.

Instead, Zelensky will return to Ukraine, as his commander-in chief denies reports that his troops are at risk of being encircled by Russians amid fierce fighting in Kursk.

Following reports of rapid Russian advances in the Kursk region, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky says Ukrainian forces are not in danger of being encircled there.

They are “taking timely steps to redeploy to areas advantageous for defence”, he said in a statement, external.

According to Gen Syrsky, the offensive in Kursk region involves “a significant number of Russian troops reinforced with North Korean infantry”.

Responding to reports of Russian forces trying to cross from Kursk region into Ukraine, he said the Ukrainian army was in control of the border.

Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in August 2024. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think-tank, Russian forces “are collapsing the northern part of the Ukrainian salient, external”. 

The ISW said it was “noteworthy” that Russian advances in the area coincided with the suspension of US intelligence sharing with Ukraine.

Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent

A senior Ukrainian politician has said the cost of President Trump’s decision to halt the supply of weapons and some intelligence sharing with Ukraine will be measured “in the life of our soldiers”.

 Yehor Cherniev, the Deputy Chairman of Ukraine’s Defence and Intelligence Committee told the BBC the US pause “will mean that we’ll lose more and more soldiers”.

However, he did not think the impact will be felt immediately on the frontline. That will depend on the intensity of the fighting. Currently he believes Ukraine has sufficient stocks  to fight on for  another six months. 

More pressing, he says, is  the supply of missiles for US made air defence systems like Patriot batteries – one of the few systems capable of shooting down Russian ballistic missiles. 

As for long range  US supplied ATACMS missiles, used to hit high value targets behind enemy lines, Mr Cherniev thinks most, if not all, have already been used.

Ukraine is now less reliant on US supplied weaponry  and ammunition than it was at the start of Russia’s full scale invasion. Mr Cherniev said that Ukraine’s own arms production had increased more than 20 times. The focus has been on domestically produced drones.

Ukraine has still been conducting its own long range drone strikes inside Russia, since the US decision. That suggests it still has access to some intelligence. How and where it’s getting that information from is unclear. 

Ivan Stupak, a former Ukrainian Security Service Officer believed  Ukraine “did not have a clue of what is going on” – in terms of intelligence sharing. He said it was a sign of the break down in relations between Kiev and Washington – with “no direct communication”.

Yaroslav warns that Ukraine will run out of missiles amid US aid cuts

Ukraine is still clearly getting some intelligence. Enough
to sound the air raid warnings in Kyiv before another Russian attack. But
defending Ukraine’s  towns and cities will become more difficult
without American support.

Russia appears to be making the most of the Trump
administration’s pause in weapons deliveries – launching scores of drones and
missiles.

Ukrainian soldiers defending the skies around the capital
are engaging targets most nights. 

Oleksandr, a soldier with Ukraine’s Central Air Defence
Command, says he was “upset” by President Trump’s decision to halt the supply
of weapons and intelligence to Ukraine. “We were counting on US support, he
says. But if it stops “we’ll carry on fighting with what we’ve got”.

His small unit relies on older Soviet era shoulder launched missiles and a Ukrainian made heavy machine gun. They’re
effective against slower moving Russian drones. Over the past weekend they’ve
successfully destroyed two.

Hidden away are the more sophisticated western supplied
air defence systems needed to bring down faster moving targets. The US made
Patriot is one of the few systems capable of intercepting Russian ballistic
missiles and essential  to protecting the capital and key military
sites. President Zelensky has long been pleading for more batteries. But
Ukraine’s immediate worry is running out of Patriot interceptor
missiles.

Yaroslav, the mobile battery commander, says the US
administration’s decision will hurt Ukraine. “We haven’t felt it yet” he
says “but I think we will feel it. Sooner or later we’ll run out of missiles”.

There is still hope that President Trump will reverse his
decision. But regardless of what he decides Ukraine knows that it can no
longer always count on continued US support. 

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has landed in Saudi Arabia ahead of peace talks with Ukrainian officials on Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters just before touching down in Jeddah, Rubio was quizzed on whether Ukraine could expect to start receiving military aid from the US again. 

""I think the notion of the pause in aid, broadly, is something I hope we can resolve. Obviously what happens tomorrow will be key to that,"" he says.

As for the minerals deal, Rubio says this is something that Trump ""wants to see done"", but he adds, ""it doesn't necessarily have to happen tomorrow"". 

He adds that the US delegation will be in ""listening mode"" and hope to get a ""general sense"" of what concessions Ukraine is willing to make. 

""You're not going to
get a ceasefire and an end of this war unless both sides make concessions,"" he explains, adding that the US will then find out what the Russian position is. 

""That'll give us a
pretty good assessment of how far apart we are,"" he suggests.

We're now hearing from Downing Street, after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with US President Trump ahead of Tuesday's talks in Saudi Arabia between the US and Ukraine.

A spokeswoman from Downing Street says Starmer told Trump that Ukraine officials ""remain committed to a lasting peace"". 

She adds that during the conversation, Starmer said ""he hoped there would be a positive outcome to the talks that would enable US aid and intelligence sharing to be restarted"".

“The two leaders also spoke about the economic deal they had discussed at the White House and the Prime Minister welcomed the detailed conversations that had already happened to move this forward. 

""Both leaders agreed to stay in touch,"" she adds.

As a reminder, Starmer is set to host a second meeting, expected to be a virtual gathering on Saturday, for leaders of countries that may contribute to a ""coalition of the willing"" for Ukraine.

As we reported a little earlier, Steve Witkoff says the US never shut off intelligence for ""anything defensive that the Ukrainians needed"". 

Donald Trump told reporters last night that the US has ""just about"" lifted its pause on sending military intelligence to Ukraine. 

The pause, which came into effect on 5 March, means Ukraine would not be able to make such effective use of long-range Western weaponry or have access to valuable advance information on incoming threats.

'We just about have' - Trump on lifting Ukraine intelligence pause

We're seeing images now of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with Saudi officials, after he recently landed in Saudi Arabia.

Zelensky is meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but he will not be attending talks on Tuesday between US and Ukrainian officials.

Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, says the US never shut off intelligence for ""anything defensive that the Ukrainians needed"".

Witkoff is part of the US delegation due to meet Ukrainian officials in Jeddah tomorrow.

""There's been a lot of discussion between our teams and the Ukrainians and the Europeans who are relevant to these discussions as well,"" Witkoff says in an interview with Fox News.

""I would like to describe it as progress.""

Witkoff adds that he hopes a deal on critical minerals will be signed off during this week's meetings.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has arrived in Jeddah ahead of talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman today, AFP and Reuters news agencies report, both citing a Ukrainian official.

As a reminder, he will not attend talks between the Ukrainian and US delegations on Tuesday.

In Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, the fighting continues

Ukraine is expected to push for a truce with Russia in the sea and the sky during the upcoming peace talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, an official says.

Ukrainian and US officials will discuss how to bring peace, though neither US President Donald Trump nor his Ukrainian counterpart will be in attendance - Russia will also be absent.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov says Russia is at ""an initial stage of restoring bilateral relations"" with the US. He adds that it is ""important to understand if Ukrainian authorities want peace or not"".

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says “Ukraine has been striving for peace since the first second of the war"". He is due to meet the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Jeddah today.

Meanwhile, the war on the ground continues as Russian forces are reportedly trying to encircle thousands of Ukrainian soldiers in Russia's Kursk region, where they recaptured three settlements on Sunday.

As the build-up to Tuesday's peace talks continues, we'll bring you the latest updates. Stay with us.

US President Donald Trump says he believes ""a lot of progress"" will be made during talks between the US and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump added that he's expecting to see ""pretty good results"" in the ""not so distant future"".

Trump also said that ""eventually, we have to have peace"".

As a reminder, Trump will not be in attendance at the talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Instead, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz will be at the table.

Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent

Prime Minister Keir Starmer will this week host a second meeting, expected to be on Saturday, for leaders of countries that may contribute to a ""coalition of the willing"" for Ukraine, Downing Street has said. 

The meeting, led by Starmer, will be a ""virtual"" one held online. It follows the recent summit he chaired at Lancaster House. 

Around 20 countries are believed to have expressed interest in possibly joining the coalition, though it's understood not all would be willing to send troops to Ukraine.

The Prime Minister's official spokesperson told reporters that, beyond European states, ""Commonwealth allies"" such as Australia were part of the talks, adding ""clearly all of those involved discussions are interested in exploring exactly what they're able to contribute, but, still, discussions are ongoing"". 

The spokesperson said the UK Defence Secretary John Healey will also be travelling to Paris this week. 

On Tuesday, Healey will, alongside his French counterpart, host a 'military meeting' of possible members of the""'coalition of the willing"". 

On Wednesday, Healey will take part in a meeting of defence ministers from E5 countries, the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Poland.

Serhiy Leshchenko (pictured in 2016) is an adviser to Volodymyr Zelensky

Ukraine is proposing a ceasefire in the sky and at sea, but
not on the ground, presidential adviser Serhiy Leshchenko has said.

“You want a ceasefire? We’re ready, but not on the ground,
where Putin would be able to cease fire for a few months and treat his wounded,
recruit infantry from North Korea and resume this war,” Leshchenko tells Ukrainian TV.

“He [Trump] is asking: have you got a ceasefire plan? We say
we do. We suggest ceasing fire in the sky – we’re talking about drones,
missiles and ballistic missiles. 

""We are also proposing to cease fire at sea. We
undertake the pledge not to attack. Which is paradoxical, by the way, because
we hold the initiative in the Black Sea. We are also suggesting that the energy
sector is not attacked,” he says.

Oleksiy Goncharenko also says the Ukrainian delegation will report to Zelensky, who will make the final decision, during talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday

Ukrainian opposition MP Oleksiy Goncharenko has called for a ceasefire ""on the ground"" as well as in the sea and sky, as suggested by Volodymyr Zelensky. 

As our colleague Vitaliy Shevchenko reports, the Ukrainian president suggests a ceasefire in the sea and sky could initially be agreed, before fighting comes to a complete halt. 

Zelensky is also pushing for US security guarantees as part of a deal to bring about the end of the war, but Goncharenko tells the BBC Ukraine should be ""reasonable"" about this.

Vitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC Monitoring

As US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia draw near, it remains unclear
what Washington is prepared to offer Ukraine in exchange for access to the
country’s mineral wealth demanded by Donald Trump. 

But we have a better idea of what Ukraine wants. On Friday, President Volodymir
Zelensky said, external initial steps towards peace should include “quiet” in the sky
(i.e. no more Russian missiles, bombs and drones) and at sea to guarantee
unhindered shipping.

Today, the AFP news agency quoted a Ukrainian official
speaking on condition of anonymity as also saying that Kyiv would propose a
ceasefire in the sky and at sea in Saudi talks because such a ceasefire is
“easy to install and to monitor”.

Earlier, on 24 February, President
Zelensky said, external a comprehensive exchange of all prisoners of war held by
Russia and Ukraine should be the first step towards peace.

As for Russia’s stance, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria
Zakharova rejected proposals for a truce, saying the war would only resume
“with renewed force” afterwards.

There is still no sign that Russia’s appetites have in any
way diminished. Officials in Moscow still say the “special military operation”
will go on to capture more Ukrainian territory, and Russia’s missiles and
drones continue attacking towns and cities across Ukraine. 

The strikes on Dobropillya in Donetsk region destroyed several residential blocks

As we've reported, Ukrainian military drones are reported to have hit a Russian oil refinery. This follows an intense wave of Russian strikes have killed at least 25 people since Friday, according to various Ukrainian officials on Saturday.

The deadliest strikes occurred late on Friday in Dobropillya, Donetsk. Local officials say a Russian attack killed at least 11 people and wounded 40, including six children.

Following the strikes, Polish PM Donald Tusk said: ""This is what happens when someone appeases barbarians.""

Other attacks in the region killed nine people and wounded 13 on Friday and Saturday, local officials said.

Russian drones also struck a company in Kharkiv, killing three people, and hit civilian and energy infrastructure in Odesa, according to the regions' heads.

BBC Monitoring

Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) attack drones have hit the Novokuybyshevsk oil refinery in Russia's Samara Region, according to a Ukrainian media outlet.

News website Ukrayinska Pravda reports that Samara residents reported loud explosions, adding that the nets built to protect the plant from drone attacks were not fully installed.

Andriy Kovalenko, from Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council (NSDC), wrote on Telegram that the plant's capacity totalled 8.8m tonnes of oil per year, ""making it one of the 10 largest refineries in the Russian Federation"". 

The refinery produces petroleum products -  including gasoline, diesel fuel and fuel oil - as well as transport and military equipment, Kovalenko adds. 

Russian forces are reportedly trying to encircle thousands of Ukrainian soldiers in Russia's Kursk region, where they recaptured three settlements on Sunday. 

Ukraine seized Kursk seven months ago, hoping to use it as leverage in peace talks. 

It follows reports by Russian bloggers that Russian special forces had crept for miles through a gas pipeline near the town of Sudzha in an attempt to surprise Ukrainian forces.

A further thrust there, combined with recent advances in Ukraine's Sumy region in north-east Ukraine, could force Ukrainian troops to retreat or surrender in western Russia. 

Ukraine says there have been more than a hundred and fifty clashes with Russian forces in the past day, with the heaviest fighting around the industrial city Pokrovsk, eastern Ukraine.

Watch: Oil tanker and cargo vessel on fire in North Sea

Edited by Emily Atkinson and Jenna Moon

Alastair Smith, head of operations for Lincolnshire at East Midlands Ambulance Service, says emergency crews assessed 36 people at Grimsby's North Quay earlier after receiving a call at 11:28 GMT.   

He adds that nobody was required to go to hospital.  

Earlier, MP Graham Stuart said one person had been hospitalised. 

Rachel FlynnLive reporter

As we've reported, the Solong cargo ship was carrying 15 containers of the chemical sodium cyanide when it collided with the Stena Immaculate tanker.

Sodium cyanide has a variety of commercial uses, from being used to plate metals to dye production.

Dr Mark Hartl, associate professor of marine biology at Herriot Watt University, explains that sodium cyanide is very soluble in water and can be toxic because it interferes with the respiration of animals, and if the sodium cyanide is heated up it can generate a toxic gas.

At this point it is not clear if any has entered the water or been burnt, but it has the potential to kill aquatic organisms through ingestion.

Dr Hartl did explain that marine organisms like fish have a major avoidance reaction so may have already vacated the area.

This morning, the Humber Coastguard appeared to make a distress call via radio to alert other ships in the area that ""Solong has collided with tanker Stena Immaculate"".  

The Coastguard asked for vessels with firefighting equipment or search and rescue capabilities to assist, at the time when crews were evacuating. You can listen to that recording here:

This video can not be played

The Solong vessel was carrying 15 containers of the chemical sodium cyanide among other cargo, when it collided with the Stena Immaculate tanker in the North Sea earlier, according to a report from maritime data provider Lloyd’s List
Intelligence.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), describes sodium cyanide as a white crystal-like solid with a faint almond odour. It is used in industry for metal cleaning, plating and extraction, and photography. It can also be used to make other chemicals.

The agency says exposure to cyanide salts can cause headache, nausea, dizziness, nervousness, confusion, changes in heart rate and drowsiness. In the most serious cases, there can be heart and breathing problems or even death, it adds. 

As we've been reporting, the two ships involved in the collision are the oil tanker MV Stena Immaculate and a cargo ship called Solong. Here is a graphic to help you understand how they compare:

One of the ships involved in today's collision, the MV Stena Immaculate oil tanker, was carrying cargo for the US Department of Defense, US officials have confirmed.

""The collision and ensuing explosions will not impact operations or combat readiness. We do not have a single point of failure,"" the officials say.

We've also heard from the ship company's owner that the vessel was carrying jet fuel when it was hit by the Solong.

Rowan BridgeReporting from Grimsby

It's very much a closed off scene here at the moment.  

The dock behind me has now been shut and no commercial vessels are going in or out of it. 

In the last hour, we've had a statement from the owners of the Stena Immaculate saying there were multiple explosions on the tanker and it is now pouring jet fuel into the North Sea.   

The coastguard say they are assessing what pollution response might be needed. 

There will be questions about what conditions were like out at sea this morning, but this happened during daylight. 

The Stena Immaculate was anchored off the coast of Hull, when it and the cargo ship Solong collided. 

We are yet to hear any response from its owners about what has happened here today. 

Downing Street says details of the cause of the collision are ""still becoming clear"", with a spokesperson for the prime minister describing the crash as an ""extremely concerning situation"".

The spokesperson adds: ""We thank the emergency services for their rapid response. I understand the Department for Transport is working closely with the coastguard to help support the response to the incident.


""We're obviously monitoring the situation, we'll continue to co-ordinate the response and we're grateful to emergency personnel for their continued efforts.""


The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has deployed a team to conduct a preliminary assessment, as we reported earlier.

Baroness Susan Hayman, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Environment, says she is ""extremely shocked and concerned"" about the North Sea collision.

Speaking in Parliament, Hayman calls the situation an ""emerging picture"" and says the department is speaking closely with the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for Transport and Maritime and Coastguard Agency. 

Hayman also says the Environment Agency is engaging with any clean-up needed. 

Independent maritime safety consultant David Mcfarlane tells BBC News that more will become clear once investigators can get on board the vessels and recover data recorders. 

But, he says, ""there should be no reason for two ships to collide"".

There are collision regulations in place to avoid situations like this - and Mcfarlane says ""something has gone very badly wrong"". 

These vessels are ""quite manoeuvrable"", and the speed the Solong was travelling at was about average speed. 

He says it is common for ships to be on autopilot, but there should always be someone on watch. 

It will take ""weeks if not months to come to any proper conclusion"". 

On the spill of jet fuel, Mcfarlane says it is ""fairly light"" compared to the likes of crude oil. This means there will be less pollution than if it were another type, but there will ""still be another oil spill, there's no doubt about that"", he adds.

Dave O’Hara, senior site manager at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) Bempton Cliffs, says the incident has taken place in an area home to England's largest gannet colony and internationally important populations of seabirds. 

""Naturally, we are extremely concerned about the potential for a leak from the tanker as oil pollution can seriously damage habitats and be lethal to seabirds,"" he says.  

They are keeping a close eye on the situation.  

Around half a million seabirds, including Gannets, Kittiwakes, Guillemots, Razorbills and Puffins breed in the area each year, on the 400-foot-high (122 metre) chalk cliffs. 

The Cleethorpes Wildlife Rescue committee is preparing in case they are needed to rescue wildlife affected by the fuel spill caused by the collision this morning. 

In a post online, it says they have met to discuss how best to help wildlife, particularly birds, that may reach Cleethorpes Beach. 

The group says it is adapting its oil spill response protocols to be prepared for this incident and has set up ""a dedicated oiled wildlife hotline for reporting affected animals in Cleethorpes: 01472 472662"".

They have also scheduled a meeting with partner rescue group and will be closed for the rest of Monday to work on preparation. 

""If you spot an oiled bird along our coast, please do not attempt to handle it. Instead, report the sighting via the hotline, and a volunteer will respond as soon as possible"", the committee says.

Greenpeace UK says it is ""too early"" to know the extent of any environmental damage caused by the incident, but ""both the high speed of the collision and the footage of the aftermath are cause for great concern"".

A spokesperson says any impact relies on a number of factors, including what type of oil was released and how much of it is in the water.

""Sea and weather conditions will also be important in determining how any spill behaves"", the spokesperson says.

""In the case of an oil spill or any loss of hazardous cargo from the container ship involved, the speed of the response will also be crucial in limiting any impact."" 

Niall Stevenson saw crews arriving at the scene

We've just heard that only one crew member is in hospital following the incident earlier. 

Local worker Niall Stevenson tells the BBC he saw a ""load of ambulances"" and search and rescue crews pulling up shortly after 09:30 GMT this morning. 

He says there were about eight or nine ambulances, and some police on the scene too. 

""It was a full hands on deck"" situation, he adds. 

Local MP Graham Stuart says he has spoken to the transport secretary and only one person has been hospitalised. 

""The other 36 mariners across both crews are safe and accounted for,"" he adds. 

Everyone is now on shore, but Stuart says he is concerned about the ""potential ecological impact"".

He says he is ""calling for a unified command structure, to bring together government, police, Coast Guard, the Environment Agency, local authorities and your MPs"".

As we've been reporting, an oil tanker involved in the collision with a cargo vessel off East Yorkshire's coast is on fire.

The two ships involved are the oil tanker MV Stena Immaculate and a cargo ship called Solong. The Immaculate was carrying jet fuel - the company that owns the ship says this is now leaking into the sea.

All of the crew from the Immaculate have been rescued safely - there were more than 20 people on board. 

So far, 32 people have been brought to shore. They are being taken away in ambulances and their condition is unknown. 

A coastguard rescue helicopter from Humberside has been on scene alongside a Coastguard fixed-wing aircraft and nearby vessels with firefighting capability and lifeboats have been dispatched from Skegness, Bridlington, Mablethorpe and Cleethorpes.

The alarm was first raised at 09:48 this morning, and marine inspectors are already gathering evidence to determine the next steps. 

We'll continue to bring you the latest as soon as we have it. 

Jonathan JosephsBusiness reporter

US logistics firm Crowley, which is the operator and joint owner of the MV Stena Immaculate, says the vessel was carrying jet fuel when it was hit by the Solong in the North Sea at approximately 10:00 GMT.

All of its crew of more than 20 are now safe and accounted for - but there are fears that jet fuel is now pouring into the sea.

In a statement, the Florida-based company said: “A fire occurred as a result of the allision, and fuel was reported released. The Stena Immaculate crew abandoned the vessel following multiple explosions onboard. All Crowley mariners are safe and fully accounted for.”

I understand this jet fuel was owned by the US government. That’s consistent with the vessel being part of a US government programme designed to supply the armed forces with fuel during times of armed conflict or national emergency.

The US Air Force has several bases in the UK.

We're starting to get some more images from the scene of the collision now. 

They show a large fire that is spread across the North Sea and thick black smoke billowing upwards. A rescue vessel appears to be spraying the blaze with water.

Evidence is being gathered and next steps are being determined
following the collision of the two vessels in the North Sea, marine inspectors say.

A spokesperson for the Marine Accident Investigation Branch says it has deployed a team to
Grimsby following this morning's collision of the container ship
Solong and the oil tanker Stena Immaculate.

""Our team of inspectors and support staff are gathering
evidence and undertaking a preliminary assessment of the accident to determine
our next steps,"" it adds.

A Ukrainian demand for the return of land that is now part of Russia would be taken by US President Donald Trump's team as proof of Kiev's unwillingness to pursue peace, insider sources have told Reuters.

Two US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have reportedly outlined Washington’s expectations ahead of high-level talks with a Ukrainian delegation set to convene in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. 

”You can’t say ‘I want peace,’ and, ‘I refuse to compromise on anything’,” remarked one source. The other stressed Trump’s desire for a “realistic peace,” stating, “If they [Ukrainians] are only interested in 2014 or 2022 borders, that tells you something.”

In 2014, Crimea voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia following a Western-backed armed coup in Kiev, while two eastern regions declared independence, also rejecting the new authorities. Following the escalation in the conflict in 2022, the two Donbass regions, plus two others, held referendums to join Russia, and Moscow now recognizes them as its territory.

Kiev claims sovereignty over all former Ukrainian lands, insisting that the votes were “a sham” and not genuine displays of self-determination by disenfranchised citizens. Moscow asserts that the status of the new Russian regions is non-negotiable.

The upcoming round of Russian-American talks follows a disastrous visit by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky to the White House last month. The trip was cut short after he publicly questioned the US administration’s ability to negotiate with Moscow. The failed meeting derailed plans to sign a minerals agreement, which Washington sees as vital for recovering the money spent to support Kiev in the conflict.

The EU and the UK have criticized Trump for halting arms supplies and intelligence sharing with Ukraine as a means to pressure Zelensky into making concessions. They have pledged to guarantee long-term Ukrainian security, contingent on a ceasefire with Moscow and continued US support.

Moscow is concerned about a reported surge of violence in Syria and supports international intervention, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. As many as 1,300 people have been killed in the cities of Latakia and Tartus in three days, including more than 800 civilians, according to news reports.

Russia and US have requested an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss a response.

“Many nations and international organizations, including the UN, share our concern,” Peskov said during a regular media briefing.

The Russian official declined to comment on claims that some civilians facing attacks by militias allied with the new Syrian government found shelter inside a Russian military base.

The Syrian government was toppled in late 2024, after militant forces opposing then President Bashar Assad took control over Damascus. The Assad family belongs to the Alawite sect of Islam, which is viewed negatively by hardline Islamists supporting the country’s new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa.

Alawites were reportedly massacred en masse by Syrian security forces after an armed rebellion against the new authorities by groups described in Western media as Assad loyalists. Al-Sharaa, formerly the leader of the jihadist force HTS, has vowed to hold accountable anyone harming innocent civilians. Western nations have granted his government the benefit of the doubt, after al-Sharaa pledged to respect the rights of ethnic and religious minorities and pave the way for an inclusive civilian government in Syria.

Commenting on the spree of violence on Saturday, the EU condemned “pro-Assad elements” for attacking “interim government forces,” as well as “all violence against civilians,” without attributing the deaths to any party. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has broadly denounced “radical Islamist terrorists, including foreign jihadis” for murdering members of Syrian minority groups, including Christians, Druze, Alawites and Kurds.

An Irish schoolteacher who refused to use ‘they’ instead of ‘he’ when addressing a biologically male transgender student, citing his Christian beliefs, could now be stripped of his salary, according to The Irish Times. He has already spent more than 500 days in prison.

Enoch Burke, formerly a teacher of history and German at Wilson’s Hospital School in County Westmeath, has been at the center of a prolonged legal and ethical dispute since 2022. Burke was suspended after he opposed the school principal’s request to refer to a ‘transitioning’ student by a new name and the pronoun “they.” 

Following a hearing on Friday, the High Court of Ireland will be asked to appoint a receiver to recover unpaid fines from Burke’s salary. If approved, the move would enable authorities to collect €79,100 – an amount he has accrued through daily €700 fines for showing up at Wilson’s Hospital School in defiance of court orders to stay away.

The teacher, who has an evangelical Christian background, had repeatedly failed to heed a court order barring him from entering the grounds of the school.

“I teach everyone who’s in front of me. I teach every single student,” Burke told SkyNews last year. “But when I am commanded, when I’m told that I can’t have my religious belief anymore, when I’m told I have to confess belief in transgenderism, instead of my simple belief, which is male and female, that’s just a breach simply of my rights.”

Although suspended with full pay in May 2022 pending an investigation into alleged misconduct, Burke continued to show up at the school, leading to his imprisonment for contempt of court in September 2022. To date, he has spent a total of 512 days in jail across three separate periods for defying court orders.

Despite being dismissed from the school, Burke continues to receive his salary under administrative leave while his appeal over his termination is still pending.

Recently, Justice David Nolan doubled Burke’s daily fine to €1,400 after it was revealed that he had entered the school through a student entrance and attempted to join a school assembly.

Nolan said by his rough calculations, Burke owes around €190,000 so far as a result of a €700 a day fine imposed on him by the court in January 2023.

The teacher has accused the courts of failing to recognize his constitutional right to religious freedom, and said that these rights were breached when he was asked to refer to a student as they/them.

According to its website, “Wilson’s Hospital School is, to this day, a place where true love of knowledge makes all study a discovery and joy. Our school maintains a distinctive Church of Ireland ethos, fostering Christian practice and teaching, promoting dignity and respect for the individual and committed to the provision of a caring family atmosphere in which education can flourish.”

US President Donald Trump has said that Washington has “just about ended” its freeze on the provision of intelligence data to Kiev amid its fighting with Russia. The statement comes ahead of negotiations between American and Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Trump halted the provision of US military aid to Ukraine and subsequently stopped sharing intelligence with Kiev after his public quarrel with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky at the White House in late February. Following the meeting, the US president blamed his guest for not wanting peace with Moscow and being ungrateful for the assistance which Washington has provided his country during the conflict.

When asked by journalists aboard Air Force One on Sunday if he would consider ending the intel pause, Trump replied by saying: “We, we just about have. I mean, we really just about have. And we want to do anything we can to get Ukraine to be serious about getting something done.”

The US president also expressed confidence that “we are going to make a lot of progress” during the talks in Jeddah on Tuesday.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff are expected to represent Washington in Saudi Arabia, with Kiev’s delegation to be headed by Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andrey Yermak.

US officials told Reuters on Monday that Washington intends to use the meeting to determine if Ukraine is ready to make concessions to Russia to end the conflict. “You can't say: ‘I want peace,' and, 'I refuse to compromise on anything,’” one of the sources stressed.

The Financial Times reported on Sunday that during the discussions in Jeddah, the Kiev authorities are planning to propose a partial ceasefire with Moscow, covering long-range drone and missile strikes and combat operations in the Black Sea, in the hope that it would lead to the US reversing its decision to freeze intelligence sharing and weapons deliveries. An unnamed Ukrainian official told FT that in the short-term, Kiev would prioritize fixing its ties with Washington.

Russia said repeatedly that it is not going to accept a temporary ceasefire with Ukraine as it would likely be used by the West to rearm Kiev. According to Moscow, the conflict must be settled through reliable, legally binding agreements that would eliminate its root causes and make sure the fighting does not resume in the future.

US President Donald Trump has privately made it clear to his aides that Vladimir Zelensky should quit as the Ukrainian leader, NBC has reported, citing an administration source.

The report comes ahead of negotiations between senior US officials and Zelensky’s chief of staff in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will discuss a resolution to the three-year conflict with a Ukrainian delegation headed by Andrey Yermak.

Trump wants to see a change in Zelensky’s attitude toward peace talks, including a willingness to concede claims to territory, the broadcaster said in an article on Sunday, citing a member of the US administration and another American official.

Trump has reportedly said that Zelensky should be ready to move toward holding a presidential election and “possibly toward stepping down as his country’s leader.”

Zelensky’s presidential term officially expired in May 2024 as he refused to hold a new election, citing martial law imposed during the conflict with Russia.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in February that Moscow does not consider Zelensky to be a legitimate head of state, but is still ready to negotiate.

Trump already called for a presidential vote to be held in the Ukraine last month, labelling Zelensky a “dictator without elections” with a “4% approval rating.”

According to the latest poll by Kiev International Institute of Sociology, the Ukrainian leader’s rating stands at 68%, with the numbers going up sharply after his public spat with Trump and US Vice President J.D. Vance at the White House in late February.

Zelensky demanded security guarantees from the US, ruled out talks with Moscow and claimed that Vance could not have known anything about Ukraine’s problems due to never having visited the country.

After the argument, Trump accused his guest of not wanting peace with Moscow and being ungrateful for billions assistance which Washington has provided to his country during the conflict.

Following the debacle the US president halted military aid to Ukraine and then stopped sharing intelligence with Kiev.

Trump said last week that he was “finding it more difficult... to deal with Ukraine” than with Russia when it comes to negotiating the settlement of the conflict. It is “surprising” considering that Moscow has “all the cards,” while Kiev has none, he stressed.

US President Donald Trump has privately told his aides that a deal granting Washington access to Ukraine’s mineral resources will not be enough for the resumption of American military aid and intelligence sharing with Kiev, NBC reported ahead of negotiations between US and Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, scheduled for March 11.

Zelensky was expected to finalize the minerals agreement during his trip to Washington in late February, but his meeting with Trump and US Vice President J.D. Vance devolved into a shouting match in front of the cameras and the signing never happened.

After the argument, Trump, who accused the Ukrainian leader of not wanting peace with Moscow, halted the provision of US military aid and subsequently stopped sharing intelligence data with Kiev. In recent days, Zelensky signaled his willingness to sign the deal and engage in diplomacy.

Trump not only wants the minerals agreement, but also to see a change in Zelensky’s attitude toward peace talks, including a willingness to make concessions such as giving up territory to Russia in order to stop the fighting, the broadcaster relayed on Sunday, citing a member of the administration and another American official.

The US president also believes that Zelensky should move toward holding a presidential election in Ukraine and “possibly toward stepping down as his country’s leader,” the officials told NBC.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will discuss a resolution to the three-year conflict with a Ukrainian delegation headed by Andrey Yermak.

Trump told journalists aboard Air Force One on Sunday that “we are going to make a lot of progress” during the upcoming negotiations. He also expressed confidence that Ukraine “will sign the minerals deal” eventually.

The Financial Times reported on Sunday that in Saudi Arabia, the Kiev authorities are planning to propose a partial ceasefire with Moscow, covering long-range drone and missile strikes and combat operations in the Black Sea, in the hope that it will lead to the US reversing its decision to freeze intelligence sharing and weapons deliveries.

Russia, however, has said repeatedly that it won’t accept a temporary ceasefire with Ukraine, insisting that the conflict must be settled through reliable, legally binding agreements that would eliminate its root causes.

A cousin of US Vice President J.D. Vance spent three years fighting with a Ukrainian military unit in the conflict with Russia and is now seeking a publisher for his story, Le Figaro has claimed.

Nate Vance fought in the ‘Da Vinci Wolves’ battalion, a Ukrainian unit originally formed as a militia of far-right nationalists from the local Right Sector group and named after its late founder, Dmitry ‘Da Vinci’ Kotsubailo, the French daily reported on Sunday.

Nate Vance is the son of James Vance, brother to the vice president’s mother, Beverly. The 47-year-old veteran of the US Marine Corps reportedly leveraged his military experience to support the Ukrainian army, initially serving as an instructor before taking on combat roles. He is said to have returned to his home in Texas in January, just before J.D. Vance was sworn in, claiming he could no longer risk capture.

J.D. Vance rose to prominence with his 2016 memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, which details his upbringing in poverty-stricken Appalachia. Speaking to the French daily, Nate criticized his famous cousin, asserting that his views on Ukraine are misguided and stating: “I could have told him the truth, without pretense, without personal interest. He never tried to find out more.”

The US vice president recently faced accusations of “ambushing” Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky during his visit to the White House. Tensions flared when Zelensky questioned President Donald Trump’s ability to negotiate a sustainable peace deal with Russia, resulting in a heated on-camera exchange among the three.

The Russian government considers all foreign fighters employed by Kiev as mercenaries who should be prosecuted. Last week, a Russian court sentenced 22-year-old British national James Scott Rhys Anderson to 19 years in prison on terrorism charges related to his role in the ongoing Ukrainian incursion in Russia’s Kursk Region.

Romanian presidential hopeful Calin Georgescu has said he will appeal against the decision by the country’s Central Electoral Bureau (BEC) to bar him from taking part in a new election in May, Reuters has claimed citing one of his advisers.

The BEC dismissed Georgescu’s candidacy on Sunday, citing more than 1,000 challenges filed against him. Georgescu was the clear favorite for the election rerun, polling between 40% and 45% in most recent surveys.

Georgescu condemned the decision, stating the EU has turned into a “dictatorship,” while branding his own country a “tyranny.” On Monday, the politician vowed to appeal the ruling with the country’s Constitutional Court.

“We go together all the way for the same values: peace, democracy, freedom,” he said in a video address posted on social media. The politician has also condemned the violence that erupted between his supporters and police outside the BEC building in Budapest on Sunday, urging his backers to abstain from such behavior.

According to Romanian law, the decision of the BEC must be appealed within a 24-hour period, with the top judiciary body obliged to deliver the final verdict on the matter within 48 hours.

Georgescu scored an unexpected win in November’s presidential election first round, receiving 23% of the vote. The result, however, was promptly annulled by the Constitutional Court over alleged “irregularities” in the campaign. The politician is known as an outspoken critic of NATO and the EU, and a staunch opponent of supporting Ukraine.

Preliminary findings of an investigation into the elections scandal, reported by media early this year, indicated the campaign “irregularities” likely were the result of actions of a consulting firm associated with the pro-Western National Liberal Party (PNL). The firm presumably tried to derail another candidate, but accidentally boosted Georgescu instead.

Last month, Georgescu was indicted on six criminal charges, including allegedly plotting “anti-constitutional acts” and “promoting fascist, racist, or xenophobic ideologies.” He has denied all the charges, insisting the criminal case against him was part of a campaign orchestrated by the Romanian “deep state.”

US Senator Lindsey Graham has warned that he will propose new sanctions against Russia if Moscow does not engage in ceasefire negotiations over the Ukraine conflict in the near future.

The US has already imposed extensive sanctions on Moscow since the conflict with Kiev escalated in 2022, targeting financial institutions, trade, and energy exports. However, President Donald Trump has suggested that the restrictions should be used as leverage and potentially lifted in order to achieve peace.

Speaking with Fox News on Sunday, Graham, a Republican from South Carolina and prominent hawk, suggested that Washington should introduce even more sanctions on Moscow.

“If they don’t engage in ceasefire and peace talks with the administration, we should sanction the hell out of them, and I’ll have legislation to do that next week,” Graham said. 

The senator has been a long-time proponent of extensive military and financial aid to Ukraine and has publicly characterized the conflict as a US-led proxy war against Russia. He had previously called the killing of Russians by Ukrainian troops “the best money” the US had ever spent.

Graham has criticized the recent pause in intelligence sharing and weapons transfers to Ukraine, arguing that stopping US assistance would have serious consequences. “If we pull the plug on Ukraine, it’d be worse than Afghanistan,” he said.

The Republican also reiterated his criticism of Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky, saying he “blew it” during his recent White House meeting with Trump, where he was accused of disrespecting the Oval Office and “gambling with World War III” by refusing to seek peace.

After the heated exchange with Trump and US Vice President J.D. Vance, Zelensky was asked to leave the White House and return only when ready for serious negotiations. Trump has since halted military aid to Ukraine and suspended all intelligence sharing with Kiev.

Last week, Trump also threatened Moscow with a new round of “large-scale” sanctions until a Ukraine ceasefire is reached. However, Reuters later reported that Washington is also exploring ways to ease some restrictions on Russia’s energy sector as part of a broader peace initiative.

Russia has consistently maintained that Western sanctions have failed to inflict lasting damage on its economy, calling them illegal and ineffective in altering its strategic decisions.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly stated that Moscow remains open to negotiations but insists any settlement must guarantee long-term security for Russia. “We don’t want anything that belongs to others, but we won’t give up what’s ours,” Putin said in a recent statement.

France has handed over two army facilities to Senegal, the French embassy in Dakar has announced. The move marks the start of the former colonial power’s pullout from another West African nation, following demands by local authorities to end its military presence.

The transfer comes just weeks after Paris and Senegal set up a joint commission to finalize the handover of bases and the withdrawal of some 350 French troops in the African state by the end of 2025. Last November, Senegalese President Bassirou Diomaye Faye declared that French troops would leave the country, calling their presence “incompatible” with Senegal’s sovereignty.

“In accordance with the decision of the joint commission... the French side returned to the Senegalese side the facilities and housing in the Marechal and Saint-Exupery districts,” the French embassy in Senegal said in a statement on Friday, referring to military installations in the capital, Dakar.

“Located near Hann Park, these districts were ready to be returned since the summer of 2024,” it said, adding that other sites will be transferred according to a jointly agreed timetable.

Senegal’s new government, which has been in power for less than a year, has taken a tough stance on the presence of French troops, following a regional trend of former colonies severing defense relations with Paris. Its West African neighbors, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, have all cut ties with Paris over alleged failures to combat jihadist insurgents and have sought defense cooperation with Russia.

Last month, France transferred the Port-Bouet military camp – its only army base in Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) – to the West African nation’s authorities. Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara said during his year-end address in December that the exit of about 600 French troops is intended to modernize the national armed forces.

In late January, the French army handed over its remaining base in Chad, which had been France’s last foothold in the troubled Sahel region after the Central African nation’s government unexpectedly ended military partnership with its former colonial ruler in November, declaring the pact “obsolete.”

Two British diplomats have had their accreditation revoked in Russia after engaging in espionage activities, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has said.

In a statement on Monday, the agency said its operatives had “discovered an undeclared intelligence presence” at the UK Embassy in Moscow.

Two British diplomats were found to have been “carrying out intelligence and subversive work that threatens Russia’s security,” the statement alleged.

It has been established that the UK Embassy’s second secretary and the husband of the first secretary of the embassy’s political department intentionally provided false information when receiving permission to enter Russia, thus violating the country’s laws, the FSB said.

The Russian Foreign Ministry, in cooperation with other agencies, therefore decided to revoke the accreditation of the two diplomats, ordering them to leave the country within two weeks, it added.

“The FSB will continue to counter intelligence and subversive activities of foreign intelligence services using all available means,” the statement read.

The Foreign Ministry in Moscow said it had summoned a representative of the British Embassy over the loss of accreditation by the two UK diplomats.

A video made by RT captured the British representative leaving the Foreign Ministry, while declining to answer questions about the effect of the incident on relations between Moscow and London.

In November, the FSB announced the expulsion of a British diplomat for “conducting intelligence and subversive work” and intentionally providing false information when entering Russia. At the time, the UK Foreign Office accused Moscow of making “malicious and baseless accusations against our staff.”

Six more British diplomats had been ordered out of the country on similar grounds in August, according to the agency.

Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Timoshenko has hit out at German intelligence chief Bruno Kahl after he claimed that resolving the conflict with Russia before the end of the decade could pose a security threat to Western Europe.

An end to the Ukraine conflict before 2029 or 2030 could allow Russia to regroup and “increase security risks for Europe,” Kahl told state broadcaster Deutsche Welle.

Kahl’s statement is the first official confirmation that the EU’s security is being prioritized at the expense of Ukraine’s sovereignty and the lives of its citizens, Timoshenko, who leads the opposition Fatherland (Batkivshchyna) party in Ukraine, claimed in a Facebook post on Friday.

“At the cost of Ukraine’s very existence and the cost of the lives of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, did anyone decide to pay for Russia’s ‘demolition’ for safety in Europe? I didn’t think they would dare to say it so officially and openly...” she wrote.

Kahl’s remarks “explain a lot,” she said, urging the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, to respond while calling for an immediate end to the conflict.

The German official’s comments echoed recent remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron, who claimed that Russia poses a direct threat to the rest of Europe and urged EU member states to increase defense spending.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has consistently dismissed Western leaders’ claims that Moscow could attack NATO as “nonsense.”

Divisions remain within the EU on the Ukraine conflict, with some countries advocating a stronger military response from Kiev while others, such as Hungary, call for peace talks. Brussels has continued to push for military aid to Kiev.

In March, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen launched the “rearm Europe” initiative to boost EU defense with up to €800 billion ($870 billion). In February, she announced €3.5 billion ($3.78 billion) in aid to strengthen Ukraine, calling its resilience an EU priority. Moscow has vowed to take measures to protect its security, warning that the EU’s militarization and confrontational rhetoric could escalate tensions.

Timoshenko’s response comes amid reports that she and members of former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko’s party recently held discussions with the team of US President Donald Trump. According to Politico, Ukrainian opposition figures presented themselves as more open to negotiations than Vladimir Zelensky. Both Timoshenko and Poroshenko, presently sanctioned on suspicion of high treason, confirmed their contacts with Trump’s team.

By Ivan Timofeev, programme director of the Valdai Club.

The recent failed negotiations between Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky and US President Donald Trump mark a significant break from past patterns.

Over the last three years, Washington’s unwavering support for Kiev has been taken for granted. Most of Ukraine’s military supplies, financial aid, communications, and intelligence assistance have been provided by the US. Moreover, America supported the country’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations even before the current conflict.

In many ways, modern Ukraine as a political entity largely owes its existence to the support of the US.

Against this backdrop, the US president and vice president’s public spat with Zelensky in the Oval Office was particularly striking. Although no one knows when the Ukraine conflict may come to an end, the incident at the White House gives us an opportunity to consider the results of the past three years and reflect on earlier phases of Ukraine’s post-Soviet history. This can be summarized as a balance sheet of gains and losses.

The fact that Ukraine has remained formally independent may be considered a gain. The country has suffered territorial losses, but compared to what Ukraine had de facto control over before the start of the war, they are not so huge.

For the past three years, Kiev has managed to preserve the support of the collective West, positioning itself as the leader in deterring Russia. The Ukrainian military has evolved into one of the most battle-hardened forces in Europe, gaining experience with modern Western weaponry under real combat conditions.

Despite repeated corruption scandals, the country has managed to concentrate its resources, enforce mobilization of the population, and maintain a high pace of military operations for the past three years.

Now, regarding the losses. First of all, Ukraine has suffered significant human losses. Several hundred thousand men have been killed and wounded. This is further exacerbated by the mass exodus of refugees and internally displaced persons, many of whom are hesitant to return.

Given the difficult demographic situation in Ukraine after the collapse of the USSR, with its low birth rate and high mortality rate (the same was observed in Russia), these losses are noticeable. Moreover, unlike Russia, Ukraine does not have experience in integrating large numbers of migrants. It will be extremely difficult to compensate for the losses.

While the diaspora abroad can serve as an asset – lobbying for pro-Ukrainian legislation, advocating for sanctions against Russia, and sending money to relatives back home – it cannot directly compensate for the workforce depletion or stimulate domestic economic growth.

Human losses are compounded by damage to infrastructure, industrial capabilities, and material resources. The ongoing hostilities have inflicted substantial damage, and recovery will require tens of billions of dollars.

When it comes to supplying the army, the losses are even more evident. In the past three years, Ukraine has exhausted the huge reserves of Soviet weapons that it had before the war. Western supplies have mitigated the problem, but it will be difficult to maintain the scale of supplies at the required levels without ongoing gigantic financial investments. The abrupt shift in Washington’s stance has further complicated matters, as the bulk of aid came from the US.

As for territorial losses, their final extent remains uncertain. But one thing is clear – restoring the country’s 1991 borders is no longer a realistic objective.

The prospect of repelling Russian forces appears bleak, especially as the Russian army continues its slow yet steady advance. The Russian defense industry is ramping up production and seems prepared to maintain its current pace. Meanwhile, Ukraine is growing weaker, and this may lead to new territorial losses.

It’s true that Kiev will not bear the financial burden of restoring the territories it has lost, but it won’t have access to their resources either.

Three years of warfare have significantly deepened Ukraine’s dependence on Western partners. Having retained formal sovereignty, Ukraine no longer has the freedom to choose a political and economic course. The country’s budget is critically dependent on foreign aid, and what remains of its industry is increasingly integrated into Western supply chains, making Ukraine a peripheral economy.

It’s impossible to modernize the country or even maintain its vital functions without the assistance of Western donors. Even if the EU and others were to confiscate all frozen Russian assets and transfer them to Ukraine – a scenario that currently seems unlikely – it wouldn’t resolve the issue, as decisions about future funding would still be made abroad.

This dependence makes Ukraine politically vulnerable. Western allies can exert influence and claim assets they deem essential. While the EU does this gently, choosing the right words and allowing Ukraine to save face, Trump is not shy about demanding control over Ukraine’s natural resources in return for all the aid the US has provided. Kiev has become trapped in a form of debt bondage that could take decades to escape – if that is even possible.

As a result, Ukraine has become an even more vulnerable, dependent, and peripheral state than it had been before. In the early 1990s, it had very different prospects, with its large population and industrial potential inherited from the Soviet Union.

Three years into the conflict, Ukraine’s political system remains rife with instability. The wartime nation has morphed into an authoritarian state, leaning heavily on nationalism as its guiding ideology. This shift raises serious concerns about the legitimacy of the current administration and government.

Ukraine’s political continuity is disrupted, which is evident from the fact that sanctions have been imposed not only on the pre-Maidan leadership but also on former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko and key figures of the 2014 revolution. The vulnerabilities that have plagued Ukrainian politics since the country’s independence may now resurface with renewed intensity.

Adding to these political issues is societal fatigue stemming from the ongoing war, frustration over losses, and the cynicism of allies. Ukraine will soon have to confront the challenges of post-traumatic stress. While collaboration with the West has opened many doors for ordinary Ukrainians – making it relatively easy for them to find jobs in EU countries or study at Western universities – this model risks becoming colonial in nature, exacerbating the brain drain as skilled workers continue to leave.

Ukraine’s readiness for a new confrontation with Russia is another result of the three-year conflict. Should Kiev maintain its current foreign policy course, any potential ceasefire could merely serve as a temporary respite. Ukraine will need to sustain and finance a significant military force, relying heavily on Western support. However, this further deepens its dependency on external powers.

Ultimately, Ukraine will need to break another pattern and end the conflict with Russia. However, in the context of the current conflict (and on a larger scale, the entire post-Maidan period), this is unacceptable for present-day Ukraine. Internally, this policy may lead to accusations of treason, sanctions, and repressions. The media has embedded the image of Russia as an eternal foe. Embracing the role of martyr – protecting the West at great personal cost – has become the norm for Ukrainians. Moreover, three years of war compounded by propaganda have left profound scars on the human level.

Continuing the confrontation, even in a cold war scenario, appears both convenient and logical for Ukraine. The thirst for revenge fuels national identity and strengthens nationalism. However, unless, following a painful period of acknowledging losses and damage, Ukraine finds a way out of this conflict, it risks losing its sovereignty, solidifying its role as a pawn in the hands of foreign powers and completely losing its independence.

Know your market, deliver the goods, mind your looks and manners, and leave emotions at the door. Had Vladimir Zelensky relied on those tips from Donald Trump’s ‘The Art of the Deal’, the now historic spat in the Oval Office may have resulted in something more amicable. But the Ukrainian leader chose a different tactic, one also used by Trump – never admitting to mistakes and repeating the same thing over and over again. Where does this leave the two presidents and their countries? We ask Dmitry Suslov, the deputy director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow.

        Former central banker Mark Carney is set to become Canada’s next prime minister after succeeding Justin Trudeau as leader of the governing Liberal Party.
    

Canada's next prime minister declared that his country would ""never, ever become part of the US"" after being elected leader of the governing Liberal party. 

Mark Carney was appointed Liberal leader after Justin Trudeau resigned, following plummeting popularity levels and criticism from his own ministers. 

Carney — who is set to be sworn in the coming days — won the leadership vote by a landslide. 

He used his first speech to take a defiant stance against threats from US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly suggested that Canada could become the ""51st state"".

""Canada will never, ever be part of America,"" Carney declared. 

The former Bank of England governor also vowed Canada would win a trade war with the US after Trump threatened multiple tariffs against the neighbouring country. 

Last week, Trump signed orders exempting many goods from his 25% tariffs. However, the White House said 62% of Canada's imports would still face levies. 

Canada has responded with retaliatory tariffs that Carney pledged would remain in place ""until the Americans show us some respect.""

“We didn’t ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,” Carney said. “They [the US] should make no mistake, in trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.”

Carney’s previous roles saw him navigate financial crises as head of the Bank of Canada. In 2013, he was appointed governor of the Bank of England, under then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, becoming the first non-citizen to run the English central bank since its founding in 1694.

A former Goldman Sachs executive, Carney worked for 13 years in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003.

In 2020, he served as the United Nations’ special envoy for climate action and finance, under UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.

Canada's Liberal Party has seen its approval ratings improve amidst a trade war with the US ahead of the country's general election, which could be called in the coming weeks. 

Canada’s opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose substantially and immigration surged.

Carney was quick to point out the differences between the US and Canada during his speech, declaring the US is “a melting pot. Canada is mosaic,"" he said. “America is not Canada. And Canada will never, ever will be a part of America in any way, shape or form.""

After decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada’s next leader is now expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the threat posed by Trump.

“These are dark days, dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust,” Carney said. “We are getting over the shock but let us never forget the lessons. We have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead.”

However, Carney may not keep the job for long, as he is expected to trigger a snap election shortly. Either he will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month. The Liberal Party are mandated to hold a general election on or before 20 October.

Trudeau urged Liberal supporters to get involved and support the new leader. “This is a nation-defining moment. Democracy is not a given. Freedoms is not a given. Even Canada is not a given.”

        US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and tech billionaire Elon Musk sparred with Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski on X over the use of Musk's Starlink satellite system in Ukraine.
    

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has defended his Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, after he was criticised by the country's opposition party for sparring with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Elon Musk on X.

Tusk said Sikorski had ""calmly"" explained the ""Polish raison d'état to officials from another country"" and criticised the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party for going after Sikorski. 

Sikorski, Rubio and Musk sparred on Sunday in a series of X posts over the use of the South African-born billionaire's Starlink satellite system in Ukraine.

Sikorski commented on a post made by Musk where he mentioned turning off the system which provides high-speed internet to remote or crisis areas, such as war zones. 

The foreign minister said that turning off Starlink in Ukraine would result in a search for other suppliers and noted that the Polish Digitalisation Ministry funds half of the 42,000 Starlink terminals in the country, costing around $50 million (€46m) a year. 

""The ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers,” Sikorski wrote. 

Rubio hit back in a strong rebuke, rejecting claims that Musk would shut down the system and telling Sikorski to ""say thank you"".

The exchange culminated in Musk calling Sikorski a ""small man"".

""Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink,"" Musk concluded. 

PiS was equally scathing of Sikorski, with former government minister Michał Wójcik writing on X, ""Poland is ruled by an unserious government that … is insulting the American administration.”

Former Deputy Foreign Minister Paweł Jabłoński suggested someone should ""take away Sikorski’s Twitter.” 

“Preferably before it leads to the US withdrawing its troops from Poland,” Jabłoński added. 

PiS enthusiastically celebrated US President Donald Trump's return to the White House. The national-conservative party enjoyed close relations with Trump during his first term, when they were also in power.

Tusk directly defended Sikorski from comments made by PiS, also writing later on X that,  ""True leadership means respect for partners and allies. Even for the smaller and weaker ones. Never arrogance. Dear friends, think about it.""

The country's foreign ministry told Polish Press Agency that ""this discussion has perhaps made the American public aware that the United States does not pay for everything …and that Ukraine is not so much a loss as an investment in security”.

Starlink terminals are key to Ukraine's army operations and have been in place in the country since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. 

Despite Rubio and Musk's insistence that the services would not be shut off, the European Commission is looking into securing alternative satellite communications services for Ukraine amid concerns Musk could use access to the system as a bargaining chip to pressure Kyiv into a peace deal. 

A possible rare-earth minerals deal between the US and Ukraine is reportedly on the table as the two sides meet in Saudi Arabia for peace talks this week.

        An oil tanker and cargo ship collided off the UK coast near Hull, causing a fire. A major rescue operation is under way involving lifeboats and helicopters.
    

An oil tanker and a cargo ship collided in the North Sea off the UK coast on Monday, triggering a major rescue mission.

UK authorities launched lifeboats and firefighting vessels to the scene some 10 nautical miles out from the city of Hull after an alarm was sounded at around 11 am CET, authorities said.

""A coastguard rescue helicopter from Humberside was called, alongside lifeboats ... an HM Coastguard fixed-wing aircraft, and nearby vessels with firefighting capability,"" a coastguard spokesperson said on Monday.

At least 32 casualties have been brought ashore, according to Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East. Their condition is not immediately clear. 

Initial reports showed fire and thick black smoke pouring from both ships. Boyers said that there had been a ""massive fireball"" when the vessels collided. 

The incident involved a US-registered oil tanker, Stena Immaculate, and a Portuguese container ship called the Solong, registered in Madeira, according to ship tracking website Vessel Tracker. 

The tanker was listed as sailing from the Greek port of Agioi Theodoroi, while the cargo vessel was on course from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. 

The Stena Immaculate is the larger of two ships, listed as being 183 metres long and 32 metres wide. The Solong is 140.6 metres long and 21.8 metres wide, according to ship tracking site Marine Traffic. 

The site data shows Solong was drifting at 0.3 knots according to its last tracked position.

The UK Coastguard says it was assessing a ""likely"" counter-pollution response, although it isn't known what the oil tanker was carrying at the time of the incident. 

UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was ""concerned"" to hear of the collision between the two vessels. She thanked ""all emergency service workers involved in their continued efforts in responding to the incident.""

The Met Office said visibility was poor in its morning forecast for Yorkshire and Humber. 

“Areas of fog and low cloud lifting as winds increase through the morning, with some warm, if rather hazy sunny spells expected in places for a time,” the weather agency said.

        Mahmoud Khalil, an Algerian of Palestinian ancestry, served as a student negotiator during talks with university staff.
    

A pro-Palestinian activist who played a prominent role in Columbia University protests against the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza was detained in New York on Saturday evening, his lawyer has said. 

The arrest of Mahmoud Khalil marks a major development in the Trump administration’s pledge to arrest and deport international students involved in what it calls antisemitic campus demonstrations against Israel. 

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested Khalil at his university-owned flat in New York on Saturday evening, according to his lawyer Amy Greer, who said that, as of Sunday evening, she did not know where her client was being detained. 

The ICE officials threatened to arrest Khalil’s wife, who is eight months pregnant, Greer added. 

In a phone call she had with one of the agents during the arrest, Greer said she was told that the State Department was seeking to cancel Khalil’s student visa. 

After she informed them that Khalil was in fact living in the US with permanent Green Card residency, the official said they would attempt to revoke that instead, Greer added. 

“We have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained. This is a clear escalation. The administration is following through on its threats,” the lawyer said. 

Khalil’s arrest was confirmed on Sunday by Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, who said it was carried out “in support of President (Donald) Trump's executive orders prohibiting antisemitism”. 

McLaughlin alleged that Khalil, an Algerian citizen of Palestinian origin, had “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organisation”. She has not provided any evidence to back the claims.

Responding to his arrest, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio took to X to say that Khalil’s detention was just the start. 

“We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported,” he said on Sunday, without providing any evidence against Khalil.

Meanwhile, critics said that the Trump administration was acting out of self-interest.

“This has the appearance of a retaliatory action against someone who expressed an opinion the Trump administration didn't like,” said Camille Mackler, founder of Immigrant ARC, a coalition of legal service providers in New York.

Khalil, who recently graduated from Columbia University with a master’s in international affairs, served as a negotiator for students in their talks with university officials during the protests at Columbia.

One of the demonstrators’ demands was for the university to divest from companies tied to Israel. 

As a result of Khalil’s visible role, pro-Israeli activists have called in recent weeks for the Trump administration to take action against him. 

Since starting his second presidential term, Trump has promised to go after people involved in what he calls “illegal protests” against Israel. 

“Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on the crime, arrested,” he said on his social media site Truth Social last Tuesday. 

On Friday, the US government said it was cutting $400 million (€368.7m) in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University over its campus protests against the war in Gaza.

        The teacher, who maintains her innocence, is reported to have regularly humiliated Evaëlle, 11, in front of her peers.
    

A French school teacher is to appear in court on Monday and Tuesday after being accused of harassing an 11-year-old pupil who later took her own life. 

Six years ago, Evaëlle's father found his daughter dead in her bedroom in the northwest Parisian suburb of Herblay-sur-Seine. 

He discovered diaries in which Evaëlle had written about being harassed at school, listing the names of people who had “bothered"" her. 

One of Evaëlle's teachers — who denies the allegations — is suspected of harassment.

The teacher is alleged to have “regularly humiliated her in front of the class"", according to a court referral order seen by French outlet FranceInfo. 

The document also stated that this “repeated behaviour“ led to “a very significant deterioration in the living conditions of the young girl, who became increasingly isolated and defensive"". 

The teacher, who is being tried in the Pontoise Criminal Court, worked at a secondary school in the Val-d'Oise department, which Evaëlle attended for six months between September 2018 until February 2019. 

The girl's parents filed a police complaint over the teacher's actions, and decided to move their daughter to a different school. 

Evaëlle died in June 2019.

        Rupert Lowe, the now independent MP for Great Yarmouth, denies any wrongdoing, saying he is being targeted because of political differences with party leader Nigel Farage.
    

Infighting has taken hold of the anti-immigration Reform UK party, following its decision to suspend a politician for alleged misconduct. 

The right-wing British party, which has surged in opinion polls in recent months, announced last week that Rupert Lowe, who now sits as the independent MP for Great Yarmouth, was being investigated over allegations of bullying in his parliamentary offices.

Reform UK also said the police were looking into reports that Lowe had made “threats of physical violence” against the party’s chairman Zia Yusuf. 

Lowe denies all the charges, claiming there is “zero credible evidence” against him and that the allegations constitute a “political assassination”. He has indicated that he could start legal proceedings against the party over its actions. 

News of his suspension came shortly after the Daily Mail newspaper published an article in which Lowe said Reform UK under its leader Nigel Farage was a “protest party led by the messiah”. 

Their public quarrel has only escalated since the politician’s suspension, with British political commentators suggesting the episode indicates a power struggle between Farage and Lowe over the future direction of Reform UK. 

Writing in the Telegraph newspaper on Saturday, Farage said it would have been “inconceivable” for his party to have ignored the allegations against Lowe. 

Farage also warned against internal disputes. “If the last general election taught us anything, it is that the public does not like political parties that engage in constant infighting,” he wrote, in reference to the previous Conservative government. 

In response, Lowe said he had “enormous respect” for Farage, before adding that the party leader’s version of events was “an entirely false and poisonous narrative”. 

Lowe has suggested that Farage is unhappy about his public support for mass deportations, of the kind that US President Donald Trump has promised. 

In the latest YouGov polling, Reform UK is currently the second most popular party in Britain.

Last week’s survey suggests that it has 25% of the electorate’s support, 1 point behind the governing Labour Party and 4 points ahead of the Conservative Party. 

Reform UK’s success has been a striking development in British politics, given the long dominance of the Labour and Conservative parties. 

As a result of Lowe’s suspension, Farage’s party now only has four MPs in parliament.

        A report by the National Observatory on Violence Against Women found that seven in ten women in the Île-de-France region have been subjected to some form of sexual violence on public transport.
    

The number of reported victims of sexual violence on public transport hit a record high in France last year, a report has revealed.

The study, which was published by the National Observatory on Violence Against Women on Monday, found that the annual number of victims had increased by 86% since 2016. 

In 2024, 3,374 victims of sexual violence on public transport were recorded by the police, 6% higher than the previous year and 9% above the figures seen in 2022, according to the report. 

The forms of abuse highlighted by the study included sexual harassment as well as rape and attempted rape. 

More than nine out of every 10 victims were women, with 75% of them aged under 30. 

The most affected area of the country was the Île-de-France region, where 44% of all incidents were recorded and where seven out of ten women said they have experienced sexual violence on public transport at some point in their lives. 

Manon Marguerit, an urban planning researcher at Gustave-Eiffel University, said: “The perpetrators that always come to mind are exhibitionists and gropers. It is true that certain characteristics of public transport spaces — such as confinement, overcrowding, and the inability to escape from the vehicle — can lead to these specific forms of sexual violence."" 

 ""These incidents are a reality, but they dominate public perception, overshadowing other forms of violence,"" she noted, citing sexist insults and unwanted touching as two examples. 

""Too often dismissed as trivial, these behaviours can cause significant trauma to those who experience them,"" Marguerit said. 

The report said that 96% of perpetrators were men, while 21% of cases were committed by multiple people. 

It added that many women were reluctant to report abuse, fearing they would not be taken seriously or that the authorities would be unable to act. 

As a result, only 7% of victims file a police report, according to the study. 

The report also found that more than one-third of victims reported feeling ashamed, while 70% felt anger and 60% expressed a desire for societal change. 

Many women who take public transport adopt avoidance strategies, such as altering their routes, travel times or even their clothing, the report found. 

Between 2005 and 2024, 152 cases of sexual violence by drivers of ambulances, buses, and school transport were recorded, with 67% of victims being minors and 23% being individuals with disabilities. 

The National Observatory on Violence Against Women called for stricter background checks and enhanced monitoring of transport workers to prevent repeat offenders from remaining in positions of authority.

Chaos broke out in Romania's capital on Sunday as supporters of Calin Georgescu protested the electoral body's decision to reject his candidacy in the presidential election rerun.

Protests erupted in Romania’s capital Bucharest on Sunday after the electoral body rejected ultranationalist Calin Georgescu’s candidacy for the country’s presidential election rerun.

Georgescu, 62, won last year’s first round before the election was annulled over alleged Russian interference. 

The rejection of his bid sparked outrage, with hundreds of supporters gathering outside the Central Election Bureau's headquarters, chanting, throwing objects, and setting a bush on fire.

The first round of the presidential election rerun is scheduled for May 4.","{'href': 'https://www.euronews.com', 'title': 'Euronews'}"

        The one day walk out has already left thousands of flights grounded at hubs including Berlin, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf and Munich.
    

A one-day strike by workers at 13 German airports, including the Frankfurt and Munich hubs and all the country's other main destinations, has caused the cancellation of most flights on Monday 10 March.

More than half a million people could face travel disruption today across the country, with more than 3,400 expected flight cancellations, according to German Airports Association ADV. 

Passengers have been urged not to travel to airports and are being advised to contact their airline or tour operator for information about rebooking or alternative travel options. 

The 24-hour walkout, which started at midnight, involves public-sector employees at the airports as well as ground and security staff. The strike is part of an ongoing dispute over wages and working conditions. 

The operator of Frankfurt Airport, Germany's busiest, has said that no passenger flights will depart from there on Monday. Transfers are also likely to be affected.

At Frankfurt Airport, 1,054 of the day's 1,116 scheduled takeoffs and landings had been canceled, German news agency dpa reported, citing airport traffic management.

The airport operator says delays and cancellations may also be possible on Tuesday. 

The Lufthansa Group, which has its main hub at Frankfurt Airport, has confirmed that it is facing ""delays and extensive cancellations"" across all of its airlines. This includes German flag carrier Lufthansa, Eurowings, Austrian Airlines and Swiss International Air Lines. 

Flights have also been cancelled at Berlin Brandenburg Airport, as it warned that ""all regular departures and arrivals will be affected by the strikes and therefore cannot take place."" Affected passengers have been advised to contact their airline or tour operator for information about rebooking options and alternative travel options.

The airport is expecting to resume regular and scheduled airport operations on Tuesday 11 March. 

Hamburg Airport has said no departures would be possible with strikes affecting several areas including aircraft handling and passenger security checks. Arrivals may still be possible but, it adds, ""significant disruptions and cancellations are expected"". Late night check-in for Tuesday flights also won't be possible on 10 March. 

It has advised passengers planning to depart on Monday not to come to the airport and to contact their airline. 

Cologne/Bonn Airport said there was no regular passenger service on 10 March, adding that ""passengers who have booked a flight for Monday should contact their airline or travel agent before travelling to find out about the status of their flight."" 

Munich Airport advised travelers to expect a ""greatly reduced flight schedule"", saying passengers are ""strongly advised to check the flight status with their airline"". 

Hannover Airport has asked all passengers who are going to depart from or arrive in Hannover on 10 March to contact their airline or tour operator.

The ver.di service workers union's strike targeted the Hamburg, Bremen, Hannover, Berlin, Duesseldorf, Dortmund, Cologne/Bonn, Leipzig/Halle, Stuttgart and Munich airports. 

At the smaller Weeze and Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden airports, only security workers were called out. The union announced the strike on Friday. 

At Hamburg Airport, ver.di added a short-notice walkout on Sunday 9 March to the strike on Monday, arguing that it must ensure the measure was effective. 

Staff walked out early on Sunday morning, leaving thousands of passengers facing disruption, and airlines forced to cancel or redirect flights. Almost all flights to and from the airport were cancelled. 

Some passengers had reportedly already checked in their luggage and were having problems getting it back, according to public broadcaster NDR. 

The so-called ""warning strike,"" a common tactic in German wage negotiations, relates to two separate pay disputes: negotiations on a new pay and conditions contract for airport security workers, and a wider dispute over pay for employees of federal and municipal governments.

The latter already has led to walkouts at Cologne/Bonn, Duesseldorf, Hamburg and Munich airports. 

Pay talks in that dispute are due to resume on Friday, while the next round of talks for airport security workers is expected to start on 26 March.

Israel's Knesset Health Committee held a heated discussion on a proposal for Israel to leave the World Health Organization (WHO), a United Nations agency. The committee will hold another discussion to hear from government ministry representatives.The WHO was established on April 7, 1948, as a UN agency with the mission of promoting global public health, combating infectious diseases, and assisting countries in health emergencies. It is primarily funded by member states, alongside contributions from international foundations and private entities.Israel joined the organization in 1949 and has since participated in its activities and provided financial support as part of its international commitments. However, recent calls within the government have pushed for Israel to withdraw from the WHO.  Claims of antisemitism and calls for withdrawalThe discussion was initiated by MK Limor Son Har-Melech (Otzma Yehudit), who argued that the WHO consistently takes a hostile stance against Israel, promoting resolutions that harm its international standing.""The organization's policies are often tainted with antisemitism and clear discrimination against Israel, severely undermining its legitimacy as a sovereign state,"" she said. ""The US president announced America's withdrawal from the organization on his first day in office, recognizing that the WHO does not serve the interests of democratic nations and even harms them.

Spanish police have arrested 11 Pakistani nationals on suspicion of belonging to the banned terrorist organization, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).According to Spanish media, a joint operation by the National Police, Mossos d'Esquadra, and the Italian Polizia di Stato led to the arrests in Barcelona. The suspects are accused of ties to a Pakistani-origin terrorist organization that promoted violent actions—including murders and beheadings—via encrypted communication channels.  Investigations reveal that the group, allegedly linked to TTP and also known as the “Pakistani Taliban,” operated with a hierarchical structure. The organization used instant messaging platforms to indoctrinate followers and identify potential targets in Europe.The Spanish National Police stated that the investigation is part of the third phase of an ongoing operation that has resulted in 30 arrests in Spain over the past three years. Of the detainees, ten were apprehended in Barcelona and its metropolitan area, while one was arrested in Italy.

The organization used instant messaging platforms to indoctrinate followers and identify potential targets in Europe.The Spanish National Police stated that the investigation is part of the third phase of an ongoing operation that has resulted in 30 arrests in Spain over the past three years.

Canada elected Mark Carney as the leader of Canada’s Liberal Party, and he will serve as the successor of Justin Trudeau for Canada’s prime minister role. While vowing to fight Trump’s tariffs, Canada’s Jewish community is not convinced that he will keep the same vow to fight antisemitism, nor is his stance on Israel promising in the Diaspora.Carney was a former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England and has never previously held an elected role in office. He garnered 85.9% of the vote in the four-person race, taking control of the ruling party following Trudeau’s departure after nine years.  Though Carney will take office immediately, he will face Pierre Poilievre, the leader of Canada’s Conservative Party, in national elections expected in October. According to the Forward, Poilievre has called Canadian Jews “the true Indigenous people” and has even hitchhiked through Israel in his youth. However, following backlash against Trump’s tariffs on Canadian imports, Poilievre’s party’s support has narrowed.More than 335,000 Jews live in Canada, accounting for 0.9% of the population. Since the October 7 Hamas massacre, Canada’s Jewish population has faced a new level of antisemitic attacks. Between firebombs and gunshots at synagogues, antisemitic graffiti, and continued anti-Israel protests, the country has faced an antisemitic power surge. AdvertisementTrudeau previously criticized the IDF’s Gaza response, backed UN resolutions against West Bank Israeli settlements, and said he would enforce the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Uncertainty surrounding Canadian-Israeli relations under CarneyEven though Jewish leaders nationwide were supportive of Trudeau’s departure, they do not necessarily think Canada-Israel relations will be better under Carney. The prime minister-designate met with Netanyahu in 2012 when he visited Israel, according to the Forward. Since then, it’s been mixed signals despite condemning antisemitic attacks and calling for stronger enforcement of hate speech laws.He has made mistakes in political debates and has appeared in social media posts from pro-Palestinian student groups. The Conservative mayor of Hampstead, Jeremy Levi, accused Carney of being silent in recent statements on Israel and antisemitism. On Instagram, Levi wrote, “Silence speaks volumes, and his silence is deafening.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  However, he was cited with a low grade on Palestinian rights by Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East due to his lack of clear positions on the matter. AdvertisementCarney has attended Holocaust memorial events and stated, “Never Again is more than a phrase – it must be a promise.” While balancing public support for Israel’s right to defend itself and the removal of Hamas, he has also supported the establishment of a Palestinian state.Carney mistakenly said he “was in agreement with Hamas” in answering a question on the governance of post-war Gaza. His chief rival interjected and said their party did not support Hamas, leading him to correct himself to say he supported the establishment of an independent Palestinian state without the involvement of the terror organization.Last month, Carney said, “I support the hard work of reaching a two-state solution, with a viable and free Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the State of Israel.” His critics still describe his response as bland.  Though many say he is not doing enough or speaking up, he was still one of 50 leaders and clergy who signed an open letter calling for the enforcement of law at pro-Palestinian protests, pushing for the identification of hate speech.His October 7 social media response quoted Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel: “I learned the perils of language and those of silence. I learned that in extreme situations where human lives and dignity are at stake, neutrality is a sin.”The question remains: Will he take this to heart in his role as prime minister?

The Arab League held a summit in Cairo on March 4 with the sole intention of considering a comprehensive plan for Gaza’s future, masterminded by Egypt.Costed at some $53 billion, it focuses in a 112-page document on emergency relief, rebuilding shattered infrastructure, and long-term economic development. The conference endorsed the plan, as far as it went. The later stages will require more detailed consideration.  It was on February 4 that US President Donald Trump announced his proposal to turn the Gaza Strip into a US-run “Riviera of the Middle East,” having first evacuated the population to any nearby Arab states willing to accept a total of some two million people.The Arab world, as well as much of the rest of the globe, greeted the idea with a mixture of astonishment and ridicule. Some commentators, claiming to know Trump’s methods, maintained that he had deliberately used shock tactics to goad the Arab world into playing a more active role in considering Gaza’s future and how to achieve it. AdvertisementIf this was indeed the method in Trump’s madness, it produced results. A couple of weeks later, on February 17, news media worldwide reported that Egypt was preparing an alternative to Trump’s proposal in which evacuating the territory and relocating the Gazan population would play no part.

The Arab plan does not mention the need for Hamas to lay down its weapons and relinquish control over the Gaza Strip, much to the dismay of the US and Israel, says the writer. (credit: Egyptian Presidency/Reuters)The Egyptian plan for Gaza's futureThe Egyptian proposal called for establishing “secure areas” within Gaza, where Palestinians can live temporarily while Egyptian and international construction firms reconstitute the Strip’s infrastructure. More than two dozen Egyptian and international firms would take part, and the reconstruction would provide tens of thousands of jobs for Gaza’s population. Winding up the summit on March 4, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi welcomed “the consensus among the Arab countries to support the reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, which allows the Palestinian people to stay on their land without displacement.”In a social media post after the conference, Sisi said he looked forward to working with Trump, other Arab nations, and the international community “to adopt a plan that aims for a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian issue, ends the root causes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, guarantees the security and stability of the peoples of the region, and establishes the Palestinian state.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The Egyptian plan outlines a three-phase process taking five years, starting with a six-month “early recovery period” involving the establishment of “safe zones.” Some 1.5 million displaced Gazans would be moved into 200,000 prefabricated housing units and 60,000 repaired homes. This stage is estimated to cost some $3b. AdvertisementThe second phase, lasting two years and costing $20b., would see housing and utilities rebuilt. During the third phase, which would take another two years, an airport, two seaports, and an industrial zone would be built at a cost of $30b.As for the Strip’s governance, a key aspect of this plan is the establishment of a temporary Governance Assistance Mission from which Hamas would be excluded. This interim body would oversee humanitarian aid and initiate reconstruction efforts until a reformed Palestinian Authority can assume control. Despite this exclusion, Hamas has publicly welcomed the Egyptian plan as signaling strong Arab alignment with the Palestinian cause.Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the summit’s final communiqué calls on the UN Security Council to deploy an international peacekeeping force in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. In addition, the communiqué said Egypt will host an international conference in cooperation with the UN to agree on Gaza’s reconstruction.  Funding will probably require investment from oil-rich Gulf governments, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. A trust fund, overseen by the World Bank, will be established to handle pledges and donor-provided funds.A final stage, still open for Arab discussion and refinement, would start the process of creating a sovereign Palestinian state. Establishing interconnectivity between the West Bank, east Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip would be an early priority. In tackling this conundrum, the planners need look no further than Trump’s own comprehensive plan, “Peace to Prosperity: A Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian and Israeli People,” issued on January 28, 2020.The result of years of intensive diplomatic effort by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the plan envisaged the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank, excluding the settlements, plus a Gaza greatly expanded by a swath of Israeli territory south of the Strip. All Palestinian occupied territories would be made contiguous by way of a network of highways and a road tunnel linking the West Bank to Gaza. The published plan contained maps illustrating how all enclaves of a sovereign Palestine could be interconnected.Trump’s plan was no sooner unveiled than it was vehemently rejected by Mahmoud Abbas, president of the PA, and other voices in the Arab world, though not universally. Significantly, both Saudi Arabia and Egypt seemed prepared to give the plan a fair hearing.The Egyptian Foreign Ministry stated: “Egypt recognizes the importance of considering the US administration’s initiative from the perspective of the importance of achieving the resolution of the Palestinian issue, thus restoring to the Palestinian people their full legitimate rights.”Egypt’s new plan for Gaza’s future, while carrying the wholehearted approval of the Arab League, has not fared so well in US and Israeli circles. The AP news agency reported that White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes has dismissed the Egyptian proposal as unworkable.“The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable,” said Hughes on March 4, “and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance. President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.”A spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, Oren Marmorstein, posted on X that the Egyptian plan “fails to address the realities of the situation.” The plan, he said, remains “rooted in outdated perspectives.”Nevertheless Egypt’s plan garnered backing from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who attended the Arab summit. “I welcome and strongly endorse the Arab-led initiative to mobilize support for Gaza’s reconstruction,” he said. “The UN stands ready to cooperate fully in this endeavor.”Initial knee-jerk reactions by US and Israeli spokesmen to the Arab-endorsed plan may yet be modified, especially as the White House announced on March 5 that, with Israel’s prior knowledge, the US was engaged in direct talks with Hamas about the ceasefire.

We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.”A spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, Oren Marmorstein, posted on X that the Egyptian plan “fails to address the realities of the situation.” The plan, he said, remains “rooted in outdated perspectives.”Nevertheless Egypt’s plan garnered backing from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who attended the Arab summit. “I welcome and strongly endorse the Arab-led initiative to mobilize support for Gaza’s reconstruction,” he said. “The UN stands ready to cooperate fully in this endeavor.”Initial knee-jerk reactions by US and Israeli spokesmen to the Arab-endorsed plan may yet be modified, especially as the White House announced on March 5 that, with Israel’s prior knowledge, the US was engaged in direct talks with Hamas about the ceasefire.

Trump’s plan was no sooner unveiled than it was vehemently rejected by Mahmoud Abbas, president of the PA, and other voices in the Arab world, though not universally. Significantly, both Saudi Arabia and Egypt seemed prepared to give the plan a fair hearing.The Egyptian Foreign Ministry stated: “Egypt recognizes the importance of considering the US administration’s initiative from the perspective of the importance of achieving the resolution of the Palestinian issue, thus restoring to the Palestinian people their full legitimate rights.”Egypt’s new plan for Gaza’s future, while carrying the wholehearted approval of the Arab League, has not fared so well in US and Israeli circles.

A return to war against Hamas will “challenge” the safety of the remaining Israelis being held hostage in Gaza, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich admitted during a press conference at the end of his party’s weekly meeting in the Knesset in Jerusalem on Monday.Smotrich, who has advocated strongly for a return to war, explained that the government had yet to do so in order to engage in negotiations to return as many hostages as possible first.  Smotrich had previously insisted that the war goals of defeating Hamas militarily and freeing the hostages did not contradict each other, but the comment on Monday indicated that this may no longer be possible and that a decision to reinvade Gaza could indeed lead to harm to the hostages.The comments were in line with statements made in February by Smotrich’s party member National Missions Minister Orit Struk, who said at a Besheva conference that “destroying Hamas was more important than freeing the last hostage.” AdvertisementDirect talks between US and Hamas ""an utter mistake,"" Smotrich addsIn an interview on KAN Radio on Monday morning, Smotrich said that the direct talks between US President Donald Trump’s Envoy for Hostages, Adam Boehler, and Hamas were an “utter mistake.” United States Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Adam Boehler against backdrop of Hamas terrorists (illustration). (credit: REUTERS/LEAH MILLIS, REUTERS/Ramadan Abed)According to Smotrich, Boehler had “acted on his own accord” in order to free the captive soldier Edan Alexander, who is a US citizen. Boehler was acting “naively”, and the plan he proposed in Hamas’s name, whereby the organization agreed to disarm and return all hostages in return for a 5-10 year ceasefire, was “utter nonsense,” he said. Smotrich noted Boehler’s post on X/Twitter on Sunday night clarifying that Hamas were “BY DEFINITION BAD people” (capital letters in source). A member of Smotrich’s party, MK Simcha Rothman, made similar comments in a debate in the Knesset Constitution Committee on Monday morning.Rothman's commentsAccording to Rothman, “Adam Boehler, and anyone who negotiates with Hamas, causes great harm to the return of hostages”.

The partnership between Qatar and Hamas has become legitimate and accepted by the US administration under Netanyahu's auspices. Friends, this is a historic diplomatic achievement for Hamas, under the auspices of Netanyahu's diplomatic failures,” Golan argued.

The last sentence that US President Donald Trump uttered recently at the end of the rather unconventional/bizarre confrontation in the Oval Office, between himself and Vice President JD Vance on the one side, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, on the other, was: “All right, I think we’ve seen enough. What do you think? Great television; I will say that.”The confrontation was unconventional and bizarre because it resembled an impromptu, rather long press conference before the two presidents were to have signed an agreement that would hand over around half of the Ukrainian mineral rights to the US.   This arrangement is designed as compensation to the US for the hundreds of billions of dollars of military and other aid that it has delivered to Ukraine to enable it to wage its three-year war against Russia, which broke out on February 24, 2022.Trump’s price for his efforts to bring a ceasefire between Ukraine and RussiaThis prospective agreement also appears to be Trump’s demanded price for his efforts to bring a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin, based on the false assumptions that Zelensky was responsible for the outbreak of the war, and the false accusation that Zelensky does not want a ceasefire. AdvertisementOn February 28, the agreement was not signed, and Zelensky was thrown out of the White House, after being accused by Trump of “gambling with lives of millions of people,” “gambling with World War III,” and being insulted on various bizarre excuses, such as the clothes he wears, (since the outbreak of the war, Zelensky has chosen to dress in public – including his visit to the White House – in simple sweatshirts and sweaters bearing the Ukrainian trident symbol, cargo pants, and work boots), and being disrespectful to his American benefactors. US President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House in Washington, US, February 28, 2025. (credit: REUTERS/BRIAN SNYDER/FILE PHOTO)One of the questions that have been asked is whether Trump had deliberately set Zelensky up, and whether the whole performance in the Oval Office was a preplanned charade designed to humiliate the Ukrainian president, whom he despises. Another question is whether Trump really believes that it was Zelensky who had invaded Russia, rather than Putin, who had invaded Ukraine. It is not unreasonable to assume that Trump is ignorant of the history of Russian-Ukrainian relations: that the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine was one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1991, and that after the Soviet Union was in the process of dissolving itself at the end of 1991, an overwhelming majority in Ukraine voted in favor of independence. The borders of post-independence Ukraine were the borders of the defunct UkSSR – not the result of some dubious negotiations.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Since 1999, Putin – both as president and prime minister of Russia – never concealed his distaste for the fact that the Soviet Union had split in 1991. He has rejected some of the independent states that were subsequently established, while encouraging Russian irredentist claims against them – especially in Ukraine’s case. AdvertisementIn February 2014, Russia occupied and subsequently annexed the Crimean Peninsula, which had formed part of Ukraine. This followed the ousting of Ukraine’s pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, in the process of its “Revolution of Dignity.” The occupation and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula was merely a prelude to what was to follow eight years later.Trump warming up to PutinWHAT HAS led to Trump’s current policy toward Ukraine undoubtedly also has to do with his policy of warming up to Putin, and his apparent movement away from Europe and NATO. No one knows how far all this will go – whether to the complete disruption of the post-World War II American alliance with non-Communist Europe, or to less extreme changes in the North Atlantic Alliance.Undoubtedly, Ukraine and its president certainly find themselves in a difficult conundrum. Zelensky didn’t come prepared for what was to happen to him in Washington on February 28. If he was set up – he fell into the trap; if the situation simply got out of control unplanned, he didn’t even try to alleviate the pressure by acting wisely rather than insisting on being right.  He should have tried to emulate French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had preceded him at the White House for talks with the unpredictable Trump on February 24 and 27 respectively. Both did their best to raise their concerns with the president, without angering him.The main problem with Trump’s conduct is that while he professes to be seeking peace in both the case of the Russian-Ukrainian War, and the Israel-Hamas War, rather than turn to the mechanisms created after World War II (largely at the behest of the US), he is turning to the pre-World War I and pre-World War II practices of balance-of-power machinations and secret diplomacy. These have been blamed in the past for having brought about, or at least failed to prevent ruinous wars.In the case of Ukraine, Trump is employing bilateral talks with Putin, without the involvement of Zelensky and the Europeans (minus Viktor Orban of Hungary, who is on Russia’s side). In the case of Israel and Hamas, Trump seems to be mounting the same path, now that the US has admitted (much to Israel’s chagrin) that it is negotiating bilaterally and secretly with Hamas (even though it was declared by the State Department in 1997 as being a terrorist organization) about the release of the hostages (both alive and dead) with American citizenship.I’m worried that at some point, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might (heaven forbid) find himself in a similar situation that Zelensky was in when he met with Trump on February 28. On August 1, 2024 Netanyahu got on the nerves of then-president Joe Biden, to such an extent that Biden scolded him over the phone saying: “Stop bullshitting me.” This was only a week after the two had met in the White House to discuss the ongoing negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas, and the issue of humanitarian aid for the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip.We know that Trump was furious with Netanyahu after the 2020 US presidential election, because the prime minister had congratulated Biden on his victory, which Trump had denied, and still denies. At the time, Trump more or less broke off his relations with Netanyahu. These days, with Trump back in the White House, how might he react if he feels that Netanyahu is bulls*****g him about returning all the hostages back home, due to difficulties in his coalition. At least Zelensky has the Europeans to fall back on if he loses US support altogether.

Another question is whether Trump really believes that it was Zelensky who had invaded Russia, rather than Putin, who had invaded Ukraine. It is not unreasonable to assume that Trump is ignorant of the history of Russian-Ukrainian relations: that the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine was one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1991, and that after the Soviet Union was in the process of dissolving itself at the end of 1991, an overwhelming majority in Ukraine voted in favor of independence. The borders of post-independence Ukraine were the borders of the defunct UkSSR – not the result of some dubious negotiations.   Stay updated with the latest news!

This followed the ousting of Ukraine’s pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, in the process of its “Revolution of Dignity.” The occupation and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula was merely a prelude to what was to follow eight years later.Trump warming up to PutinWHAT HAS led to Trump’s current policy toward Ukraine undoubtedly also has to do with his policy of warming up to Putin, and his apparent movement away from Europe and NATO.

Zelensky didn’t come prepared for what was to happen to him in Washington on February 28.

Both did their best to raise their concerns with the president, without angering him.The main problem with Trump’s conduct is that while he professes to be seeking peace in both the case of the Russian-Ukrainian War, and the Israel-Hamas War, rather than turn to the mechanisms created after World War II (largely at the behest of the US), he is turning to the pre-World War I and pre-World War II practices of balance-of-power machinations and secret diplomacy. These have been blamed in the past for having brought about, or at least failed to prevent ruinous wars.In the case of Ukraine, Trump is employing bilateral talks with Putin, without the involvement of Zelensky and the Europeans (minus Viktor Orban of Hungary, who is on Russia’s side). In the case of Israel and Hamas, Trump seems to be mounting the same path, now that the US has admitted (much to Israel’s chagrin) that it is negotiating bilaterally and secretly with Hamas (even though it was declared by the State Department in 1997 as being a terrorist organization) about the release of the hostages (both alive and dead) with American citizenship.I’m worried that at some point, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might (heaven forbid) find himself in a similar situation that Zelensky was in when he met with Trump on February 28. On August 1, 2024 Netanyahu got on the nerves of then-president Joe Biden, to such an extent that Biden scolded him over the phone saying: “Stop bullshitting me.” This was only a week after the two had met in the White House to discuss the ongoing negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas, and the issue of humanitarian aid for the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip.We know that Trump was furious with Netanyahu after the 2020 US presidential election, because the prime minister had congratulated Biden on his victory, which Trump had denied, and still denies. At the time, Trump more or less broke off his relations with Netanyahu. These days, with Trump back in the White House, how might he react if he feels that Netanyahu is bulls*****g him about returning all the hostages back home, due to difficulties in his coalition.

In the case of Ukraine, Trump is employing bilateral talks with Putin, without the involvement of Zelensky and the Europeans (minus Viktor Orban of Hungary, who is on Russia’s side). In the case of Israel and Hamas, Trump seems to be mounting the same path, now that the US has admitted (much to Israel’s chagrin) that it is negotiating bilaterally and secretly with Hamas (even though it was declared by the State Department in 1997 as being a terrorist organization) about the release of the hostages (both alive and dead) with American citizenship.I’m worried that at some point, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might (heaven forbid) find himself in a similar situation that Zelensky was in when he met with Trump on February 28. On August 1, 2024 Netanyahu got on the nerves of then-president Joe Biden, to such an extent that Biden scolded him over the phone saying: “Stop bullshitting me.” This was only a week after the two had met in the White House to discuss the ongoing negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas, and the issue of humanitarian aid for the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip.We know that Trump was furious with Netanyahu after the 2020 US presidential election, because the prime minister had congratulated Biden on his victory, which Trump had denied, and still denies. At the time, Trump more or less broke off his relations with Netanyahu. These days, with Trump back in the White House, how might he react if he feels that Netanyahu is bulls*****g him about returning all the hostages back home, due to difficulties in his coalition. At least Zelensky has the Europeans to fall back on if he loses US support altogether.

""[US President Donald] Trump is more of an Israeli patriot than Netanyahu, he is the one speaking directly to Hamas to free hostages"" Yehuda Cohen, whose son IDF gunner Nimrod is being held alive in Hamas captivity, said in the Knesset's Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee Monday morning.""We have got to a situation where it is more important to the Americans to free hostages than to our government. I am speaking to the Knesset here, which is supposed to review the government, and the Knesset is silent - not saying a single word,"" he added.  ""What is Netanyahu doing?"" he added. ""He is counting the days till March 17. What interests Netanyahu is the budget bill, what interests him is to survive with his coalition, which will maybe give him space for two more years to survive in spite of his criminal trial.""Nimrod's brother Yotam also spoke in the Knesset Monday, telling the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee (FADC) that had he known what the current situation would be, he would have told his brother to apply for US citizenship prior to the beginning of his service, because this would have improved his chances of being freed.

"" ""What is being a citizen of this country worth? Why did I draft to the IDF? Why did my brother draft? Why is my sister in the IDF now?

Cohen quoted the New York Times report that 41 hostages who had been captured alive had been killed in captivity and argued that a reinvasion of Gaza would endanger the remaining hostages, up to 24 of whom are still alive.""I suggest that every mother and every parent whose son is going to be drafted into the IDF ensure that your son is a US citizen before he is drafted, because otherwise he is not coming back,"" he said in a meeting of the Special Committee for Strengthening and Developing the Negev and Galilee.  Families of hostages also gave Knesset and Government representatives pita bread, wrapped up with yellow ribbon.Also in the meeting of the Special Committee for Strengthening and Developing the Negev and Galilee, Yotam handed Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli a pita with the quote from freed hostage Eli Sharabi's interview on Channel 12's Uvda ""opening a fridge is an entire world.""""There is a pita here, which is about the weekly amount that the hostages eat in captivity,"" he told the minister.""I would like to gift this to you, as a symbol of recognition, for the fact that you are abandoning hostages in captivity, and I would like it if every time you open the fridge, you will remember that my brother is hungry in captivity.""A cousin of Ofer Kalderon handed Government Secretary Yossi Fuchs a gift-wrapped pita, and requested that it be passed on to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He called it a “Mishloach Manot,” the traditional gift given on Purim, which will be celebrated this weekend.  'Dealing in death'Shimon Or, uncle of Avinatan Or, who is still in captivity, argued in the FADC meeting that the government was “dealing in death” by negotiating for a few hostages at a time and not demanding the release of all remaining hostages.In the same meeting, Yizhar Lifshitz, son of Oded Lifshitz, whose body was returned last month, said that the “Witkoff Proposal” to return half of the remaining live hostages, would make it difficult to return the rest of the live hostages, since they will be Hamas’s last bargaining chips and will not be released easily.Speaking in the Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee meeting, Danny Elgarat, whose brother Itzik was killed in Hamas captivity and returned to Israel for burial last month, highlighted the different treatment from Danish and Israeli officials after his brother's death.""You didn't call to express your condolences, you didn't write anything on Twitter about my brother - you ignored.,"" he told committee head Simcha Rothman.""I want to tell you that the Queen on Denmark sent a bouquet. The Danish parliament met in an emergency session and stood in a moment of silence. The prime minister of Denmark [Mette Frederiksen] sent a condolence letter in her own hand,"" he said, adding that the Copenhagen municipality also decided to name a square after his brother.""Long live the small difference between a Danish citizen and an Israeli citizen, as they say,"" he added sarcastically.""So I want to tell you that he is no longer in captivity, but he also did not come back; he was abandoned to his death, and he was buried. He is no longer suffering, he is not being starved, he is not a hostage, he is a victim.""

He called it a “Mishloach Manot,” the traditional gift given on Purim, which will be celebrated this weekend.  'Dealing in death'Shimon Or, uncle of Avinatan Or, who is still in captivity, argued in the FADC meeting that the government was “dealing in death” by negotiating for a few hostages at a time and not demanding the release of all remaining hostages.In the same meeting, Yizhar Lifshitz, son of Oded Lifshitz, whose body was returned last month, said that the “Witkoff Proposal” to return half of the remaining live hostages, would make it difficult to return the rest of the live hostages, since they will be Hamas’s last bargaining chips and will not be released easily.Speaking in the Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee meeting, Danny Elgarat, whose brother Itzik was killed in Hamas captivity and returned to Israel for burial last month, highlighted the different treatment from Danish and Israeli officials after his brother's death.""You didn't call to express your condolences, you didn't write anything on Twitter about my brother - you ignored.,"" he told committee head Simcha Rothman.""I want to tell you that the Queen on Denmark sent a bouquet.

Chelsea Handler hit out at billionaire Elon Musk with a brutal sex jab during her appearance at the South by Southwest, the music and tech festival in Austin.

The 50-year-old comic engaged in discussion with journalist Kara Swisher about her views on Donald Trump's administration and his presidency, including Tesla CEO Musk, 53, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

During the conversation, Swisher said that she has suggested Handler to date the SpaceX CEO, as per Daily Beast.

However, Handler, who recently opened up about the romance allegations between her and 62-year-old Ralph Fiennes, expressed no interest in dating or sleeping with the world's wealthiest man, who is said to have fathered 14 children.

“There's a lot I would do for the country, but having sex with Elon Musk is not one of them. I can’t,” the star said.

Handler further clarified that she likes “variety of men in my life” but added that she is not the type of girl who settles down.

Meanwhile, Swisher remarked that Handler would be Vice President JD Vance's nightmare.

Reacting to her comments, Handler blasted those men who keep women. The current state of politics, in her opinion, is an obvious illustration of “the fact that men are so scared of women”.

Handler also complained about Musk's presence in the White House. “I mean, did anyone vote for Elon Musk to be president?” the 50-year-old asked.

In her message to the audience, she asserted that she will not let Trump and his allies take away her joy this time.

“You know the first Trump presidency, for instance, I let it take me down, and I let it steal my joy. And I am not going to do that again,” she stated. “It’s the power of being optimistic in the dark and not going down a wormhole.”

While stressing that she does not “have answers” about how Democrats should respond to Trump, Handler said she does believe that Republicans could lose the upcoming elections.

The Elon Musk-led social media platform X (formerly Twitter) suffered second outage for several users across the world. 

The number of outage reports rose to more than 40,000 after easing a bit earlier in the day, user-submitted data on the outage-tracking website showed.

More than 10,800 users in the UK also reported outages earlier in the day.

Several users complained about not being able to load pages and refresh the timelines. 

“Twitter went down for an hour but seems to be okay now?"" an X user posted on social media. “Everyone going to X now Twitter is down,”@huzy14w, an X user, posted. However, the X services resumed shortly after suffering a global outage.

There were more than 21,000 incidents of people reporting issues with the platform in the U.S. and more than 10,800 incidents in the UK, according to Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources.

Downdetector.com said that 56% of problems were reported for the X app, while 33% were reported for the website.

Downdetector's numbers are based on user-submitted reports. The actual number of affected users may vary.

In March 2023 the social media platform then known as Twitter experienced a bevy of glitches for over an hour as links stopped working, some users were unable to log in and images were not loading for others.

Elon Musk took over Twitter in 2022 and later renamed it as X. Since then, the platform was rebranded as “X” and changed the terms “tweets” to “posts” and “retweets” to “reposts”.

Musk also replaced the iconic blue bird logo, originally named after basketball player Larry Bird, with a white X on a black background. The only thing that remained unchanged until today was the domain name - “twitter.com”. 

According to a PA Media report, X is in talks with investors over raising cash that would value the site at $44 billion (£34.9 billion).

The valuation is the same price Musk paid for the platform in 2022, and would suggest a turn in fortunes for the company, which has seen advertisers and users step away following a string of controversies under his ownership.

According to a report from Bloomberg News, the talks over the financing round are still ongoing and the details could change, and the amount of cash looking to be raised has not been confirmed.

A shocking video of children using a snake as a skipping rope has gone viral on social media, sparking outrage and concern. According to a report by 7NEWS, the incident took place in Woorabinda, a remote town in Central Queensland, Australia, about two hours from Rockhampton. The footage shows the children laughing and jumping over the snake while an adult, seemingly supervising them, records the scene.

In the video, a woman can be heard saying, “Show me that, show me what it is,” as she films the unusual act. The children, unfazed, continue to giggle and jump over the lifeless reptile. One of the boys in the clip identifies it as a black-headed python. However, it remains unclear whether the snake was already dead before the children began using it as a skipping rope.

Authorities condemn ‘inappropriate behaviour’As the video gained traction, drawing thousands of views online, the Department of Environment, Tourism, Science and Innovation stepped in to address the matter.

 BEIJING -China will exert utmost efforts to realise ""peaceful reunification"" with Taiwan, but will take all necessary steps to safeguard China's territorial integrity, its foreign ministry said on Monday. 

 China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory despite the objection of the government in Taipei. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te says only Taiwan's people can decide their future. 

 Last week, on the sidelines of China's annual meeting of parliament, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters that Taiwan would never be a ""country"", and to support ""Taiwan independence"" was to interfere in China's internal affairs. 

 China is ""willing to do our utmost to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity,"" said Mao Ning, spokesperson at the foreign ministry, when asked about Wang's remarks on Taiwan. 

 ""At the same time, China will take all necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and resolutely oppose Taiwan independence and external interference,"" Mao said. 

 In recent years, Beijing has ramped up its military pressure against the island, including holding several rounds of war games, keeping alive the prospect of the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. 

 The United States is Taiwan's key arms supplier even in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, but there is no defence treaty, unlike in the case of Japan and South Korea. 

 The United States must cease its arms sales to Taiwan and stop all military contacts with the island, Mao told reporters. 

 ""The Taiwan issue is the core of China's core interests and the first insurmountable red line in Sino-U.S. relations,"" she warned.

Prince Frederik of Luxembourg passed away on March 1 in Paris. However, his family didn’t officially announce the news of his passing until recently. The 22-year-old member of the royal family battled a rare genetic disorder known as POLG mitochondrial disease until his dying breath. 

“It is with a very heavy heart that my wife and I would like to inform you of the passing of our son, The POLG Foundation Founder and Creative Director, Frederik,” his father, Prince Robert of Luxembourg, revealed via the POLG Foundation website.

Prince Frederik was diagnosed with POLG at 14. The disease in question that claimed his life is believed to have a wide range of symptoms and affects many different organ systems, which makes it extremely difficult to diagnose and treat.

The deceased young man started the foundation in 2022, which describes the disease as a “genetic mitochondrial disorder that robs the body’s cells of energy, in turn causing progressive multiple organ dysfunction and failure.” The uncommon genetic disorder has also been compared to a faulty battery that never fully recharges and is in a constant state of depletion.

According to the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation, a cure for POLG disease has yet to be discovered. Available treatment for the mitochondrial disorder focuses on managing the symptoms and quality of life.

As the powerhouse of the cell, the mitochondria contain their own DNA which, to replicate, requires an enzyme encoded in the host cell’s POLG and POLG2 genes, per the POLG Foundation. Ultimately, inherited mutations in those genes compromise the mitochondria DNA’s replication. The UMDF states that over 200 disease-causing POLG mutations are currently known.

Depending on when the disease emerges, its symptoms range from mild to severe, including ophthalmoplegia, muscle weakness, epilepsy and liver failure.

“As is the case for 300 million people like Frederik worldwide, these diseases are usually hard to recognise even by physicians, and patients’ families may never know what they are suffering from as they may only be identified very late in their progression,” Prince Frederik wrote.

Sudiksha Konanki, the Indian-origin student who went missing in the Dominican Republic last week, believed to have died by drowning after being swept up in a large wave, as per the officials.

Three Dominican officials informed ABC News that Konanki, the 20-year-old student at University of Pittsburgh, arrived at a beach in Punta Cana with six other individuals on Wednesday night. While most of the group members returned to the resort, she remained on the sand with one other person until early Thursday.

Citing the police report, the outlet said Konanki went swimming with the other person and was confronted by a large wave.

Konanki was a lawful permanent resident of the United States and was residing in a wealthy suburb of Washington, DC.

She was last captured on security footage on March 6 at 4:15 AM local time, the Dominican Republic Public Ministry told ABC News. Family and friends raised alarm when Konanki did not return from the beach, and the hunt for her started early on March 8.

The authorities interrogated the “young man” who was swimming with Konanki, but it is yet to be clarified if he was also a Pitt student.

Speaking to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette over drowning reports, a representative for the sheriff's office in Loudoun County stated that speculation about her drowning may be “based on her last known location near the beach, but [there's] no evidence to support that conclusion at this time.”

While crews launched intensive searches over the white sands, rescue personnel commenced a desperate hunt for her, employing drones and helicopters to comb the water.

Meanwhile, her father Subbarayudu Konanki has urged authorities to broaden the scope of the probe beyond the water.

“They’re only searching the ocean, but what if she was taken? What if this wasn’t an accident?” he said after reaching the Dominican Republic. “We don’t think she could survive this long in the water, but that doesn’t mean she drowned. We need answers.”

Ontario, Canada's most populous province, announced a 25% hike in electricity export tariffs for nearly 1.5 million American consumers living in Minnesota, New York, and Michigan. The move is a retaliation against US President Donald Trump's decision to levy import tariffs on some Canadian goods and energy.

The revised prices will be effective on Monday. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said, “I will not hesitate to increase this charge. If the United States escalates, I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely.”

“Believe me when I say I do not want to do this. I feel terrible for the American people who didn't start this trade war. It’s one person who is responsible, it’s President Trump,” he added.

The provincial government expects to generate a revenue of $300,000 Canadian dollars ($208,000) to CA$ 400,000 ($277,000) per day by imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity supplied to American consumers. Ford's office said the increased revenue “will be used to support Ontario workers, families and businesses.”

Ontario's electricity tariffs are in addition to the federal government's $21 billion worth retaliatory tariffs on several American products, which will not be revoked unless Trump rescinds his tariffs completely. The US president has suspended his 25% levies on most Canadian imports under the trade agreement for a month as trade disputes ignited fears of inflation and economic downturn.

The provincial premier called for US tariffs to end. “Until these tariffs are off the table, until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario will not relent,” he said, vowing to maximise pain on the Americans as Trump keeps changing his stance “every day” and continues to attack Canada.

“I will do whatever it takes to maximize the pain against Americans,” Ford said.

Trump's decision to provoke a tariff war with the country's three biggest trading partners drew immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China and sent financial markets into a tailspin.

A shocking incident occurred at a high school track meet in Virginia on Friday, leaving Brookville High School sprinter Kaelen Tucker severely injured. While competing in the 4×200 meter relay at Liberty University, Ms Tucker was struck on the back of the head by a baton wielded by an opposing runner. The impact resulted in a diagnosed concussion and a suspected skull fracture, leaving her in need of medical attention.

Video footage shared on social media shows Ms Tucker attempting to overtake the Norcom runner, who then violently swung her baton, striking her on the head. The impact caused Ms Tucker to stumble, slow down, and eventually collapse on the track's interior. Her mother and team trainers promptly rushed to her side to assist.

Tamarro Tucker, Kaelen's mother, expressed concern that following the disturbing incident, no one from the I.C. Norcom High School team took the initiative to check on her daughter's well-being.

""No apologies. No coaches. No athlete. No anything. Even if it was an accident, which I don't believe it was, nothing,"" she said.

Twenty-year-old Sudiksha Konanki, an Indian-origin student, has gone missing in Dominican Republic where she was on a spring break trip with her classmates. The local police have expanded their scope of investigation, deploying ""several brigades have been deployed by sea and land"", according to Defensa Civil, a Dominican Republic search and rescue force. She was last seen with a man right before her disappearance in Punta Cana. The police said she was last seen on CCTV with seven other people entering the beach at the Riu Republica Hotel in Punta Cana after 4.15 am Thursday (March 6). Later surveillance video shows the man leaving the beach area at 9:55 am without Ms Konanki.

As per the police, Ms Konanki is a University of Pittsburgh student. Her father told CNN that his daughter had gone to Punta Cana for spring break, ahead of pre-med studies at Pittsburgh.

""My daughter is a very nice girl. She's ambitious. She wanted to pursue a career in medicine,"" Subbarayudu Konanki said, adding that his daughter wants to be a doctor.

Ms Konanki is a chemistry and biological sciences student at the University of Pittsburgh. She received a diploma in biological sciences from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in 2022, per her LinkedIn page.

The Konanki family, originally from India, has lived in the United States since 2006 and are permanent residents.

A flyer posted on Instagram describes Ms Konanki as 5 feet, 3 inches tall, with black hair and brown eyes. She is a resident of Ashburn, Virginia.

A Maryland resident has posted details about Ms Konanki, offering help in spreading the information about her. The post said she was last seen wearing a brown, two-piece bikini, big round earrings, a metal designer anklet on her right leg, yellow and steel bracelets on her right hand, and a multi-coloured beaded bracelet on her left hand.

The University of Pittsburgh has urged anyone with information to contact the Loudoun County Sherrif's Office.

NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, whose short mission to the International Space Station (ISS) ast year has turned into a 10-month marathon, are finally gearing up for a return to Earth. The American space agency has cleared to launch on SpaceX's Crew10 this week, which will bring the duo back as early as March 16, NASA officials have said. 

Sunita (Suni) Williams and Barry Wilmore initially embarked on a 10-day mission aboard the Boeing Starliner on June 5, 2024, but the spacecraft experienced thruster malfunctions during its approach and docking maneuvers. This resulted in an extensive investigation by NASA and Boeing back on the ground, with the space agency finally declaring the Starliner too risky to carry astronauts back home.

The spacecraft returned to Earth without its crew in September, leaving the two astronauts without a ride home. 

Later, NASA decided to bring both its astronauts back to Earth with the help of billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX. Williams and Wilmore were added to the downward leg of SpaceX's Crew-9 mission, which was launched with only two members -- NASA's astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov --  in September, making it possible to accommodate the duo stranded in space.

Crew-9's return was initially scheduled for February after it completed its six-month stay at ISS, but it was postponed due to logistical adjustments. Finally, NASA cleared the launch of Crew 10 on Friday.

The mission will be launched on March 12 from Kennedy Space Center, carrying astronauts Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Takuya Onishi, and Kirill Peskov. Due to construction delays, the crew is flying on the Endurance capsule instead of the originally planned new Crew Dragon spacecraft.

According to NASA, if the launch proceeds as planned, Crew 9 will undock on March 16 following a two-day handover period on March 14 and 15.

However, in case there are any delays in Crew10's mission, Crew 9's return will also be pushed back. Backup launch dates for Crew 10 are available on March 13 at 7:35 pm and March 14 at 7:04 pm, which would shift Crew 9's return to March 17 or 18 accordingly.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Images available with NDTV show a large cloth being removed from a tube attached to the lavatory system on board AI-126, the Boeing 777-300ER jetliner which had to return to Chicago on March 5 after the majority of its lavatories on board were choked.

A second picture (above) indicates that plastic waste had also been flushed down one of the toilets on the aircraft.

The images sourced by NDTV include two unrelated images (above) from separate Air India flights which have operated within the last two weeks.

One of the images shows an entire blanket being pulled out from an aircraft plumbing tube while a final image appears to show an item of clothing in a tube.

On March 5, the Air India Boeing 777 was flying over Greenland when most of its 12 toilets broke down. There were 300 passengers on board at the time.

The jetliner was forced to return to Chicago after having flown for approximately five hours.

In a statement, Air India said, ""Upon landing in Chicago, all passengers and crew disembarked normally and have been provided with accommodation to minimise inconvenience.""

Air India said it is aware of some social media posts about the unserviceable lavatories on the flight.

""We would like to confirm that as part of our investigation into the incident, our teams found polythene bags, rags, and clothes that had been flushed down and stuck in the plumbing. This led the lavatories to become unserviceable,"" it said.

Air India in a statement said it is aware of some social media posts about the unserviceable lavatories on the flight.

""We would like to confirm that as part of our investigation into the incident, our teams found polythene bags, rags, and clothes that had been flushed down and stuck in the plumbing. This led the lavatories to become unserviceable,"" it said.

""While we fully empathise with passengers who faced discomfort and whose travel plans have been affected by the flight's diversion, we would like to put forth the following facts about the flight: ""The flight departed in time at 1648 hours (UTC). About an hour and forty-five minutes into the flight, the crew reported some of the lavatories in Business and Economy Class to be unserviceable. Subsequently, eight of the 12 lavatories in the aircraft became unserviceable, causing discomfort to all on board.""

""By this time, the aircraft was overflying the Atlantic, leaving points in Europe as potential cities to divert to. However, due to restrictions on night operations at most of the European airports, it was decided to divert back to Chicago. The decision to divert was taken entirely in the interest of passenger comfort and safety,"" Air India said.

Upon landing at Chicago, all passengers were provided immediate assistance, including hotel accommodation and alternative flight options to continue their journey to Delhi, it said.



""While not found on AI126 of 5 March 2025, our teams have previously also found objects such as blankets, innerwear, and diapers, among other waste, having been flushed down the toilets on other flights. We take this opportunity to urge passengers to use lavatories only for the purposes that they are meant for,"" Air India said.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Indian-origin NASA astronaut Sunita Williams (Suni), who has been dubbed as the ""stranded astronaut"" over his stay in space since June last year, has done some ""amazing experiments"" and indulged in over 900 hours of research.

Having spent over 600 days in space so far, for three different missions, the 59-year-old also did spacewalks for 62 hours and nine minutes, leading the women astronaut corps in spending maximum time on the activity. 

Ms Williams and her fellow astronaut Barry (Butch) Wilmore have been at the International Space Station (ISS) for several months. The duo had launched aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 5 last year for its first crewed flight, and reached the space station on June 6 - for what was supposed to be an eight-day mission that eventually got extended. 

They, however, faced delays, space debris threats, helium leaks and technical glitches on the Starliner spacecraft on which they travelled.

Ms Williams is likely to be back on Earth in the next few weeks.

So what is it that Ms Williams is doing while orbiting the Earth, nearly 400 kilometres above?

On the way up to the ISS, the astronaut piloted the Boeing Starliner she helped develop, and which cost NASA 4.2 billion dollars. She, along with Mr Wilmore, saw the Starliner depart from the ISS and land safely on Earth on September 7. She also became the first woman astronaut to test a space capsule. 

At the ISS, Ms Williams helped with a lot of maintenance and cleaning of the football field-sized space station. She and her colleague helped replace many old instruments on the ISS and send back a lot of trash to Earth.

According to NASA, Ms Williams, Mr Wilmore and another astronaut, Nick Hague, ""completed more than 900 hours of research between over 150 unique scientific experiments and technology demonstrations during their stay aboard the orbiting laboratory"". 

As Ms William's stay got extended from weeks to months, the veteran of the three-space flight was then promoted to the role of ISS Commander, a rare distinction that placed the safety and security of the ISS on her shoulders. The ISS is possibly the single-most expensive engineering experiment ever to be undertaken by humans. It has continuously been inhabited by humans for the last 25 years.

Ms Williams had to accommodate extensive weight training in space, in her schedule, to keep her body fit and in shape as she floated around in near zero gravity in space. At  one point, there were swirling ""rumours"" about her health till she issued a clarification, saying she weighs the same as she did when she arrived at the ISS. Her ""wild hair"" also garnered worldwide attention, with US President Donald Trump saying: ""I see the woman with the wild hair, good, solid head of hair she's got. There's no kidding, there's no games with her hair.""

The astronaut has also taken a long spacewalk, also called an extra vehicular activity (EVA), and has completed 62 hours and nine minutes on the activity. 

On her last space walk on January 30, Ms Williams spent five hours and 26 minutes on EVA in an effort to upgrade the ISS. A fortnight before that, on January 16, she did a six-hour spacewalk.

She has also done some tests and experiments on her own physiology to have a better understanding of how the body reacts to the space environment. On an earlier visit, she ran a marathon in space.

As part of her outreach activities, Ms Williams sent Diwali, Christmas and New Year greetings to humans on Earth and even held a session with students of a school named after her. She even wished the participants of the 2024 Paris Olympics good luck from space.

Among other activities, the astronaut helped with some gardening in space by watering lettuce plants and studying them, in an effort which, according to NASA, could ""show how less-than-ideal conditions affect plant growth and help scientists design systems to produce safe and nutritious food for crew members on future space journeys"".

Ms Williams also carried out experiments on how to recover water at the ISS through what NASA described as the packed bed reactors, referring to systems that ""pack"" materials such as pellets or beads inside a structure to increase contact between any liquids and gasses flowing through it. 

She installed hardware for the Packed Bed Reactor Experiment: Water Recovery Series (PBRE-WRS) investigation, to examine how gravity affects these systems aboard the ISS. The results could help scientists design better reactors for water recovery, thermal management, fuel cells and other applications.

While Mr Wilmore swabbed the exterior of the ISS, searching for life on the inside of the space station, his colleague experimented with other microbes. According to NASA, Ms Williams posed with bacteria and yeast samples for Rhodium Biomanufacturing 03, part of an ongoing examination of microgravity's effects on bio-manufacturing engineered bacteria and yeast aboard the ISS. 

NASA says microgravity causes changes in microbial cell growth, cell structure and metabolic activity that can affect bio-manufacturing processes. This investigation could explain the extent of these effects and advance the use of microbes to make food, pharmaceuticals and other products in space, reducing the cost of launching equipment and consumables from Earth.

Ms Williams also carried out the BioNutrients investigation that demonstrated technology to produce nutrients during long-duration space missions using engineered microbes like yeast. Food stored for long periods can lose vitamins and other nutrients, and this technology could provide a way to make supplements on demand. She prepared specially designed growth packets for the investigation aboard the ISS.

Once she returns to Earth, Ms Williams will make another record having flown four different space capsules - Space Shuttle, Soyuz, Boeing Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon.

Incidentally, during her long stay at the ISS, a seismic shift happened in the politics and governance in the US, and she became an unwarranted accomplice in the war between the Democrats and the Republicans. She did not wade into the war of words, steering clear and focusing on her singular job as an astronaut.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Elon Musk-run X went down on Monday in a massive global outage, including in India, as users were unable to access the micro-blogging platform.

X, formerly Twitter, was non-operational for millions of users and the company was yet to respond to the reason behind the mega outage.

It, however, started to work for some users after facing at least a 30-40 minute outage during the day.

According to platform outage tracking platform DownDetector, the X outage peaked at around 15:00 hours.

A user commented: ""Is Twitter down? Anyone getting the same issue? Can't open the comments section"".

DownDetector reported a huge spike, with users rushing to lodge their complaints about the social media site on other platforms like Facebook and Instagram.

During the downtime, X stopped working completely while the users were unable to post tweets or even open pages on the platform.

X was acquired by Elon Musk in 2022 for $44 billion.

After the acquisition, X rarely went off the grid unlike its peers Facebook and Instagram.

Recently, the tech billionaire raised prices of its top-tier subscription service (Premium+) for his X social media platform by a massive 35 per cent for both new and existing users in India, including across global markets.

The Premium users in India now shell out Rs 1,750 a month - up from Rs 1,300 now, which is an approximately 35 per cent hike. Similarly, on an annual basis, the Premium users in the country pays Rs 18,300, up from Rs 13,600 at the moment (up by almost 35 per cent).

In India, the basic tier subscription rate remains unchanged at Rs 243 and premium tier at Rs 650 as well.

In the US, the Premium service will cost $22 a month, up from $16. Annual subscription cost has increased to $229 from $168.

The Trump administration rolled out a new app on Monday that will allow immigrants in the United States illegally to ""self deport"" rather than face possible arrest and detention, building on President Donald Trump's deportation push.

The US Customs and Border Protection app, called CBP Home, will offer an option for someone to signal their ""intent to depart,"" the agency said.

""The CBP Home app gives aliens the option to leave now and self-deport, so they may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American dream,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. ""If they don't, we will find them, we will deport them, and they will never return.""

Trump, a Republican, has vowed to deport record numbers of migrants in the US illegally. Trump's initial deportation numbers lagged the monthly average in fiscal year 2024 under Democrat Joe Biden, although Biden's deportations included many recent border crossers.

The Trump administration has taken other steps that could pressure immigrants in the United States illegally to leave.

A Trump administration regulation set to take effect April 11 would require people lacking legal status to register with the federal government or face fines or jail time.

CBP Home replaces an app known as CBP One that was launched under Biden. The Biden-era app included a feature that allowed some one million migrants in Mexico to schedule an appointment to request entry at a legal border crossing.

Republicans criticized the Biden program, saying it facilitated mass migration to the United States and did not adequately vet migrants.

Trump shut down CBP One hours after taking office, leaving migrants with pending appointments stranded and unsure of next steps.

North Korea fired ""multiple unidentified ballistic missiles"" on Monday, South Korea's military said, the same day Seoul and Washington began a major annual joint military drill known as Freedom Shield.

""Our military has detected at around 13:50 (0450 GMT) multiple unidentified ballistic missiles fired from Hwanghae province into the West Sea,"" the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the body of water also known as the Yellow Sea.

""Our military will bolster surveillance and maintain a full readiness posture under close cooperation with the United States,"" the JCS added.

The United States stations tens of thousands of US soldiers in South Korea, and the allies regularly stage joint drills, which they describe as defensive in nature.

But such exercises infurate Pyongyang, which regards them as rehearsals for invasion and routinely responds with weapons tests of its own.

Earlier Monday, the nuclear-armed North slammed the drills as a ""provocative act"", warning of the danger of sparking war with ""an accidental single shot"".

""This is a dangerous provocative act of leading the acute situation on the Korean peninsula, which may spark off a physical conflict between the two sides by means of an accidental single shot,"" said Pyongyang's foreign ministry, according to the Korean Central News Agency.

The joint US-South Korea ""Freedom Shield 2025"" exercise kicked off on Monday, and will involve ""live, virtual, and field-based training"", according to a US statement.

The exercise will run until March 20, the statement said.

The latest exercise comes after two South Korean Air Force fighter jets accidentally dropped eight bombs on a village during a joint training exercise with US forces on March 6.

Some 31 people, including civilians and military personnel, were wounded in that incident, South Korea's military said.

Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles last year in violation of UN sanctions.

The two Koreas remain technically at war since their 1950-1953 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.

The large-scale Freedom Shield exercises are one of the allies' biggest annual joint exercises.

In its statement on Monday, North Korea's foreign ministry dubbed the exercises ""an aggressive and confrontational war rehearsal"".

Last week, Pyongyang slammed the United States for ""political and military provocations"" over the visit of a US Navy aircraft carrier to the South Korean port of Busan.

Where is Vanuatu?

Vanuatu is an island nation in the South Pacific Ocean, about 1,750 km east of northern Australia. It lies southeast of the Solomon Islands, northeast of New Caledonia, and west of Fiji.

The archipelago consists of approximately 83 islands stretching 650 km in a Y-shaped configuration. Port Vila, situated on Efate Island, serves as the capital and largest city.

Formerly administered jointly by Britain and France, Vanuatu gained independence in 1980. Its economy depends on tourism, agriculture (copra, beef, kava, cocoa), and offshore financial services.

Is Vanuatu a Tax Haven?

Yes, Vanuatu is considered a tax haven. The nation imposes no income tax, withholding tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, or exchange controls, making it attractive for offshore financial activities.

This status has drawn scrutiny from international regulators.

On Pentecost Island in Vanuatu, villagers perform a daring tradition called land diving - jumping headfirst from wooden towers with vines tied to their ankles. Just like this risky plunge, Vanuatu faces an uncertain future as the world cracks down on tax havens.

The country's offshore finance industry took off in the 1970s amid global deregulation. But as financial crime - including money laundering, drug trafficking, and arms smuggling - became rampant, Vanuatu came under increasing pressure.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) placed it on its ""grey list"" for weak anti-money laundering regulations, isolating its banking sector. The 2017 'Paradise Papers' leak exposed hidden wealth tied to its offshore industry.

Vanuatu on Being Labelled a Tax Haven

Vanuatu changed its laws to improve financial oversight and transparency, leading many offshore banks to shut down. Yet, some in Vanuatu feel the country is still unfairly seen as a tax haven. Marie Noelle Ferrieux-Patterson, who leads the corruption watchdog 'Transparency International', argues that some US states offer even more secrecy than Vanuatu.

After the Global Financial Crisis, 83 countries agreed to stricter tax rules under the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). While six Pacific nations joined, Vanuatu remains on a list of countries yet to take full action. It will undergo an OECD review next year, abc.net.au reported.

Ms Ferrieux-Patterson insists Vanuatu is already quite transparent, as most of its international banks are linked to Australia and follow both Vanuatu and Australian regulations.

Vanuatu's History with Financial Controversies

Vanuatu's reputation as a tax haven is not new. In 2001, former Prime Minister Barak Sope was charged with forgery over unauthorised financial guarantees worth between $23 million and $100 million to Indian businessman Amarendra Nath Ghosh, as per CNN. The guarantees, signed without proper approval, led to Mr Sope's removal from office in April that year.

His successor, Edward Natapei, launched an investigation into the scandal, while Mr Sope, previously flagged by the Ombudsman Commission, continued to face legal trouble. At the time, Vanuatu's financial practices were under heightened scrutiny, leading to its withdrawal from WTO accession talks due to financial concerns.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

SAN JUAN ALOTENANGO, Guatemala (AP) — Guatemala’s Volcano of Fire is erupting, and authorities have evacuated nearly 300 families while warning that another 30,000 people in the area could be at risk.

The eruption started overnight. There is no immediate report of casualties. The 12,300-foot (3,763-meter) high volcano is one of the most active in Central America. It last erupted in June 2023.

The volcano spewed gas and ash far into the sky Monday, leading authorities to close schools in the vicinity and a key road connecting communities.

Claudinne Ugalde, secretary of the disaster agency, said “some 30,000 people more or less are at risk in these three (jurisdictions) and we are trying to have them evacuate or self-evacuate,” she said.

The biggest danger from the volcano are lahars, a mixture of ash, rock, mud and debris, that can bury entire towns.

A 2018 eruption killed 194 people and left another 234 missing.

Isaac García, 43, a resident of El Porvenir on the slopes of the volcano, had that tragedy in mind when he and his family decided to heed authorities’ warnings to evacuate early Monday.

“We were a little worried because a few years ago the volcano became active,” García said, referencing the 2018 eruption, as he spoke with a mask to protect against the falling ash. He came to a shelter opened in San Juan Alotenango with his mother, wife and their three children, as well as other relatives.




The volcano is 33 miles (53 km) from Guatemala’s capital.

The flow of volcanic material is weak to moderate but expected to increase, Guatemala’s disaster agency said early Monday.

PARIS (AP) — Military officials from more than 30 nations will take part in Paris talks on the creation of an international security force for Ukraine, a French military official said Monday.

Such an international force would aim to dissuade Russia from launching another offensive after any ceasefire in Ukraine comes into effect.

The long list of participants in Tuesday’s discussions will also include Asian and Oceania nations that will join remotely, the French official said. The international makeup of the meeting offers an indication of how broadly France and Britain — which are working together on plans for the force — are casting their net as they aim to build what the French official described as a coalition of nations “able and willing” to be part of an effort to safeguard Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire.

The French military official spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the blueprint for the force that is shrouded in secrecy and the Paris talks that will consider it.

The force being envisaged by France and Britain would aim to reassure Ukraine and deter another large-scale Russian offensive after any ceasefire, the official said. It could include heavy weaponry and weapons stockpiles that could be rushed within hours or days to aid in Ukraine’s defense in the event of a Russian attack that shatters any truce, the official said.

The French-British blueprint will be presented to military officials from more than 30 nations in the first part of Tuesday’s talks, the official said.




The talks’ second part will include “more precise and concrete” discussions where the participants will be invited to say whether and how their militaries might be able to contribute, the official said.

“It’s not, ‘This is what we need,’” the official said. “It’s more, ‘What are you bringing to the pot?’”

The official stressed, however, that the ultimate decision on whether nations take part in the force would be taken at a political level, by government leaders. 

Army chiefs or their representatives from nearly all of the 32 nations of the NATO military alliance will attend the Paris talks — with the notable exception being the United States.

The official said the United States wasn’t invited because European nations want to demonstrate that they can take responsibility for a large part of the post-ceasefire security framework for Ukraine.

Also attending will be the chiefs of staff of Ireland and Cyprus and a representative from Austria — all nations that are not NATO members but are in the European Union.

Australia and New Zealand, which are Commonwealth nations, as well as Japan and South Korea, will listen into the talks remotely, the official said. 

Ukraine will be represented by a military official who is also a member of the country’s security and defense council.

NUUK, Greenland (AP) — When U.S. President Donald Trump first suggested buying Greenland in 2019, people thought it was just a joke. No one is laughing now.

Trump’s interest in Greenland, restated vigorously soon after he returned to the White House in January, comes as part of an aggressively “America First” foreign policy platform that includes demands for Ukraine to hand over mineral rights in exchange for continued military aid, threats to take control of the Panama Canal, and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.

Increasing international tensions, global warming and the changing world economy have put Greenland at the heart of the debate over global trade and security, and Trump wants to make sure that the U.S. controls this mineral-rich country that guards the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America.




Greenland is a self-governing territory of Denmark, a long-time U.S. ally that has rejected Trump’s overtures. Denmark has also recognized Greenland’s right to independence at a time of its choosing.

Amid concerns about foreign interference and demands that Greenlanders must control their own destiny, the island’s prime minister called an early parliamentary election for Tuesday.

The world’s largest island, 80% of which lies above the Arctic Circle, is home to about 56,000 mostly Inuit people who until now have been largely ignored by the rest of the world.

Climate change is thinning the Arctic ice, promising to create a northwest passage for international trade and reigniting the competition with Russia, China and other countries over access to the region’s mineral resources.

“Let us be clear: we are soon entering the Arctic Century, and its most defining feature will be Greenland’s meteoric rise, sustained prominence and ubiquitous influence,’’ said Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative.

“Greenland — located on the crossroads between North America, Europe and Asia, and with enormous resource potential — will only become more strategically important, with all powers great and small seeking to pay court to it. One is quite keen to go a step further and buy it.”

The following are some of the factors that are driving U.S. interest in Greenland.

Following the Cold War, the Arctic was largely an area of international cooperation. But climate change, the hunt for scarce resources and increasing international tensions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are once again driving competition in the region.

Greenland sits off the northeastern coast of Canada, with more than two-thirds of its territory lying within the Arctic Circle. That has made it crucial to the defense of North America since World War II, when the U.S. occupied Greenland to ensure that it didn’t fall into the hands of Nazi Germany and to protect crucial North Atlantic shipping lanes. 

The U.S. has retained bases in Greenland since the war, and the Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Force Base, supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO. Greenland also guards part of what is known as the GIUK (Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom) Gap, where NATO monitors Russian naval movements in the North Atlantic.

Greenland has large deposits of so-called rare earth minerals that are needed to make everything from computers and smartphones to the batteries, solar and wind technologies that will power the transition away from fossil fuels. The U.S. Geological Survey has also identified potential offshore deposits of oil and natural gas. 

Greenlanders are keen to develop the resources, but they have enacted strict rules to protect the environment. There are also questions about the feasibility of extracting Greenland’s mineral wealth because of the region’s harsh climate.

Greenland’s retreating ice cap is exposing the country’s mineral wealth and melting sea ice is opening up the once-mythical Northwest Passage through the Arctic. 

Greenland sits strategically along two potential routes through the Arctic, which would reduce shipping times between the North Atlantic and Pacific and bypass the bottlenecks of the Suez and Panama canals. While the routes aren’t likely to be commercially viable for many years, they are attracting attention.

In 2018, China declared itself a “near-Arctic state” in an effort to gain more influence in the region. China has also announced plans to build a “Polar Silk Road” as part of its global Belt and Road Initiative, which has created economic links with countries around the world.

Then-U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected China’s move, saying: “Do we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a new South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?” A Chinese-backed rare earth mining project in Greenland stalled after the local government banned uranium mining in 2021.

The legislation that extended self-government to Greenland in 2009 also recognized the country’s right to independence under international law. Opinion polls show a majority of Greenlanders favor independence, though they differ on exactly when that should occur. The potential for independence raises questions about outside interference in Greenland that could threaten U.S. interests in the country.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabia is to host talks on Tuesday between the United States and Ukraine in a new diplomatic push after an argument erupted during President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s Feb. 28 visit to the White House. 

The oil-rich kingdom may seem like an unusual venue for talks aimed at smoothing over relations after the blowup. But Saudi Arabia under its assertive Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been positioning itself as an ideal location for possible peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow — and even the first face-to-face talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump. 

Here’s what to know about why this meeting is taking place and Saudi Arabia’s role:

U.S. and Ukrainian officials will meet after the Oval Office meeting between Zelenskyy, Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance descended into an extraordinary 10-minute argument before journalists. 

Trump at one point admonished Zelenskyy by angrily saying: “You’re gambling with World War III, and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country.” Zelenskyy ended up leaving the White House without signing a deal that included granting the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals. Kyiv hoped that deal would ensure the continued flow of U.S. military support that Ukraine urgently needs as it battles Russia in the war that began after Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.




Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry in a statement on Friday identified the location for the talks as Jeddah, a port city on the Red Sea. It’s not clear why the kingdom picked Jeddah as opposed to Riyadh, the Saudi capital where the initial Russia-U.S. talks took place on Feb. 18. However, Jeddah has hosted other diplomatic engagements in the past and is home to royal palaces. 

The Foreign Ministry said the kingdom would continue to pursue “a lasting peace to end the Ukrainian crisis.” 

“The kingdom has continued these efforts over the past three years by hosting many meetings on this matter,” the ministry said. 

Zelenskyy plans to visit Saudi Arabia on Monday ahead of the talks. He earlier delayed a trip to the kingdom after traveling to the neighboring United Arab Emirates, which also has been considered as a possible venue for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow. 

“We continue working on the relevant steps with our partners who want peace, who want it just as much as we do,” Zelenskyy said Friday. “There will be a lot of work here in Europe, with America in Saudi Arabia — we are preparing a meeting to accelerate peace and strengthen the foundations of security.”

Zelenskyy wrote online that a team including his chief of staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov traveling with him to Saudi Arabia will take part in the talks. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead the American team for the Ukrainian talks and meet with Prince Mohammed.

Sybiha also spoke on Friday with Rubio ahead of the talks. Sybiha described it as a “constructive call.” A two-sentence readout from the State Department said Rubio “underscored President Trump is determined to end the war as soon as possible and emphasized that all sides must take steps to secure a sustainable peace.”

Trump himself sounded upbeat on Air Force One on Sunday when speaking to journalists.

“I think you’re gonna have eventually — and maybe not in the distant future — you’re gonna have some pretty good results coming out of Saudi Arabia this week,” Trump said. 

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked on Monday about the talks, said: “It doesn’t matter what we’re expecting. It matters what the United States is expecting.”

Since assuming power in Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed took an aggressive posture both at home and abroad. His public image reached its nadir with the 2018 slaying of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, believed by the United States and others to be at the prince’s orders. 

In the last two years, however, Prince Mohammed instead has reached a détente with Iran, hosted Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit and been involved in negotiations over the wars in Sudan and the Gaza Strip. Riyadh also maintained ties to Russia through the OPEC+ oil cartel while Western nations levied sanctions against it. That’s reasserted the role the kingdom long has perceived itself as having — being the leader of the Sunni Muslim world and a dominant force in the Middle East. 

Hosting Russia-U.S. talks, possibly drawing Trump to the kingdom for his first foreign trip in this term through investments and other possible meetings only raise Saudi Arabia’s profile further as a neutral territory for high-stakes negotiations. Saudi Arabia’s autocratic government, compliant media and distance from the war also allows for talks to take place in a tightly controlled country with relative privacy. 

Trump remains focused on reaching some kind of peace deal to stop the war. His approach toward Ukraine so far has relied far more on stick than carrot — limiting their access to intelligence and weaponry. While conciliatory toward Putin, Trump recently also threatened new sanctions against Russia over its ceaseless attacks on Ukrainian cities. 

If Ukraine and the U.S. reach some sort of understanding acceptable to Trump, that could accelerate his administration’s push to talks. However, the rest of Europe remains skeptical as they have been sidelined from the talks. The European Union last week agreed to boost the continent’s defenses and to free up hundreds of billions of euros for security.

DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syria’s central government has reached a deal with the Kurdish-led authority that controls the country’s northeast, including a ceasefire and the merging of the main U.S.-backed force there into the Syrian army.

The deal was signed Monday by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa and Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.

The deal marks a major breakthrough that would bring most of Syria under the control of the government led by the group that led the ousting of President Bashar Assad in December.

The deal to be implemented by the end of the year would bring all border crossings with Iraq and Turkey in the northeast, airports and oil fields under the control of the central government.

Syria’s Kurds will gain their rights including teaching and using their language, which were banned for decades under Assad.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

Syria’s interim government on Monday announced the end of a days-long military operation against insurgents loyal to ousted president Bashar Assad and his family in the worst fighting since the end of the 13-year civil war in December. 

The Defense Ministry’s announcement comes after a surprise attack by gunmen from the Alawite community on a police patrol near the port city of Lattakia Thursday spiraled into widespread clashes across Syria’s coastal region, during which monitoring groups said hundreds of civilians were killed. 




Syria’s new interim Islamist rulers are struggling to exert their authority across the country and reach political settlements with other minority communities, notably the Kurds of the northeast and the Druze in southern Syria.

“To the remaining remnants of the defeated regime and its fleeing officers, our message is clear and explicit,” said Defense Ministry spokesperson Col. Hassan Abdel-Ghani. “If you return, we will also return, and you will find before you men who do not know how to retreat and who will not have mercy on those whose hands are stained with the blood of the innocent.”

Abdel-Ghani said that security forces will continue searching for sleeper cells and remnants of the insurgency of former government loyalists. 

Though the government’s counter-offensive was able to largely contain the insurgency, footage surfaced of what appeared to be retaliatory attacks targeting the broader minority Alawite community, an offshoot of Shia Islam whose adherents live mainly in Syria’s western coastal region. 

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said 1,130 people were killed in the clashes, including 830 civilians. The Associated Press could not independently verify these numbers.

The interim government is made up of members of Sunni Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which led a lightning insurgency in December that overthrew Bashar Assad, ending over half a century of his family’s dictatorial rule. The Assad family are Alawites.

Interim President Ahmad Al-Sharaa said the retaliatory attacks against Alawite civilians and mistreatment of prisoners were isolated incidents, and vowed to crack down on the perpetrators as he formed a committee to investigate the incident. 

Abdel-Ghani says the security forces will allow the committee “the full opportunity to uncover the circumstances of the events, verify the facts, and rectify wrongdoings.” 

Still, the footage of houses in several neighborhoods set on fire and bloodied bodies laid on the streets alarmed Western governments, who have been urged by Al-Sharaa to lift economic sanctions on Syria. 

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a statement issued Sunday urged Syrian authorities to “hold the perpetrators of these massacres” accountable. Rubio said the U.S. “stands with Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite, and Kurdish communities.”

Thousands of Syrians from the coastal area fled to neighboring Lebanon, mostly through unofficial crossings. The UN refugee agency said in a statement that according to local authorities, 6,078 people have arrived in about a dozen villages in northern Lebanon’s Akkar province fleeing the fighting, while arrivals in other parts of the country were still being verified.

Lebanon is hosting more than 755,000 registered Syrian refugees, with hundreds of thousands more believed to be unregistered. Since the fall of Assad, the flow had begun to reverse, with the UN reporting that nearly 260,000 Syrian refugees have returned home since November, about half of them coming from Lebanon.

Stephen Moore, who contributed to Project 2025, urges Congress to pass tax cuts by Memorial Day

Donald Trump’s focus on tariffs as an economic weapon is “misguided”, and the US economy is “very wobbly”, a former adviser and longtime supporter of the president said.

“I think that the president’s emphasis on tariffs right now is misguided,” Stephen Moore told Fox News on Sunday night. “I think we have a very wobbly economy. We saw a not-very-good jobs report on Friday. The consumer confidence numbers are sinking, and other indicators are not positive.

“The economy needs [a] pick-me-up, and tariffs are not a pick-me-up. What is, is the Trump tax cut. Congress has to get this passed as soon as possible – by Memorial Day. That will provide the stimulus the economy needs.”

Long an advocate of tax cuts, Moore is the author of books including Trumponomics: Inside the America First Plan to Revive Our Economy, from 2018.

In 2019, Trump picked Moore for a seat on the Federal Reserve board. Moore eventually withdrew, after the Guardian reported tax and legal issues including underpayment of alimony – and other outlets reported allegedly sexist and racist remarks.

Moore said “unrelenting attacks on my character” had made seeking a Fed role “untenable for me and my family”. But he told Trump he would “continue to be a loud economic voice advocating your policies” and would “always [be] at your disposal”.

Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Moore was a chapter co-author for Project 2025, the vast policy plan coordinated by the hard-right Heritage Foundation that Trump disavowed on the campaign trail but which is now influencing White House policy after his victory in the race.

Trump and key allies insist the US economy is strong and that imposing tariffs on erstwhile allies such as Canada and Mexico as well as competitors like China is right – notwithstanding Trump’s own warning to Fox News on Sunday, in which he said the US “may” go into recession.

Moore has previously shown willingness to depart the party line.

In March 2024, after what turned out to be Joe Biden’s last State of the Union address, Moore told Fox Business: “Let me just say one thing positive about where we are right now. One thing that Biden said last night was true. It is true that the United States today has the strongest economy. There is no question about it.

“If you look at what’s happening in Europe today, Germany, Britain, France, if you look at Japan and China, they’re not growing. And so it is true … the way I like to put it is we are the least rotten apple in the cart and that’s … important to cheer.”

On Sunday, as Trump’s tariffs policy continued to heat up trade wars with Canada, Mexico and China, Moore told Fox News host Katie Pavlich: “Well, you used the word ‘complicated’ and that’s exactly what it has been over the last week, where one day the tariffs are going to go up and then there’s going to be a delay in the tariffs, and then there’s going to be a tariff on another country; and it’s been up and down and up and down. And, by the way, the stock market went up and down and up and down with these things.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Jensy Machado, a naturalized US citizen from Virginia, believes US immigration agency profiles Hispanic people

A Virginia man who was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents despite being an American citizen says he is reconsidering his support for Donald Trump in his triumphant 2024 presidential election campaign.

Jensy Machado, a naturalized US citizen, said he was in a car when he was stopped by Ice agents while on his way to work in Manassas, Virginia, where a large-scale immigration enforcement operation was recently taking place after Trump took office for a second time in January following repeated campaign promises of mass deportations.

“They just got out of the car with the guns in their hands and say: ‘Turn off the car, give me the keys, open the window,’ you know. Everything was really fast,” the 38-year-old Machado told the news stations Telemundo 44 and NBC 4 Washington.

Machado was driving to work with two other men when Ice suddenly stopped him near his home. Agents brandishing guns surrounded his truck.

“I was a Trump supporter,” he said on Wednesday. “I voted for Trump last election, but, because I thought it was going to be like ... against criminals, not every Hispanic, Spanish-lookalike.”

According to Machado, the agents told him the name of a man who had a deportation order and had given Machado’s home address. He responded by telling the agents that man’s name wasn’t his – and offered to show them his Virginia driver’s license.

But he says that the agents did not ask to see his ID. Instead, they ordered him to leave his car, and they placed handcuffs on him. An agent then asked Machado how he got into the country.

“And I told him I was an American citizen,” Machado said. “He looked at his other partner like, you know, smiling, like saying, ‘Can you believe this guy?’”

The two men with Machado were taken into custody, but he doesn’t know why. He was released after eventually being able to show his driver’s license.

Though Machado described himself as a supporter of the president, he said his faith in Trump’s administration has diminished following his being detained.

“They will assume that we are all illegals,” he said. “They’re just following Hispanic people.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Republican faces backlash for saying Democrat shook ‘his pimp cane’ at Trump during congressional address

The extremist Republican US House member Lauren Boebert has been accused of racism, ableism and hypocrisy in one fell swoop after criticizing a Black Democrat for “shaking his pimp cane” at Donald Trump during the president’s recent speech to Congress.

“Al Green was given multiple opportunities to stand down, to sit down, to behave, to show decorum,” Boebert told Real America’s Voice, a far-right outlet, while discussing the Texas Democratic congressman’s ejection from the House chamber for shouting about Trump’s threats to social benefits spending on 6 March.

Boebert added:“For him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent.”

The Tennessee Holler, a progressive outlet, said simply: “Effortless racism.”

One Bluesky user said: “It’s not a pimp cane. It’s a cane. Al Green is a politician who uses a tool to help him walk, just like many of his constituents who are dependent on Medicaid assistance. Lauren Boebert is being ableist with her statements.”

Green, 77, said he heckled the president as a way of standing up “for those who need Medicaid, Medicare and social security”.

Democrats would never abandon the fight to make sure every American has a safe, healthy, and financially secure life,” Green said.

Later, he said: “I heard the speaker when he said that I should cease. I did not, and I did not with intentionality. It was not done out of a burst of emotion.”

House Republicans censured him, with support from 10 Democrats.

Boebert also invited accusations of hypocrisy by comparing Green’s actions to her own during the 2022 State of the Union address when Joe Biden was president.

Boebert said: “You had some folks on the left trying to come out early and defend [Green’s] behavior and compare it to an image of Marjorie Taylor Greene and myself, who were chanting ‘Build the wall’ while all other Republicans were chanting the same phrase, and they just got that one image and acted like we completely disrupted the State of the Union.”

Then, Greene and Boebert’s chanting and heckling led one Democrat to tell them to “sit down”. Later, when Biden referred to the coffins of US service members killed in Afghanistan, Boebert prompted loud boos when she shouted: “You put them in – 13 of them!”

Boebert earned rebukes from her own party. Mike Braun, an Indiana senator, said: “It’s something that I think that there’s a place. That’s not the place to do that.”

With her attack on Green, Boebert also drew criticism for speaking about breaches of public decorum in light of her own auditorium ejection, in Denver in 2023 – for vaping, dancing, singing and groping her date during the Beetlejuice musical.

Boebert first denied behaving inappropriately. After surveillance video surfaced, also showing her giving ushers the middle finger while being escorted out, she apologized.

“Whether it was the excitement of seeing a much-anticipated production or the natural anxiety of being in a new environment,” she said, “I genuinely did not recall vaping that evening when I discussed the night’s events with my campaign team while confirming my enthusiasm for the musical.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

President tells Republicans to support measure boosting defense and deportation budgets before Saturday deadline

Republican lawmakers are scrambling to avert a government shutdown set to begin on Saturday, with Donald Trump’s backing for a temporary funding measure having suddenly silenced the usual conservative opposition.

The stopgap funding bill, known as a continuing resolution (CR), would maintain government operations at current funding levels through 30 September, the end of the fiscal year. Republican US House speaker Mike Johnson said he plans to hold a procedural vote on Monday, aiming for a passage vote on Tuesday before sending lawmakers home for recess.

Trump instructed reluctant fellow Republicans to fall in line behind the stopgap bill that would fund the government through September. “All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week,” the president wrote on Saturday on his Truth Social platform.

“It could happen. It shouldn’t have happened, and it probably won’t,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday when asked about the possibility of a shutdown. “I think the CR is going to get passed.”

The bill would boost defense spending by $6bn while slashing non-defense programs by $13bn and maintaining a $20bn freeze on IRS funding – priorities that align with Trump’s agenda but were previously insufficient to secure hardliner support.

The measure also provides additional funding for immigration enforcement, deportations and veterans’ healthcare, and it could grant Trump expanded authority to redirect funds between programs at his discretion – which is a no-go for most Democrats who worry it could enable the administration’s reshaping of federal priorities without congressional approval. The funding bill makes no mention of social security or Medicare, essential programs that operate automatically and separate from the government’s day-to-day budget.

The House Republicans’ paper-thin 218-214 majority has repeatedly threatened government funding over the last year. Congressman Thomas Massie has declared his opposition, while House representatives Tony Gonzales, Brian Fitzpatrick and Cory Mills remain undecided.

However, Trump’s support appears to have shifted the dynamic for his most ardent backers.

Congressman Andy Harris, the chair of the far-right House Freedom caucus, which attempted to sabotage other funding bills over the last few months, abandoned his earlier reluctance after a meeting at the White House.

“I am firmly 100% in his corner,” Harris told reporters, while former skeptic representative Victoria Spartz, who nearly blocked a budget blueprint last month, said: “I don’t think we have time to do anything else. I’m being realistic.”

Democratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said his side of the aisle is unwavering in its disapproval, saying he expects “that Republicans are going it alone”.

But Democratic responses have fractured in the US Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. Republican senator Rand Paul is expected to vote against the bill, meaning at least eight Democratic votes will be needed to overcome the hurdles – though the lawmakers are already facing intense pressure from within their party to resist Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk’s unilateral cuts to federal agencies, which have already eliminated more than 100,000 jobs.

In indicating his support for the bill, the Pennsylvania Democratic US senator John Fetterman said a shutdown would be “chaos”. “I’ll never vote for chaos,” he said.

Oregon’s Democratic senator, Ron Wyden also signalled support, saying: “Shutdowns are a bad idea. I’m not a shutdown guy.”

Swing state Democratic senator Elissa Slotkin, however, told NBC News on Sunday she would be withholding her vote “until I see some assurances that whatever we pass … is going to ensure that the money is spent the way Congress intends”.

The last government shutdown was the longest in US history, stretching 35 days during Trump’s first presidency and stemming from disagreements over building a border wall to block off Mexico.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Number of animals affected by neurological toxin increases in past week as experts warn of impact from climate crisis

The number of marine mammals in California affected by a neurological toxin from algae has surged in the past week, in what could be another deadly year for animals such as sea lions, seals, dolphins and larger whales.

According to the Marine Mammal Care Center, a rescue facility based in Sausalito, California, the facility is treating more than 30 animals affected by a toxic algal bloom, with eight animals admitted on Wednesday. The algae bloom off the California coast has been on the rise in recent years, producing a neurological toxin called domoic acid.

“Since about 2015 we really saw kind of a steep change in how intense these blooms are and how long they last,” said Clarissa Anderson, a biological oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “They’re definitely longer lasting in general than they were prior to about 2014.”

Anderson added: “In the last four years, the impacts have been really heavy on the marine mammal side, both sea lions, some fur seals, and quite a few long-beaked common dolphins.”

Domoic acid is a neurotoxin that accumulates in small fish such as sardines and anchovies, creatures that serve as common food sources for marine mammals such as sea lions. This toxin can affect animals and humans.

When ingested in large quantities, domoic acid attacks the animal’s brain and heart, which can lead to seizures and heart failure. It often causes permanent brain damage if left untreated. Although the toxin can naturally leave an animal’s system over time, repeated exposure results in more severe and lasting effects.

If sea lions receive care before any serious damage occurs, veterinarians can help flush the toxin from their system by administering fluids and providing domoic acid-free fish. Anti-seizure medications, similar to those used in humans, are also given to control seizures.

Climate change seems to be leading to higher levels of domoic acid amid changing water temperatures. The first diagnosed case of domoic acid toxicosis in California sea lions was made in 1998 at the Marine Mammal Center, and cases of affected sea lions have been on the rise ever since.

“The 25 to 30 years of data we have now is suggesting that something’s changing. They do appear to be getting more intense,” Anderson said of the blooms. She suggested that changes in nutrient supply, possibly propelled by global climate change, could be having ripple effects on the ecosystem.

The extent of the current domoic acid outbreak remains uncertain, but the MMCC, for example, warned that if they continue to receive three to five new patients daily, their resources may become strained in the coming weeks.

“On the science side we’re trying to really study these blooms and understand what causes them and whether they are increasing in frequency,” Anderson said, “and that’s primarily all federally funded, and that is in huge jeopardy right now considering what’s happening on the Hill and with Doge, so we’re struggling I think from all ends on the resource end of this.”

To make matters worse, this is also the time of year when malnourished elephant seal pups begin stranding along Los Angeles county beaches, which could further hinder the ability for rescue centers to intake new animals.

On Thursday, the MMCC reminded beachgoers in an Instagram post not to approach stranded marine mammals.

“While it is always dangerous to approach a marine mammal on the beach, sea lions affected by domoic acid can be especially aggressive, often awaking from a seizure with little notice,” reads the post.

Anderson said predicting domoic acid events is more complex than it looks, not only because it’s hard to forecast when the organism will bloom and produce toxins, but also because the impact on animals varies.

“If the anchovies are swimming more at the surface, then you can imagine pelicans being more impacted because they don’t dive too deep,” Anderson said.

She added that multiple factors must align – bloom location, the feeding patterns of anchovies (which transfer the toxin), and the presence of top predators – to create the kinds of effects seen in recent years.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Donald Trump’s brinkmanship and stop-start approach to tariffs rattle investors

The risk that the US economy will enter recession this year is rising, according to economists, as Donald Trump’s chaotic approach to tariffs continued to hit markets.

Shares on Wall Street fell sharply on Monday as investors bet the president’s unpredictable tariff trade war and handling of the economy would hit growth, amid a recent plunge in business and consumer confidence.

On another day of selling pressure in global markets, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 1.5%, while the S&P 500 was down 2.4%. Share prices also fell in Europe, as the FTSE 100 tumbled 0.9% in London, Germany’s Dax was down 1.7% and France’s CAC fell 0.9% on Monday.

Economists said the risks of a “Trumpcession” had increased as the president’s brinkmanship and stop-start approach to tariffs rattled global investors, exemplified by last week’s decision to pause US tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico for the second time in as many months.

Trump declined on Sunday to rule out the possibility that the US economy could tumble into recession this year as he warned businesses and households to brace for a “period of transition” and the potential for higher inflation.

Analysts said the president could have used the interview with Fox News as an opportunity to calm jitters in financial markets but that he instead chose to press on with an increasingly chaotic approach to his second term in office.

Kathleen Brooks of the trading platform XTB said Trump was putting his political goals ahead of the strength of the economy and the stock market. “[His] flip-flopping on tariffs, and his old-fashioned views of America first, is weighing on consumption and knocking confidence.”

Wall Street economists have downgraded their growth forecasts for the US, warning that Trump’s trade wars are proving more damaging for the US economy than first anticipated.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs said on Friday that the chances of a US recession had increased from 15% to 20%, as it revised its forecasts to incorporate higher tariffs and inflation, alongside a hit to gross domestic product and employment.

Morgan Stanley cut its 2025 GDP growth forecast from 1.9% to 1.5%. “While we did expect growth-constraining policies (tariffs and immigration controls) to precede growth-supportive initiatives (tax cuts and deregulation), their severity has been greater than we anticipated. This is especially the case with tariffs, which have come in faster and broader than we had pencilled in,” it said.

Many economists still reckon the US will avoid the widely accepted definition of a recession – two consecutive quarters of shrinking output – but warn that the latest figures show the risks are mounting.

Data from the US economy in recent weeks showed an unexpected fall in consumer spending in January, a widening of the US trade deficit to a record $131bn (£101bn) in the same month, as firms rushed to move goods before the introduction of tariffs, and the biggest fall in consumer confidence in four years in February.

The Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model, which predicts growth based on available economic data, suggests the US economy could contract by 2.4% in the first quarter (annualised). The reading can be volatile and is influenced heavily by the ballooning US trade deficit, which is likely to be unwound in future months.

“Markets are now starting to get concerned about the prospects for growth in 2025,” said Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS global wealth management. “Trump’s tariff policy has been unpredictable, with a series of retreats so rapid they almost collide with the next tax hike announcement.

“The rather chaotic US tariff policy still allows companies to sell a story to their customers to cover for price increases, and some may also try to raise prices in anticipation of tariffs that actually end up being retreated from.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Researchers report difficulties retaining staff as White House cost-cutting stresses US medical research system

Major Alzheimer’s disease research centers across the country face a $65m funding gap amid a Trump administration-imposed delay, with at least one struggling to retain highly trained staff.

Although courts have ruled a government-wide funding freeze is illegal, the administration has managed to delay research funding by canceling scientific meetings and failing to publish forthcoming meetings in the Federal Register, both which are legally required.

“The applicants know what their scores are, they know if their scores are really good they’re very, very likely to be funded, but now they can’t be funded because the advisory councils haven’t met,” said Jeremy Berg, a former director of the National Institute of General Medicine Sciences.

As the Trump administration seeks to reshape government and cut costs in line with its priorities, scientific institutions, and in particular the $48bn-budgeted National Institutes of Health (NIH), have come under attack.

Funding delays have affected nearly every research field, from pediatric cancer to dementia, as part of a multi-pronged strategy of draconian cuts. Government cost-cutting measures come ahead of an expected push to extend Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which overwhelmingly enriched the wealthy.

For Alzheimer’s research, the stakes are high. The degenerative condition affects 6.7 million Americans with diagnoses expected to double by 2060. Although it most often affects older adults, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not consider Alzheimer’s a normal part of aging.

At least $65m slated for 14 of the nation’s 35 Alzheimer’s disease research centers is now in limbo. Funding for all 14 centers is expected to run out on 30 April.

The critical funding gap comes as senators consider Trump’s nominee to head the NIH, Dr Jay Bhattacharya, a conservative darling who rose to prominence criticizing Covid-19 lockdown measures. Bhattacharya said during his confirmation hearing that he would ensure researchers “have the resources they need”, but repeatedly deflected comments on the administration’s funding freeze and mass layoffs.

Ann D Cohen, an associate professor of psychiatry and an Alzheimer’s disease researcher who has about $3m in delayed funding, is working to “stop the bleeding” and retain her staff – spending hours scouring spreadsheets and seeking temporary funding.

“Our clinicians and our staff are really highly trained, highly skilled people, and to lose them would be devastating,” said Cohen, who spoke in her personal capacity. She is based at the University of Pittsburgh’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. “You don’t just pull those kinds of skill sets out of anyone in the general population.”

Pittsburgh’s center alone houses clinical trials, a bank of 1,769 brains, 965 positron emission tomography (PET) scans, 5,000 blood samples and longitudinal data on 6,000-plus patients – altogether accounting for decades of research at an institution that has been funded continuously since 1984.

“Make no mistake: Donald Trump and Elon Musk are slashing research for Alzheimer’s disease to give tax breaks to big corporations,” said Tammy Baldwin, a Democratic sentaor from Wisconsin. Baldwin first identified the cuts this week.

“This investment gives patients and their loved ones hope that they can fight this disease, and stopping their funding wastes precious time we cannot get back,” she said.

Cohen has reduced her lab’s budget to one-quarter of normal operating expenses. She is being tided over by “generous donors” and the help of her institution. Many researchers such as Cohen are now effectively doing damage control, Berg said, as they seek to retain talent.

“It’s all very distressing and damaging for no reason,” said Berg. “These are multimillion-dollar, years-long grants that coordinate the Alzheimer’s clinical trials … They’ve got staff, etc, and now they’re going to have a gap in funding.”

With widespread disruptions in research, outcry led the administration to begin scheduling study sections and publishing in the Federal Register, both legally required to for federal grants. But a secondary layer of peer review called advisory councils remains delayed, gumming up grant renewals, with more chaos on the horizon.

Alzheimer’s research is also threatened by an executive order targeting diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Such language could be a threat to Alzheimer’s research because the field has sought to diversify study participation in recent years. White, wealthy and female patients are overrepresented in clinical trials, which makes trial results less generalizable to the “real world”, in Cohen’s words.

Grant-making officers have canceled at least 16 active grants across the agency, and NIH employees expect that hundreds more could be canceled, Nature reported.

Trump touted this work as ending “the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government”, in his address to a joint session of Congress last week. In practical terms, it has amounted to an ideological review.

In one example of boilerplate language used by the administration, NIH officers have been instructed to cancel grant funding involving “transgender issues”, according to orders seen by the Guardian, writing: “Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans.”

Another of the administration’s cost-cutting initiatives involves slashing “indirect costs” by $4bn. Courts have temporarily blocked the plan, but attorneys representing academic institutions expect the administration to attempt an end run.

“The administration has made it very clear, NIH has made it very clear, the indirect rates are too high and reflect” what the administration views as “waste and inefficiency,” said Dan Graham, a partner with the McDermott Will & Emery law firm.

Cohen’s lab has a 59% indirect cost rate. Part of that cost is related to the maintenance of freezers with tissue samples – and not just the electricity to run them. Their contents are so precious that at all times a member of staff wears a pager that alerts in the event of a malfunction.

“We also expect the administration to try to use existing authority, existing terms and conditions in regulations and rate agreements, to open them up for renegotiation,” said Graham. In practice, that could mean arguing that researchers spent money inappropriately to reopen negotiations.

The administration moved to further solidify its ability to impose changes by rescinding a little-known transparency policy called the “Richardson waiver”. In force since 1971, the waiver requires the Department of Health and Human Services to publish policy changes in the Federal Register.

The change has private industry, researchers and institutions bracing for a more secretive department – even as health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s promised “radical transparency” in his confirmation hearing.

Ironically, Cohen’s research would appear to comport with at least one administration priority: Kennedy’s stated interest in anything “that advances human health and can’t be patented by pharma”.

“I’m interested in what lived experience does to brain ageing,” said Cohen. “That’s not something shareholders in a private company are going to be interested in because they can’t monetize that.

“Without NIH, who takes risk on that kind of observational work, we lose out on a whole sector of research that doesn’t involve pharmaceuticals that could be sold.”

Palestinians facing mass displacements, airstrikes and rise in attacks on children and other civilians, rights group says

Israel has brought the military tactics of its war in Gaza to the occupied West Bank, where Palestinians face mass forced displacements, a surge in airstrikes and a sharp rise in attacks on children and other civilians, a Palestinian-Israeli rights group has said.

B’tselem has detailed the impact of Israel’s most intense operations in the area for at least two decades in a report that describes what it calls the “Gazafication” of Israel’s occupation there.

Israeli airstrikes in the West Bank since 7 October 2023, the beginning of the Gaza war triggered by Hamas’s attack on southern Israel, have killed more Palestinians than during the violence of the second intifada of the 2000s, with children killed at a rate unprecedented during the territory’s occupation, according to data collected by B’tselem over more than two decades.

Military operations launched in three West Bank refugee camps in January also forced 40,000 people from their homes, the largest displacement since Israel’s occupation began in 1967. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said troops would remain “for the coming year”, meaning residents would not be allowed back in that time.

Israel says its operations target militant Palestinian groups. The refugee camps are historically home to fighters who consider themselves armed resistance.

“Israel’s complete disregard for international law in the war in Gaza is now being replicated to the West Bank,” said B’Tselem’s executive director, Yuli Novak. “Its activity there, as yet on a smaller scale than in Gaza, is already causing indiscriminate and disproportionate killing and destruction.”

The parents of a boy shot when he went to buy bread and the uncle of two children, aged five and eight, who were killed in an airstrike are among relatives of six child victims who told the Guardian about how attacks documented by B’tselem have shattered their lives.

Rigd Gasser, father of 14-year-old Ahmad Rashid Jazar, said his son was hit in the chest by a single bullet on 19 January while leaving a shop in his home village of Sebastia, where he had been on an errand to get bread.

Gasser was in a cafe when he heard the gunshots and rushed out when he heard calls for help. “I got closer and recognised my son. I knew him by his clothes, his body was all covered in blood,” he said. “Since the beginning of the war, they [Israeli forces] have been coming here every day. They launch raids in the morning and evening.”

Israel sent a surge of troops, including tanks, to the West Bank after the Gaza ceasefire began in January. Military operations in the three refugee camps – Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams – came on top of what had been Israel’s deadliest bombing campaign in the occupied territory. In the 17 months since 7 October 2023, B’tselem documented64 airstrikes that killed 261 Palestinians, including both militant and civilian casualties and at least 41 minors.

That is more than three times the total toll from airstrikes during the second intifada, which lasted more than four years, when B’tselem recorded 78 deaths including 10 children between 2000 and the end of 2004.

The group’s report described the increased use of airstrikes as part of a “broader conceptual and operational shift” in Israeli military tactics that put civilians at greater risk. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions.

Muhammad Khreiwish’s niece and nephew were among the youngest victims. Sham Abu Zahara, eight, and Karam Abu Zahara, five, were killed with both their parents and another uncle on 3 October 2024, when an airstrike targeted a cafe in Tulkarm.

The cafe was on the ground floor of an apartment building, and the Abu Zahara family lived next door. Khreiwish was arriving to visit his sister Saja when an explosion threw him off his bike. As people raced away from the site, he ran in to look for the family.

Inside he was met by a horrific scene. “I found pieces of bodies that I couldn’t recognise, and then I saw my niece,” he said. He called for help but she had been killed immediately. All he could do was wrap her shattered body and take it to the hospital morgue.

The strike killed 18 people and at least six of them, or a third of the total, were civilians, B’tselem investigators found.

The Abu Zahara siblings were two of 180 children killed by Israeli forces over the 17 months since the Gaza war began, the deadliest period in the West Bank of Israel’s nearly 60-year-long occupation according to B’tselem.

Until 2023 the most dangerous time for Palestinian children in the West Bank was the second intifada, when B’tselem documented 246 children killed in 63 months – a rate of killing half current levels from all Israeli operations.

B’tselem said looser rules of engagement were one reason for the rise in child deaths. The Israeli military has expanded its “open fire” rules, with soldiers now allowed to shoot to kill targets including anyone they suspect is “messing with the ground”, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.

The cousins Reda Basharat, eight, and Hamza Basharat, 10, were killed near home by a drone strike on 8 January. The children could not go school that morning because Israeli forces had launched a raid near their village, Tammun, and so roads were closed, Hamza’s mother, Eman Basharat, said.

Hamza, born after a years-long IVF struggle, was a cheerful child who normally loved studying and was angry about missing an English test scheduled for that day.

The boys were sitting outside with their 23-year-old cousin Adam, who was drinking a morning coffee when they were targeted. Eman raced out to look for her son as soon as she heard the explosion. She found Hamza injured and struggling to breathe. “I held his body. I cleaned the blood from his face and I recited the Shahada [the Muslim profession of faith]. He died in my arms, he didn’t look like he was in pain.”

Israeli soldiers arrived soon after and took away all three bodies for several hours, before returning the children to their grieving families without explanation.

“When I think about what happened to my son and remember the images of their bodies, and I see what is happening in Gaza on TV, I felt suddenly that they are doing the same thing,” Eman Basharat said.

It is a comparison that has also been made by Israeli officials. The West Bank campaign was a based on “a lesson from the activity that took place in Gaza and other places”, Katz told the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. “We need to clean up a place and not allow terrorism to return to it.”

Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has said Palestinians in the West Bank should know that “if they continue with terrorism … their fate will be like Gaza”. He said the “Tulkarm and Jenin [refugee camps] will look like Jabaliya and Shujayah [in Gaza]”.

An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson has previously denied that soldiers forced Palestinians from their homes, saying camp residents who chose to leave to escape fighting were “allowed” to do so.

Dozens of homes have already demolished. Similarities with larger-scale displacement and destruction in Gaza were clear to Palestinian families crowded into mosques, wedding halls and the homes of relatives where they had sought refuge.

The Guardian spoke to three families who said they were ordered to leave their homes either directly by Israeli forces or through messages broadcast on loudspeakers.

Fatma Shab, 63, is living in the women’s area of wedding hall, separated from her severely ill husband, Yusuf Shab, 68. Permanently connected to oxygen, he cannot walk and had to be evacuated by ambulance.

As Israeli forces advanced the Shabs fled from their home in Nur Shams refugee camp to the house of their son, which has since been demolished. Soldiers broke into the building and told them to leave immediately, with no time to pack.

So they moved again to a nearby Kafr al-Labad town where they have found temporary, basic shelter in al-Diah wedding hall. They only have two bathrooms for 14 people, and just drapes separating crowded sleeping areas.

Even so, the families sheltering there are terrified they will have to leave after Ramadan, as it will be needed again for weddings once the holy month is finished.

“People here are kind, but in my home I am more comfortable,” Fatma Shab said. “Even just being able to go to my closet to choose some clothes to wear. Now I’m just wearing what I have on, there are no choices.”

She said she did not know if she would see the house she built with her husband for their retirement again. “It’s just a short distance away, but I can’t go home. In Gaza they were forced out and killed, and here now it’s the same.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Former prosecutors criticize Pam Bondi’s decision to halt enforcement of bribery laws as short-sighted and dangerous

A radical makeover at the US department of justice has seen key drives to fight corruption hamstrung in ways that could benefit US businesses operating abroad and foreign kleptocrats, including some Russian oligarchs.

The moves have sparked sharp criticism by former US prosecutors, transparency experts and top Democrats, who warn that the moves to cut back on anti-corruption efforts is a huge setback for American efforts to clean up global business practices and tackle the power of oligarchs and of authoritarian rulers.

Donald Trump’s US attorney general Pam Bondi – long an ally of the president – has moved fast to halt enforcement actions for six months under the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that bars bribes by US businesses to win overseas deals, which some American firms have long charged gives certain foreign firms a competitive edge.

Trump sounded bullish while signing an executive order in February to halt the department’s FCPA investigations for six months to review policy guidelines. “It’s going to mean a lot more business for America,” Trump boasted, to the dismay of critics.

In another fast foreign shift at the DoJ, a Bondi memo last month indicated that two units aimed at fighting kleptocracy – including some major Russian oligarchs – were being disbanded with some lawyers redeployed to focus on new priorities involving fighting drug cartels and transnational crime.

Veteran prosecutors say such policy changes are short-sighted and dangerous, stressing they could fuel bribes by US firms to win deals abroad, and let Russian oligarchs and other kleptocrats facing sanctions or other penalties for illicit activities such as money laundering, go unpunished.

“Jettisoning the DoJ’s robust FCPA enforcement under the guise that it somehow makes US companies anti-competitive seems stubbornly ignorant,” former acting chief of the fraud section Paul Pelletier told the Guardian. “US public companies very much understand that this type of corruption is actually bad for business and that shareholders won’t tolerate it.

“This new policy, however, is not likely the result of ignorance. More credibly, the rescission of FCPA enforcement is a clarion signal to non-public US companies to corruptly seek a beachhead for their enterprises in foreign countries.”

Pelletier added that the “elimination of the department’s hugely successful anti-kleptocracy initiatives allegedly to focus on drug cartels is also colossally tragic. Bondi, a former prosecutor, must understand that robustly targeting oligarchs and drug cartels are not mutually exclusive. Plainly, the neutering of kleptocracy prosecutors, by design, empowers those authoritarians hellbent on looting their countries.”

Other former prosecutors voice similar concerns.

“Federal transnational anti-corruption enforcement is getting slammed by an administration that not only shows no interest in such efforts but seems to affirmatively embrace bribes by US firms as a way to keep up with the competition,” said Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and now a law professor at Columbia University.

Richman noted caustically that “the abandonment of the anti-kleptocracy initiatives might be good for US condo sales. But if the Trump administration thinks giving aid and comfort to autocrats and corrupt officials abroad who want to stash their money here is in our national interest, it has a sleazy real estate broker’s view of the national interest.”

The president and Bondi, a former Florida AG who helped defend Trump during his first impeachment, have championed these moves as part of a strategic shift at the DoJ to boost other Trump priorities and ones they claim are good for business.

Trump’s FCPA order, for instance, repeats the mantra of business foes of the 1977 law: Trump charged that “over-expansive and unpredictable FCPA enforcement against American citizens and businesses … for routine business practices in other nations not only wastes limited prosecutorial resources that could be dedicated to preserving American freedoms, but actively harms American economic competitiveness and, therefore, national security.”

At the DoJ, meanwhile, Bondi moved fast on her first day to issue a directive ending “Task Force KleptoCapture”, which had targeted Russian oligarchs with Kremlin links since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with some notable results.

Last year, the department announced the taskforce had charged more than 70 individuals for “violating international sanctions and export controls levied against Russia”, and some, such as Russian oil and metals multibillionaire Viktor Vekselberg, had their yachts seized.

According to Bondi’s directive, staff working on KleptoCapture and another older unit, dubbed the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, would be reassigned to fight drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations.

In a related shift that seems to fit Trump’s political agenda and pro-Russia tilt, Bondi quickly disbanded the FBI’s foreign influence taskforce, which was launched in 2017 with the aim of countering secret operations waged by Russia, China and other foes to affect US politics and public opinion.

In disbanding the FBI taskforce, Bondi’s order portrayed the move as one of bigger priorities, despite warnings from several intelligence agencies that foreign disinformation influence operations have been mounting and pose dangers.

“To free resources to address more pressing priorities, and end risks of further weaponization and abuses of prosecutorial discretion, the Foreign Influence Task Force shall be disbanded,” the Bondi order stated.

Likewise, Bondi eased criminal actions for violations of the decades old Foreign Agents Registration Act, a weapon used by the DoJ to combat foreign disinformation and influence operations that requires lobbyists working for foreign governments to register with the US government.

DoJ veterans and anti-corruption advocates are especially critical of Bondi’s disbanding the anti-kleptocracy units, which they say could boomerang and weaken efforts to go after drug cartels, while spurring more illicit foreign funds moving to the US.

“It makes no sense to treat kleptocracy and drug trafficking as if they were in separate silos,” said Stefan Cassella, an ex-federal prosecutor who now runs Asset Forfeiture Law.

“A corrupt foreign official who is investing criminal proceeds in the United States could very likely be investing the bribes he received from the drug cartels. Thinking of these as separate issues is naively simplistic; you have to take a holistic approach.

“Disbanding the groups of prosecutors and agents who have specialized in kleptocracy deprives law enforcement of the very people and resources who are needed when public corruption and drug trafficking overlap, as they so often do.”

Cassella added that the DoJ changes “not only allow these people to go unpunished, but allows them to use the US financial system to hide and invest their wealth”.

Cassella’s critique was echoed by Gary Kalman, the head of Transparency International’s US operations, who stressed that “these anti-kleptocracy initiatives provided a place for critical information sharing. Their dissolution could slow or block timely enforcement.”

Kalman pointed out that the Bondi directives could actually undercut some of the DoJ’s new goals. “It’s very unclear what the shift in priorities toward cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) means. Kleptocrats regularly partner with criminal organizations.

“The lack of clarity creates uncertainty which is an environment, traditionally, in which bad actors thrive and honest US companies do not.”

Some ex-DoJ lawyers expect that Bondi will have to reverse course in some fashion regarding the anti-kleptocracy units.

“New DOJ leadership has put well-financed, cross-border cartels in the center of its sights,” said Andrew Adams, a partner at the law firm Steptoe who used to be a top national security official at the DoJ overseeing global sanctions programs.

“Fighting those groups means fighting their illicit funding and exploitation of US businesses. Where new leadership has disbanded some legacy programs that would drive that enforcement, I fully expect they will want and need to stand up new units of the same models, and in short order.”

Concerns about Bondi’s early moves have also been rising in Congress.

“Pam Bondi arrived and instantly closed its anti-kleptocracy work that had successfully targeted Putin’s Russian oligarchs,” said Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.

“It’s odd that a state AG entering a big department would so quickly pick that small but effective office. Add to that the disbanding of other anti-kleptocracy initiatives and the presumptive nonenforcement of foreign corruption cases. This is a gift to corrupt foreign kleptocrats and requires renewed examination of Trump/Russia.”

With regard to the AG’s FCPA order, Democratic representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who taught constitutional law for over two decades, condemned Bondi for putting “America on the side of ‘routine’ corrupt business practices all over the world”, adding that it gives corporations “free rein to pay bribes, kickbacks, and financial tribute to corrupt foreign officials”.

Ex-prosecutors raise similar alarms about bad fallout from Bondi’s FCPA move.

“Failing to prosecute the FCPA is the epitome of corruption,” said former federal prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig. “ You don’t stop prosecuting while you’re reviewing.”

“It is unsurprising that the hollowing out of anti-corruption efforts could well benefit Trump and his supporters. That’s what Trump assumes is the proper result of his election.”

Looking ahead, ex-federal prosecutor Barbara McQuade, who now teaches law at the University of Michigan, predicts negative consequences with the halt in FCPA enforcement and the disbanding of the anti-kleptocracy units.

She said: “The DoJ’s shift in priorities away from corruption enforcement concerns me, because it removes an important deterrent against bad actors in American business and foreign kleptocrats.

“The real victims of corruption are members of the public, who end up paying more for goods and services and receiving poorer quality in exchange. I worry that this shift will normalize corruption.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Residents sought safety in temporary shelter after Fuego volcano spewed lava, ash and rocks

Guatemalan authorities have evacuated about a thousand people after Central America’s most active volcano erupted, spewing lava, ash and rocks.

Residents with traumatic memories of a deadly eruption in 2018 sought safety in a temporary shelter after the Fuego volcano – located 35km (22 miles) from the capital, Guatemala City – showed escalating activity on Sunday.

“We heard the rumblings and then a strong eruption. We have faith in God … that the activity of the volcano will calm down soon,” Manuel Cobox, 46, told AFP after leaving his home with his wife and three daughters.

About 125 families, roughly 900 people, were moved to safety from the community of El Porvenir, said Juan Laureano, a spokesperson for Guatemala’s disaster coordination agency, Conred.

Residents of another community in Las Lajitas were also evacuated, the official added.

Buses brought evacuees carrying belongings to a town hall turned into a temporary shelter.

About 30,000 people were potentially “at risk” and should evacuate themselves if necessary, Conred’s head, Claudinne Ogaldes, told a news conference.

Guatemala lies on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity.

In 2018, 215 people were killed and a similar number left missing as an eruption of the Fuego volcano sent rivers of lava pouring down its sides, devastating the village of San Miguel Los Lotes.

Amanda Santos, a 58-year-old housekeeper, said that memories of that previous eruption came flooding back when she heard the firefighters’ sirens.

“That’s why we’re afraid. Many people died,” she added.

Another eruption in 2023 from the 3,763-meter (12,346ft) Fuego caused the evacuation of about 1,200 people.

An alert was issued by the authorities on Sunday in order to coordinate the response and preventive measures, Conred said.

The government suspended local school activities and closed a road through the village that links the south of the country to the colonial city of Antigua, a Unesco world heritage site and Guatemala’s most popular tourist destination.

Authorities were monitoring pyroclastic flows – fast-moving currents of hot ash, gas and rock fragments that descend the slopes of a volcano, the Conred spokesman Laureano said.

The state-run Volcanology Institute recommended that air traffic take precautions due to ash that has spread about 50km west of the volcanic cone.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The Emilia Pérez actor, whose offensive resurfaced tweets sank the film’s hopes for awards glory, says public hatred left her ‘on the edge’

Karla Sofía Gascón, the first out trans actor to be nominated for an Oscar, whose hopes of winning were dashed after offensive social media posts were surfaced a month before the ceremony, has spoken out about the “unexpected, devastating storm” of awards season.

The Spanish actor says that the final stretch of the race, was the “most exposed” period of her life. She faced widespread criticism for her tweets, and despite repeated apologies, was cold-shouldered by the cast and crew of Emilia Pérez, while studio Netflix dropped her from campaigns and cut off funds allowing her to travel to ceremonies. A contract with her Spanish publisher was cancelled, and senior politicians in her home country spoke of their disappointment in her.

“Absurd and even delirious accusations were thrown at me, which deeply hurt my spirit. Things escalated to a point, and so quickly, that I couldn’t even breathe.

“Amid this unexpected, devastating storm, there have been moments when the pain has been so overwhelming that I contemplated the unthinkable,” Gascón continues.

“I harboured darker thoughts than those I considered in some of my previous, no less intimate and personal struggles. And I asked myself: if I, with all my strength and preparedness to deal with rage and rejection, am on the edge, what would have become of someone with fewer emotional resources to resist this onslaught? Somehow, I made it. Others would not have survived this brutal winter I am about to wrap up.”

A fortnight before the Oscars ceremony, Netflix and the director of Emilia Pérez, Jacques Audiard, appeared to rethink their previous strategy. The studio offered to fund Gascón’s expenses to attend the César awards in Paris while Audiard – who had previously said that he hadn’t spoken to his star and “didn’t want to” – shouted out affectionately to the absent Gascón in a Bafta acceptance speech.

Some have speculated that this U-turn may have been prompted by concerns over Gascón’s mental health. A number of senior publicists who spoke to the Guardian expressed anxiety over whether the studio and Gascón’s publicists had performed due diligence over their client’s social media history, as well as fulfilling a duty of care towards a newcomer to international fame.

Emilia Pérez went into the Oscars with a record-breaking 13 nominations but ended up with just two awards: supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña and best song, for El Mal.

At the ceremony, host Conan O’Brien made reference to the controversy in a joke saying that: “Anora uses the F-word 479 times. That’s more than the record set by Karla Sofía Gascón’s publicist.” He also asked the actor to refer to him as Jimmy Kimmel.

After the ceremony, Gascón told the Hollywood Reporter that she “loved the ceremony, honestly, I found it very enjoyable”.

“I would have liked to experience it more normally, from the happiness of being nominated, of celebrating, as I am now, full of love, a person who puts her soul and her being into her work and who gives herself to others,” she added. “I am very grateful to return and for how my colleagues and the professionals of the Hollywood industry received me. I am grateful to the academy, to Netflix and to the production.”

In her lengthy statement, Gascón said she had learned a lot from the experience, including that “hatred, like fire, cannot be put down with more hatred”.

“Offences cannot be erased with more offences, and mistakes cannot clean up other mistakes, especially when lies and falseness proliferate all around and when all they send back to me is pure rage, blatant bullying, vexation, scorn and even death threats.”

She concludes by saying that she will continue to fight the corner for oppressed minorities, as “a trans woman trapped in the worst possible place: the body of a criminal immersed in an extreme patriarchy”.

“You will always find me on the opposite side of fanaticism, imposition, patriarchy, fascism, dictatorships, terror, abuse and irrationality,” she says. “I do not bind myself to any political flag; I only try to be a human being in constant evolution, with successes and failures, but with an unbreakable will to learn, listen, admit mistakes, apologise and forgive others as I forgive myself for the unnecessary pain I have caused.”

Sometimes, we put on a shield to protect ourselves, so that harm does not reach our hearts, our skin, or our souls. I have my own armour too, like anyone else. It’s not pretty, but it has saved my life a couple of times. The problem is, precisely, that shields can be cold and hard on the outside and can also hurt those around you. That is what happened to me, to those who love me, and to those who believed in me.

Lately, as I have been the target of harmful words, I have also said hurtful things throughout my life that have caused others to feel offended – things done and said from fear, from my own ignorance, from my own pain, from the outside of that cold, upsetting shield.

With no excuse, and without any intention to justify any of my past actions, I apologise to all I have offended at any point in my life and throughout my journey. I humbly ask for their forgiveness and, to honour their kindness and understanding, I promise I will commit to continuing to learn and listen, so as not to make the same mistakes in the future.

For the last few years of my life, I went out into the world and gave my best to bring visibility to a historically overlooked group – a group that is part of my identity and my own reality. I have been defending and reflecting the life of a trans woman trapped in the worst possible place: the body of a criminal immersed in an extreme patriarchy. While doing so, my purpose was always to do it with as much dignity as possible, showing a story of struggle and resistance that deserved to be told. I poured my soul, my life, and my essence into this project, working side by side with great Mexican friends who helped me convey a message of hope: we can all be better people, no matter our starting point or our beginnings in this quest called life.

Mexico holds an indelible place in my heart. In this magnetic and amazing country, I was allowed to establish my career as an actor, and I have received friendship, affection, and human warmth I will never forget. Since the day my dear Julián Pastor, a legendary film director, opened his doors to me, my love for this land and its people became eternal.

My commitment to stand for Mexico, all Mexicans, and for the rights of the most disadvantaged remains strong. You will always find me on the opposite side of fanaticism, imposition, patriarchy, fascism, dictatorships, terror, abuse, and irrationality. I do not bind myself to any political flag; I only try to be a human being in constant evolution, with successes and failures, but with an unbreakable will to learn, listen, admit mistakes, apologise, and forgive others as I forgive myself for the unnecessary pain I have caused.

Because of my daughter, and for future generations, I want to open an honest discussion and reflection on mental health. Throughout different stages of my life, I have gone through dark moments – episodes in which despair led me to unexpected places. In this last episode, the most talked about and most exposed of my life, several fake accounts were created in my name to add to the pain and confusion. Absurd and even delirious accusations were thrown at me, which deeply hurt my spirit. Things escalated to a point, and so quickly, that I couldn’t even breathe.

Amid this unexpected, devastating storm, there have been moments when the pain has been so overwhelming that I contemplated the unthinkable. I harboured darker thoughts than those I considered in some of my previous, no less intimate and personal struggles. And I asked myself: if I, with all my strength and preparedness to deal with rage and rejection, am on the edge, what would have become of someone with fewer emotional resources to resist this onslaught? Somehow, I made it. Others would not have survived this brutal winter I am about to wrap up.

Now that the storm is calming down a bit, and the worst has passed (or so I hope), I start seeing clearly what I have learned. I’ve learned that hatred, like fire, cannot be put down with more hatred. Offences cannot be erased with more offences, and mistakes cannot clean up other mistakes, especially when lies and falseness proliferate all around and when all they send back to me is pure rage, blatant bullying, vexation, scorn, and even death threats.

Fortunately, I have kept my one inch of sanity to see the light at the end of this tunnel of hate and understand that I must be and do better, and correct my past faults, without engaging in more darkness. Otherwise, if I play their game, and reciprocate and amplify all that hate others project on me, I will get lost; I will never move forward, and I won’t be able to keep helping others still stuck in the storm.

The responsibility to care for ourselves as a society lies with each one of us. As Martin Luther King Jr said, “Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.” Therefore, if there is something that must guide us in these difficult days, it is empathy with those, like me, who have walked on the edge most of our lives, who believed we were a mistake, and then, we made mistakes. As Albert Camus stated, “there is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide,” because it confronts us with the very meaning of existence. I am not quoting these words to insinuate anything or point at myself, but for those others who would not have been able to endure what I just have endured.

Only through understanding, compassion, forgiveness and empathy can we build a world where difference is not synonymous with condemnation, but with richness. A world where we can learn and grow as we go. A world where we can all put our shields aside and be ourselves.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

There are fears military will deploy further violence in run-up to any poll, which is unlikely to be viewed as credible

The Myanmar military’s promise to hold elections in December 2025 or January 2026 has been condemned as a “sham” that risks bringing even greater violence.

Myanmar’s military junta announced on Saturday, in comments reported in state media, that it would hold a long-promised election, specifying a timeframe for the first time since seizing power in a 2021 coup.

The coup was widely opposed by the public and prompted an armed resistance, plunging much of the country into conflict.

China, an ally of the military that has sought to protect its economic investments in the country, has previously expressed support for the election plans. However, most western countries and election watchdogs are highly unlikely to view the vote as credible.

Opposition parties are mostly either banned from contesting or boycott elections, while almost 22,000 political prisoners remain in detention, according to a local monitoring group, including Aung San Suu Kyi, whose government was ousted in 2021. Her party, National League for Democracy (NLD), was dissolved for failing to re-register under an electoral law introduced after the coup.

It is also unclear how the military would implement elections given that it has lost control of large swathes of the country to a patchwork of opposition groups that are fighting against its rule. Its territorial losses have been so severe that it was only able to conduct a full census, designed to prepare voter lists, in less than half (145) of the country’s 330 townships. 
  A study commissioned by the BBC, suggests the military controls only 21% of the country’s territory, though it still holds the key, densely populated cities.

“There’s no question an election held under current conditions will be a sham and it’s important that countries denounce the plan to hold elections by the Myanmar military and deny technical support,” said Bryony Lau, the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch.

“It’s clear that holding an election currently is only about the military’s interest. For ordinary people in Myanmar it must be a terrifying prospect.”

When the military’s census was conducted last year, people were afraid to answer questions, while those being made to conduct the census also feared being targeted by the opposition.

Analysts have warned the military, which has launched bloody crackdowns on dissent since seizing power, is likely to deploy further violence to ensure polling goes ahead in areas it controls. Opposition groups may also seek to resist violently.

Chin Human Rights Organization, a human rights NGO, said on social media that western democratic countries “must send a clear, unequivocal message by pre-emptively denouncing the junta’s polls”.

Debbie Stothard, the founder of Altsean-Burma, a network of human rights organisations in south-east Asia, said there was concern that the election would bring even greater bloodshed. “We can see already preparation for the election has involved a sharp spike in violence – 2024 saw more airstrikes than 2021, 2022 and 2023 combined. We’ve seen areas that are not reachable by the junta being bombarded with airstrikes – they are literally trying to kill off the opposition,” she said.

A joint statement by election experts, published by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance in February, said they “unequivocally reject” plans by Myanmar’s junta to hold an election.

A vote would not bring peace or stability to Myanmar, the statement added, but would “deepen divisions, fuel violence, entrench authoritarian rule and exacerbate the crisis caused by the military coup”.

Foreign ministers from the regional bloc of south-east Asian nations also told the junta in January that it should prioritise a ceasefire over fresh elections.

The junta’s leader, Min Aung Hlaing, has long promised to hold an election but has repeatedly extended a state of emergency. The junta-controlled Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper quoted the leader as saying during a visit to Belarus: “We are planning to hold the election in December 2025 or … by January 2026.” He added that 53 political parties had registered to participate.

The military would also invite teams from Belarus to observe the election, he said during a meeting with the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power for more than three decades, and recently won a seventh five-year term in a vote that was widely rejected as a sham.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Cǎlin Georgescu to contest decision to bar him from election rerun in May  after claims of Russian meddling

Romania’s far-right presidential frontrunner, Cǎlin Georgescu, has said he will appeal against a decision to bar him from standing in a rerun of the presidential election, calling it “a direct blow to the heart of democracy worldwide”.

Georgescu, a Moscow-friendly populist, surged from almost nowhere to win the first round of the country’s presidential election last year, but the result was annulled by Romania’s top court because of evidence of suspected Russian interference.

Amid claims of “massive” social media manipulation, he was placed under criminal investigation last month on six charges including false statements about his campaign financing, fraudulent use of digital technologies and promoting fascist organisations. He has denied any wrongdoing.

Romania’s central election bureau said on Sunday it had decided to bar Georgescu’s candidacy for the rerun of the first-round vote, scheduled for May, ruling that it was inadmissible after the constitutional court’s annulment of the November vote.

The decision drew sharp criticism from Washington, with the US presidential adviser Elon Musk posting on Sunday: “This is crazy!” The billionaire returned to the subject on Monday, asking: “How can a judge end democracy in Romania?”

The US vice-president, JD Vance, had previously said the annulment of the first-round vote showed Romania did not share American values. Georgescu, 62, a former government official, is leading in the polls and was projected to win about 40% of votes in May.

Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right Lega party, called the bureau’s decision a “Soviet-style Euro-coup”, while Georgescu said it was “just the beginning … Europe is now a dictatorship. Romania is under tyranny!”

In a video on Facebook, Georgescu added: “We go all the way for the same values: peace, democracy, freedom.” He urged his supporters, who clashed with police on Sunday night, to refrain from violent protests.

Scores of Georgescu voters rallied in Bucharest to express their anger, many waving Romanian flags and chanting “Thieves!” and “the last resort is another revolution!” Some threw broken paving stones at riot police.

The constitutional court is expected to rule on Georgescu’s appeal on Wednesday but is thought unlikely to find in his favour. It has previously barred another far-right candidate, arguing that her anti-EU, pro-Russian views made her unfit for office.

Georgescu has lauded Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, as “a man who loves his country” and praised Romania’s 1930s fascist leaders. The promotion of fascist leaders and Nazi, racist or xenophobic symbols is banned under Romanian law.

If the court upholds the election bureau’s decision, three ultranationalist parties that backed Georgescu’s candidacy and have 35% of the seats in Romania’s parliament risk not being on the ballot for the rerun, opening the way for another candidate.

George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), could put his name forward. He described the election bureau’s decision as “a new episode … in a coup d’état ” and a “black page in our fragile democracy”.

after newsletter promotion

Simion, 38, said on Monday that the bureau “does not have the right to reject a candidate when all the requirements regarding documents, signatures and forms have been met”. He said he would back Georgescu “to the end” but did not have high hopes.

Sergiu Miscoiu, a professor of political science at Babes-Bolyai University, said he believed that even if the US “reacts badly”, it would be riskier to let Georgescu run than to bar him since his victory could derail Romania’s pro-western orientation.

Many of Georgescu’s supporters and some politicians from other parties, including Elena Lasconi, the president of the centre-right Save Romania Union (USR) party, who finished second in the cancelled presidential election, cried foul.

Lasconi, 52, who has previously called on prosecutors to provide their evidence against Georgescu, said in a statement that the election bureau – which has said only that his candidacy would be “unacceptable” – must provide its reasoning as soon as possible.

“Decisions must be explained,” she said, “otherwise people will become furious, suspicious and prone to conspiracies.”

Georgescu had been polling in single digits before the election and had declared zero campaign spending. The first round of the rerun is scheduled for 4 May, with the second round run-off on 18 May.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Canada’s incoming prime minister warns the US president’s tariffs threaten the ‘greatest crisis of our generation’

When Mark Carney becomes Canada’s prime minister later this week, a list of simmering crises across the country will demand his attention: housing is unaffordable, healthcare is breaking, living costs keep rising and the climate crisis is ransacking livelihoods.

But most – if not all – of those concerns will be pushed aside, supplanted by a far greater threat to the country: the US president, Donald Trump.

The potential effects of Trump’s economic attack on Canada are so wide-ranging and so damaging that they are likely to overshadow all other issues in Carney’s in-tray. US trade tariffs, if held in place for an extended period of time, could push Canada’s fragile economy into a recession and unleash a cascading chain of knock-on upheavals.

“Without overstating it, the challenges are almost unique in Canadian history, if not unique in the post-war period,” Cameron Anderson, a politics professor at Western University, told Reuters.

“We have big challenges domestically in terms of cost of living and housing and healthcare and managing immigration ... And then I think when we look at Canada as a country in the world, we’re probably threatened and have the sense of being threatened in a way we haven’t in many generations.”

Carney, who won an overwhelming majority in the Liberal leadership race, used his victory speech on Sunday evening to warn the “greatest crisis of our generation” came in the form of Trump, leader of Canada’s closest ally and largest trading partner.

“The Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country. Think about that for a moment. If they succeed, they will destroy our way of life,” he said, pledging to supporters that Canada would remain unbowed to US threats.

“America is not Canada. And Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape, or form. We didn’t ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves.”

Carney’s predilection for a hockey metaphor was in full view on Sunday as he promised to keep Canada’s retaliatory tariffs in place until the American ones were fully removed, adding the country’s southern neighbor needed to show “respect” to one of its largest trading partners.

“So, Americans should make no mistake … In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.”

A Nanos poll, conducted for CTV News and released on Sunday, found 36% of respondents saw Trump as the most important issue influencing their vote. The economy followed at 29%.

Before his victory in the Liberal party race, multiple polls showed that Carney was viewed as most capable of dealing with the economic fallout of a Trump-inspired trade war.

Carney, 59, was head of the Bank of Canada from 2008, when he helped Canada avoid the worst of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. In 2013, he became the first-ever noncitizen to run the Bank of England since its inception in 1694, and helped blunt the consequences of Brexit in the UK.

Carney also hinted at the degree to which Trump will feature as a foil in the upcoming national election against the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, whose lead in the polls is wilting.

“Pierre Poilievre’s plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,” Carney said. “Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.”

The shift in political sentiment has benefitted Carney’s Liberals but he nonetheless warned of “dark days” ahead for the country.

“I’ve learned from long experience that in a crisis, ‘plan beats no plan’, and that you need to first distinguish between what you can change and what you can’t change. We can’t change Donald Trump.

Polish prime minister tells ‘friends’ to cast aside arrogance after his foreign minister and Marco Rubio trade barbs online

Donald Tusk, Poland’s prime minister, has called on “friends” to respect their allies and not be arrogant in a post on X that mentioned nobody by name but was published a day after an extraordinary social media spat between top officials in the US and Poland over Starlink satellites.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, accused Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, of “making things up” and suggested on Sunday he was ungrateful, in a strong rebuke after Sikorski said Ukraine may need an alternative to Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite service if it becomes unreliable.

Poland pays for Ukraine to use Starlink, which provides crucial internet connectivity to Kyiv and its military.

“True leadership means respect for partners and allies. Even for the smaller and weaker ones,” Tusk wrote in English on X. “Never arrogance. Dear friends, think about it.”

Rubio had also said that “no one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink”.

“And say thank you because without Starlink Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now,” Rubio added.

Sikorski had later replied: “Thank you, Marco, for confirming that the brave soldiers of Ukraine can count on the vital internet service provided jointly by the US and Poland.”

Sikorski had been told to “be quiet” and labelled a “small man” by Musk after he suggested that Poland, which says it pays $50m a year for Ukraine’s Starlink services, may need to find another provider if Musk’s service was deemed unreliable.

The US government has already revoked some access to satellite imagery for Ukraine and paused intelligence sharing, piling pressure on Kyiv as Trump seeks a swift end to the war, which is now in its fourth year after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Shares in the Franco-British satellite operator Eutelsat soared by as much as 650% last week amid speculation the company could replace Starlink in providing internet access to Ukraine.

Musk, a high-profile figure in Donald Trump’s administration, said in a post on his X social media platform early on Sunday that Ukraine’s “entire frontline would collapse if I turned it [Starlink] off”.

In a series of posts on X on the subject, that lasted through the day, Musk said later he would not turn off Starlink in Ukraine.

“To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals … We would never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Calls grow to control military use of unmanned aerial vehicles which, despite claims of precise targeting, are claiming civilian lives

Almost 1,000 civilians have been killed and hundreds more injured in military drone attacks across Africa as the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles continues unchecked on the continent, according to a report.

At least 50 separate deadly strikes by armed forces in Africa have been confirmed during the three years up to November 2024, with analysts describing a “striking pattern of civilian harm” with little or no accountability.

Although the rapid growth of armed drones deployed by Ukraine and Russia receives significant scrutiny, scant focus is being paid to the escalating use in Africa of a new breed of imported cheaper drones, such as Turkey’s Bayraktar TB2, said Cora Morris of campaign group Drone Wars UK, which on Monday published a report on the growth of armed drones in Africa, called Death on Delivery.

“This must change. Unless the international community moves rapidly towards developing and implementing a new control regime, we are highly likely to see more examples of the killing of civilians from the use of armed drones,” said Morris.

So far, the use of armed drones has been confirmed in at least six conflicts in Africa: Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso and Ethiopia, where most attacks were seen.

Drone strikes by the Ethiopian armed forces against adversaries such as the Tigray People’s Liberation Front were found to have killed more than 490 civilians in 26 separate attacks.

Elsewhere, at least 64 civilians died in nine separate drone strikes conducted by Malian armed forces battling separatist groups in the north of the country. In neighbouring Burkina Faso, researchers found more than 100 civilians have been killed in drone strikes carried out by the country’s military.

The Drone Wars UK report said the failure to control the proliferation of armed drones in Africa had led to more than 940 civilians being killed since November 2021, a figure it described as conservative.

Most armed drones in Africa are imported from Turkey, along with China and Iran, with researchers sounding the alarm over the growing popularity of “medium altitude, long endurance” (MALE) drones.

These can be flown remotely for many hours over a large distance, conducting surveillance as well as airstrikes.

The proliferation – and risks – of armed drones in African conflicts has been witnessed in Sudan’s civil war with their use in highly populated areas such as markets in the capital, Khartoum, having “grave” consequences for civilians. Iranian, Chinese and Turkish drones have been deployed by the Sudanese military while its adversary – the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – has used UAE-supplied drones, the report said.

In Burkina Faso, Bayraktar TB2s have been deployed by Burkinabè military forces in their struggle against a jihadist insurgency. State-sponsored media regularly celebrated “neutralisations” of terrorists using what it described as sophisticated, precise drone technologies.

However, accounts from sources on the ground often yield a different narrative, pointing to frequently high civilian deaths. One incident in the country’s Sahel region in August 2023, saw drones strike a market in the village of Bouro, killing at least 28 civilians.

The report said: “The Burkinabè government’s wholesale celebration of strikes like that on Bouro’s market rests upon a perception of drone warfare as an efficient, advanced development in the country’s military operations, signifying a technically sophisticated arsenal operated by a vigilant, effective government with a firm grip on its territories.

“However, on-the-ground research quickly reveals the falsity of this picture: exposing erratic bombings of innocent communities, which sow only further destruction and insecurity.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Campaigners say funding halt is a ‘staggering blow’ to vulnerable nations and to efforts to keep heating below 1.5C

Donald Trump’s withdrawal of US overseas aid will almost decimate global climate finance from the developed world, data shows, with potentially devastating impacts on vulnerable nations.

The US was responsible last year for about $8 in every $100 that flowed from the rich world to developing countries, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather, according to data from the analyst organisation Carbon Brief.

About $11bn was spent last year, and a similar amount would have been spent by the US on climate finance this year under a continuation of Joe Biden’s plans, the analysis found.

But among the first actions of Trump on resuming the US presidency, in a turbulent two months, have been to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, and to eviscerate overseas aid efforts, of which climate finance is a part.

The White House has halted much of the funding to USAid, the government’s overseas aid agency that provides about a third of US climate finance, and contributions to the international Green Climate Fund and the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage.

Trump has also taken the US out of a Just Transition Energy Partnership with Indonesia, a programme worth tens of billions of dollars that was intended to end the use of coal. The White House has also begun a purge of climate references from government websites.

Campaigners told the Guardian these actions would have a major impact on the ability of poor countries to cope with extreme weather. Anne Jellema, the executive director of 350.org, told the Guardian: “The US retreat from its global climate finance commitments is a staggering blow to the chances of keeping global temperature rise to 1.5C [above preindustrial levels]. By abruptly axing nearly a tenth of the limited funds for climate protection in developing countries, it is effectively abandoning millions of communities who have done nothing to cause global heating but who are losing homes, livelihoods and lives because of it.”

She called on other countries to step up. “Now is the moment for wealthy nations to rise above politics and show real leadership. The world is watching, and the stakes have never been higher. We must act together to keep hope alive for a livable future.”

Trump’s newly formed “department of government efficiency”, headed by Elon Musk, has been firing USAid staff and ending shipments. Though some have been reinstated after controversy and court orders, Trump is likely to continue his efforts to cut all forms of aid, with climate a key target.

Under Trump’s last presidency, climate finance also fell sharply. This time, it is likely to fall further under the onslaught on all forms of government spending.

The US has long contributed far less to climate finance, proportionate to its status as the world’s biggest economy and biggest carbon emitter, than other developed countries. Though Joe Biden markedly increased the funds during his term, he faced a struggle with the Republican-dominated Congress to do so.

Climate finance is needed to help poor countries cope with the already evident impacts of the climate crisis, such as droughts, floods, heatwaves and storms. The developing world is sustaining hundreds of billions of dollars in damage as a result, with the effects expected to intensify further.

These countries are already spending large chunks of their existing domestic budgets patching up the damage and trying to improve their resilience, depriving them of funds needed for health, education and economic development.

Rich governments carry an obligation under the Paris agreement to provide funds to poor nations, which have done little to contribute to greenhouse gas emissions but bear the brunt of the damage.

Last November, at the annual conference of the parties (Cop) of the UNFCCC, all countries agreed that climate finance should reach $1.3tn a year by 2035. The bulk of this will come from the private sector, some is likely to come from charges on high-carbon activities such as shipping and aviation, and at least $300bn is to come from the developed world.

Without sizeable contributions from the US, the world’s biggest economy, those numbers are likely to be much harder to reach.

Harjeet Singh, founding director of the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, said: “As the largest historical emitter, the US bears a significant share of the blame for the climate adversities affecting vulnerable populations worldwide. We must hold them accountable and ensure they contribute their fair share towards global climate reparations.”

Countries with rapidly growing economies that are still classed as developing under the UN, such as China, the United Arab Emirates, and other oil states, also contribute to climate finance. Pressure on those emerging economies to contribute more is also likely to grow, from developed areas such as the EU, as the US steps away and they face increasing demands for defence spending.

Ukrainian president will be holding talks with Mohammed bin Salman

We’re just getting a line that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia for his talks with Mohammed bin Salman, whose government has played a mediating role between Ukraine and Russia.

French president Emanuel Macron has warned that Moldova is facing increasingly blatant Russian attempts aiming at destabilising the country, Reuters reports.

Macron, at a joint press conference with his Moldovan counterpart Maia Sandu, said:

Moldova, whose airspace is regularly violated by Russian drones and missiles, also has to contend with increasingly uninhibited Russian attempts at destabilisation, targeting your country’s democratic institutions in particular.

A senior Ukrainian politician said the cost of Donald Trump’s decision to halt the supply of weapons and some intelligence sharing with Ukraine will be measured “in the life of our soldiers”.

The pause will mean that we’ll lose more and more soldiers”, Yehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of Ukraine’s defence and intelligence committee told the BBC.

He said he did not believe the impact will be felt immediately on the frontline, adding that Ukraine has sufficient stocks to fight on for another six months.

Ukraine is less reliant on US-supplied weaponry and ammunition than it was at the start of Russia’s full scale invasion, he said.

A Ukrainian delegation meeting with US officials in Saudi Arabia tomorrow will propose a ceasefire covering the Black Sea and long-range missile strikes, as well as the release of prisoners, Associated Press reports, citing two senior Ukrainian officials.

The Ukrainian delegation is also ready during the talks to sign an agreement with the US on access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, Ukrainian officials told the news agency.

The Ukrainian armed forces commander-in chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said its forces are not in danger of encirclement in Russia's Kursk region, despite reports of a recent counteroffensive by Russian forces that has included North Korean troops.

Russia has taken control of several villages in the Kursk region and claims its forces are close to surrounding thousands of Ukrainian troops fighting on Russian territory.

Syrskyi, who said he was visiting the forces fighting in Kursk, said:

Despite the involvement of a significant number of Russian troops in the offensive, reinforced by North Korean infantry, the enemy is suffering significant losses in manpower and equipment.

And as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s meetings in Riyadh continue and we wait for more details to emerge from behind the closed doors, let me hand you over to Leonie Chao-Fong who will guide you through the evening.

Going back to genuinely important topics, let’s take a quick look at what is expected tomorrow as, thousands of miles away from Jeddah, a number of military officials will meet in Paris for talks on the creation of an international security force for Ukraine, which would be needed in case of a ceasefire with Russia.

A French military official told journalists earlier today that more than 30 nations are expected to join the forum, convened by French president Emmanuel Macron, including Asian and Oceania representatives joining remotly.

The talks’ second part will include “more precise and concrete” discussions where the participants will be invited to say whether and how their militaries might be able to contribute, the official said.
 “It’s not, ‘This is what we need,’” the official said. “It’s more, ‘What are you bringing to the pot?’”

Of 32 Nato members, Croatia and Montenegro did not respond to their invitations, and the US was not invited, as European-led group wanted to demonstrate that they can take responsibility for a large part of the post-ceasefire security framework for Ukraine.

On a lighter note, please indulge me for a second as we take a slight detour to bring you some light on this otherwise depressing day.

Longstanding readers of this blog will know that I like to occassionally look at the bizarre tales of the Eurovision song contest to bring us something to laugh about, and Italy has been at the forefront of the absolute drama this year.

Over the weekend, a third Italy-related song was confirmed in the lineup for this year’s final in Basel, Switzerland, after San Marino decided to send Italian DJ Gabry Ponte with his “Tutta l’Italia,” meaning literally “All of Italy.”

What makes this pick particularly unusual is that… the song was literally the main theme of this year’s Italian song festival in Sanremo, the Italian qualifier for the Eurovision last month.

Ponte reportedly wanted to compete, but wasn’t allowed on a technicality that he is a DJ and not a singer, and instead agreed for the song to be used as the main theme played at the beginning of each and every show, during ad breaks, at the end, and 39812 many other times during the Sanremo week.

Fast forward three weeks, and Ponte was part of the lineup in the San Marino’s contest over the weekend, and… erm, he won it. A senior San Marino minister even joked that now “all of Italy will now be able to vote for him” at the Eurovision, La Repubblica reported.

“The international rebirth of Italodisco starts with San Marino,” the paper said.

Be warned: as one commenter on YouTube put it, “this song lives rent free in my head many days in the row.”

What makes the pick even more tasty is that Ponte will now face Italian-mocking controversy-inducing Estonian pick Tommy Cash – “Ciao bella, I’m Tomaso, addicted to tobacco. Mi like mi coffè very importante” – in the first semifinal, in which Italians will be able to vote and offer their view on both songs…

Also, imagine being the Italian pick, Lucio Corsi, who survived the entire week of hearing this song so many times on loop in Sanremo, only to now be confronted by its existence again, on the big stage, under the flag of San Marino (awkward!).

In other Eurovision dramas, Sweden has Finns singing about the experience of being in sauna, Ireland has a Norwegian musician singing about a Soviet space dog, and Finland has a part of its song in German (no, me neither). And here’s the Ukrainian song, announced today.

Oh, well: that’s geopolitics of the Eurovision song contest for you. At least it’s (usually) harmless.

Back to normal news before I get carried away any further. Hope this made you smile, though. At least a bit?

As we are waiting for more updates on Zelenskyy’s meetings in Riyadh, let me bring you first pictures from his meetings there with senior Saudi officials.

Ahead of tomorrow’s US-Ukraine talks, UK prime minister Keir Starmer spoke with US president Donald Trump to discuss their expectations about the meeting.

A Downing Street spokesperson said that Starmer told Trump “that UK officials had been speaking to Ukraine officials over the weekend and they remain committed to a lasting peace.”

The British prime minister also said “he hoped there would be a positive outcome to the talks that would enable US aid and intelligence sharing to be restarted.”

“The two leaders also spoke about the economic deal they had discussed at the White House and the prime minister welcomed the detailed conversations that had already happened to move this forward. Both leaders agreed to stay in touch,” the spokesperson added.

We now have more details on Marco Rubio’s comments ahead of the US-Ukraine talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, tomorrow.

The US state secretary said he hoped Washington’s cutoff of military aid could be “resolved” during critical talks in Saudi Arabia aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine, AFP reported.

“I think the notion of the pause in aid, broadly, is something I hope we can resolve. Obviously what happens tomorrow will be key to that,” the chief US diplomat told reporters.

He also spoke about the prospects of a ceasefire in the conflict, indicating a level of support for the Ukrainian proposal on air and sea truce.

“I’m not saying that alone is enough but it’s the kind of concession you would need to see in order to end the conflict,” he said.

Rubio has now landed in Saudi Arabia too, but despite Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy also being there tonight, the pair is not expected to meet.

Denmark is in principle ready to take part in the European peacekeeping forces deployed to Ukraine, Danish foreign minister confirmed after securing key parliamentary approval.

In remarks reported by the Danish media after a meeting with the Foreign Policy Committee, Lars Løkke Rasmussen said it was important for Europe to “send the right signals to both Putin and Washington”.

No specific decision about deployment was agreed; it was more of an agreement in principle for if and when the right circumstances arise under a ceasefire arrangement between Russia and Ukraine.

As a result, Danish chief of defence, Michael Hyldgaard, will take part in tomorrow’s meeting of military chiefs of staff from multiple European countries, convened by French president Emmanuel Macron in Paris.

We are also getting some comments from US state secretary Marco Rubio who will be taking part in the US-Ukraine talks on Tuesday.

He is quoted by Reuters as saying that he hopes the meeting will go well, but it is important to “establish clearly Ukraine’s intentions” on peace, and that Ukraine “is prepared to do difficult things, like the Russians will.”

We will bring you more from him when we have it.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Syria’s defence ministry spokesperson warns of further retribution against forces loyal to Assad. This live blog is closed

Israeli media is quoting a Hamas spokesperson saying the group has “softened” its demands.

Haaretz quotes Abdul Latif al-Qanou saying:

We have softened our demands at the request of the mediators and Trump’s envoy, and we await the results of the negotiations. Israel’s duty is to agree to move to the second stage.

The talks are based on ending the war, withdrawing, and rebuilding the Gaza Strip. We agree to the Egyptian proposal to establish a committee responsible for managing the Gaza Strip and its reconstruction.

Israel’s decision to cut off electricity and talk about resuming the fighting constitute a threat to the hostages. They will only be released through negotiations.

Israel is reported to be sending a delegation to Qatar to continue talks. Over the weekend it said it would cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip, a move which Hamas condemned as blackmail.

Hassan Abdul Ghany, Syria’s defence ministry spokesperson, has said in a statement on social media that with the end of a military operation against remnants of the Bashar al-Assad regime, public institutions were now able to resume their work and provide essential services.

“We are paving the way for life to return to normal and for the consolidation of security and stability,” Abdul Ghany said.

Reuters reports he added that plans were in place to continue combating the remnants of the former government and eliminate any future threats.

Ghany said “We were able to absorb the attacks from the remnants of the former regime and its officers. We shattered their element of surprise and managed to push them away from vital centres, securing most of the main roads.”

Syrian news agency Sana quoted him threatening further retribution against forces loyal to Assad, saying:

To the remnants of the defeated regime and its fleeing officers, our message is clear and explicit: If you return, we will return, and you will find before you only men who do not know how to retreat and who do not have mercy on those whose hands are stained with the blood of the innocent.

The Australian federal police deputy commissioner, Krissy Barrett, said on Monday investigators now believed the caravan incident was concocted by criminals who wanted to cause fear for personal benefit.

The motivation was understood to be both to distract police and divert their resources away from organised crime, as well as to create plots that incarcerated criminals could use to tip off law enforcement as a gesture to reduce their sentences.

“The findings of this investigation should not in any way diminish the summer of fear and anxiety which the Jewish community experienced or the vicious nature of the attacks which included the attempted arson of Synagogues and the firebombing of a childcare centre,” president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, David Ossip said.

Shares in FTSE 250 company fall by a fifth as geopolitical turmoil pushes down freight rates

The world’s biggest ship broker has said that geopolitical turmoil from war and Donald Trump’s tearing up of US foreign policy have hurt its revenues, sending its share price tumbling by almost a fifth on Monday.

Clarksons, which is listed on London’s FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies, said the rates charged by shipping companies had dropped since the start of 2025, hit by concerns over the impact of tariffs.

Trump has imposed tariffs on the US’s largest trading partners, Mexico, Canada and China, only to then temporarily withdraw levies on Canada and Mexico. He has also threatened steep tariffs on the EU, another key goods trade partner, and announced tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to begin later this week.

The company said: “Following a year of extensive political change, [and] ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Russia-Ukraine, adding further complexities, markets have softened as economies grapple with the immediate impacts of this phase of change.”

Andi Case, the chief executive, said: “2025 has started with more uncertainty than most due to political change, ongoing regional conflicts, increased trade tensions, tariffs and sanctions, inflation and changing monetary policy across global economies.”

China introduced previously announced tariffs on imports worth about $22bn (£17bn) on Monday, including soya beans, pork, beef and seafood.

Shares in the company fell 20% on Monday, to the lowest since early November.

The company, which employs 2,000 people across 24 countries, was founded in 1852, during the age of sail, and then shifted to steamships. It grew to a dominant position in the global ship-broking market in tandem with the oil industry, which relies on ever-larger tankers to fuel the world economy.

Clarksons makes money by taking a percentage of the fees charged by shipowners to customers, as well as providing port services and advising companies on shipping issues. That means some disruptions to global shipping can benefit it, such as attacks by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen in late 2023 and early 2024.

Sales rose by 3% to £661m in 2024, while underlying profits edged up to £115m, a company record.

Kremlin accuses individuals of ‘intelligence and subversive activities’ in what appears to be latest in tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions

Two people connected to the British embassy in Moscow have been ordered to leave the country by the Russian authorities, which claimed they had been performing intelligence work.

The British government hit back by accusing Russia of making “malicious and baseless accusations”.

Citing Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), the state news agency Tass identified the two individuals who had been expelled as a second secretary of the British embassy and the spouse of another British diplomat.

It named the two people and accused them of deliberately declaring false information about themselves when entering the country.

They have been given two weeks to leave, according to the Russian government, which accused them of “intelligence and subversive activities”.

The FSB had uncovered what it called “signs of intelligence and sabotage work” by both that threatened Russia’s national security, Tass added.

It comes days after three Bulgarian nationals accused of spying for Russia were found guilty of espionage charges in a trial that heard how they were involved in a string of plots around Europe directed by a fugitive based in Moscow.

Downing Street said the latest expulsions were “what we have come to expect from President Putin and his regime” and “the allegations are no doubt baseless”.

The prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “It won’t distract us from our focus on supporting Ukraine and putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position over the days and weeks ahead.”

The Russian government posted a video on X on Monday morning showing what it said was a representative of the British embassy being summoned to the foreign affairs ministry.

The move appears to the latest in a series of tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats by Russia and the UK.

Britain expelled a Russian diplomat last month with the foreign secretary, David Lammy, saying that action had been taken “following Russia’s recent expulsion of a British diplomat” in November.

Russia had accused the British diplomat of giving false information and spying.

The expulsion was announced after a major criminal investigation left six members of a Russian proxy spy ring labelled the “Minions” facing years behind bars for their part in one of the “largest and most complex” enemy operations to be uncovered on UK soil.

The Bulgarians Katrin Ivanova, 33, Vanya Gaberova, 30, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, were found guilty at the Old Bailey last week of spying on an “industrial scale”, putting lives and national security at risk.

The Russian spy ring will be sentenced in May alongside the ringleader, Orlin Roussev, 47; his second-in-command, Biser Dzhambazov, 43; and Ivan Stoyanov, 33, who admitted their roles.

Christo Grozev, a Bulgarian journalist who was the focus of discussions by members of the spy ring about kidnapping or killing him, said the expulsions appeared to be a “thinly deniable tit for tat” for the convictions last week.

“I am sure that the Russian government was closely following the court trial and were sending feelers to try to find out what the verdict was likely to be,” he said.

“Thus, for them to expel the two British diplomats right now is clearly expected, if not intended, to be seen as a reaction to the verdict. It appears to me to be a thinly deniable tit for tat.” 

In January, the Guardian reported on how Russian diplomats accessed a private area of parliament in a major security breach shortly before Christmas that alarmed security officials and prompted private warnings from the speakers of both houses.

A number of UK politicians and journalists have been barred from entering Russia since the start of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Dozens of others, including the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and other cabinet members, were also added by Russia to a so-called “stop list”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Graham Stuart says other 36 mariners across both crews are ‘safe and accounted for’

Graham Stuart, the MP for Beverley and Holderness, says the transport secretary has told him that only one person has been hospitalised following the incident.

“The other 36 mariners across both crews are safe and accounted for,” he said on X.

The crews of an oil tanker and a cargo ship are “safe and accounted for” with one person taken to hospital after the vessels collided in the North Sea, with jet fuel reported to have been released, a maritime company has said. Crowley, the shipping company that manages the MV Stena Immaculate, said there were “multiple explosions onboard” when the oil tanker suffered a ruptured cargo tank.

Graham Stuart, the MP for Beverley and Holderness, says the transport secretary has told him that only one person has been hospitalised following the incident. “The other 36 mariners across both crews are safe and accounted for,” he said on X.

An emergency operation was launched after the collision on Monday morning. A helicopter was scrambled and lifeboats launched from four different bases along the coast. The collision happened near the Humber estuary. According to the ship tracking tool Vesselfinder, the US-flagged tanker was at anchor at the time of the incident. It had departed from a Greek port in the Aegean Sea and was heading towards Hull, according to the Marine Traffic website. The Solong was destined for Rotterdam.

US logistics firm Crowley, the operator and joint owner of the MV Stena Immaculate, said the tanker was carrying jet fuel. The vessel was hit by the Solong in the North Sea at approximately 10am today. In a statement, the Florida-based company said: “A fire occurred as a result of the allision, and fuel was reported released.

The Stena Immaculate tanker was on a short-term charter to the US Navy’s Military Sealift Command when it was struck on Monday while anchored off north-east England, a US military spokesperson told Reuters. The tanker was operated by US logistics group Crowley. Crowley wrote on X that the tanker, carrying a cargo of Jet-A1 fuel, was anchored near Hull off the North Sea coast when it was struck by the Portuguese-flagged 9,322 dwt container ship Solong.

The Solong vessel, which was involved in a collision off the coast of Britain on Monday, is carrying 15 containers of sodium cyanide among other cargo, according to a report from maritime data provider Lloyd’s List Intelligence. The container vessel was also transporting an unknown quantity of alcohol, the casualty report – an assessment of incidents at sea – said, citing a message from the local coastguard.

A spokesperson for Greenpeace UK said it was monitoring the situation “very closely” but that it was too early to assess the extent of any environmental damage.

Two maritime security sources said there was no indication of any malicious activity or other actors involved in a crash on Monday between a tanker carrying jet fuel and a cargo vessel off the coast of England.

The Marine Accident Investigation Branch sent investigators to Grimsby following the crash between two vessels in the North Sea. A spokesperson said: “The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has deployed a team to Grimsby following the collision of the Portuguese-registered container ship Solong and the US-registered oil tanker Stena Immaculate which collided in the North Sea this morning.”

A jet fuel spillage into the sea is “less of an environmental problem” than black crude oil, experts have said this afternoon.

Prof David Slater, honorary professor in the school of engineering at Cardiff University, said:

It is being reported that jet fuel has been spilt into the sea. If so, that means it was more likely to ignite, as appears to have happened. The upside is it’s less of an environmental problem than black crude oil.

In some cases like this it’s better to leave it to burn, but that depends on how much fuel is leaking.

Mark Hartl, a marine ecotoxicologist from the Centre for Marine Biodiversity and Biotechnology at Heriot-Watt University, said:

Whilst the images look worrying, from the perspective of the impact to the aquatic environment it’s less of a concern than if this had been crude oil because most of the jet fuel will evaporate very quickly.

Also, the fact that it happened out at sea and not closer to land or within an estuary setting is fortuitous and will minimise the environmental impact.

However, it will have an acute effect on organisms in the immediate aftermath of the spill and lead to various degrees of stress in exposed animals.

There must also be a concern that heavier ship fuel was spilled as a consequence of the collision which could have a more lasting effect on the coastline.

The head of the maritime centre at Liverpool John Moores University has been using simulators to reconstruct the incident and said watchkeepers on the Solong could be to blame for the collision.

Dr Abdul Khalique said:

It can be assumed that the watchkeepers on MV Solong were not performing their duty to ‘maintain a proper lookout by all available means’ as required by International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea.

Although lookout by sight may have been hampered by the poor prevailing visibility at the time of accident, had the watchkeepers been maintaining a proper lookout by Radar, they would have spotted this imminent collision threat and taken an action to avoid collision. Preliminary reports suggesting that poor visibility may have played a role in the collision too.

The incident will be fully investigated by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) and other stakeholders to fully understand the reasons for such a mishap.

According to our reconstruction, MV Stena Immaculate’s heading was approximately about 065⁰ when she was hit on her port side by MV Solong at 9:48:07 between the rear half of MV Stena Immaculate’s length.

After collision, MV Stena Immaculate’s heading turned to heading 131⁰ (T) and took all of MV Solong’s speed away. Both ships appear to have remained in contact for around four minutes dragged southeast until 9:52:42.

Graham Stuart, the MP for Beverley and Holderness, says the transport secretary has told him that only one person has been hospitalised following the incident.

“The other 36 mariners across both crews are safe and accounted for,” he said on X.

Here is a graphic which shows where the collision in the North Sea occurred this morning.

David McFarlane, director of Marine Risk and Safety Consultants Ltd, said both ships would have been obliged to do what they can to avoid collisions, under international collision regulations.

Several warning systems, including radar and a ship’s horn, are on board aimed at preventing such incidents. Around 200-300 collisions happen at sea each year, he said.

“They would have sighted each other over radar, called Automatic Identification System (AIS), onboard. The ships would be able to see and identify another vessel via AIS, and can call them up via very high frequency radio, and ask them what they are doing.”

A ship is visible on another ship’s radar from as far as 24 miles away, McFarlane said. All vessels should have someone on lookout at all times.

“But you wouldn’t get anxious about another ship until it was about 4 miles away, depending on speed.”

If the other ship doesn’t respond on the radio, vessels have a last-minute warning system, the ship’s horn, he said.

“The next thing to do would be to blast the horn of a ship, which can be heard from miles away”.

However, if a ship is at anchor, and initial reports of the Stena Immaculate suggest that it was nearly stationary, it can take a ship up to an hour to pick up the anchor.

“I’ve heard that one of the ships was an anchor. If so, there’s a possibility it would have picked up its anchor, or was in the process of doing so, we don’t know. But it can take up to an hour to pick up anchor.”

McFarlane said that it is too early to speculate what happened between the two vessels.

However, in the 200-300 collisions around the world every year, human error is often to blame.

He said that while there have been reports of pockets of fog in the North Sea at the time of the collision, it would not impact the ability of any approaching vessel to warn of an approach, given the AIS.

US logistics firm Crowley, the operator and joint owner of the MV Stena Immaculate, said the tanker was carrying jet fuel.

The vessel was hit by the Solong in the North Sea at approximately 10am today.

In a statement, the Florida-based company said: “A fire occurred as a result of the allision, and fuel was reported released.

“The Stena Immaculate crew abandoned the vessel following multiple explosions onboard.

“All Crowley mariners are safe and fully accounted for.”

‘Multiple explosions’ rupture cargo tank of MV Stena Immaculate, with jet fuel reportedly released



The crews of an oil tanker and a cargo ship are “safe and accounted for” with one person taken to hospital after the vessels collided in the North Sea, with jet fuel reported to have been released, a maritime company has said.

Crowley, the shipping company that manages the MV Stena Immaculate, said there were “multiple explosions onboard” when the oil tanker suffered a ruptured cargo tank.

More than 30 casualties have been brought ashore so far after the collision off the coast of East Yorkshire on Monday morning. The other vessel involved was a Portuguese-flagged container ship called the Solong.

Graham Stuart, the MP for Beverley and Holderness, said the transport secretary told him that only one person had been hospitalised. “The other 36 mariners across both crews are safe and accounted for,” he said on X.

Footage from the scene showed clouds of black smoke billowing into the air.

A spokesperson for Greenpeace UK said it was monitoring the situation “very closely” but that it was too early to assess the extent of any environmental damage.

Crowley said in a statement: “At approximately 10am on 10 March 2025, while anchored off the North Sea coast near Hull, United Kingdom, the Crowley-managed tanker Stena Immaculate was struck by the container ship Solong.

“The Stena Immaculate sustained a ruptured cargo tank containing Jet-A1 fuel due to the allision. A fire occurred as a result of the allision, and fuel was reported released. The Stena Immaculate crew abandoned the vessel following multiple explosions onboard. All Crowley mariners are safe and fully accounted for.

“Crowley immediately initiated its emergency vessel response plan and is actively working with public agencies to contain the fire and secure the vessel. Our first priority is the safety of the people and environment. We will provide more updates as information becomes available.”

An emergency operation was launched after the collision on Monday morning. A helicopter was scrambled and lifeboats launched from four different bases along the coast.

The collision happened near the Humber estuary. According to the ship tracking tool Vesselfinder, the US-flagged tanker was at anchor at the time of the incident. It had departed from a Greek port in the Aegean Sea and was heading towards Hull, according to the Marine Traffic website. The Solong was destined for Rotterdam.

Footage of the incident showed both ships on fire, with flames spreading across the water and clouds of black smoke coming from the oil tanker, which is believed to have been carrying jet fuel.

A spokesperson for HM Coastguard said: “HM Coastguard is currently coordinating the emergency response to reports of a collision between a tanker and cargo vessel off the coast of East Yorkshire.

“The alarm was raised at 9.48am. A coastguard rescue helicopter from Humberside was called, alongside lifeboats from Skegness, Bridlington, Mablethorpe and Cleethorpes, an HM Coastguard fixed-wing aircraft, and nearby vessels with firefighting capability.

“The incident remains ongoing and an assessment of the likely counter-pollution response required is being enacted.”

The UK transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “I’m concerned to hear of the collision between two vessels in the North Sea this morning and am liaising with officials and HM Coastguard as the situation develops. I want to thank all emergency service workers involved for their continued efforts in responding to the incident.”

The leader of Hull council, Mike Ross, said: “The scenes across the East Yorkshire coast are deeply shocking. My thoughts are with all those affected. There will now be massive emergency response efforts from people right across the area and beyond.
 “As Hull’s council leader, I will work with the team here urgently to do everything we can to support the response needed now.”

A spokesperson for Greenpeace UK said: “Both the high speed of the collision and the footage of the aftermath are cause for great concern.” They added: “Right now, our thoughts are with all those affected by the incident and the emergency services responding to the situation.”

David McFarlane, the director of Marine Risk and Safety Consultants, said several warning systems, including radar and a ship’s horn, were onboard aimed at preventing such collisions. About 200 to 300 collisions happened at sea each year, he said.

Contest in Runcorn and Helsby will be a challenge for Labour

Mike Amesbury is standing down as an MP following his conviction for assault, the BBC is reporting.

This means there will definitely be a election in his constituency, Runcorn and Helsby.

This will be a challenge for Labour, which won the seat at the least election with a majority of 14,696. Reform UK came second on 18% of the vote, compared to Labour’s 53%. Nigel Farage’s party is seen as having a good chance of winning but, given that he regularly claims he is going to win the next general election (despite only winning five seats in 2024), failing to win would be a huge setback.

But the contest will also be perilous for Kemi Badenoch. The Tories were third in the constituency at the general election, with 16% of the vote, and a bad result would revive speculation about Badenoch facing a leadership challenge.

Mike Amesbury has resigned as an MP after being given a prison sentence for punching a constituent, triggering a byelection where Labour is likely to face a strong challenge from Reform UK.

The Sentencing Council has suggested that Shabana Mahmood’s threat to curb its powers could undermine the independence of the judiciary. (See 5.32pm.)

Keir Starmer has told Donald Trump he wants US-Ukraine talks to have a “positive outcome” that will result in the resumption of military aid and intelligence-sharing.

The family of murdered MP Sir David Amess have criticised an “insulting” rejection by the home secretary of their calls for a public inquiry into his death, accusing the government of “adding salt on an open wound”.

Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has told MPs that potentially “thousands” of neighbourhood policing officers and police community support officers (PCSOs) were miscounted by the last government, meaning cuts to officer numbers were “even worse” than anticipated. Opening the second reading debate on the crime and policing bill, she said:

I have to tell the house that the cuts to neighbourhood policing over the last decade were even worse than we had thought.

The previous Conservative government was so indifferent to neighbourhood policing that they did not even keep a proper count of who was doing that work. They treated, too often, the neighbourhood police officers just the same as 999 response officers or local detective teams, and the Home Office guidance actually allowed forces to report some of their response officers as neighbourhood police instead, and they didn’t have proper checks in place.

As a result, I can tell the house that hundreds and even thousands of officers and PCSOs were miscounted under the last government and the Home Office and National Police Chiefs’ Council will, later this month, have to publish revised force-by-force figures so that communities properly can see what is happening in their area.

Rob Ford, a politics professor, has posted some thoughts on the Runcorn and Helsby byelection on Bluesky.

By-election time! First of the new Parliament, and an interesting one too...Labour have a 35 point majority in Amesbury’s seat of Runcorn & Helsby (formerly Weaver Vale), which looks big, but these are volatile times, and ReformUK are in 2nd place

So, first of all, could Lab lose? The seat would fall on a 17.5 point swing away from the government...sounds a lot, but Starmer achieved 6 swings of 20 points plus in the previous Parliament (5 from Con, 1 from SNP), Starmer & Lab are now about as unpopular as their Tory predecessors were then...

Second, could Reform win? They finished only 2 points ahead of Conservatives last July, and the predecessor seat of Weaver Vale returned Tory MPs in 2010 and 2015. Reform will need to squeeze the Con vote as well as win over Labour voters - may not be easy & they have their own internal troubles

Third, what would the result mean? In one sense, not much. By-elections are often outliers. But perceptions are everything...The current Starmer team spent years obsessing over by-election campaigns & the rise of Reform is the big story right now.

A Lab defeat to Reform will be a big blow to morale and will definitely intensify internal arguments over how to respond to Farage, particularly as it will come either soon before or soon after local and Mayoral contests which will also feature Reform heavily.

A Reform by-election win on such a big swing would be a huge deal for Farage, demonstrating his claim to be “coming for Labour” is credible, and likely also showing that Reform can squeeze third placed Con voters where they are the best placed local opponent to Lab...

...and partly for that reason a Reform win would be an even bigger nightmare for Badenoch and Cons that Starmer & Lab. Not only would it underline Badenoch’s failure to rebuilt support or see off Farage, it would make the possibility of Reform displacing Cons as main party of the right more credible

Every by-election provides a big moment of electoral drama and a key test for the parties. This one will perhaps be a bigger moment than most, shaping perceptions of three different parties’ prospects - offering relief or anxiety for each going into the summer & the autumn conference season beyond.

Nominations to be Labour’s candidate in Runcorn and Helsby have already closed, according to the broadcaster Michael Crick, who has a useful Twitter sideline monitoring candidate selections.

Election Maps UK, an elections/polling website, says Labour should be able to win Runcon and Helsby, on the basis of current national polling, according to its model.

In his interview with the BBC Mike Amesbury said that, if he had been given a lighter sentence for assault, he would have tried to stay on as an MP.

But he was given a custodial sentence, which was suspended following an appeal, and this meant the recall petition process would have been triggered if he had not decided to quit. He told the BBC:

I’m going to step aside at the earliest opportunity. I’ve got processes I must go through - there’s a statutory process in terms of redundancies.

Amesbury said he would regret assaulting Paul Fellows for the rest of his life. But he said he was on edge before the incident happened because he had received death threats. He went on:

So, when someone approached me at ten past two in the morning it was quite natural to be on edge and anxious - and I got it wrong …

I just saw red - a moment of madness which I will regret for the rest of my life.

The Sentencing Council has said that the claims that its new guidelines for judges will result in minority ethnic offenders getting more lenient sentences than white offenders are “completely wrong”.

Lord Justice William Davis, chair of the council, hit back in an open letter to Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, in which he also suggested that it was a mistake for her to threaten its independence.

Davis was responding to a letter Mahmood sent to the council last week, after it issued new guidelines saying judges should normally get pre-sentence reports for certain categories of offender, including people from an ethnic, cultural or faith minority. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, claimed this would make the legal system biased againt white people.

In a reference to Jenrick, Davis said:

I have seen it suggested that the guideline instructs sentencers to impose a more lenient sentence on those from ethnic minorities than white offenders. Plainly that suggestion is completely wrong.

Davis said the council produced the new guidelines following a consultation process that started in 2022. He said the last government did not object to what was proposed, and officials from Mahmood’s department did not raise any objections when they were briefed on what was being planned two days before the new guidelines were published.

Defending the news guidelines, Davis said:

The purpose of the list [of types of offender where a pre-sentence report will normally be needed] is to remind sentencers of the kinds of cases in which it is likely that they will require more information about the offence and the offender to reach an appropriate opinion of the sentence. The guideline does not mandate a pre-sentence report in those cases. Rather, a report will normally be considered necessary. It does not exclude a pre-sentence report in relation to an offender who does not fall within any of the wide range of groups reflected in the list …

In relation to offenders from ethnic minorities, there is good evidence (both from the council’s own research and other independent research) that in relation to some types of offence there is a disparity in sentence outcomes as between white offenders and offenders from an ethnic minority. Offenders from some ethnic minority backgrounds are more likely to receive an immediate custodial sentence than white offenders. In some offence specific guidelines this fact is highlighted. Why this disparity exists remains unclear. The Council’s view is that providing a sentencer with as much information as possible about the offender is one means by which such disparity might be addressed.

In her letter to the council, Mahmood said people from a minority ethnic background should not get “differential treatment” from the criminal justice system. She said she would review whether the council should have the power to make such important decisison, and whether ministers or MPs should have more say.

But Davis accused her of threatening the independence of the judiciary. He said:

All judges and magistrates are required to apply any relevant guideline unless the interests of justice require otherwise. In practice, the guidelines form the backbone of every sentencing decision made throughout England and Wales. There is general acceptance of the guidelines by the judiciary because they emanate from an independent body on which judicial members are in the majority. The council preserves the critical constitutional position of the independent judiciary in relation to sentencing.

In criminal proceedings where the offender is the subject of prosecution by the state, the state should not determine the sentence imposed on an individual offender. If sentencing guidelines of whatever kind were to be dictated in any way by ministers of the Crown, this principle would be breached.

The prime minister spoke to President Trump ahead of the US Ukraine dialogue in Saudi Arabia.

The prime minister said that UK officials had been speaking to Ukraine officials over the weekend and they remain committed to a lasting peace.

The prime minister said he hoped there would be a positive outcome to the talks that would enable US aid and intelligence sharing to be restarted.

The two leaders also spoke about the economic deal they had discussed at the White House and the prime minister welcomed the detailed conversations that had already happened to move this forward. Both leaders agreed to stay in touch.

At the Covid inquiry Michael Gove, the former Cabinet Office minister, has dismissed evidence suggesting he ordered officials to ensure that ventilators designed by James Dyson’s company for use during the Covid pandemic were approved.

Confronted with an official minute of a meeting suggesting that, on Wednesday 25 March 2020, he told civil servants that he wanted the Dyson model to be approved by the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority) by the Friday (two days later), Gove said that it would have been “absurd” for him to seek to overrule a regulatory body.

He also claimed that the minute was phrased in “shorthand” and that what it was meant to say was that he wanted to see the Dyson ventilator approved, provided it passed the tests.

Gove was responding to questions from Jamie Sharma, counsel for the inquiry, who produced this minute. It says that CDL (Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster – Gove) told MHRA and Gareth Rhys Williams, a Cabinet Office official, to ensure that “by the end of Friday, the Dyson product has tested and approved by MHRA”.

Sharma also showed the inquiry a letter from Graeme Tunbridge, director of devices at the MHRA, saying that Gove was “keen to press forward with Dyson’s proposal to a timescale that is totally unrealistic, based in part on promises made by Dyson that are already not being fulfilled”. Tunbridge added:

In addition, however, CDL did not appreciate the level of risk involved in the manufacture and use of ventilators and wanted to circumvent the expedited regulatory process that had been put in place.

Sharma also showed the inquiry an email from Rhys Williams describing Gove’s attitude in this matter as “unreasonable”.

Gove said the minute of the meeting where he said he wanted to see the Dyson product approved was not an exact record. He said:

This is private office of shorthand for ‘we would hope that it had been tested, and if tested satisfactory, approved by the MHRA to that timescale’. I was anxious to ensure at all points that, if we could, that we had products that could save lives operating at the front line.

But it’s absurd to imagine that I, or any other minister, could instruct the MHRA, an independent regulatory agency, to approve a product. If I had told the MHRA to approve a product, they would have told me where to get off.

Asked about the claim from Tunbridge that Gove wanted to see the regulatory process circumvented, Gove said he just wanted to ensure the proper process was carried out rapidly.

Gove also said that he was particularly keen to see the Dyson product approved because, unlike other people offering to make ventilators for use by the NHS, Dyson had the ability to scale up manufacture very quickly.

Heather Hallett, the chair, asked Gove if it was fair to summarise this as Gove putting officials under “a great deal of pressure” because he thought the Dyson scheme was viable when it wasn’t. Gove accepted that summary. He said he was not qualified to say if the Dyson model was viable. But, he went on:

What I do have experience of is pushing bureaucracies, and sometimes I can be unreasonable and rebarbative in tone, and I apologise for that.

Sharma then showed the inquiry an extract from the witness statement from Sir John Manzoni, permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office at the time. Manzoni said he was concerned that “indirect pressure was being placed on the MHRA to approve the supplier’s design at the stage of selecting suppliers to progess to the ventilator challenge”. Manzoni had to intervene “to protect the integrity of the process”, he said.

Gove said there was no need for Manzoni to protect the integrity of the process because he (Gove) was doing that anyway.

Asked if he had any regrets over what he did, Gove said he did not.

He said that Dyson, or his company, spent £20m on trying to develop a ventilator. He did it because he wanted to help the NHS, Gove said. And Gove claimed Dyson was attracting negative publicity “because of his support for Brexit”.

Sixteen leading disability and welfare charities have written an open letter to Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, expressing alarm at reports that the government is planning to cut PIP (personal independent payments – a disability benefit) by up to £5bn. (See 12.51pm.) They say the impact of the proposed cuts could be “devastating”, pushing up to 700,000 disabled households into poverty.

In the letter, Mark Hodgkinson, chief executive of Scope, and the other charities leaders say:

Disability benefits such as Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and the limited capability for work amount, can be a lifeline for disabled households and can enable people who receive PIP to work. Making cuts to disability benefits would have a catastrophic impact on disabled people up and down the country. Scope’s analysis of government figures shows that without PIP, a further 700,000 more disabled households could be pushed into poverty. Life costs more for disabled people. Huge numbers already live in poverty as a result of these extra costs. The impact of any cuts to disability benefits would be devastating.

We agree with the government’s ambition to support more disabled people into work. However, making cuts to disability benefits will not achieve this goal or fix the system. In fact, there is little evidence to suggest cutting benefits increases employment outcomes. We know the benefits system is broken and needs reform. That there are disabled people out of work who want to work given the right support. And for some disabled people work isn’t appropriate. Changes to welfare must start here. Not with cuts.

The other organisations that have signed the letter are: Inclusion Barnet; National Autistic Society; Thomas Pocklington Trust; Citizens Advice; Sense; Mencap; Disability Rights UK; RNIB; MS Society; Joseph Rowntree Foundation; Mind; Turn2Us; Z2K; Trussell; and Parkinsons UK.

Downing Street has urged Israel to restore Gaza’s electricity supply, warning that failing to do so risked breaching international law.

Israel announced it had cut off Gaza’s electricity supply on Sunday evening, a week after it suspended delivery of humanitarian supplies to the territory.

At the lobby briefing this morning the PM’s spokesperson said No 10 was “deeply concerned” by these reports. He said:

Our position is humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or used as a political tool.

Asked whether the move was against international law, he said this was “a matter for an international court” but added:

A halt on goods and supplies entering Gaza, including basic needs such as electricity, risks breaching Israel’s obligations under international humanitarian law.

David Willetts, the Tory former minister for universities and science, has been appointed as the first chair of the Regulatory Innovation Office (RIO), the government has announced. It says the RIO was set up “to cut red tape which unnecessarily impedes on new technologies coming to market and stunts growth, instead pivoting to a streamlined and pro-innovation environment which allows people across the UK to reap the real, positive impact of new tech safely and sooner”.

To mark his appointment, Willetts went to Guy’s hospital in London with Patrick Vallance, the science minister, to see how drones are transforming healthcare. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology says:

Drones are already cutting blood delivery times from 30 minutes to just 2 minutes, speeding up testing turnaround times to improve NHS productivity. British start-up Apian, founded by NHS doctors, works with global drone company Wing to fly blood samples from Guy’s to Synnovis’ lab at St Thomas’ Hospital for urgent testing. This rapid turnaround service supports some of their most vulnerable patients, ensuring they have the best possible care.

Keir Starmer is to host another summit of countries willing to contribute to Ukraine’s defence in the event of a peace deal, No 10 has said.

The PM’s spokesperson said that the next “coalition of the willing” meeting would take place virtually, probably on Saturday. It will build on what was discussed at the in-person meeting Starmer chaired at Lancaster House eight days ago.

Around 20 countries are taking part, No 10 said, mostly from Europe and the Commonwealth.

And tomorrow Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the chief of the defence staff, will also attend a meeting in Paris with fellow military leaders about the proposal.

Starmer and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, have been leading efforts to ensure that, in the event of Ukraine and Russia agreeing a ceasefire, a Europe-led force could be dispatched to Ukraine to help protect it from further Russian aggression. But Starmer says such a force would also need US backup support.

Vladimir Putin’s Russia has expelled one British diplomat and the spouse of another, accusing them of spying, PA Media reports. PA says:

The pair were accused of engaging in intelligence activity under cover of the embassy in Moscow.

They have been ordered to leave the country within two weeks, the Russian news agency Tass said, citing the country’s FSB security agency.

“The Federal Security Service’s counter-intelligence operations exposed the unreported intelligence presence of the United Kingdom under the cover of the country’s embassy in Moscow,” an FSB statement cited by Tass reads.

It is the latest in a series of tit-for-tat expulsions involving the UK’s embassy in Moscow and the Russian mission in London.

Downing Street said the latest expulsions were “what we have come to expect from President Putin and his regime” and “the allegations are no doubt baseless”.

The PM’s spokesman said: “It won’t distract us from our focus on supporting Ukraine and putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position over the days and weeks ahead.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Rights groups on Monday condemned Israel’s decision to cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip. The move Sunday came nine days after Israel halted all aid into Gaza, in an apparent effort to pressure Hamas on negotiations after the first phase of a ceasefire deal expired on March

U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territories Muhannad Hadi said Monday that any further delay in the resumption of “aid will “further reverse any progress we have managed to achieve during the ceasefire.”

Israel has provided almost no electricity to Gaza since the start of the war in October 2023, but the largely symbolic announcement was nevertheless applauded by the far right, which has argued for the near-total elimination of humanitarian aid, fuel and power supplies as Israel pushes for further hostage releases and its other objectives.

After the electricity cut, Gaza’s main functioning desalinization facility, which provides much of the enclave’s safe drinking water, is operating using generators, with capacity reduced by more than 80 percent and fuel reserves for about 10 days if Israel does not permit more fuel deliveries, a senior official for Gaza’s Costal Municipalities Water Utility said on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive details.

Gisha, an Israeli human rights group that aims to protect the freedom of movement for Palestinians, renewed a petition to enable humanitarian access into Gaza, saying there “cannot be any dispute that hermetically closing all goods crossings to Israel constitutes a conscious trampling on Israel’s obligations as a party to the conflict and as an occupying power.”

President Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel to the Qatari capital, Doha, on Tuesday for ceasefire talks, according to a U.S. official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.

David Mencer, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister’s office, said Monday that Israel has accepted an invitation by mediating countries, backed by the United States, to send a delegation to Doha. The delegation left for Qatar on Monday, an Israeli official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.

The talks would mark the Trump administration’s first ceasefire negotiations with representatives or intermediaries of Israel and Hamas.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed that federal immigration authorities arrested Mahmoud Khalil, an activist and former Columbia University graduate student who helped lead negotiations between demonstrators and university officials last spring. He remains detained.

“In support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism, and in coordination with the Department of State, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Mahmoud Khalil,” the department said on X. It said that “Khalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,” without offering further information.

“This is the first arrest of many to come,” President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Monday. “We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it. Many are not students, they are paid agitators. We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country — never to return again.”

He said that ICE “proudly apprehended” Khalil, and that he expects every university in the country to “comply.”

Khalil’s attorney had said Sunday that he was arrested by DHS agents despite having a green card.

Trump has promised to deport international students who participated in “pro-jihadist protests” on college campuses. Columbia was at the center of intense protests that broke out on campuses across the country last year over the Israel-Gaza war. Khalil’s arrest followed the Trump administration saying Friday that it was canceling $400 million in federal contracts and grants to Columbia because university officials had not done enough to prevent antisemitism on campus.

Khalil was stopped by ICE agents who told him his student visa had been revoked, his attorney, Amy E. Greer, said in a written statement. When Khalil told agents that he was a lawful permanent resident, holding a green card, agents detained him anyway, she said.

Greer said she filed a habeas corpus petition on Khalil’s behalf challenging the validity of his arrest and detention. An ICE detainee locator website says Khalil is being held in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Greer was told Sunday morning he was there. But Greer said Khalil’s wife — who is eight months pregnant, a U.S. citizen and had also been threatened with arrest — tried to visit him Sunday and was told he was not there.

Zohran Kwame Mamdani, a New York State Assembly member and candidate for mayor, denounced the arrest as a violation of the First Amendment.

Hundreds of members of Syria’s Alawite minority, including women and children, have been killed in reprisal attacks after clashes between government forces and armed remnants of the previous regime spiraled into widespread sectarian bloodshed, monitoring groups and local officials said Sunday, presenting the most serious challenge to the country’s stability since the fall of the Assad dynasty in December.

Interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former fighter known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani and a Sunni Islamist, called for national unity Sunday as videos of mass executions and bodies piled in the streets of Alawite villages proliferated online. The scale of the violence in recent days was beginning to emerge: At least 624 people were killed, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, which has documented rights violations in Syria since the popular uprising against Assad rule in 2011.

Other local rights monitors reported similar figures, and Alawite community leaders said they expected the toll to climb as more deaths are verified.

JERUSALEM — Israel will open an office under its Defense Ministry to manage the mass displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to other countries, far-right lawmakers said Sunday, as they pitched their mounting effort to depopulate the territory as being closely aligned with President Donald Trump’s own vision to “clean out” and redevelop the enclave.

The formation of the new office, which was not immediately confirmed by the Defense Ministry, would represent a tangible step toward implementing the highly controversial proposal voiced in February by Trump — and cheered on by Israel’s right wing — to remove Gazans, after 15 months of war and intense Israeli bombardment that have left the tiny territory in ruins.

At a public hearing on Sunday in Israel’s Knesset, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the new “Emigration Authority” would be co-led by the Defense Ministry and the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It would receive enough funding to carry out what he envisions as a “massive logistical operation” to find destination countries that will accept and employ Palestinians from Gaza, he said.

More than 2 million people currently live inside the Strip. Smotrich, who visited Washington last week, said he spoke to U.S. officials who backed the plan.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel’s airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel’s founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations’ ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The killings occurred in the heartland of Syria’s Alawite minority, escalating after a nascent insurgency formed against the Sunni Islamist government.

Hundreds of members of Syria’s Alawite minority, including women and children, have been killed in reprisal attacks after clashes between government forces and armed remnants of the previous regime spiraled into widespread sectarian bloodshed,  monitoring groups and local officials said Sunday, presenting the most serious challenge to the country’s stability since the fall of the Assad dynasty in December.

Interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former fighter known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani and a Sunni Islamist, called for national unity Sunday as videos of mass executions and bodies piled in the streets of Alawite villages proliferated online. The scale of the violence in recent days was beginning to emerge: At least 624 people were killed, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, which has documented rights violations in Syria since the popular uprising against Assad rule in 2011.

Other local rights monitors reported similar figures, and Alawite community leaders said they expected the toll to climb as more deaths are verified.

The killings have taken place largely in the coastal provinces of Tartus and Latakia — the heartland of Syria’s Alawites, the minority religious sect to which former president Bashar al-Assad belongs. The violence there escalated after a nascent insurgency, linked in part to former military figures in the Assad regime, staged a wave of attacks on government security forces last week.

But what began as armed skirmishes quickly deteriorated into widespread attacks on civilians as armed groups leftover from the years-long civil war rallied and headed toward the coast.

Residents of the coastal region who spoke to The Washington Post described Sunni militants as roaming house to house, killing occupants in summary executions and pillaging what they could find. Some terrified residents managed to flee to neighboring Lebanon, while others hid  in the mountains,  forests and orchards.

“Entire families were being wiped out,” one doctor working in al-Qadmus, a town perched in the mountains in Tartus province, said of the bloodshed. She fled Sunday morning as the fighting continued. “They entered homes and carried out mass killings of all Alawites,” she said.

The doctor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals, said the majority of the dead appeared to be civilians and that patients were arriving at her hospital with gunshot and shrapnel wounds.

The state has tried to distance itself from the killings, blaming rogue elements and forming a committee to investigate the violence. But witnesses said the gunmen who wrought carnage were indistinguishable from government forces. Some said that foreign fighters appeared to be among them.

The deaths underscore the deep challenges faced by Syria since Assad’s fall. The former president clung to power despite mass protests and an armed insurgency, leading to 14 years of civil war. That period left society with deep sectarian scars, fueled extremism and made Syria a magnate for foreign-born Islamist militants.

Sharaa, who is Syrian and was once affiliated with al-Qaeda, rose through the ranks of insurgents. It was his rebel group, Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham, that led the operation to oust Assad in December. From the outset, he promised that his Islamist government would be inclusive of minorities. But the recent violence raises serious questions about whether he is willing or able to rein in the vast array of armed factions still operating across the country.

“No one will be above the law, and all those whose hands are stained with Syrian blood will face justice — fairly and without delay,” Sharaa said Sunday.

The pace of the violence appeared to have slowed but many were too terrified to return to their villages. One resident of al-Sanobar, a village in Latakia, said that militants arrived Friday morning, made their way to the mayor’s house and shot him and his three sons as their mother watched.

“Imagine your husband and three boys being killed in front of you,” said the resident, who was not there at the time but relayed accounts from his neighbors. He, like others in this report,  declined to be named for fear of reprisals.

The wife and 4-year-old daughter of one of the mayor’s sons was also there. “One of the militants told her to take her gold off and said that otherwise they’d kill her daughter,” the resident said.

He broke down as he recounted the names of  10 more people killed in three other houses belonging to the same extended family. At least 133 people were killed in al-Sanobar alone, he said, providing a list of names of the dead compiled by residents.

In other villages, entire families were killed.

“The killing of civilians in coastal areas in northwest Syria must cease, immediately,” the U.N. commissioner for human rights Volker Turk, said Sunday. He said that his office had received “extremely disturbing reports” of the killing of entire families, including women and children as well as surrendered fighters.

In an earlier address on Sunday, Sharaa described the violence as within the “expected challenges” for Syria in the postwar period. But after the massacres, some Alawites said it is hard for them to see a future in the country.

“As an Alawite, I don’t see I have a future here in Syria,” said one 36-year-old from the coastal town of Jableh, who hid in an abandoned building to escape the killings.

Another resident of the town said his wife and son fled their home Friday after their downstairs neighbor was killed — and that they had called him to tell him not to go home.

“I am still alive, but I don’t know if that will be the case one hour from now or one day from now,” he said.

U.S. arms exports reached 43 percent of the worldwide total as Ukrainian imports skyrocketed following the Russian invasion, according to research by SIPRI.

The war in Ukraine has helped grow U.S. dominance of the global arms industry, according to a study released Sunday. U.S. arms exports between 2020 and 2024 were up by more than a fifth compared with the previous five-year window, reaching 43 percent of the worldwide total.

The United States has averaged 35 percent of global arms exports over the past two decades, making the recent surge unusual, according to estimates from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which published the study.

“The USA is in a unique position when it comes to arms exports,” said Mathew George, director of the arms transfer program at SIPRI. “At 43 percent, its share of global arms exports is more than four times as much as the next-largest exporter, France.”

SIPRI found that Ukraine, which Russia invaded in February 2022, was the largest weapons importer between 2020 and 2024, with its number of imports nearly 100 times greater than they were between 2015 and 2019. Arms imports to European states surged by 155 percent in the same window, fueled by fears of Kremlin expansionism and pressure from the United States to rearm.

The findings come as the Trump administration puts pressure on Ukraine to end the war that began with Russia’s invasion more than three years ago. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that the United States should be repaid for its military aid to Ukraine, much of which comes in the form of military equipment, by way of a proposed deal for U.S. access to Ukraine’s critical minerals.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected Trump’s account of U.S. aid and pointed out that a large share of the $174 billion in U.S. funds appropriated by Congress in response to the war in Ukraine actually went to the U.S. defense industry.

At the same time, Trump has continued to urge countries to buy U.S. arms. As the White House casts doubts on NATO, Bloomberg News reported last month that U.S. officials had urged European allies to buy U.S. weapons to strengthen the alliance.

“Trump was an aggressive arms sales promoter in his first term,” said William D. Hartung, an expert on the arms trade who was not involved in the SIPRI study, adding that Trump had sided with arms contractors even when Saudi agents’ murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi led to calls to halt sales to Riyadh.

“The flip side is that sales are already so high, can he outdo that?” said Hartung, who works at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington think tank that promotes diplomatic engagement over conflict.

The study suggests that military aid to Ukraine has been a boon for U.S. arms producers. Most U.S. weapons sent to Ukraine have come through the presidential drawdown authority, under which the United States sends equipment from its stockpiles, or through another program that uses funding to procure arms directly from U.S. manufacturers.

The study counts weapons sent from stockpiles as exports. European countries also sent aid from their stockpiles, the replenishment of which drove still further demand for U.S. weapons.

The impact of the war in Gaza  on the global arms trade is less distinct in the SIPRI data, which tracks arms deliveries rather than announcements. “There is usually a lag” between the announcement of sales and aid and its delivery, George said.

George added that if the value of U.S. arms exports to Ukraine and Israel were removed from SIPRI’s data, the United States would still have a 37 percent share of global arms exports between 2020 and 2024, making it the largest global exporter.

According to SIPRI data, Russian arms exports have fallen sharply, dropping by 64 percent in the most recent five-year period. Though the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to widespread diplomatic isolation and economic sanctions on Russia, SIPRI found that the decline appeared to predate the war, with historic lows in export volumes in 2020 and 2021.

“Two of Russia’s most important arms-trading relationships had already weakened before 2022, with India increasingly favoring other suppliers, and China sourcing more arms from its own burgeoning arms industry,” said Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher for SIPRI.

The Trump administration has said it hopes for greater military sales to India. Last month, the president told visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi he would make “many billions of dollars” more in sales to India and would consider providing New Delhi with F-35 fighter jets.

Aircraft such as the F-35, America’s most advanced fighter jet, make up the largest category of U.S. arms sales, according to SIPRI, followed by missiles and armored vehicles like main battle tanks.

European nations entered into increased agreements to buy U.S. arms between 2020 and 2024, surpassing the Middle East as their largest regional destination. Some of those orders remain undelivered and would count toward still more growth in the next study window.

But much remains uncertain: U.S. aid to Ukraine is paused. Europe continues to boost defense spending, which could bolster the U.S. arms industry, while it also looks to curb reliance on Washington — which could ultimately mean spending funds elsewhere.

“Maybe some European allies will look inward instead of buying American due to Trump’s statements about and treatment of the alliance thus far,” Hartung said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

China’s decision to impose tariffs of up to 15 percent on products including corn, soybeans and beef starting Monday targets some of the United States’ most important exports to the world’s second-largest economy.

The retaliation against President Donald Trump’s move to raise tariffs on all Chinese goods to at least 20 percent marks another escalation in a mounting trade battle that has no end in sight.

Behind the rapid-fire actions and public bravado, however, Beijing is eager to strike a deal and has been scrambling to find out what Trump wants, whom to speak to and whether it can avert serious damage to its slowing economy.

“There’s just overall confusion about the Trump administration’s real intentions, whether it’s genuinely seeking a deal or simply going to escalate tensions,” said Patricia Kim, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, who has met with visiting Chinese academics looking to understand the new administration. “They want to know what kind of deal Trump is looking for and what his end game is.”

The problem for Beijing is that, under its highly centralized political system, only Chinese leader Xi Jinping could secure a deal to end the tensions.

But — unlike the leaders of Canada and Mexico — Xi has not had a conversation with Trump in his second term. That might be because Xi is unlikely to risk direct negotiations until he is certain of results, Chinese experts said — and Trump’s unpredictability makes that difficult.

China will be looking for “a sense of certainty in the negotiation protocols and concrete projects or deals” before engaging at the top level, said Zha Daojiong, a professor of international political economy at Peking University in Beijing.

“Neither side has really ascertained a go-to person for working-level conversations,” Zha said.

Wang Wentao, the Chinese commerce minister, said last week that he hoped his team could “begin communication as soon as possible” with their U.S. counterparts.

Top Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have had initial calls with their Chinese counterparts.

But Beijing doesn’t appear to have found a direct line to the president, despite searching for what Chinese experts like to call a “new Kissinger.”

This is a stark contrast to the trade war of Trump’s first term, when China tried to reach a deal, in part using a back channel to Trump via his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

In the meantime, Beijing has sent unofficial delegations of academics and experts to Washington to parse Trump’s true priorities when it comes to China.

That’s a sign that reaching a deal is important to Beijing, said Bonnie Glaser, an analyst at the German Marshall Fund in Washington.

“Beijing likely wants to avoid more instability and unpredictability in the U.S.-China relationship that could have unforeseen consequences for Chinese interests,” she said.

In public, Beijing has struck a defiant tone, showing its readiness to match the United States blow for blow.

Monday’s tariffs target the United States’ agriculture sector. China is the largest market for American farm products, importing almost $20 billion in chicken, pork, cotton and the other goods that will be subject to the new tariffs last year, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Beijing also placed export controls and trade restrictions on more than 20 U.S. companies. It moved to restrict imports of gene-sequencing technology from American biotech company Illumina and an investigation into whether an American fiber optics company was skirting Beijing’s earlier anti-dumping measures.

But despite these measures, China has relatively few cards to play given that it runs an enormous trade surplus — approaching $300 billion last year — with the United States.

Complicating matters further, China’s economy is also is struggling. In addition to weak spending and high unemployment, China is experiencing stubborn deflation. Data on Sunday showed consumer prices dropped further in February, falling 0.7 percent from a year earlier.

That worries many on the front lines of the trade war. Numerous Chinese exporters and manufacturers have bet heavily on selling to the United States, building their businesses around the particular needs of American consumers.

Nearly 15 percent of Chinese exports went to the United States last year, according to official customs data. While that was down from just over a fifth in 2018, the United States is still the largest single destination for Chinese products.

Analysts estimate that a major slump in U.S. sales could ripple through the Chinese economy and knock a few percentage points off growth, which has been struggling to meet Beijing’s annual target of about 5 percent.

The impact of the trade war is already being felt on the ground.

Tian Yong, the founder and chief executive of Foodie Pet, a Jinan-based maker of premium dog and cat treats, is bracing for a loss of American customers, who account for about a third of his sales.

Tian is determined not to cut prices. Instead, he plans to weather tariffs by moving faster to release dozens of products every year.

“Our pet culture is not so deep, but when it comes to innovation, the United States is not as good as us,” he said while in the capital this month to sell “grassland rabbit spareribs” and “chicken and orange” flavored chews to middle-class Beijingers.

There are more pet lovers in China today than when Tian started out three decades ago, but the United States remains his top target market.

Alex Zhu, who sells soft toys to major American brands, said the 20 percent duties have all but wiped out profits for his confirmed orders, putting 3,000 employees at risk.

While Zhu’s main concern now is remaining profitable while keeping costs low for American consumers, he fears major buyers will soon decide the political risks of manufacturing in China are too great.

“If the only consideration was cost, we would probably be fine,” he said, adding it would be “dangerous” for his business if U.S. companies give up on Chinese suppliers.

This pressure on exporters — and the wider economy — will make it ever more necessary for Beijing to reach a deal with the Trump administration, analysts say.

It has already offered some olive branches.

On the same day as hitting back against tariffs, Chinese authorities released a white paper claiming that law enforcement agencies were cracking down on the production and shipment of fentanyl-related substances — the main reason Trump says he imposed the tariffs.

That underscores Beijing’s carrots-and-sticks approach, analysts said.

“Of course, we want to make a deal, you know? I mean, we don’t like tariffs. We don’t like trade wars,” said Wu Xinbo, an international relations scholar at Fudan University in Shanghai. “However, if the U.S. wants to impose it on China, then we have to respond.”

Mark Carney, the former governor of two central banks, was elected leader of Canada’s Liberal Party and is poised to replace Justin Trudeau as prime minister.

Mark Carney, the Canadian economist who helped steer two countries through major financial upheaval as the governor of their central banks, was elected leader of Canada’s ruling Liberal Party on Sunday. The 59-year-old is expected to formally replace Justin Trudeau as prime minister in the next week.

Carney will immediately face a crisis brewing along Canada’s southern border: a trade war with the United States, its largest trading partner, that could cripple the economy. President Donald Trump has levied steep tariffs on Canadian goods, which were immediately reciprocated, and has threatened to annex the United States’ northern ally through “economic force.”

Here’s what to know about Canada’s next prime minister.

In his victory speech Sunday, Carney said Canadians are “facing the greatest crisis of our lifetimes” and pitched himself as a direct foil to the U.S. president. “If they succeed, they would destroy our way of life,” he said, referring to Trump and his administration.

To cheers in the Ottawa crowd, Carney outlined plans to maintain the reciprocal tariffs levied by Canada on U.S. goods until Canada is shown respect by its southern neighbor. He also addressed Trump’s threat to turn the nation into a 51st U.S. state: “Canada never, ever will be part of America in any way,” Carney stated. “Americans should make no mistake: In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.”

Drawing on his record as a monetary policy expert, Carney said that although some variables were beyond Canada’s control — such as who occupies the White House — Canada was still master of its own destiny. “I’ve learned a few things from long experience in crises. The first is that ‘plan beats no plan,’” he said, outlining a vision to build millions of homes, make Canada an energy superpower and build new trade corridors “with reliable partners.”

As an elected politician, Carney is a newcomer. His two highest-ranking appointments until Sunday were to nonpolitical roles, which were preceded by a career in investment banking.

Carney has sought to turn this lack of political experience — and his relative distance from Trudeau, who has grown increasingly unpopular among voters — into an advantage, presenting himself as a fresh start with real-world experience. On Sunday, he decried Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre as a “lifelong politician” who has never made a payroll.

That evening, Poilievre tweeted that the Liberal Party was attempting to “trick Canadians into electing them for a fourth term by replacing Trudeau with his economic advisor,” a reference to Carney’s appointment in September to lead a Liberal task force on economic growth.

In between stints at the Bank of Canada, Carney served for three years, starting in 2004, as Canada’s senior associate deputy minister of finance.

He also does not hold a seat in Parliament, which means Carney cannot cast a ballot in parliamentary votes, nor can he participate in Question Period, when government ministers are challenged by lawmakers.

Carney led two of the world’s largest central banks during particularly difficult times, which earned him a reputation as “fixer” that he has wrapped into his pitch to Canadian voters.

In 2008, during the global financial crisis, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, after a brief stint in 2003 as its deputy governor. He quickly implemented monetary measures — including cutting interest rates to almost zero after one month in the job — that analysts said helped stabilize Canada’s economy and led it to recover faster than other major economies.

He left the Bank of Canada in 2013 and took over the Bank of England — the first non-Briton to be appointed to that position. Four years ago, he told the Guardian he hadn’t wanted the job but agreed to take it on because it was a “challenge.”

Though he initially agreed to remain at the Bank of England for five years, Carney stayed until 2020 to help it navigate Britain’s exit from the European Union, otherwise known as Brexit, and the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. He received praise for increasing transparency and being willing to take difficult decisions. But under his stewardship, the bank was accused of giving mixed signals on interest rate hikes, leading a lawmaker to liken it to an “unreliable boyfriend,” a label that stuck in media coverage.

Carney told the Guardian in 2021 that he was proud of “what was accomplished.”

In a Liberal leadership debate last month, Carney referenced his experience leading the Bank of Canada through the aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis.

“Right now … Canada faces one of the most serious crises in our history,” he said. “To get through it, we will need to build a strong economy, and that requires big changes. … I can bring that change. I know how to manage crises. I know how to build strong economies.”

In 2020, Carney became the United Nations’ special envoy on climate action and finance.

Carney received a bachelor’s degree in economics from Harvard University in 1988. He later attended Oxford University in England, receiving a master’s degree in economics in 1993 and a doctorate in economics in 1995. While at Oxford, Carney was goalkeeper and co-captain of the men’s ice hockey team, where he met his British wife, Diana Fox, who played on the women’s team. Fox is an economist who has previously worked for the British government. They have four children.

Carney had a 13-year career in investment banking at Goldman Sachs that began in 1988, when he joined the bank as an analyst in London and later in Tokyo. After Oxford, he rejoined Goldman Sachs and worked there until 2003 in various roles, including executive director for debt capital markets and vice president for corporate finance in the New York office. He eventually moved to the bank’s Toronto office, where he was appointed managing director in 2002.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22world%20news%22%20site%3Awashingtonpost.com,Cargo ship and tanker filled with jet fuel collide off English coast,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/10/tanker-collision-english-coast/,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 17:59:29 GMT","

The collision has raised fears of an explosion or environmental catastrophe, with rescue teams racing to the scene.

LONDON — Rescue teams raced to the aid of two cargo vessels that collided Monday in the North Sea off the east coast of England, sparking fires aboard both ships — an oil tanker and a container vessel, British officials said. The incident forced at least some crew members to abandon ship.

More than 40 crew members were taken ashore at the nearby Port of Grimsby, and both ships’ full rosters were accounted for after several hours, a local official told reporters. One crew member was reported hospitalized.

But officials cautioned that the situation remained unstable, as fears of an explosion or environmental disaster, or both, ran high. Video showed plumes of black smoke and orange flames coming from both ships.

The British coast guard mounted a major rescue operation, with  helicopters, planes, lifeboats and firefighting vessels from nearby bases. A pop-up flotilla of private and commercial craft in the area also responded, some reportedly picking up crew members and transporting them to shore.

The 600-foot tanker is the U.S.-flagged Stena Immaculate, a ship that sometimes transports materials for the U.S. military. The other vessel is the Solong, a Portuguese-registered container ship.

The American tanker, having traveled from Greece, was anchored just off the Yorkshire port city of Hull at the time of the collision, according to maritime traffic sites. The Solong was heading south from a Scottish port toward Rotterdam when it struck the stationary tanker, according to an analysis by Marinetraffic.com.

Mayday calls were reported shortly before 10 a.m. local time, the coast guard said. Some residents reported seeing a “massive fireball” after the collision, said Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East.

British Transport Minister Heidi Alexander said on X that her office was monitoring the situation and in touch with the coast guard.

The Stena Immaculate’s joint owner, Crowley Logistics, based in Jacksonville, Florida, said in a statement that the ship was carrying jet fuel. The coast guard said it was preparing for the strong possibility of a spill.

“The incident remains ongoing and an assessment of the likely counter pollution response required is being enacted,” the coast guard said in statement.

Officials in Hull said they are bracing for a possible environmental catastrophe if the tanker explodes or founders in the sensitive coastal waters where the ship was burning. The ship had been at anchor in the Humber estuary, near the approach to the port.

Hull City Council leader Mike Ross told the BBC that any significant spill could be “devastating.”

Greenpeace UK said in a statement that it was too early to determine the extent of the spill and that weather, currents and then amount of material spilled would determined how serious the damage would be. But the group cautioned that “the high speed of the collision and the footage of the aftermath are cause for great concern.”

The Stena Immaculate is one of a small group of tankers that remain on standby to transport fuel for the U.S. military during times of emergency.

The collision occurred in a crowded shipping area under conditions that were moderate but foggy, local officials said. The cause of the accident remains unclear. British officials said investigators were on their way to the scene.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with Ukrainian officials for the first time since the Oval Office blow-up between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky.

The Trump administration may resume U.S. military and intelligence support for Ukraine if its leaders commit to a peace process during a high stakes meeting Tuesday in Saudi Arabi, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters.

Rubio said the initial suspension of aid “came about because we felt the Ukrainians were not committed” to negotiations to end the three-year war to repel Russia’s invasion, but if that changes, U.S. policy will probably change too, he said Monday as he landed in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah.

“My hope is we’ll have a really good meeting tomorrow and be in a different place,” he added.

Rubio’s meeting will be his first with senior Ukrainian officials since the Oval Office blow up between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that resulted in the aid being cut off.

The decision stunned Ukrainian officials and alarmed U.S. allies in Europe who are desperately hoping for the talks to restore U.S.-Ukrainian relations as a wave of Russian attacks has continued to hit government and residential buildings across Ukraine.

Ahead of Rubio’s arrival in Jeddah, U.S. officials said they were pleased at the high-level delegation Zelensky chose to send. “The fact that they’re coming here at senior levels is a good indication to us that they want to sit down, and they’re ready to move forward,” a senior State Department official said on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive talks.

The Ukrainian delegation will be led by Zelensky’s top aide, Andriy Yermak, alongside Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa. Rubio will be joined by White House national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff.

Zelensky will not attend the meeting but will be in Saudi Arabia to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh.

“These are separate events,” a Ukrainian official told The Washington Post.

“We hope for results — both in bringing peace closer and in continuing support,” Zelensky said in a video address late Sunday.

Zelensky is under extraordinary pressure to placate the Trump administration and demonstrate support for the president’s diplomatic drive despite his unanswered push for a U.S. security guarantee that would deter Russia from reinvading Ukraine.

Trump has insisted that the United States be repaid for the more than $100 billion it has spent in its support for Kyiv since Russia invaded more than three years ago. To that end, Kyiv and Washington are negotiating a deal that would provide the United States access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine that U.S. officials say will provide a type of security guarantee for Ukraine given the presence of U.S. businesspeople — an arrangement many Ukrainian officials view as insufficient.

The Trump administration has ruled out allowing Ukraine into NATO, viewing that as placing new burdens on the United States and obviating a path to peace with Moscow.

Rubio emphasized that the conflict in Ukraine has calcified into a war of attrition and that neither Russia nor Ukraine can prevail militarily. He said both sides would have to accept concessions but that the first objective for U.S. officials was understanding Ukraine’s position.

“The most important thing that we have to leave here with is a strong sense that Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things — like the Russians will have to do difficult things — to end this conflict,” he said.

Rubio said the mineral deal was not a core focus of the meetings in Saudi Arabia, but emphasized that “it’s certainly a deal the president wants to see done … doesn’t necessarily have to be done tomorrow.”

Ukrainian officials have bristled at the way the Trump administration has handled the negotiations, in particular by excluding them from the initial talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia.

Trump, who called Zelensky a “dictator” who was ungrateful for U.S. support, has softened his tone in recent days.

On Sunday, when asked whether he would consider lifting the intelligence pause, Trump said “we just about have. I mean, we really just about have, and we want to do anything we can to get Ukraine to be serious about getting something done.”

Among the types of intelligence that have been suspended is the provision of satellite imagery services used by Ukrainian artillery and drone units to assess quality targets and keep tabs on Russian positions and depots.

Rubio clarified that the Ukrainians are “already receiving defensive intelligence information as we speak.”

The United States also stopped the transfer of any of the $3.85 billion in remaining military equipment available for Ukraine as well as halted the delivery of weapons already in transit after having been approved by the Biden administration.

“The pause in aid broadly is something I hope we can resolve, obviously what happens tomorrow will be key to that,” Rubio added.

The latest: The Ukrainian military has launched a long-anticipated counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces, opening a crucial phase in the war aimed at restoring Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and preserving Western support in its fight against Moscow.

The fight: Ukrainian troops have  intensified their attacks on the front line in the southeast region, according to multiple individuals in the country’s armed forces, in a significant push toward Russian-occupied territory.

The front line: The Washington Post has mapped out the 600-mile front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces.

Over the weekend, Russian forces pushed hard against the territory controlled by Ukraine in Kursk, but troops are still holding on.

KYIV — Ukrainian forces battled to stave off fierce Russian attacks both inside Russia and along Ukraine’s front lines, as the country’s officials prepared Monday for high-stakes talks in Saudi Arabia with an increasingly skeptical ally, the United States.

Ukraine hopes the talks, set to begin Tuesday, will restore relations after a bruising week in which President Donald Trump paused the provision of military aid and intelligence sharing vital for Kyiv to repel Russian attacks. After Russian advances in the Kursk region, where Ukrainians hold a sliver of Russian territory, the Ukrainian military said the situation was stabilizing.

Ukrainian officials will seek to convince the U.S. delegation that they are ready for a swift end to the war, and are set to present a case for a partial ceasefire after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week he would push for a ban on long-range drone and missile attacks as well as on military operations in the Black Sea.

Trump appeared to indicate a softening of the pressure on Zelensky’s country when he told reporters late Sunday that the United States had “just about” ended a suspension of intelligence-sharing with Kyiv and said he expected good results from the talks.

But a senior State Department official told reporters traveling on Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s plane to the Saudi talks that there were no assurances on resuming military or intelligence support to Kyiv.

The Ukrainian delegation will be led by Zelensky’s top aide, Andriy Yermak. Zelensky will not attend the meeting but will be in Saudi Arabia on a separate trip.

In a video address late Sunday, Zelensky said, “We hope for results — both in bringing peace closer and in continuing support.”

U.K.’s prime minister Keir Starmer said he had spoken with Trump ahead of the U.S.-Ukraine talks and said he hoped for a positive outcome to the talks that would enable U.S. aid and intelligence sharing to be restarted. UK officials had been speaking to their Ukrainian counterparts over the weekend, and they remain committed to a lasting peace, he said.

Zelensky is under pressure to support Trump’s diplomatic drive to bring a quick end to the war despite the lack of any promises for U.S. security guarantees to prevent new Russian incursions into Ukraine.

Officials in Kyiv are still smarting from last week’s sudden pulling of military support, which left many in Ukraine feeling betrayed and leaders across Europe questioning the future of the transatlantic alliance.

The situation “is fragile, and it’s based on things that often we don’t understand at all. I don’t want to make any forecasts anymore because it is completely unpredictable,” said one Ukrainian official.

“Tomorrow’s meeting will be very important for Ukraine,” said another senior Ukrainian official, adding that he expected the situation to still change many times. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive situation.

The senior official warned that last week’s decision to pause military aid could open the way for Russian propaganda to convince Ukrainians that they had fought — and died — for empty promises from the West, allowing Russia to potentially make political inroads to destabilize the government.

“People will ask for what did we pay a huge price, what was the reason for this: So that one day the Americans said thank you, it was a proxy war?” he said. Russian propaganda will attempt to say “you died not for your interests but for the interests of Uncle Sam. And after this Uncle Sam betrayed you. Believe me, we will have enough politicians who will repeat it.”

The pausing of large portions of intelligence sharing appeared to have had an immediate effect on the battlefield. Russian forces advanced on Friday in Russia’s Kursk region, seeking to encircle Ukrainian troops and cut off supply lines.

By Monday, however, the situation appeared to be stabilizing after Ukraine sent reinforcements and was mostly able to repel a daring attempt by Russian forces on Saturday to break into Ukraine’s strategic stronghold in the town of Sudzha by crawling through a gas pipeline.

A spokesman for the army, Dmytro Likhovy, said Ukrainian forces had been able to “destroy” most of the Russian attack force by blowing up a segment of the pipeline, but added that the situation on the front line was still “dynamic.”

Russian ground forces from the Kursk region were making repeated attempts to cross Ukraine’s northeastern border in small groups, in a relentless effort to try to encircle Ukrainian forces, Likhovy said.

“This is how they are managing to build up a presence,” he said. Ukraine’s commander in chief Oleksandr Syrskyi on Monday said that Ukrainian units were not currently under threat of encirclement.

“The situation is difficult because they control the logistics routes,” said a Ukrainian fighter from the 82nd Brigade, who goes by the call sign Krim. Under military rules, soldiers typically speak on the condition that they’re identified only by call sign or first name. “They attempt meat grinder assaults.”

The soldier said the events of recent weeks had left him feeling “like we’re in some kind of surreal TV show rather than reality” adding that it was “obvious that Trump is on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s side and will pressure us.”

Current and former Ukrainian officials said the withdrawal of U.S. support last week could affect future trust in the United States across Europe, as well as morale among the Ukrainian armed forces. “If things go the way they’re going, it is very serious damage to American soft power,” said Oleh Rybachuk, former chief of staff to ex-president Viktor Yushchenko, one of the leaders of the Orange Revolution in which Ukraine first sought to break free from Moscow’s orbit 20 years ago.

The U.S. pause in military assistance also impacted the provision of satellite imagery services, affecting commercial providers such as Maxar that had signed contracts with Ukraine.

Rybachuk said the decision would undermine trust in U.S. weaponry and technology. “Can you imagine the shock of the Europeans who realized that if this is how Ukraine is being treated, that this could happen to them. They have all purchased trillions of dollars worth of U.S. equipment and now they are not sure if that equipment will work.”

Russia has intensified its efforts to retake Ukraine’s sliver of Kursk in recent weeks, sending in elite units of paratroopers and marines, as well as several thousand reinforcements of now battle-hardened North Korean soldiers who began fighting in Kursk last autumn.

According to estimates by military experts, Russia has retaken about half of the territory it lost last summer. Britain’s Defense Ministry said Monday that Ukrainian forces probably maintain control of about 115 square miles (300 square kilometers) of Kursk.

Likhovy said Russian and North Korean forces now far outnumber Ukrainian troops in Kursk. But the change in focus meant Russia was now losing ground in Pokrovsk in the east, he said. “They are sending new forces, and possibly because of this they have reduced pressure in Pokrovsk in Donetsk,” he said. “There, we have been able to stabilize the situation and in some places restore control over territories we lost before.”

Andriy, a drone unit commander operating in Kursk, told The Washington Post that the Ukrainian troop withdrawal from some parts of Kursk was to preserve personnel. He said the troops there had yet to feel the impact of the suspension of American military support.

“The Russians are pressing from all directions now — it’s tough, but we are holding on gradually,” he said.

Numerous rivers are still in major flood stage, and there’s widespread beach erosion.

Cyclone Alfred struck the east coast of Australia late Friday, unleashing strong winds, rough surf and dangerous rip currents along popular beaches over the weekend. An estimated 10 to 15 inches fell around Brisbane and on Moreton Island during the storm.

Widespread beach erosion and coastal wind damage affected parts of Queensland and New South Wales, while inland areas also felt the effects of heavy rain and freshwater flooding. In addition to the 15 inches in those areas, northeastern New South Wales also saw heavy rain, with 4 to 10 inches from Newcastle to the Queensland border. Sydney only saw an inch or two in most of its suburbs.

Meanwhile, nearly 5 inches of rainfall was recorded in a single hour at Cracow in New South Wales between 6:22 p.m. and 7:22 p.m. on Monday evening. In Pine Hills, 2 inches was recorded, and the Durah Homestead Alert saw 3 inches in two hours during the afternoon.

Before Alfred formed, the instigating system initially formed northeast of Australia over the Coral Sea on Feb. 20. It was upgraded to a tropical storm two days later, and began quickly intensifying. On Feb. 27, the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded Alfred to a Category 4-equivalent cyclone with winds of up to 130 mph at its core. The system was still offshore but exhibited a pinhole eye on satellite.

Alfred lingered offshore for another week and a half before weakening and making landfall on Moreton Island, South East Queensland, late Friday evening. Moreton Island is just east of Brisbane. A named storm hasn’t passed this close to Brisbane — the country’s third-largest city, with 2.7 million people — since Zoe in 1974.

Winds were estimated at 45 mph, meaning the system was the equivalent of a low-end tropical storm. Still, the slow-moving nature of the storm caused serious erosion.

Tropical cyclones (and all low-pressure systems) spin clockwise in the southern hemisphere, so the heaviest rain totals — associated with onshore flow — hit south of the storm’s center.

Meanwhile, scattered strong to severe thunderstorms continue to affect Australia; most of Queensland was under a severe thunderstorm warning Monday evening local time.

The Bureau of Meteorology warned of additional “major flood warnings” in effect for the following rivers:","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

“Samara” was 19 when an online conversation led her into the nightmare of human trafficking. Her story is a common one for many Romanian nationals, who are among the most trafficked EU citizens, primarily for sexual exploitation. In 2024, Romania passed several new laws aimed at cracking down on traffickers and protecting victims, marking a critical step forward. Samara’s trafficker is now behind bars — but the fight to end trafficking is still far from over.

George Washington law professor and Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss courts blocking President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's DOGE cuts as Democrats celebrate.

The onslaught of legal challenges to President Donald Trump's early actions brought by federal workers and advocacy groups have found their way into mostly friendly courts, overseen, for the most part, by sympathetic judges.

These plaintiffs have employed a well-known, pervasive strategy used by both sides of the political aisle, known as forum or ""judge shopping""– that is, to have a case tried in a certain district court, and one that falls under the jurisdiction of a U.S. appeals court with a certain political makeup.

This strategy serves a distinct legal purpose. While the Supreme Court is the nation’s highest court, most cases don't make it there. That’s because the Supreme Court hears an average of less than 100 cases annually, according to federal judiciary data. In contrast, the 13 U.S. appeals courts handle an average of more than 50,000 cases per year – meaning that these courts often get to rule on the most pressing legal issues.

And while plaintiffs suing the federal government used to have to establish a local, geographic connection to the district where they were filing their lawsuit, Congress broadly moved to lift that requirement more than 30 years ago – allowing the practice to quickly gain prominence. 

As president, Trump ""is exercising Article II power to take care that our federal laws are faithfully executed,"" Mike Davis, the founder and president of the Article III Project, or A3P, told Fox News Digital in an interview.

""That's his constitutional duty. And that includes weeding out waste, fraud and abuse. That’s what he's doing with Elon Musk and with DOGE,"" said Davis, a former Supreme Court clerk for Justice Neil Gorsuch.

But recent years have seen a wave of new efforts to reform the system and stop the process of ""judge shopping,"" with detractors pointing to a spate of recent examples where cases were filed specifically in certain districts in an effort to yield more favorable outcomes.

It's a strategy both Republican and Democrat plaintiffs have used with increasing regularity. Most recently, groups of Democratic-led plaintiffs filed three separate court challenges to Trump's executive order seeking to ban birthright citizenship within the jurisdiction of the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals, or the Boston-based appeals court whose bench is composed primarily of Democratic-appointed judges.  

Other groups seeking to overturn Trump's early actions have focused on courts within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has a reputation for liberal decisions. 

Judges on that bench moved unanimously to block the Trump administration's birthright citizenship order from taking force, leaving in place the decision of a Seattle district court, and potentially kicking the matter to the Supreme Court for consideration.

Other notable examples include a wave of anti-abortion cases filed in the rural Texas town of Amarillo, where the sole federal judge, Matthew Kacsmaryk, is known for his anti-abortion beliefs and for siding on behalf of pro-life groups. (Texas is also under the jurisdiction of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, where 75% of the 26 judges on the bench are Republican-appointed.)

Kacsmaryk’s attempt to ban the abortion pill, mifepristone, in 2023 was upheld but narrowed by the Fifth Circuit Court. It was later dismissed completely by the Supreme Court, which noted that the plaintiffs in the case lacked proper standing. 

Still, judicial reform advocates have pointed to this case – and many others – as evidence of the lengths individuals will go to in an attempt to reshape the federal policy landscape by way of case law and legal precedent.

""Allowing plaintiffs to pick their judge is contrary to the bedrock federal court principle of randomly assigning cases to judges through an electronic version of drawing names from a hat,"" Russell Wheeler, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Governance Studies program, wrote in an op-ed.

Davis, for his part, told Fox News that his organization, A3P, is currently working with the Senate Judiciary Committee to draft legislation to end the flurry of temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions that have come before single judges.

""The legislation will require a three-judge panel randomly assigned from around the country; a lottery system"" to hear various cases and prevent the uptick in forum shopping, Davis said. Federal judiciary leaders and members of Congress have also introduced efforts within the last year aimed at stopping or curtailing the pervasiveness of judge-shopping.

Senate Democrats introduced a bill last spring that would require cases to be randomly assigned within a federal court district, though it has failed to gain traction in the rest of Congress. 

Last March, the U.S. Judicial Conference, the body that sets policy for the federal courts, issued fresh guidance urging courts to assign certain high-profile cases at random in a bid to stop judge shopping and restore public trust in the court system.

""The random case-assignment policy deters judge-shopping and the assignment of cases based on the perceived merits or abilities of a particular judge,"" Judge Robert J. Conrad, the U.S. Judicial Conference secretary, said in a statement at the time.

Rather, he said, the feature ""promotes the impartiality of proceedings and bolsters public confidence in the federal Judiciary.""

Ontario, Canada's most populous province, is adding a 25% surcharge to all electricity exports sent to the U.S. as part of retaliation against the Trump administration's tariffs on Canadian products.

The 25% surcharge will be effective as of March 10, and will affect consumers and businesses in Michigan, Minnesota and New York, the province said in a Monday statement. The new fee will add as much as $400,000 Canadian dollars ($277,000) in daily costs for 1.5 million U.S. homes and businesses, it added.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford estimated it will add about CA$100, or $69 a month, to the bills of each American affected.

On March 8, Ford told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe that President Trump's tariff plan was creating ""mass chaos,"" and added that a trade war between the U.S. and Canada was ""unacceptable."" During the interview, he also said that while he has a great relationship with the governments of Michigan, Minnesota and New York, he planned to impose a 25% surcharge on energy products starting March 10 unless the trade dispute came to an end.

""President Trump's tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They're making life more expensive for American families and businesses,"" Premier Doug Ford said in Monday's statement. ""Until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario won't back down. We'll stand strong, use every tool in our toolkit and do whatever it takes to protect Ontario.""

On Monday, the Michigan Public Service Commission said it was concerned about the surcharge, ""including both pricing and reliability concerns.""

""While the vast majority of Michigan's electricity is either produced by the electric utilities or purchased under long-term power contracts, the imposition of these tariffs could have some impact on prices in the regional energy markets, though the ultimate impact on Michigan customers is likely to be small,"" the regulatory agency said in a statement. 

Mr. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico went into effect last week, although on Thursday he said he would delay the levies by one month, until April 2. On Monday, Ford said Ontario's electricity surcharge would remain in place despite the one-month reprieve from Trump, noting a one-month pause means nothing but more uncertainty.

On March 8, Ford told CBS News that Mr. Trump has declared ""an economic war on his closest friends.""

Ford's office said the new market rules require any generator selling electricity to the U.S. to add a 25% surcharge. Ontario's government expects it to generate revenue of CA$300,000 ($208,000) to CA$400,000 ($277,000) per day, ""which will be used to support Ontario workers, families and businesses.""

The new surcharge is in addition to Canada's initial CA$30 billion's ($21 billion's) worth of retaliatory tariffs have been applied on items like American orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, appliances, footwear, cosmetics, motorcycles and certain pulp and paper products.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it is reinstating a plan to recover 100% of overpayments to beneficiaries, a policy the agency abandoned last year after an outcry over cases in which the practice led some Americans to receive shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars.  

In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The agency is required by law to claw back overpaid benefits.

Because of public backlash over the 100% recovery policy, the agency last year had capped the withholding rate for someone who had been overpaid at 10% of the person's monthly benefit. On Friday, the SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments, while the withholding rate for people with overpayments before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.

""People who are overpaid after March 27 will automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,"" the agency said.

The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. In some cases, the bills were for tens of thousands of dollars. If beneficiaries were unable to immediately pay the bill, the agency could dock their entire monthly Social Security payment, leaving some people financially destitute, as reported by ""60 Minutes,"" KFF Health News and other media outlets,

In many cases, the overpayments were the fault of SSA. A 2022 report by the agency's inspector general found that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of ""effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.""

In the agency's new statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said it is the agency's ""duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding.""

He added, ""We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people.""

Raising the clawback rate to 100% from its current 10% will increase the amount of recovered funds by $7 billion over the next decade, the agency said. SSA pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year. 

The revised policy will lead to financial hardships for many people faced with Social Security overpayments, according to the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare. 

""This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices — usually through no fault of their own,"" a spokesperson for the advocacy group said in a statement. ""Many overpayments are the result of errors on SSA's part.""

Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, noted the advocacy group supports the government recouping improper overpayments, but said an immediate 100% cut in benefits would take a toll on older Americans. 

""The 'clawback' of payments is especially unfair to seniors who do not have external support to help manage their finances and track their benefits,"" she told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. ""Many beneficiaries may not be aware of an overpayment and could suddenly find themselves without a check.""

The reversal comes as the Social Security Administration is undergoing widespread job cuts and a reorganization under the Trump administration. With its staff already at a 50-year low, employees at the agency have told CBS News that the cuts could disrupt or delay services, including customer service delays and longer waits to qualify for some benefits.

While on the campaign trail, President Trump vowed not to touch Social Security, a promise he repeated Sunday on Fox News, although he added that his administration wants to root out ""fraud"" from the benefit system. 

""I'm not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we're going to get fraud out of there,"" he said. ""We have people 250 years old and all, you know, tremendous fraud,"" he added, referring to a false claim that people who are beyond the human lifespan are receiving benefits.""

The cuts to Social Security's workforce could mean that more beneficiaries are subject to overpayment errors, the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare said in the statement. 

""Trump's SSA also is closing field offices across the country, meaning beneficiaries will have to wait longer and possibly travel farther to resolve their overpayment cases,"" the group said.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22national%20news%22%20site%3Anews.yahoo.com,"Neo-Nazi killers freed, child attackers given bail: Scenes from Canada’s broken justice system",https://ca.news.yahoo.com/neo-nazi-killers-freed-child-111431308.html,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:14:31 GMT","

Late last month, a six-year-old boy waiting for a bus in Halifax was attacked and stabbed repeatedly in a completely random assault committed in broad daylight. The suspect, 19-year-old Elliott Chorny, was described by her own mother in a Facebook post as a “severely unwell person” whose family had tried for years to put her in treatment or custody in a bid “to try and protect the community.”

Chorny was also free despite having just been charged with another allegedly violent assault, against a psychiatrist at a Halifax day hospital.

Although the Halifax stabbing became national news, its details are far from atypical. It seems like every week in Canada yields a violent crime committed by a suspect who could conceivably have been in custody. The system also routinely releases violent offenders despite a high likelihood that they will harm more victims.

Below is just a cursory sample of such cases. To give a sense of how often this occurs, all of these are just from the last six weeks. And the list is far from comprehensive.

Freedom for a neo-Nazi who stomped a random handicapped man to death

In 2010, 47-year-old Calgary man Mark Mariani paused briefly in an alleyway to empty his colostomy bag; a consequence of his Crohn’s disease. This caught the attention of two white supremacists who were spraying graffiti nearby. They were members of the group Western European Bloodline, and had multiple neo-Nazi face and neck tattoos. Without provocation, both of them proceeded to fatally kick and stomp Mariani; the brutally beaten man was able only to crawl to his car before dying.

Just 15 years later, one of those white supremacists, Robert Reitmeier, has been granted unescorted absences from William Head Institution, a Victoria-area minimum security prison compound often described as one of the country’s most comfortable. It’s the same prison where, in 2019, two inmates were able to easily escape the prison by walking around its fence. They proceeded to murder a nearby homeowner.

 

Immediate bail for an Albertan who allegedly attacked his two children with a knife

This case received a mention from Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who described it in a social media post as “a sicko who attacked two children with a knife has been released back out on bail thanks to Liberal catch-and-release laws.”

Many of the details of the case have been sealed by a publication ban in order to protect the identity of the victims, who are the young children of the accused. But an eight-year-old and a seven-year-old in Grande Prairie, Alta., were attacked by a knife – the former suffering a severed esophagus.

With one of the children still in hospital, their alleged attacker was released on bail and was reportedly back to uploading video game livestreams within two days of the assault.

Court rules that jail for man who bludgeoned ex to death is “cruel and unusual punishment”

This is a bit different from the other cases on this list in that the violent offender remains in custody. But in a late January decision, B.C. Supreme Court justice David Crossin ruled that it’s “cruel and unusual” punishment to expect first degree murderers to serve 25 years in jail before obtaining parole.

The case surrounded Luciano Mariani, who broke into the Vancouver Island home of his ex-girlfriend in 2021 and – in a meticulously pre-planned attack – bludgeoned her to death with a baseball bat.

Crossin ruled that since a mass-murderer would also serve a 25-year sentence, it was unfair to expect the same of someone who had only killed one person. Of course, mass-murderers used to serve longer sentences; 25 years for every person they killed. But this was slapped down by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2022 on the grounds that it constituted “cruel and unusual punishment.”

Bail for suspect in a vicious near-fatal group attack of a young woman

Last September, a trio of quad riders outside Westlock, Alta., were suddenly approached by a severely bloodied woman screaming for help. In a scene the riders would compare to a “horror movie,” the woman had shredded clothes, puncture wounds all across her back, and a laceration at the back of her neck that was several inches wide.

Police believe that four boys, all under the age of 18, had taken the woman into the woods, stabbed her repeatedly and left her for dead. On Jan. 23, one of those accused boys was granted bail, despite pleas from the prosecution that he was a flight risk and was likely to reoffend.

Released child attacker charged with new attacks on children

Starting in mid-February, multiple children in Toronto’s west end reported near-identical encounters of a strange man tapping them on the shoulder before telling them to “accompany him to an unknown location.” In three instances, children escaped the man by screaming to attract attention and then either pushing him or running in the opposite direction.

The accused in these incidents is 34. When Petrini was 18, he snatched a nine-year-old boy off the street in Brampton, Ont., under circumstances very similar to those described above. The boy was then subjected to six hours of sexual assault, including repeated anal and oral rape.

Freed just eight years after the crime, Petrini has repeatedly violated the terms of his supervision order, including being found in the possession of a phone containing cartoons of children being orally penetrated. In one Parole Board review, it was determined “that no appropriate program of supervision can be established that would adequately protect society from the risk of your reoffending.”

Regardless of the number of violations, Petrini has continued to obtain release; each one being accompanied by a police warning that he is likely to seek out new victims.

Bail for a man accused of attacking and sexually assaulting strangers

Leikeze Cheruiyot, 22, is accused of two particularly horrifying sex assaults that occurred in the Hamilton area between 2022 and 2023.

In July 2022, he is accused of ambushing a woman who was out for a walk on a forest trail, binding her wrists and sexually assaulting her until the attack was interrupted by a passerby. A year later, in August 2023, he is accused of breaking into the home of a sleeping 74-year-old woman and sexually assaulting her for an hour.

Cheruiyot was given bail on Feb. 10. Only after the Crown brought a bail review to the Superior Court of Justice was it revoked 17 days later.

Notorious child rapist and “dangerous offender” granted unescorted leave from prison

Corey Newton was convicted for sexually assaulting 11 children in the Niagara Region between 1996 and 2002 – although he has admitted he had as many as 30 victims. He targeted boys between the age of 8 and 14, and specifically sought out children from dysfunctional families – entering into relationships with single mothers for the singular purpose of abusing their sons.

To psychiatrists, Newton showed no remorse, and accused the justice system of trying to “screw me over.” For all this, Newton was declared a “dangerous offender” in 2006, a rare status that is often incorrectly understood to impose a permanent prison sentence.

This month, a CBC story reported that Newton has been repeatedly given unescorted absences out of prison. As per Correctional Service of Canada protocol, the public has not been informed of the absences, or even told where they’re happening.

Another dangerous offender granted community release

Child sex offender Harvey Venus, 38,  also a dangerous offender, is considered a “very high risk to reoffend” and has a history of obtaining release only to swiftly violate his release conditions. His record also contains instances of him completing a sentence for a child sex assault, only to be arrested and charged for another child sex assault.

One of his first crimes was committed at age 19, when he broke into the home of a 14-year-old girl and tried to cut off her clothes with scissors as she slept. One of his most recent involved dating a single mother in order to gain access to her 16-year-old daughter – Venus needed only to go by an alias to conceal his history of sex crimes.

In late February, despite his dangerous offender status, Venus was granted another round of leave privileges, with a Parole Board of Canada document saying it would give him “an opportunity to reconnect with community and pro-social peers in a controlled manner so as not to jeopardize public safety.”

Representatives of the business travel and global tourism industry have joined calls for Heathrow Airport to alter its regulatory model ahead of any expansion.

The Business Travel Association (BTA), The Advantage Travel Partnership and World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) on Monday announced their support for change at the UK’s busiest hub, adding to a growing list of aggravated parties.

A group comprised of Heathrow’s biggest airlines in February submitted their objections to the UK aviation regulator.

They argue the airport’s monopolistic structure has led to expensive landing charges, inadequate investment in infrastructure and a subpar passenger experience.

The Heathrow Reimagined campaign has gathered momentum since the Labour government confirmed its backing for a third runway at Heathrow. 

Concerns have been fuelled by the possibility that airlines could be forced to face the cost of expansion despite already being subject to some of the highest landing charges in the world.

The campaign estimates passengers and airlines are paying £1.1bn more each year than if charges were in line with equivalent European airports.

“We need a clear and fair cost strategy that protects all travellers, especially those travelling for business and are already balancing increased operational overheads,” Clive Wratten, BTA’s chief executive officer, said in a statement.

Julia Lo Bue-Said, Chief Executive Officer of The Advantage Travel Partnership, said Heathrow’s passenger experience “certainly does not” live up to its expensive cost.

“As we continue to see a cost of living crisis in the UK, passengers shouldn’t be paying a penny more than is necessary.

“We would welcome regulatory intervention so we can better understand why our customers pay so much more to use Heathrow than any other airport globally. This is more important now than ever, as the costs associated with a third runway could potentially extrapolate these high charges even further.”

The Board of Airline Representatives (BAR), which represents overseas airlines operating from the UK, also added its voice to the calls on Monday.

 “As the UK industry body representing the majority of airlines operating to the UK we are supporting the Heathrow Reimagined campaign, as we believe it is crucial for the UK to have a world class global hub airport that is able to deliver not only good connectivity, but also excellent value,” chief executive Michael Smeeth said.

“This is crucial to ensure that the biggest benefits to consumers, businesses, and the UK economy are delivered.”

Heathrow did not comment when approached. However, insiders at the airport agree that adjustments to the regulatory model are needed for a third runway. Heathrow is currently working with airlines and ministers to determine what regulatory adjustments would look like.

Deribit-listed bitcoin (BTC) futures set to expire this Friday now trade marginally below the exchange’s index price, flashing a discount in a sign of weak demand for the cryptocurrency.

“What we have seen is that near-tenor (7d and shorter) yields have dipped to the negative for the first time in over a year,” Andrew Melville, a research analyst at Block Scholes told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “This means that futures prices are trading below spot, which we take as a significantly bearish indicator.”

If you receive more Social Security benefits than you are owed, you may face a 100% default withholding rate from your monthly checks once a new policy goes into effect.

The change announced last week by the Social Security Administration marks a reversal from a 10% default withholding rate that was put in place last year after some beneficiaries received letters demanding immediate repayments for sums that were sometimes tens of thousands of dollars.

The discrepancy — called overpayments — happens when Social Security beneficiaries receive more money than they are owed.

The erroneous payment amounts may occur when beneficiaries fail to report to the Social Security Administration changes in their circumstances that may affect their benefits, according to a 2024 Congressional Research Service report. Overpayments can also happen if the agency does not process the information promptly or due to errors in the way data was entered, how a policy was applied or in the administrative process, according to the report.

The Social Security Administration paid about $6.5 billion in retirement and disability benefit overpayments in fiscal year 2022, which represents 0.5% of total benefits paid, the Congressional Research Service said in its 2024 report. The agency also paid about $4.6 billion in overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, benefits in that year, or about 8% of total benefits paid.

The Social Security Administration recovered about $4.9 billion in Social Security and SSI overpayments in fiscal year 2023. However, the agency had about $23 billion in uncollected overpayments at the end of the 2023 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Research Service.

By defaulting to a 100% withholding rate for overpayments, the Social Security Administration said it may recover about $7 billion in the next decade.  

""We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people,"" Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, said in a statement. ""It is our duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding, as it was during the Obama administration and first Trump administration, to properly safeguard taxpayer funds.""

The new 100% withholding rate will apply to new overpayments of Social Security benefits, according to the agency. The withholding rate for SSI overpayments will remain at 10%.

Social Security beneficiaries who are overpaid benefits after March 27 will automatically be subject to the new 100% withholding rate.

Individuals affected will have the right to appeal both the overpayment decision and the amount, according to the agency. They may also ask for a waiver of the overpayment, if either they cannot afford to pay the money back or if they believe they are not at fault. While an initial appeal or waiver is pending, the agency will not require repayment.

Beneficiaries who cannot afford to fully repay the Social Security Administration may also request a lower recovery rate either by calling the agency or visiting their local office.

For beneficiaries who had an overpayment before March 27, the withholding rate will stay the same and no action is required, the agency said.

The new overpayment policy goes into effect about one year after former Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley implemented a 10% default withholding rate.

The change was prompted by financial struggles some beneficiaries faced in repaying large sums to the Social Security Administration.

At a March 2024 Senate committee hearing, O'Malley called the policy of intercepting 100% of a benefit check ""clawback cruelty.""

At the same hearing, Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Georgia, recalled how one constituent who was overpaid $58,000 could not afford to pay her rent after the Social Security Administration reduced her monthly checks.

Following the Social Security Administration's announcement that it will return to 100% as the default withholding rate, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare said it is concerned the agency may be more susceptible to overpayment errors as it cuts staff.

""This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices — usually through no fault of their own,"" the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy organization, said in a statement.

President Donald Trump has dismissed the growing chorus of CEOs, investors and policymakers who are pleading with the White House for greater clarity about his sweeping tariff agenda.

""They always say that. 'We want clarity,'"" Trump said in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday.

""They have plenty of clarity,"" the president told ""Sunday Morning Futures"" host Maria Bartiromo.

Appeals to the White House from the business community to provide more concrete guidance, Trump said, are little more than talking points. ""They just use that — like almost a sound bite.""

Pressed by Bartiromo on whether there would be ""clarity for the business community,"" Trump's reply was telling.

""I think so, but you know, the tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up, and you know, I don't know if it's predictability.""

Bartiromo interjected: ""That's not clarity.""

A day after the full interview aired, the start of a new week of tariff-fueled fears and heightened economic uncertainty sent stocks lower at Monday's opening. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 400 points, or 1%. The S&P 500 slipped 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite shed 2%. Later in the morning, both the 500-stock S&P and tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped to their lowest levels since September 2024.

Trump's comments capped off a week marked by unpredictability about both his tariffs and the broader strength of the U.S. economy.

The S&P 500 fell 3.10%, for its worst weekly mark since September. The Dow fell 2.37%, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 3.45%.

At the center of the storm were Trump's stiff 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which were initially paused for a month, then restarted Tuesday, only to be reined in Wednesday and then partially paused for another month on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Trump and multiple officials in his administration warned that Americans could be in store for some economic strain — including higher prices. But they insisted any adverse impacts would be temporary.

Confusion surrounding Trump's constantly shifting trade plans has left investors uncertain about what's coming next.

While Trump has downplayed the impact of his unpredictable trade policies on domestic markets, Wall Street analysts have not.

""We still have no clarity on the economy moving forward with the Trump turmoil,"" wrote Byron Anderson, head of fixed income at Laffer Tengler Investments.

""The longer we have chaos and turmoil from Trump, the higher the probability that we will eventually have data trend negative,"" he wrote in a Friday note.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Trump's latest remarks about his tariffs, or about the widespread confusion surrounding his agenda.

The coming week promises plenty of new economic data to test the competing theories.

Due out Monday is the New York Fed survey of consumer expectations, followed by the Wednesday release of February's consumer price index.

Thursday will see a fresh set of producer price data, before finishing the week with a University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading on Friday.

Now, as the Trump administration embarks on a monthlong reassessment of America's trade relationships around the world, the negative impacts of uncertainty, felt over the past few weeks, could be magnified.

""Markets fear uncertainty more than they fear bad news,"" wrote Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial. ""25% tariffs are easier to price in than 'maybe 10%, maybe more, maybe less.'""

It's not just companies and investors who need greater clarity before they make major decisions.

The Federal Reserve does, too.

Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday said the central bank is ""well positioned to wait for greater clarity"" while the Trump administration implements ""significant policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation.""

Speaking at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, Powell said it would be ""the net effect of these policy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy.""

For now, he said, ""uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high.""

The Fed, like so many others, is ""focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves,"" he added.

For years, American financial companies have fought the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — the chief U.S. consumer finance watchdog — in the courts and media, portraying the agency as illegitimate and as unfairly targeting industry players.

Now, with the CFPB on life support after the Trump administration issued a stop-work order and shuttered its headquarters, the agency finds itself with an unlikely ally: the same banks that reliably complained about its rules and enforcement actions under former Director Rohit Chopra.

That's because if the Trump administration succeeds in reducing the CFPB to a shell of its former self, banks would find themselves competing directly with nonbank financial players, from big tech and fintech firms to mortgage, auto and payday lenders, that enjoy far less federal scrutiny than Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-backed institutions.

""The CFPB is the only federal agency that supervises non-depository institutions, so that would go away,"" said David Silberman, a veteran banking attorney who lectures at Yale Law School. ""Payment apps like PayPal, Stripe, Cash App, those sorts of things, they would get close to a free ride at the federal level.""

The shift could wind the clock back to a pre-2008 environment, where it was largely left to state officials to prevent consumers from being ripped off by nonbank providers. The CFPB was created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis that was caused by irresponsible lending.

But since then, digital players have made significant inroads by offering banking services via mobile phone apps. Fintechs led by PayPal and Chime had roughly as many new accounts last year as all large and regional banks combined, according to data from Cornerstone Advisors.

""If you're the big banks, you certainly don't want a world in which the nonbanks have much greater degrees of freedom and much less regulatory oversight than the banks do,"" Silberman said.

The CFPB and its employees are in limbo after acting Director Russell Vought took over last month, issuing a flurry of directives to the agency's then 1,700 staffers. Working with operatives from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, Vought quickly laid off about 200 workers, reportedly took steps to end the agency's building lease and canceled reams of contracts required for legally mandated duties.

In internal emails released Friday, CFPB Chief Operating Officer Adam Martinez detailed plans to remove roughly 800 supervision and enforcement workers.

Senior executives at the CFPB shared plans for more layoffs that would leave the agency with just five employees, CNBC has reported. That would kneecap the agency's ability to carry out its supervision and enforcement duties.

That appears to go beyond what even the Consumer Bankers Association, a frequent CFPB critic, would want. The CBA, which represents the country's biggest retail banks, has sued the CFPB in the past year to scuttle rules limiting overdraft and credit card late fees. More recently, it noted the CFPB's role in keeping a level playing field among market participants.

""We believe that new leadership understands the need for examinations for large banks to continue, given the intersections with prudential regulatory examinations,"" said Lindsey Johnson, president of the CBA, in a statement provided to CNBC. ""Importantly, the CFPB is the sole examiner of non-bank financial institutions.""

Vought's plans to hobble the agency were halted by a federal judge, who is now considering the merits of a lawsuit brought by a CFPB union asking for a preliminary injunction.

In the meantime, bank executives have gone from antagonists of the CFPB to among those concerned it will disappear.

At a late October bankers convention in New York, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon encouraged his peers to ""fight back"" against regulators. A few months before that, the bank said that it could sue the CFPB over its investigation into peer-to-peer payments network Zelle.

""We are suing our regulators over and over and over because things are becoming unfair and unjust, and they are hurting companies, a lot of these rules are hurting lower-paid individuals,"" Dimon said at the convention.

Now, there's growing consensus that an initial push to ""delete"" the CFPB is a mistake. Besides increasing the threat posed from nonbanks, current rules from the CFPB would still be on the books, but nobody would be around to update them as the industry evolves.

Small banks and credit unions would be even more disadvantaged than their larger peers if the CFPB were to go away, industry advocates say, since they were never regulated by the agency and would face the same regulatory scrutiny as before.

""The conventional wisdom is not right that banks just want the CFPB to go away, or that banks want regulator consolidation,"" said an executive at a major U.S. bank who declined to be identified speaking about the Trump administration. ""They want thoughtful policies that will support economic growth and maintain safety and soundness.""

A senior CFPB lawyer who lost his position in recent weeks said that the industry's alignment with Republicans may have backfired.

""They're about to live in a world in which the entire nonbank financial services industry is unregulated every day, while they are overseen by the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC,"" the lawyer said. ""It's a world where Apple, PayPal, Cash App and X run wild for four years. Good luck.""

Goldman Sachs is the latest Wall Street firm to grow more concerned about the path forward for the US economy as President Trump's tariff policies become reality.

In a research note on Monday, Goldman's economics team led by Jan Hatzius slashed its 2025 GDP forecast to 1.7% from 2.4%.

""The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse,"" Hatzius wrote.

In its note, Goldman also boosted its projection for the Fed's preferred inflation gauge to end the year at 3%, up from a prior call in the mid 2% range.

Hatzius noted these updates mark the first time in about two and a half years that his team has projected GDP growth below Bloomberg consensus data, which currently calls for GDP growth north of 2% this year.

Goldman is the latest in a slew of forecasting teams that now see a more dire outlook for the US economy.

In a note to clients on Friday, Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen moved his 2025 growth forecast down to 1.5% from 1.9% previously.

Gapen also sees the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — the ""core"" Personal Consumption Expenditures index — ending the year higher, projecting core PCE to end 2025 at 2.7%, up from a previous projection of 2.5%.

In its note on Monday, Goldman's team said it now sees the average US tariff rate rising by 10 percentage points this year, twice their previous forecast and five times the level seen during Trump's first administration.

Tariffs weigh on the overall economic outlook through three key levers, Hatzius wrote.

First, the new duties are expected to push up consumer prices and, therefore, cut real income for consumers. Second, they usually come alongside tighter financial conditions. And third, the uncertainty surrounding the tariff implementation will likely prompt businesses to ""delay investment.""

Hatzius believes the combination of slower growth and sticky inflation can still leave room for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice this year in June and December.

But for now, Trump's policy uncertainty likely keeps the central bank holding rates steady.

""Our near-term view is that the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] will want to stay on the sidelines and make as little news as possible until the policy outlook has become clearer,"" Hatzius said.

And while still not the base case, discussions of recession have also picked up from various sources.

Former PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian told Yahoo Finance Monday he now sees a 25% to 30% chance the US economy enters recession this year, up from a 10% chance seen before the Trump tariff bonanza began.

Betting markets are pricing in an increasing chance the US economy tips into recession, with Polymarket placing the odds that a US recession is officially called by year-end at roughly 40% as of Monday, up from a 23% chance on Feb. 27.

The downshift in economic growth forecasts has also coincided with a broad risk-off trade in the stock market. On Monday, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down more than 3%, led by large losses in popular tech names like Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA).

It’s no longer enough for investors.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-is-fulfilling-his-crypto-promises-its-no-longer-enough-for-investors-165911389.html,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 18:45:32 GMT","

The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) continues falling despite efforts by President Trump to give the crypto world more of what it wants, including a strategic bitcoin reserve that the administration touted at the end of last week while hosting crypto executives at the White House.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell near $78,000 on Monday, hitting its lowest level since the days following Trump's election victory last November. It is now down 28% from its all-time high above $109,000 the day of Trump's inauguration in January.

Other digital assets beyond bitcoin also fell Monday, including ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP).

Trump’s pro-crypto stance was enough to lift digital assets higher in the period after his November election due to widespread optimism about a more favorable approach to the industry in Washington, D.C.

But that pro-crypto stance is no longer enough to overcome a variety of other economic worries, including growing concerns about the US economy and Trump’s unpredictable trade policy.

""While the early parts of the crypto sell-off in January and early February had nothing to do with the global macro picture, the last two weeks have 100% been driven by the equity market tantrum,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer for crypto asset manager Arca, said in a Monday note.

There was also some disappointment within the crypto industry about Trump’s bitcoin reserve announcement last week. Some were hoping the government would make it clear that it would be buying more digital assets, as opposed to simply seeding the stockpile with crypto already seized in legal proceedings.

""The market reaction reflects a reset in expectations,"" Haider Rafique, chief marketing officer for crypto exchange OKX, said via email.

While Rafique said he considers the reserve a ""milestone"" that “cements bitcoin’s legitimacy on the global stage,"" he pointed out that the order won’t immediately drive more demand for the world’s largest cryptocurrency — thus ""disappointing those expecting aggressive accumulation"" by the US government.

Monday’s move down was the latest example of how bitcoin’s price has whipsawed in recent weeks as it experienced its worst correction since a 2022 meltdown.

""Crypto is still a risk asset, and also it needs more liquidity,"" MarketVector’s Martin Leinweber told Yahoo Finance last week.

The bitcoin strategic reserve announced last week was one of Trump's biggest promises to the crypto world, something he touted while on the campaign trail last year while pledging to make the US the ""crypto capital of the planet.""

Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks said on X that the US government owns an estimated 200,000 bitcoins worth over $17 billion after selling off about half of what it acquired through criminal seizures, although he said there has never been a complete audit.

Had the government not sold that sum for roughly $360 million over the last decade, according to White House officials, its bitcoin holdings would potentially be worth $17 billion more.

Sacks said the US will not sell any bitcoin once it is in the reserve and that it will be kept as a store of value.

The reserve, he added, ""is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called 'digital gold.'""

One unknown question about the reserve announced last week by Sacks and Trump is whether it will be used to buy more bitcoin beyond the assets already held by the US government.

Sacks said that the secretaries of Treasury and Commerce have the authorization “to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC Friday that seized crypto assets would go into the reserve first and ""then we'll see what the way forward is for more acquisitions for the reserve. And we're starting with bitcoin, but it's an overall crypto reserve.""

But Sacks made it clear the government would not acquire additional assets for that stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings.

Coinbase Global (COIN) CEO Brain Armstrong told Yahoo Finance that because ""the United States government is now a holder of bitcoin, maybe a buyer,"" he thinks ""the rest of the G20 [countries] are going to see that as a signal that bitcoin is really the successor to the gold standard.""

Trump, he added, “really breathed life back into this industry.""

After months of optimism over the prospect of a US economic ""soft landing,"" more Wall Street watchers are now warning of another possible outcome: stagflation.

A bleak economic scenario in which growth stalls, inflation persists, and unemployment rises, stagflation has become the latest buzzword in financial markets as investors attempt to understand the administration's shifting trade narrative and other policy uncertainties, including recent efforts from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

""Stagflation worries [are] appearing as tariff and DOGE policies could spur inflation higher and weigh on economic growth,"" Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel wrote in a note over the weekend, adding stagflation risks ""would skew"" the firm's 5,200 year-end bear case for the S&P 500 (^GSPC).

Although Emanuel noted there are ""no overt signs"" of stagflation just yet as universal tariffs remain an unlikely outcome, the possibility has become more pronounced. According to Emanuel, the S&P 500 had an annualized fall of 10% during previous stagflationary periods.

In recent days, a number of Wall Street firms — including JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) — have reduced their respective growth targets, referencing the anticipated effects of restrictive trade and immigration policies.

""If our narrative entering the year was 'slower growth, stickier inflation' then we now think 'slower growth, firmer inflation,'"" Morgan Stanley economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note, lowering his full-year GDP target to 1.5% from 1.9%.

On Monday, Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius slashed his GDP forecast to 1.7% from 2.4% while simultaneously boosting his inflation outlook: ""The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse.""

In recent weeks, surveys and sentiment indicators — often referred to as ""soft"" economic data — have been at the center of investor concern, marking the return of ""bad news for the economy is bad news for stocks.""

Friday's jobs report showed the US economy added 151,000 jobs last month, a positive sign for economic growth, but a slight uptick in the unemployment rate and increased wage growth left inflation fears lingering underneath the surface.

""The disappointing household survey, along with solid wage growth, underscores the risk of mild stagflation — softer but still positive growth and modestly higher inflation — in coming months,"" Bank of America economist Shruti Mishra wrote in response to the data.

The prices paid index in the ISM's manufacturing PMI report came in at its highest since June 2022 last week. That data arrived on top of bleak consumer survey results for the month of February.

""The market has gone from one cut this year to expecting at least three,"" Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, told Yahoo Finance on Monday. ""So the market thinks that the employment part of the Fed's mandate is going to force the Fed to cut.""

But ""we need stable inflation in order for the Fed to respond to the maximum employment part of its mandate,"" El-Erian said. ""Otherwise, they're not going to deliver the three cuts.""

Inflation has remained stubbornly elevated, with February expected to be yet another sticky month for consumer prices. Wall Street economists project last month's CPI print to show annual headline inflation of 2.9%, just below January's 3% annual gain. On a month-over-month basis, prices are estimated to rise 0.3%, below the 0.5% increase seen in January.

On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and energy, CPI is expected to have risen 3.2% over the past year in February, a touch below January's 3.3% increase. Monthly core price increases are anticipated to hit 0.3%, below January's 0.4% rise.

In a speech on Friday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned inflation pressures will likely persist, even if Wednesday's report comes in as expected: ""The path to sustainably returning inflation to our target has been bumpy, and we expect that to continue.""

Tesla stock (TSLA) fell more than 10% on Monday as another bearish call from Wall Street sent shares to their lowest level since the day before the presidential election and 50% from its record closing high of $479 seen on Dec. 17.

In a note to clients on Monday, analysts at UBS lowered their price target on the stock to $225 from $259, citing lower delivery forecasts for the first quarter it sees resulting from softer demand for Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The firm maintained a Sell rating on the stock.

UBS now expects the company to deliver 367,000 cars in the first quarter, down from the 437,000 it said it had ""plugged in as a placeholder"" after Tesla's fourth quarter results in late January.

The firm now sees deliveries falling 5% over last year and 26% from the prior quarter in Q1, adding: ""Our UBS Evidence Lab data shows low delivery times for the Model 3 and Model Y (generally within 2 weeks) in key markets which we believe is indicative of softer demand.""

The stock was also pressured by news that shipments in China fell 49% from last year in February to the lowest level in almost three years.

With Monday's drop, Tesla stock has now forfeited more than all of its post-election gains, with this decline another piece of the persistent unwind of the ""Trump trade"" that has defined market action in recent weeks.

Tesla stock has dropped about 18% since the start of March alone.

Still, the plunge has prompted some of Tesla's biggest bulls to come out in defense of the name in recent days. Last Thursday, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives doubled down on his pro-Tesla views, calling the current slump a ""gut check moment for the Tesla bulls (including ourselves).""

Ives added Tesla to the firm's ""Best Ideas List"" and reiterated his Outperform rating and $550 price target. He also noted this is not the first time Tesla has seen a drawdown of this magnitude, writing, ""There have been a number of times in the Tesla story over the past decade that negative sentiment and Street worries have overshadowed the narrative of this unique disruptive global tech story.""

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas also recently reiterated his bullish view on Tesla, forecasting shares will rise to $430 as the company diversifies into artificial intelligence and robotics. The analyst reinstated Tesla as a top pick for the auto sector.

""Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,"" wrote Jonas in early March. He added the company's 2025 deliveries could decline year over year, but that this would be ""creating an attractive entry point"" for investors.

As Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian recently pointed out, while new competition has eaten into Tesla's sales, there is also the effect of CEO Elon Musk and his foray into politics. Musk became one of Trump's key surrogates on the campaign trail in the final months of the 2024 election.

Registration data shows Tesla car sales falling in Europe while the firing of government workers by the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have prompted protests at showrooms across the country.

Recent surveys show that many voters disapprove of Musk's actions, with a Quinnipiac poll from late January finding that voters oppose Musk playing a prominent role in the Trump administration by a 53% to 39% margin.

Tesla is expected to report its first quarter results on April 22.

President Donald Trump this weekend demurred on the question of whether his administration’s trade policies could send the US economy into recession, following up his recent acknowledgement that they may cause a “little disturbance.”

Some consistent — albeit equally vague — messaging is emerging, however. The US president and his economic team have been priming markets and the American people to expect some pain as a result of their trade policies, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warning of a “detox” period and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying there are certain to be “distortions.”

The question is how much pain is involved with ""disturbances,"" ""distortions,"" and ""detox."" The economy grew by 2.8% last year. For this year, the average of economists’ forecasts gathered by Bloomberg shows an expectation of 2.3% growth. Recently, estimates have been coming down as a result of first quarter tariff turmoil.

At a “stall speed” of 1% GDP growth or below, what the Trump administration is trying to achieve looks a lot less palatable, Mohamed El-Erian, president at Queens College, Cambridge, and former PIMCO CEO, told Yahoo Finance in an interview.

“We’re getting closer to stall speed,” El-Erian said. “And if we get to stall speed, then the journey becomes too difficult for the destination. And that’s going to be the big question as we look forward.”

For now, El-Erian sees growth this year ending up at 1.5% to 2%. He’s factoring in the chance of a recession at 25% to 30%, up from an earlier probability forecast of only 10%.

But he emphasizes that a recession is “not the baseline"" due to the ""structural strength of the US economy,"" as well as promises of deregulation, tax cuts, and cheap energy.

As El-Erian sees it, the Trump administration’s vision for remaking the economy and the federal government is four-pronged:

“A fairer trading system so that US goods are not discriminated against in global trade.”

“They want to detox the economy from its high dependence on the public sector.”

“They want to enhance the efficiency of government.”

“They want to unleash the private sector through deregulation and favorable tax treatment.”

Investors seemed broadly on board with those goals after the election, sending stocks soaring. But the volatile and uneven application of tariffs has now sent markets tumbling and increased the importance of the administration’s planned tax-cut extension and other policies to try to juice growth.

As El-Erian said, “You're getting a sequencing where the negative effects are being felt first and the positive effects are promised in the future. And that's what the market is getting used to.”

If the negative effects slow economic growth to 1% or below, the habituation process could be even rockier.

Leaning into the bear narrative on Tesla (TSLA).

UBS analyst Joseph Spak reiterated his 12-month Sell rating on Tesla shares on Monday, voicing considerable concern on the near-term demand outlook for the Model 3 and Model Y. He slashed his price target on Tesla to $225 from $259.

The consensus price target on the Street is $239, according to Yahoo Finance data.

The stock tanked 8% to $242 in early trading alongside a broader hit to markets due to tariff concerns.

""While the long-term story at Tesla has shifted to AI (robo-taxis and humanoid robots) and progress there continues, we believe these are longer dated opportunities that the premium multiple already (more than) considers. Stock is currently trading at 90x P/E on consensus (EPS) estimates for 2025, but again we believe that is too high,"" Spak said.

Spak forecasts first quarter deliveries for Tesla to decline 5% year over year and 26% sequentially. His new deliveries estimates is 13% below current consensus estimates.

Listen: How Elon Musk delivers on big ambitions

The bearish note is the latest dreadful news for the Tesla faithful.

Tesla shares are down 40% year to date and are the worst-performing component of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks — which also include Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META).

The stock fell 28% in February alone versus a modest drop for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Shares are down 7% in February compared to a 3% decline for the S&P 500.

The weakness in sentiment reflects more than just concern that Elon Musk's closeness with Trump is turning away buyers around the world (though alleged attacks at Tesla stores are fueling this narrative).

Tesla sold just 26,677 vehicles in China's market in February, according to data released today by the China Passenger Car Association. The figure marked an 11.16% drop year over year and 20% decline from January.

At the same time, Australia's Electric Vehicle Council reported that Tesla's overall sales fell 72% year over year in February.

In the US, prices on used Cybertrucks, Model 3s, Model Ss, Model Ys, and Model Xs continue to drop. Tesla is facing increased EV competition from General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), while some consumers are opting for hybrids.

In the past 90 days, the average price of a Tesla has declined 4%, according to data from CarGurus. The fastest price declines are in Cybertrucks, followed by the Model S.

Meanwhile, new tariffs from the Trump administration stand to raise costs for Tesla and other automakers.

The president has signed two executive orders imposing additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, both key raw materials for autos.

Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either — a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies.

Wall Street analysts have begun lowering their sales and profit estimates on Tesla ahead of its late April earnings release.

Compared to 30 days ago, EPS estimates on Tesla for 2025 and 2026 have been cut by 3.4% and 2.6%, respectively, Yahoo Finance data shows.

Despite the stock rout, Tesla and Musk continue to have many supporters on the Street.

Ark Investment founder and Tesla bull Cathie Wood says there's a lot of ""pent-up demand"" for Tesla vehicles. The big valuation unlock, in her view, is Tesla releasing robotaxis across the country.

""So I now think they're going to start seeding every state [with robotaxis] and their Full Self-Driving. According to our calculations, their robotaxi will be safer in the fourth quarter than human drivers are,"" Wood told me at a conference two weeks ago.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives doubled down on his bullish Tesla call last week, saying he is ""pounding the table"" on the stock.

Said Ives, ""The time has come to defend the stock.""

Mortgage giant Rocket Companies (RKT) announced Monday it agreed to purchase digital real estate brokerage Redfin (RDFN) in an all-stock deal valued at $1.75 billion.

Redfin stock rose as much as 76% on the news. Rocket stock fell as much as 10%. In 2024, Rocket's revenues were $5.1 billion; Redfin reported revenue of $1.04 billion in 2024.

""For far too long, the homeownership process has been outdated and disconnected. Home search, brokerage, mortgage, title, closing, and servicing all exist in separate ecosystems, forcing consumers to piece together a complex and frustrating journey,"" Rocket Companies CEO Varun Krishna told analysts and investors on the conference call Monday morning.

""This disjointed system creates confusion, adds friction, and drives up transaction fees totaling roughly 10% of a home's cost,"" Krishna added.

The deal comes at a time when the housing market has struggled amid high mortgage rates and tight home supply. Redfin's stock peaked at $96.81 in February 2021, when housing was thriving during the pandemic. Record-low interest rates played a crucial role in driving refinancing and fueling the market. RKT went public in August 2020, positioning itself to capitalize on these favorable market conditions.

According to a statement announcing the deal, Redfin shareholders will receive just under 0.8 shares of Rocket stock for each share of Redfin. Current Rocket shareholders will own about 95% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, while Redfin shareholders will own approximately 5%.

Rocket shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of $0.80 per share. The deal values Redfin at $12.50 per share.

The companies said the combined company should be able to cut about $140 million in costs by 2027 — and realize an additional $60 million in savings from pairing Redfin agents with Rocket's financing infrastructure.

""Rocket and Redfin's approaches to lending and brokerage service have always been two halves of one vision to make the whole home-buying process magical,"" Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman said in the release.

The deal was approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2025.

Upon the agreement, Kelman will continue to run Redfin's business, reporting to Rocket Companies CEO Krishna.

Tech stocks continue to short circuit.

The Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) finished below its key 200-day moving average last week for the first time in nearly two years, according to data from Creative Planning chief markets strategist Charlie Bilello. The 200-day moving average is a technical measure of longer-term sentiment on an index or stock.

It marked the end of the second-longest uptrend in history for the Nasdaq 100 at 497 days. During this stretch, the Nasdaq 100 notched a 73% return.

The Nasdaq 100 contains the largest, most actively traded businesses listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It includes some of the biggest momentum names in tech, such as Palantir (PLTR), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL).

Listen: Why this toy CEO is worried about tariffs

It also includes consumer companies like Starbucks (SBUX) and Costco (COST).

Bilello's work shows the longest run for the Nasdaq 100 above its 200-day moving average was 572 days from July 6, 2016, to Oct. 10, 2018. The return for this period tallied 58%.

The broader Nasdaq Composite entered into correction territory last week, defined as a decline of 10% or more from a recent high. The index closed the week down 3.6%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) recorded its worst weekly performance since September.

“We get a correction once every 12 months, and this time, it's spurred by the tariffs,” Nancy Tengler of Tengler Investments told Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith.

The market is going through a rough patch in March as investors digest a flurry of headlines related to tariffs.

Tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada from the Trump administration could hurt corporate profits this year, experts say. Against such a backdrop, investors are selling higher-valued tech stocks and rotating into more defensive names in healthcare or companies that pay strong dividends.

For some former high-flying tech names, the sell-offs are becoming very pronounced.

Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla are all 10% or more below their 52-week highs.

Nvidia's market cap losses from its record high in January have reached $1 trillion. The losses have accelerated in the wake of a fourth quarter earnings report that investors deemed only so-so.

""We think investors have too benign of an interpretation of potential new policies and their impact on US earnings,"" Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said.

Parker correctly called the latest tech weakness, telling clients on Feb. 8 to sell popular ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks.

Added Parker, ""Given the market run, we think it is likely the market will correct in the first half of 2025. Our judgment is that the risks are skewed toward the downside for the S&P 500 in the first half of the year.”

For consumer products giant Newell Brands (NWL), the business of making Sharpie pens, Graco baby car seats, and Rubbermaid food storage supplies will likely be costlier as Trump tariffs take effect.

Its CEO would tell the president that very story if they met.

""I would tell him that I think tariffs play an important role. I'm not against tariffs. I think tariffs are better applied selectively for strategic categories than universally, [that] is my personal point of view. I think there are critical industries that are important to rebuild in the US, and I think there are other industries that may be less important to rebuild in the US,"" Newell Brands CEO Chris Peterson said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (watch above; listen below).

Peterson had just joined Newell Brands as CFO in 2018 during the first Trump administration, after operational stints at Revlon, Ralph Lauren (RL), and Procter & Gamble (PG). He is currently a board member of retailer BJ's Wholesale (BJ), a competitor to Costco (COST) and Walmart's (WMT) Sam's Club.

Newell has invested $2 billion in US manufacturing since the 2017 Trump tax cuts went into effect. Even still, it relies on China for more than 10% of its sourcing, Mexico for 5%, and a small amount from Canada. The company may rationalize its Mexico manufacturing capacity if the tariffs remain in place for an extended period of time, Peterson noted.

He said the Trump tariff climate is different this time around.

""In the first Trump administration, there were tariffs put on China, but he also went through a process where there was an exclusion process and the ability for companies to go and petition to have certain product categories exempted so that the tariffs were applied more selectively as opposed to universally,"" Peterson recalled.

""In this administration, there's a different focus, I think, on the tariff discussion where the administration is looking at trade imbalances and trying to use tariffs against many different companies in a more universal fashion. And so that has created, at least in the short term, a lot more uncertainty.""

The uncertainty on tariffs among the C-suite is well deserved.

The Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico last Tuesday. Trump abruptly suspended goods that comply under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) two days later but hinted that tariffs on each country would happen in April. Noncompliant goods are currently subject to the new tariffs.

China got hit with a 10% tariff on almost all imports in early February. The tariff rate was raised to 20% last week.

Tariff news is hitting the stock market as investors price in reduced earnings power for companies.

The S&P 500 posted its third consecutive week of losses with a drop of 3.1% last week, its worst weekly fall since early September.

Markets were walloped early on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) down more than 500 points in premarket trading.

 

BCA Research's veteran strategist Peter Berezin said in a new piece of research that he sees a 75% chance of a recession within the next three months.

""Conventional estimates understate the likely impact on economic activity from the trade war and DOGE cuts. This implies that growth will slow more than expected,"" Berezin wrote.

Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius has raised his US recession probability to 20% from 15%.

Peterson isn't in the recession camp just yet but is concerned about what tariffs will do to lower-income shoppers as they continue to deal with inflationary pressures.

""The low-income consumer remains under significant pressure because the cumulative effect of inflation over the last several years has outpaced wage growth. The middle- and high-income consumer is still in very good shape. They continue to see very strong balance sheets from home price appreciation, from equity market appreciation, and we're seeing those consumers continue to spend on our categories,"" Peterson adds.

The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks were at the center of another sell-off hitting markets Monday.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) all fell, with Tesla falling as much as 13% to lead the way down. Five of the seven megacap names saw drops of over 4%; Apple and Nvidia both lost more than 5% at session lows.

The selling pressure hitting the Magnificent Seven comes after US markets suffered their worst week of the year as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell into correction last Thursday — defined as a 10% decline from its most recent closing high — and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) enters the week 6% off its record high reached on Feb. 19.

Last week, Nvidia stock lost $1 trillion from its record highs reached last year, while losses on Tesla stock are nearing 50% from its record close back in December. Nvidia has been the biggest winner from the AI boom that kicked off in 2023, while Tesla's stock — which has ebbed and flowed throughout the company's history — was an initial winner following President Trump's election win after CEO Elon Musk became one of Trump's biggest backers on the campaign trail. Musk is now leading Trump's government efficiency push.

In a note to clients published late Sunday, RBC's equity strategy team, led by Lori Calvasina, wrote that ""investor, corporate, and political vibes have continued to weaken.""

""We continue to believe that the risk of a growth scare (14-20% drawdown peak to trough) in the S&P 500 has risen,"" she wrote.

Mike Wilson, strategist at Morgan Stanley, said he sees the S&P 500 falling another 5% in a client note this weekend.

Earlier this month, strategists at Bank of America flagged the risk of a post-election ""bro bubble"" popping and argued that should the S&P 500 erase its post-election gains, ""investors currently long risk would very much expect and need some verbal support for markets from policymakers.""

Speaking to reporters last Thursday, President Trump said, ""I'm not even looking at the stock market,"" an approach that is in contrast to his first term in office, when Trump embraced the stock market as a scorecard for the administration's economic policy. Amid ongoing pressures from his burgeoning trade war, Trump on Sunday declined to rule out the possibility of a recession this year, saying the economy was in a period of ""transition.""

This week, inflation data due out Wednesday will be the biggest update for investors looking to the Federal Reserve for signs the central bank might ease policy more aggressively than anticipated this year. Data on job openings due out Tuesday morning will add more color to the labor market picture, which appeared steadier than feared in Friday's jobs report.

As Moody's economist Mark Zandi told Yahoo Finance last week: ""There's a lot of clouds out there, some storms, things are getting pretty dark.""

Quantum computing might sound like the kind of sci-fi plot device used to explain how a character traveled through time or shrank to the size of an ant. But the technology is very real, and Silicon Valley is increasingly jumping on the quantum train.

Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have each announced their own quantum computing chips over the past few months. Nvidia (NVDA) is preparing to host its first-ever Quantum Day as part of its annual GTC developer conference on March 20. IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), and a slew of quantum-focused companies also have their own chips.

Quantum computers are expected to be able to complete calculations in minutes and hours that would take classic computers, the kind you and I use every day, thousands of years to finish. What does that mean in a practical sense? The potential for massive advancements in material sciences, chemistry, medicine, and more. After all, scientists and researchers will be able to run calculations they'd otherwise only be able to dream of with today's computers.

But what exactly is a quantum computer, and what makes it so special? We've got the answers you're looking for.

To better understand quantum computers, let’s talk about classical computers first. Your laptop, smartphone, heck, even your smartwatch have processors known as central processing units (CPUs). These are the brains of modern computers.

Every CPU has what are called transistors. Think of transistors as little switches inside your computer that react to an electrical signal. You've probably heard chipmakers brag about how many billions of transistors their chips have. Apple talks up the 28 billion transistors on its M4 chips for its Mac and iPad, while Nvidia says its Blackwell chips have 208 billion transistors.

CPUs translate the apps and programs you use every day via those electrical pulses using what is known as binary code, a kind of machine language made up of 1s and 0s. Each 1 and 0 is called a bit.

Strings of bits make up the complex series of instructions that, after running through modern programming languages, are translated into the videos and images you see on your screen, the games you play, and the apps you use throughout the workday.

One series of electrical pulses could travel through a chip's transistors, creating various 1s and 0s along the way. The chip will then interpret those signals to access your computer's memory or storage. As the commands increase in complexity, they're able to interpret everything from a swipe of your finger on your phone's screen to what to do when you click on a link on a website.

These binary systems are used throughout computing, whether that's your home computer, medical equipment, cars, or virtually any other piece of technology that requires a CPU.

Quantum computers, however, use subatomic objects known as quantum bits, or qubits, rather than classic bits. This is a completely different way of storing and processing data. Rather than existing as a 1 or a 0 like a bit, qubits can exist as a 1 and 0 or any combination of the two at the same time, thanks to what is called superposition.

""Think of a qubit as a sphere,"" explained Oskar Painter, director of quantum hardware at Amazon Web Services. ""There's a north and south pole, and it can be any combination of 0 and 1 simultaneously.""

To make things even stranger, scientists don't actually know whether a qubit is a 1 or a 0 until they observe it.

""In the quantum world, the system itself can simultaneously be in several different states,"" NYU assistant professor of applied physics Rupak Chatterjee told Yahoo Finance. ""And until we measure, we don't really know, necessarily, which exact state it's in.""

That ability to exist as a 1 and a 0 enables what is called parallel processing, which allows quantum computers to solve calculations much faster than classic computers.

There are multiple ways to manipulate qubits, whether that's through superconducting systems that lower the temperature around the qubits to near absolute zero, using lasers to interact with atoms, or taking advantage of light particles — photons — in an extreme vacuum.

Those giant, gold, octopus-looking machines you see that are often referred to as quantum computers? They're largely cooling systems working with superconducting qubits to ensure they're sufficiently cold to operate properly.

What’s more, quantum computers don't exist on their own. They connect to traditional computers, which control how the quantum system should interact with a qubit and provide a readout of its performance.

So, quantum computers can use qubits' superposition to process calculations at incredibly fast speeds compared to our classic computers. Then why aren't we using them to solve the world's most complex problems yet? Because of quantum errors.

""[Qubits] are very, very fragile,"" explained Sridhar Tayur, professor of operations management at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. ""You can't have 0 and 1 at the same time if it interacts with the environment.""

See, because qubits exist at such a small scale, they're incredibly susceptible to interference from the outside world. That means even a single atom could throw off the qubit, causing it to lose the information — that 1 and 0.

According to Painter, quantum systems can have an error every 300 quantum operations. In order for a quantum computer to be useful, though, it can only exhibit an error every trillion operations. That's a dramatic difference.

To address this, companies use what is known as quantum error correction. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon focused on this with their latest chips. The idea behind quantum error correction is to use redundant qubits.

""If I want to protect one qubit of information, I need to actually replicate it 1,000 times in order to get a single good, what we call logical qubit,"" Painter said.

But that takes up a huge amount of resources. Researchers are working to address the issue, but until they can, quantum computers won't be reliable enough to use for calculations related to chemistry, to help discover new compounds, or to understand how atoms interact with each other.

While quantum computers are helpful for running specific algorithms and solving incredibly complex problems, they won't replace classic supercomputers even after researchers are able to overcome the issue with quantum errors.

That's because they're not meant to do things like run your favorite apps faster than your smartphone. What's more, there's simply no reason to use a quantum computer for such a task when classic computers are designed to handle exactly that.

In other words, don't expect to come home, turn on your personal quantum computer, and start streaming Netflix. Your Roku can handle that just fine on its own.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22business%20news%22%20site%3Afinance.yahoo.com,The new Trump era just got more complicated for Capital One,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-new-trump-era-just-got-more-complicated-for-capital-one-080011072.html,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 08:00:11 GMT","

The politics of the new Trump era just got a lot more complicated for Capital One (COF).

The huge bank and credit card lender now finds itself in the position of having to defend itself against a new lawsuit from a company owned by President Trump while also seeking a big merger approval from Trump’s antitrust enforcers.

The new legal headache arrived Friday when the Trump Organization sued Capital One for allegedly debanking hundreds of its accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol in Washington, D.C.

The ""unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations and Capital One’s unsubstantiated, ‘woke’ beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views,"" according to the lawsuit.

Capital One responded to the lawsuit by telling media outlets the bank ""has not and does not close customer accounts for political reasons.""

The unfortunate timing for the bank is that this lawsuit arrives just as the company seeks final US regulatory approvals for an acquisition of Discover Financial Services (DFS) that would create the biggest credit card lender in the US and a formidable new rival to American Express (AXP), Visa (V), and Mastercard (MA).

Capital One was initially hoping for a closing of the merger in late 2024 or early 2025, but it has been extended to May 19, 2025, to allow more time for regulatory approvals.

The deal offers a test of how the Trump administration will treat a union of two financial giants. It has already signaled that companies are not going to get a free pass when it comes to big mergers.

For example, ​Trump's Justice Department has already filed a lawsuit seeking to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) from acquiring rival Juniper Networks (JNPR). And Trump's new Federal Trade Commission Chair, Andrew Ferguson, has also kept in place stricter Biden-era standards for policing US mergers.

Capital One has scored one victory thus far from the new administration. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau dropped a lawsuit it filed less than a week before Trump’s inauguration. It had claimed in the suit that the bank had cheated customers out of $2 billion by advertising a high-yield savings account that, in fact, paid very little interest.

Capital One may not be the only big bank to face new legal and political challenges during the Trump era.

In a post on the X social media platform Friday, the president's son, Eric Trump, warned of more pressure to come.

""This lawsuit, and those that follow, are necessary steps to protect the integrity of American business practices,"" he wrote. ""We will not stand by while big banks misuse their power to stifle businesses and harm innocent Americans.""

Conservatives have been aggressively seeking remedies to their claims that customers have been denied accounts or services due to their personal beliefs or because they hail from a certain industry deemed risky by regulators, such as cryptocurrencies.

Trump himself publicly confronted Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan on this topic at the World Economic Forum in January.

""I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America,"" he said to Moynihan as the two participated in a question and answer session following a Trump speech.

The president also appeared to include JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon in his confrontation.

""I don't know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody else, I hope you open your banks to conservatives because what you're doing is wrong,"" Trump added.

JPMorgan and Bank of America are the nation’s two largest banks. Both companies denied the claims they cut off their services to customers over personal beliefs and claimed that any debanking happened due to onerous regulations imposed by regulators.

The GOP does appear sympathetic to that view, and several lawmakers said as much during hearings before Senate and House committees. Massachusetts Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren also signaled her support for the topic, saying she agreed with Trump.

Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott Tim Scott (R-S.C.) unveiled legislation last week designed to address debanking by removing references to ""reputational risk"" as a measure for determining the safety and soundness of banks.

Trump himself touched on the debanking issue at a White House crypto summit last Friday, saying that under the Biden administration ""regulators strong armed banks.""

""They weaponized government against the entire industry,"" the president told some of the crypto industry's top executives.

""But I know that feeling also,"" Trump added.

Banks are still optimistic that the path forward to fix that issue could ultimately turn out to be a positive for them if regulators relax some of their requirements that force banks to shed certain customers or else pay millions in fines.

But the Capital One lawsuit highlights the political complexities they may still face as conservatives keep their focus on the issue.

The Trump Organization said in its suit Friday that it had millions with Capital One when the bank informed it in March 2021 that the accounts would be shut in three months.

That resulted in ""considerable financial harm and losses,"" the Trump Organization said in its suit.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22business%20news%22%20site%3Afinance.yahoo.com,'Chaos creates opportunities': Wall Street pros weigh in on market sell-off under Trump's tariff war,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chaos-creates-opportunities-wall-street-pros-weigh-in-on-market-sell-off-under-trumps-tariff-war-150003507.html,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 09:32:27 GMT","

It's been a brutal start to March as markets reverse their Trump-driven euphoria following the president's recent tariff war escalation and fears over slower economic growth in the face of stubborn inflation.

Both the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) have each erased their post-election gains, with the latter entering correction territory last week after falling 10% from its record closing high of 20,173.89 on Dec. 16.

February's jobs report, released Friday, offered some relief with the US economy adding 151,000 jobs, but it was still a brutal week for stocks. The S&P 500 capped off its worst week since September.

""It's an uncertain time,"" John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, told Yahoo Finance in an interview on Wednesday. ""But gosh, we had the great financial crisis, we had COVID-19, we had the supply chain disruptions [coming out of that], and we did remarkably well.""

In other words, the stock market has remained resilient in the face of significant disruptions. And despite recent sell-off action, most strategists believe it will stay that way: Stoltzfus expects the S&P 500 to finish the year at 7,100, which implies about 25% upside based on current trading levels.

""Chaos creates opportunities,"" added Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush. ""[Buying the dip] has been our playbook for decades. The macro scares you and then you look back and say, 'Why don't I own the winners? Why don't I own the dip?'""

But the dip has escalated quickly.

The S&P (^GSPC) has swung 2% over the past seven consecutive sessions after hitting a record high on Feb. 19. According to data compiled by Yahoo Finance, this was the longest such stretch in intraday moves for the benchmark index since August 2024 — the last time economists warned of a growth scare. 

Prior to August, volatility swings of that level also showed up in March 2023, around the time of Silicon Valley Bank's collapse.

Given these moves, some Wall Street watchers have said now is the time to take advantage of lower valuations, with the resiliency picture largely still intact.

""[Tariffs] add uncertainty,"" Wedbush's Ives said. ""But in my opinion it doesn't change the demand cycle. In other words, this is not going to end the tech bull market. It's a scare. But I believe it's more opportunities than the time to head for the hills.""

Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet

Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel, who has a year-end S&P 500 price target of 6,800, added in a note to clients on Tuesday that ""stocks suffer bear markets when complacency sets in.""

""The geopolitical headlines and the urgent selling of the past week in response to fears around tariffs, Ukraine/Russia and DOGE are the opposite of complacent and at odds with earnings that project 8.2% year-over-year growth with a Fed likely to cut twice to preserve the 'soft landing,'"" he said, adding market dips ""are buying opportunities in 2025’s volatile environment.""

And although growth fears are rising, Ed Yardeni from Yardeni Research believes the economy will ""turn out to be remarkably resilient,"" citing expectations of increased consumer and capital spending, along with a potential deescalation of tariff concerns.

For now, though, ""there's a lot of bargains to be had here with this very sharp sell-off in a very short period of time."" And with Trump's track record of monitoring his popularity with stock market gains, Yardeni said it's only a matter of time before the administration steps in, regardless of what the president may say.

In recent weeks, surveys and sentiment indicators — often referred to as ""soft"" economic data — have been the root cause of investor panic, marking the return of ""bad news for the economy is bad news for stocks.""

ISM's manufacturing prices paid came in at their highest since June 2022, while new orders fell into contraction, suggesting a ""stagflationary"" environment in which growth slows but price increases remain elevated. That data arrived on top of bleak survey results for the month of February, with declining consumer confidence and sentiment results weighing on markets.

Here's the concern: Rising inflation would squeeze consumers' purchasing power and weigh on demand at a time when the consumer is already feeling the pinch of higher prices. Less demand for goods means lower sales for companies, which would pressure profit margins and eventually force businesses to cut jobs and lay off employees.

If that happens, the Federal Reserve has already indicated it would step in to stop the bleeding, hence the market's latest recalibration of future rate cuts. Following Friday's jobs report, markets continued to price in three rate cuts this year.

Not every sector is getting pummeled by the Trump tariff rout that is currently enveloping the broader markets.

Consumer staples — from companies that sell soda to those offering healthcare services and energy — continue to attract their fair share of inflows as traders seek out businesses less tied to economic cyclicality. Case in point in Monday's highly volatile trading session.

Shares of Coca-Cola (KO) are up 2% on the session, while rival PepsiCo (PEP) is up 3%. Procter & Gamble (PG) shares are up 1.2%. The iShares US Healthcare ETF (IYH) is up slightly, powered by gains in top holdings Merck (MRK) and Amgen (AMGN).

The IYH has tacked on 1.2% in March. The three aforementioned stocks have all notched gains so far in March, compared to a 3.1% drop for the S&P 500.

Watch: Gap CEO is monitoring tariffs every hour

The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) — comprised of key US utilities like Duke Energy (DUK) and Constellation Energy (CEG) — is up about 1%. It's relatively unchanged in March, outperforming the S&P 500.

Health Care (XLV), Utilities (XLU), and Consumer Staples (XLP) are some of the best-performing sectors of the S&P 500 this year.

The shift to staples has been dramatic enough to push the ratio of consumer staples stocks to consumer discretionary stock from a multiyear low to a multi-month high, according to new data from Sundial Capital Research.

""On a relative basis, staples are more defensive, and portfolio managers live in a relative world. And as much as tariff concerns are dominating, the market is growing increasingly concerned about an economic slowdown. So traders are going back to the traditional playbook, irrespective of tariffs, toward staples, in which products will still need to be bought even if the economy slows,"" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told me.

Meantime, the broader market continues to take it on the chin.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) plunged more than 600 points in afternoon trading Monday as traders grew antsy on the economic growth outlook with Trump tariffs lurking. Trump not ruling out a recession in a Sunday Fox News interview hasn't helped the increasingly bearish sentiment.

The Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) finished below its closely watched 200-day moving average last week for the first time in nearly two years, per data from Creative Planning chief market strategist Charlie Bilello. The 200-day moving average is a technical measure of longer-term sentiment on an index or stock.

It represented the end of the second-longest uptrend in history for the Nasdaq 100 at 497 days. During this stretch, the Nasdaq 100 notched a 73% return.

The Dow, Nasdaq Composite, and S&P 500 (^GSPC) are all lower on the year. The Nasdaq has been the worst performer with a nearly 10% drop.

""Anything is possible in Trump World. We can't rule out the possibility that a bear market started on Feb. 20, the day after the S&P 500 rose to a record high. It could be like the 'flash crashes' that occurred during 1962 and 1987. It could happen quickly and reverse just as quickly. So the sell-off could provide buying opportunities, especially in overvalued names that are now less so,"" said longtime market watcher Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research.

Listen: Why this toy CEO is worried about tariffs

BCA Research's veteran strategist Peter Berezin said in a new piece of research that he sees a 75% chance of a recession within the next three months. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius has raised his US recession probability to 20% from 15%.

""In this administration, there's a different focus, I think, on the tariff discussion where the administration is looking at trade imbalances and trying to use tariffs against many different companies in a more universal fashion. And so that has created, at least in the short term, a lot more uncertainty,"" Newell Brands (NWL) CEO Chris Peterson told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.

Tesla (TSLA) shipment data out of China is not good and is the latest piece of bad news for the pure EV maker.

The China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) reported Tesla’s shipments from China fell to 30,688 in February, plunging 49% compared to a year ago, per Bloomberg News, and down more than half compared to January (63,238). Meanwhile, wholesale sales of new energy vehicles in China for the month hit 840,000 units, up 82% compared to last year.

Tesla stock closed down 4.4% on Tuesday and is now down 32.6% for the year.

Tesla’s shipments from China account for a mix of domestic purchasing and exports to other territories, meaning pure domestic sales of Tesla EVs may be worse. Typically January and February are slightly weaker sales months in China due to the lunar holiday, but Tesla’s sales dip comes as February sales in the region were higher.

The CPCA notes that consumer preferences in China have shifted toward electrified vehicles like hybrids and pure EVs, indicating stronger demand for those vehicles. In addition, the trade group notes that the rise of DeepSeek and other AI technologies can be integrated cheaply into car cockpits and are popular with consumers.

Tesla has struggled with getting its autopilot and full self-driving (FSD) tech in China due to regulatory and data privacy concerns. Tesla only recently rolled out a limited version of autopilot in China, and it has been plagued with various issues.

Weakness in China, one of Tesla’s largest sales regions, is a deep concern for the company and comes after European sales tumbled as well.

Bank of America analyst John Murphy slashed his price target for Tesla to $380 from $490, citing those weaker European sales and “sentiment on the brand potentially souring,” among other reasons.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s political activities seem to be affecting his — and Tesla’s — standing both in Europe and the US. However, that effect is not as pronounced in China, where Musk typically is viewed favorably.

But Musk’s connections to the White House could become a hindrance as there is speculation the Chinese government may withhold full FSD approval in China as a bargaining chip in tariff negotiations with the White House, as reported by the Financial Times. The White House doubled its tariffs on Chinese goods to 20% just this week.

Political issues aside, Tesla’s troubles in China likely come down to more market-based forces: Domestic automakers like BYD and others are making cheaper products that are well-liked and include technology like autonomous driving features that Tesla can’t match.

Indeed, BYD is offering its self-driving technology (known as “God’s eye”) in its cheapest vehicles, which cost less than $15,000.

Tesla and Musk may be getting squeezed on both sides — with Musk’s connections to the White House during a rising trade war and Tesla’s EVs losing their popularity in the mainland, a trend that’s gaining steam.

Real estate, mortgage, and personal finance firm Rocket Companies said it would buy online brokerage Redfin in a $1.75 billion deal, the latest consolidation in the residential real estate business amid one of the slowest periods for home sales in three decades.

The deal would combine Rocket, a major mortgage provider, with Redfin’s online home listings business and brokerage of more than 2,200 agents. House hunters searching Redfin’s database or working with a Redfin agent could ultimately be referred to Rocket for a mortgage or title services.

""Rocket and Redfin have a unified vision of a better way to buy and sell homes,"" Varun Krishna, chief executive officer of Rocket, said in a statement. ""Together, we will improve the experience by connecting traditionally disparate steps of the search and financing process with leading technology that removes friction, reduces costs and increases value to American homebuyers.""

Detroit-based Rocket’s all-stock offer values Redfin shares at $12.50, more than double their Friday closing price of $5.82. Redfin shareholders can swap each of their shares for 0.7926 shares of Rocket stock. The deal is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2025.

Redfin (RDFN) stock surged 76% to $10.30 on Monday after the deal was announced. Rocket (RKT) shares fell more than 14% to $13.50.

Rocket grew its revenue in 2024 by 34% to $5.1 billion, but it still trails the company's boom years. In 2020, Rocket had revenue of over $15.7 billion.

Redfin, based in Seattle, was founded in 2004 in the early days of online real estate listings and went public in 2017. Its shares surged during the pandemic homebuying spree of 2020 and 2021, but it has struggled since mortgage rates spiked in 2022 and home sales fell to some of the lowest levels in decades. Prior to the deal with Rocket, its stock had lost more than 90% of its value from its 2021 peak.

Mortgage lenders, brokers, and other housing-focused companies have been combining or, in some cases, shutting down entirely in recent years amid a prolonged slump in home sales stemming from high rates and near-record prices.

A bitter rift between two Silicon Valley billionaires could shape the future of the fast-growing artificial intelligence industry.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, who has his own AI startup, is duking it out in court and in a public war of words with Sam Altman, leader of ChatGPT maker OpenAI.

Musk, who is the world's richest man and has the ear of President Trump, has referred to the San Francisco-based OpenAI chief executive as ""Scam Altman."" Meanwhile, Altman told Bloomberg that Musk is not ""a happy person."" Musk and Altman, along with several others, co-founded OpenAI in 2015.

Underlying the personal feud is Musk's legal challenge to OpenAI, which threatens to slow the company's efforts at a time when the race for the lead in the AI space is heating up. Musk sued OpenAI last year for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty over OpenAI's efforts to change its corporate structure. He's looking to the courts for an injunction to stop the company's ""unlawful"" conduct and seeking compensation for damages and fees.

OpenAI has disputed many of the claims in Musk's lawsuit.

""I wish he would just compete by building the better product, but I think there's been a lot of tactics, many, many lawsuits, all sorts of other crazy stuff. ... We'll try to just put our head down and keep working,"" Altman told Bloomberg.

OpenAI has an unusual business model.

It began as a nonprofit company and later launched a for-profit subsidiary to oversee its commercial operations. Its product ChatGPT has millions of users and is a household name, helping bring generative AI into the mainstream.

But with competition ratcheting up from Google, Amazon and others, OpenAI needed to raise significantly more money. To make that process easier, it embarked on a plan to explore changing the for-profit subsidiary to a public benefit corporation.

That move irked early OpenAI investors like Musk, who said he invested more than $44 million from 2016 to 2020 in OpenAI under the belief it would remain a nonprofit serving humanity and not become beholden to shareholders concerned about profits.

""OpenAI’s conduct could have seismic implications for Silicon Valley and, if allowed to stand, could represent a paradigm shift for technology start-ups,"" Musk said in court records filed last year.

On Tuesday, a judge ruled against Musk's request for a preliminary injunction that would prevent OpenAI from changing its corporate structure. However, some allegations Musk made against the company will go forward in a trial, unless the dispute is settled.

In court filings, Musk alleged that OpenAI has veered away from its founding principles. Musk said he invested significant money, helped recruit talent under that premise, served as co-chair and came up with the name ""OpenAI.""

But Musk had a falling out with OpenAI's leaders after they could not agree on the future of the start-up.

Musk said in court filings that in 2017 to 2018 Altman and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman wanted to ""recast the nonprofit as a moneymaking endeavor."" Musk bristled, writing in an email, ""Either go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a non-profit,"" according to legal documents. Musk stepped down from the board in 2018.

OpenAI says Musk's lawsuit is simply meant to slow down a rival. The company alleges that Musk, while he was still on the board, wanted to take control of the start-up or bring it under Musk's electric car company Tesla, which OpenAI did not believe was in its best interest.

Since leaving OpenAI, Musk became a direct competitor. In 2023, he launched xAI, which developed AI assistant Grok and has raised billions in funding.

""We're sad that it's come to this with someone whom we’ve deeply admired — someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI’s mission without him,"" the company said on its website last year.

OpenAI said it welcomed the court's decision denying Musk's request for a preliminary injunction.

""This has always been about competition,"" OpenAI said in a statement this week. ""Elon's own emails show that he wanted to merge a for-profit OpenAI into Tesla. That would have been great for his personal benefit, but not for our mission or U.S. interests.""

Last month, Musk led an investment consortium to make an unsolicited offer to buy OpenAI for $97.4 billion, which OpenAI's board rejected. OpenAI said it is not for sale.

Legal experts and tech analysts says the case could play out in multiple ways.

""The ultimate question is, is this a case of altruism versus greed, as Musk portrays, or is this a case of kind of corporate monopolistic prevention, as Altman and OpenAI present?"" said Neil Elan, a partner with law firm Stubbs Alderton and Markiles LLP. ""It's too early to tell.""

Gene Munster, managing partner of Minneapolis-based Deepwater Asset Management, said that, at the highest level, it's ""understandable"" that Musk is frustrated.

""I think his motivations are, he felt like he got ripped off,"" Munster said.

But Rob Enderle, principal analyst at advisory services firm Enderle Group, said he thinks it's ""hypocritical"" that Musk is bringing up these claims against OpenAI, when Musk is hugely wealthy. He's worth more than $340 billion, according to Forbes.

""His real goal is to take the company over, and it has nothing to do with what he's actually presenting,"" Enderle said, adding he thinks the case should be dismissed.

The judge said she is prepared to expedite the trial to this fall to deal with the central issues of the case, though ""ancillary claims"" would have to be tabled to fit that timeline.

Marc Toberoff, Musk's attorney, said they plan to accept the court's offer.

""We're pleased the Court has offered an expedited trial on the core claims driving this case, which in its words present 'urgent' issues in the public's interest,"" Toberoff said in a statement. ""We look forward to a jury confirming that Altman accepted Musk's charitable contributions knowing full well they had to be used for the public's benefit rather than his own enrichment.""

If a jury rules in Musk's favor, it would have huge implications for OpenAI.

Such a result could have an unraveling effect of potentially implicating many of OpenAI's relationships and contracts with business partners, including Microsoft, which is one of its backers, experts said.

""This might not only spell trouble for OpenAI, but it also might result in an avalanche of unintended consequences,"" said Elan.

Alternatively, if the case went OpenAI's way, there could be attorneys' fees and damages awarded to the firm and Altman. Musk might not be able to recover his investment in OpenAI, Elan said.

While it is possible Musk and OpenAI could settle, Elan thinks it's unlikely, given the unique personalities involved.

""Settlement requires a concession of the weaknesses of one's perception, perspective and claims, and it will be difficult, in my view, for such strong, big personalities to make such concessions,"" Elan said. ""It's unlikely that both sides will be able to put that aside for the benefit of obtaining immediate closure.""

 Learn how IPMB controls its gold supply chain and offers a novel approach to tokenized gold investments.  



As the global demand for gold remains strong and the asset’s price has reached all-time highs, investors face a difficult choice between various gold investment vehicles. Traditional methods for investing in gold come with a number of drawbacks. Physical gold incurs substantial buy and sell fees, gold futures require advanced financial literacy, while gold-backed cryptocurrencies often lack reliable reserve audits, or their sources of gold are opaque.

The International Precious Metals Bullion Group (IPMB) combines vast experience in the gold industry with opportunities provided by blockchain technology to offer a novel approach to gold investing that is reliable and cost-efficient. By controlling the crucial steps of the supply chain, IPMB offers favorable pricing and transparency for investors in its gold-backed GoldPro Token (GPRO) and GEM NFTs. 

A recent report published by Cointelegraph provides insight into this precious metals project. It gives an overview of the challenges gold tokenization solutions face, from physical gold issues to providing liquidity and backup guarantees for digital tokens. The report discusses an in-house solution developed by IPMB to track the gold supply chain, its GPRO token fully collateralized by gold, and the gold-backed GEM NFTs. The report concludes with an overview of the IPMB ecosystem and its future development plans.                       

The supply chain for physical gold relies on multiple intermediaries, which results in price premiums that are ultimately borne by investors. Furthermore, physical gold investments incur premiums at purchase and come with substantial buy/sell spreads, as well as custody fees of up to 1% per year.



In addition to increased costs, complex gold supply chains make it easier to disguise the origin of gold ore and hide unethical mining. For instance, Ghana, a leading gold producer, has faced criticism for unregulated artisanal mining, which harms the environment and often infringes on human rights.

In contrast to most existing gold tokenization solutions that rely on third-party supplies, IPMB co-owns gold mining facilities in Ghana and controls the entire gold ore delivery process. As a result, IPMB eliminates unnecessary intermediaries and achieves transparency and sustainability for the whole supply chain.  

The forthcoming launch of the Goldtrace360, an in-house tracking solution designed by IPMB, will automate the tracking process and significantly reduce latency. Goldtrace360 will utilize IoT technologies to record every step in the gold production process on the blockchain.

GEM NFTs are digital promissory notes IPMB offers for investment grade 24-karat gold. GEM NFTs are ownership titles for gold bars on the Polygon blockchain. They range from 1 gram to 12,500 grams to cater to a wide range of potential investors.

GEM NFTs can be obtained by staking GPRO, the native token of the IPMB ecosystem on the Polygon blockchain. While GPRO tokens are 1:1 backed with gold, their price remains free-floating.

To obtain an NFT of a specific denomination with a discount, the user must stake a corresponding number of GPRO tokens for a period of between three and 12 months. Longer staking is rewarded with a higher discount. If 100 GPRO tokens are staked for 12 months, 89 GPRO will be converted into a GEM NFT and 11 GPRO will be returned to the user. A limited number of NFTs are allocated to staking each month.



If the user triggers GPRO to GEM NFT conversion at the end of the staking period, GPROs get burned. At the same time, the GEM NFT gets assigned a unique 24-karat gold coin or bar and a London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) serial number, which is also reflected in the NFT metadata.

GEM NFTs that are at least one year old can be redeemed for physical gold, and the redemption is free of charge for NFTs of over 100 grams of gold in denomination. If not redeemed, NFTs stay free of insurance, custody or management fees for the first five years following the mint date.

 Bitcoin risks a fall below the critical $78,258 support, opening the doors for a further fall to $73,777. 

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls tried to push the price above $85,000, but the bears held their ground. A minor positive is that larger investors seem to be accumulating at lower levels. 

Research firm Santiment said in a post on X that wallets with 10 BTC or more have bought roughly 5,000 Bitcoin since March 3. The researchers added that if buying by the large players continues, the second half of March could be much better than the recent performance of Bitcoin.

However, not everyone is bullish on Bitcoin in the near term. BitMEX co-founder and Maelstrom chief investment officer Arthur Hayes said in a post on X that Bitcoin could retest $78,000 and even below $75,000. 

He added that Bitcoin’s price action could become violent if it drops in the $70,000 to $75,000 zone as a lot of Bitcoin open interest is stuck in that range.

Meanwhile, short-term investor sentiment remains bearish. According to CoinShares data, cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) witnessed $876 million in outflows last week, taking the four-week total outflows to $4.75 billion. Bitcoin ETPs recorded the lion’s share of outflows at $756 million.

Can Bitcoin start a recovery from the current levels, pulling altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts to find out.

The S&P 500 Index (SPX) turned down from the 20-day exponential moving average (5,900) on March 3 and broke below the 5,773 support on March 6, completing a double-top pattern.

The index bounced off the 5,670 level on March 7, but the bears successfully defended the breakdown level of 5,773. The index turned down and broke below the 5,670 support on March 10, opening the doors for a fall to 5,400.

Buyers will have to push and sustain the price above 5,773 to suggest solid demand at lower levels. The index could then rise to the 20-day EMA, which is again expected to act as a strong resistance. 

The US Dollar Index (DXY) turned down sharply on March 3 and continued lower, breaking below the 105.42 support on March 5.

DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The fall below 105.42 suggests that the breakout above 108 may have been a bull trap. Buyers are trying to defend the 103.73 level, but the relief rally is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA (106.03). 

If the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA, it will suggest a negative sentiment. That increases the risk of a break below 103.37. If that happens, the index may plunge to 101.

Buyers have an uphill task ahead of them. They will have to push and maintain the price above the 20-day EMA to clear the path for a rally to 108.

BTC price broke below the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on March 9, indicating that the sellers have overpowered the buyers.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The bulls are trying to defend the $81,500 to $78,258 support zone, but the recovery attempt faced selling at the breakdown level on March 10. That suggests the bears are trying to flip the support line into resistance. If the price skids below $78,258, the BTC/USDT pair could collapse to $73,777.

Buyers are likely to have other plans. They will try to defend the support zone and push the price above the 20-day EMA ($88,605). If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to the resistance line.

Ether (ETH) fell and closed below the vital $2,111 support on March 9, signaling the start of the next leg of the downtrend.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

Buyers tried to push the price above $2,111 on March 10, but the long wick on the candlestick suggests solid selling by the bears. There is minor support at $1,993, but if the level cracks, the ETH/USDT pair could sink to $1,750 and eventually to $1,550.

The bulls will have to push and maintain the price above the 20-day EMA ($2,329) to signal that the break below $2,111 may have been a bear trap. The pair could then rally to the 50-day SMA ($2,711).

XRP (XRP) continues to slide toward the crucial support at $2, suggesting that the bears are trying to seize control.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

A break and close below $2 will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. There is minor support at $1.77, but the level is likely to be broken. If that happens, the XRP/USDT pair could plunge toward $1.28.

Contrary to this assumption, a solid bounce off $2 will signal that the bulls are vigorously defending this level. The 20-day EMA ($2.40) is likely to act as a stiff hurdle, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could reach $2.80.

BNB’s (BNB) failure to rise above the 20-day EMA ($601) attracted another round of selling on March 9, pulling the price below $546.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The down-sloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the price maintains below $546, the BNB/USDT pair could plummet to $500. Buyers are expected to aggressively defend the zone between $500 and $460.

The 20-day EMA is the first significant resistance to watch out for on the upside. If this level gets taken out, the pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($633). A close above the 50-day SMA signals a short-term trend change.

Solana (SOL) broke below the uptrend line on March 9 and reached the strong support zone between $120 and $110.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The bulls are expected to fiercely defend the support zone, but the relief rally could face selling at the 20-day EMA ($150). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the $110 level will be at risk of breaking down. If that happens, the SOL/USDT pair could decline to $100 and later to $80.

Instead, if the price rises from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest solid buying near the support zone. The pair could then climb to the 50-day SMA ($188).

Dogecoin (DOGE) fell below the $0.18 support on March 9, indicating the resumption of the downtrend.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The down-sloping moving averages and the RSI in the oversold territory suggest that bears have the upper hand. The 20-day EMA ($0.21) is the critical overhead resistance to watch out for. If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the DOGE/USDT pair could sink to $0.14.

Alternatively, a break and close above the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair could climb to the 50-day SMA ($0.26), which may also act as a stiff resistance.

Cardano (ADA) fell below the moving averages on March 8, indicating aggressive selling by the bears.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

Both moving averages have started to turn down, and the RSI has slipped into negative territory, indicating that the bears have a slight edge. The support on the downside is at $0.58 and then $0.50.

Any relief rally is likely to face selling at the moving averages. Buyers will have to push and maintain the price above the moving averages to signal a comeback. The ADA/USDT pair could then rise toward $1.02.

Pi (PI) fell to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $1.20 on March 9, indicating that the bears have kept up the pressure.

PI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

Buyers are trying to start a recovery, but the long wick on the March 10 candlestick shows selling at higher levels. That increases the risk of a break below $1.20. If that happens, the PI/USDT pair could plunge to the 78.6% retracement level of $0.72.

Time is running out for the bulls. To prevent more downside, they will have to quickly push the price above the $2 overhead resistance. If they do that, it will suggest that the correction may be over.

 Bitcoin price weakness continues as stocks suffer amid a fresh Wall Street sell-off and $80,000 support begins to crumble — traders are now eyeing RSI signals. 

Bitcoin (BTC) sought a rematch with multimonth lows on March 10 as familiar selling accompanied the start of Wall Street trading.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD down around 4% on the day to reach $79,170 on Bitstamp.

Weakness into the weekly close continued as risk assets across the board suffered a flight to safety.

Stocks fell substantially at the open, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index down 2% and 3.5%, respectively.

Reacting, trading resource The Kobeissi Letter said that US government spending cutbacks at the hands of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) played a role in the slump.

“While everyone is focused on the trade war, do not discount the impact of reduced government spending expectations,” it wrote in part of its latest analysis on X.

Kobeissi noted that crypto markets had erased $1 trillion in market cap in just two months.

“The rally after the U.S. Strategic Reserve was announced has been completely erased,” it added on BTC/USD.

Market participants’ views were mixed as it became unclear where BTC price action might put in a more reliable floor.

Popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital advised X followers to look for rising relative strength index (RSI) values against lower prices for reversal cues.

“Going forward, it'll be worth watching for Bitcoin to form Lower Lows on the price action and Higher Lows on the RSI for a Bullish Divergence to develop,” he wrote about daily timeframes.

A further post noted that the current bull cycle had produced bounces whenever the daily RSI was below 28. 

Specifically, “Bitcoin's price would either bottom or be between -2% to -8% away from a bottom,” he explained. 

Daily RSI stood at 33.2 at the time of writing.

Elsewhere, trading firm QCP Capital pinned the blame for the broader crypto market downside on sell-offs tied to last month’s hack of crypto exchange Bybit.

“Today's price selloff may also be exacerbated by holders preemptively front-running further hacker-driven supply, now that the hackers have shown willingness to cash out rather than risk further losses — having already seen their stolen assets depreciate by 25%,” it wrote in its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers. 

QCP data showed market expectations becoming more optimistic only from Q3 onward.

“Until crypto finds a new narrative, we're likely to see an increased correlation between BTC and equities in the near term,” it concluded, referencing upcoming US macroeconomic data releases.

 US stablecoin policies may drive Bitcoin adoption and investment as regulators push to maintain the dollar’s dominance, benefiting BTC and institutional crypto growth. 

The US push to maintain the dollar’s global dominance through stablecoin adoption could have unintended benefits for Bitcoin as it emerges as a potential national reserve asset.

During the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the American government would use stablecoins to ensure the US dollar remains the world’s global reserve currency.

“We are going to put a lot of thought into the stablecoin regime, and as President Trump has directed, we are going to keep the US [dollar] the dominant reserve currency in the world,” Bessent said.

The treasury secretary also repeated the Trump administration’s promise to end the war on crypto and committed to rolling back previous Internal Revenue Service guidance and punitive regulatory measures.

The comments came just before Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve using cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases. While the order does not involve direct federal Bitcoin purchases, it represents a shift in how the government views the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin may benefit from the growing stablecoin adoption and push for more regulatory clarity, according to Omri Hanover, general manager at the Gems Trade blockchain launchpad. 

“If Trump’s policy strengthens US financial dominance, Europe’s reluctance and ‘wait-and-see’ approach could weaken its economic leverage,” he told Cointelegraph, adding:

Meanwhile, two major bills await congressional approval: the Stablecoin bill and the Market Structure bill, which aim to help lift the regulatory uncertainty around the US crypto industry.

Meanwhile, pro-crypto lawmakers have focused on two major legislative priorities — stablecoins and general market structure clarity — which would help lift the regulatory uncertainty around the US crypto industry. However, no related bills have yet been passed by Congress.

The growing profits of stablecoin issuers could contribute to Bitcoin investments, further strengthening its status as a store of value.

Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDt (USDT), said it would invest 15% of its net profit into Bitcoin to diversify its backing assets.

Tether’s Bitcoin holdings proved to be lucrative when the firm posted a record $4.5 billion profit for the first quarter of 2024.

Approximately $1 billion stemmed from operating profits derived from US Treasury holdings, while the remaining $3.52 billion comprised the market-to-market gains in the firm’s Bitcoin holdings and gold positions.

 The X social media platform experienced several outages on March 10, with users struggling to access the site. 

The X social media platform has been hit with a “massive cyberattack” that has prevented some users from accessing the site, platform owner Elon Musk confirmed on March 10.

“We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved,” Musk said.

Although user functionality was quickly restored, Musk implied that the attack was still ongoing. 

At the time of writing, there were more than 33,000 reports of X outages on March 10, according to Downdetector.

Musk confirmed the cyberattack in response to a social media user who detailed a series of attacks against the entrepreneur’s interests, from protests against the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to vandalism of Tesla stores.

As NBC News reported, there have been at least 10 acts of vandalism against Tesla stores and vehicles, likely in response to the billionaire entrepreneur’s involvement in the Trump White House.

Shortly after winning the November presidential election, Donald Trump appointed Musk to head the Department of Government Efficiency with the mandate of reducing wasteful government spending. 

So far, Musk’s DOGE claims to have saved $105 billion in taxpayer dollars across 10,492 initiatives, according to a live tracker. 

DOGE reportedly has its sights set on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and has even called on the public to provide examples of “waste, fraud and abuse” at the agency. 

Musk previously described the SEC as a “totally broken organization” that, instead of prosecuting real criminals, misallocates its resources on things that don’t matter.

With regard to crypto, the SEC’s mandate under President Trump has changed dramatically. 

According to the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance, “We should expect the SEC under the second Trump administration to scale back rulemakings adopted under the Biden administration and former Chair Gary Gensler that many viewed as increasing impediments to one of the SEC’s core missions of capital formation.”

 Thailand’s SEC had previously approved Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, XLM and certain tokens used for settlement by the central bank. 

The Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved Tether’s USDt (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC) for cryptocurrency trades, allowing the stablecoins to be listed on regulated exchanges across the country.

Thailand’s SEC announced the approvals last week after soliciting feedback from the public on proposed regulatory changes that were finalized in February and scheduled to go into effect on March 16. 

As Cointelegraph previously reported, there have been growing calls within Thailand to legitimize cryptocurrency usage and urge stablecoin adoption to boost domestic revenue. This followed the creation of a regulatory sandbox in August 2024 for select service providers to experiment with cryptocurrencies. 

The stablecoins join only five other cryptocurrencies that are approved for trading in the country: Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), Stellar Lumen (XLM) and cryptocurrencies that are being tested for settlement by the Bank of Thailand. 

According to a March 10 announcement by Tether, the approval allows USDt to be adopted by digital asset businesses and be used as a payment rail within the country.

In addition to facilitating cryptocurrency trades, stablecoins are increasingly viewed as an alternative to traditional remittances, especially in emerging markets. 

A December report by Chainalysis called stablecoins a “transformative” use case for cross-border payments and remittances. In emerging markets across Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, using stablecoins for remittances is 60% cheaper than traditional methods.

According to venture capital firm a16z Crypto, 28.5 million unique stablecoin users sent over 600 million transactions in December alone. This still represents a tiny faction of the 3.4 trillion transactions of the global payments industry.

In terms of circulating supply, stablecoins are currently worth nearly $230 billion, according to DefiLlama. Tether’s USDt accounts for just over 63% of the total market.

 European lawmakers have yet to respond to Trump’s Bitcoin reserve order as the ECB pushes ahead with its digital euro plans for an October 2025 launch. 

European lawmakers have remained silent on the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve order, a landmark policy shift favoring early adopters of Bitcoin due to its economic model.

US President Donald Trump’s March 7 executive order outlined a plan to create a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency seized in criminal cases rather than purchasing Bitcoin (BTC) on the market.

Despite the significance of the move, European policymakers have yet to make any major public statements regarding Bitcoin reserves, raising questions about their stance on integrating BTC into national reserves.

This may signal a lack of European Bitcoin reserve-related efforts due to the lengthy process of adding new national reserve assets, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum. She said:

“[The] ECB [European Central Bank] historically and currently is very critical of BTC as a reserve asset, so it effectively closes the doors to all EU member states,” Plotnikova added.

Meanwhile, European lawmakers are preparing to launch the digital euro, a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

European lawmakers’ silence on Trump’s Bitcoin reserve order is likely due to its focus on the digital euro, according to James Wo, the founder and CEO of venture capital firm DFG.

“This stems from the ECB’s firm stance against holding Bitcoin in its reserves, as reiterated by ECB President Christine Lagarde,” Wo told Cointelegraph, adding:

Despite skepticism, ECB President Christine Lagarde is pushing ahead with the digital euro’s rollout, expected in October 2025. Lagarde has emphasized that the CBDC will coexist with cash and offer privacy protections to address concerns about government overreach.

“The European Union is looking to launch the digital euro, our central bank digital currency, by October this year,” Lagarde said during a news conference, adding:

The United States and the European Union are taking opposite approaches to digital assets. While the EU is working to integrate a centralized digital currency, Trump has taken a firm stance against CBDCs.

While CBDCs have been praised for their potential to increase financial inclusion, critics have raised concerns about their surveillance capabilities and the potential for government overreach.

In July 2023, Brazil’s central bank published the source code for its CBDC pilot, and it took just four days for people to notice the surveillance and control mechanisms embedded within its code, allowing the central bank to freeze or reduce user funds within CBDC wallets.

 Currently holding around 499,000 BTC, Michael Saylor’s Strategy plans to keep stacking Bitcoin with its new “ATM Program.” 

Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the world’s largest public corporate Bitcoin holder, is looking to raise up to $21 billion in fresh capital to purchase more BTC.

On March 10, Strategy announced that it had entered into a new sales agreement that would allow the firm to issue and sell shares of its 8% Series A perpetual strike preferred stock to raise funds for general corporate purposes, including potential Bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions.

As part of the agreement deal, dubbed the “ATM Program,” Strategy expects to make sales “in a disciplined manner over an extended period,” taking into account the trading price and volumes of the perpetual strike preferred stock at the time of sale.

“Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the ATM Program for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin and for working capital,” the firm said in the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The announcement comes amid Strategy holding 499,096 BTC ($41.2 billion), which it acquired for an aggregate amount of $33.1 billion at an average price of $66,423 per BTC.

The company previously disclosed plans to issue and sell shares of its class A common stock to raise up to $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities over the next three years in order to accumulate more Bitcoin under its “21/21 plan.”

So far in 2025, Strategy has publicly announced six Bitcoin acquisitions, buying a total of 52,696 BTC since Jan. 13. The company’s current BTC yield amounts to 6.9% year-to-date, with Bitcoin trading at $82,972.

Strategy’s BTC yield — an indicator representing the percentage change of the ratio between its BTC holdings and assumed diluted shares — amounted to 74% in 2024.

In 2025, the company expects to reach a BTC yield target of 15%.

Formerly known as MicroStrategy, Strategy has emerged as one of the most prominent companies in the crypto industry after it announced its Bitcoin reserve strategy and purchased its first BTC in August 2020.

Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy laid the foundation for growing BTC adoption by many traditional finance (TradFi) companies, such as Elon Musk’s Tesla and Japanese Metaplanet.

Saylor, Strategy’s co-founder and former CEO, is one of the key crypto industry leaders guiding the United States administration in becoming a major crypto economy.

A major Bitcoin advocate, Saylor is known for pushing the US government to boost its BTC holdings in its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to acquire up to 25% of Bitcoin’s total supply or increase its current 200,000 BTC holdings to 525,000 BTC.

 Michael Saylor’s Strategy holds almost 500,000 Bitcoin worth over $41 billion at current market prices. 

Software intelligence firm turned Bitcoin investment behemoth Strategy remains $7.8 billion in profit on its Bitcoin holdings despite the cryptocurrency’s recent drop to $80,000.

On March 10, Bitcoin (BTC) recorded its largest weekly decline on record, shedding more value in the past seven days than at any other time in its trading history. Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows that BTC went from $93,379 on March 3 to a low of $80,610 on March 10, a 13.6% drop in Bitcoin prices in one week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin had recovered slightly to trade at around $82,000. 

Despite the market downturn, Michael Saylor’s Strategy remained ahead on its BTC purchases. The company held 499,096 BTC, purchased at an average of $66,423 per token. In total, Strategy has spent $33.1 billion on Bitcoin purchases, while its holdings are now valued at $41.2 billion — a 24% unrealized gain even amid the correction.

Strategy’s Bitcoin investments highlight the importance of the dollar-cost averaging tactic in investing. Instead of buying at a lump sum, the company divided its BTC purchases at different times and continued to buy the tokens despite the prices. 

While Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings remain in the green, other companies that recently entered the Bitcoin market are seeing losses.

According to Bitcoin holdings tracker BitcoinTreasuries.NET, healthcare tech and software firm Semler Scientific, which started holding BTC on May 28, is down by 6.25% on its purchases. 

The company holds 3,192 BTC bought at an average price of $87,850. This means that its BTC purchased with over $280 million is now only worth around $262 million.

Metaplanet, dubbed “Asia’s Strategy,” is slightly down on its Bitcoin holdings. The company started to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet in April 2023, copying Strategy’s playbook. 

Metaplanet holds 2,888 bought at an average price of $83,049. It’s down by over $2 million, nearly 1%, on its Bitcoin investments. 

According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, Strategy has spent $23 billion on Bitcoin purchases since November 2024. However, with the recent price drop, the BTC acquired during this period is now worth only about $20 billion, implying an unrealized loss of over $3 billion on these recent acquisitions.

 DeFi is shrinking, with the total value of assets in decentralized protocols losing all gains since Donald Trump was elected US president. 

The total value of cryptocurrencies locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols has lost all its gains since Donald Trump was elected US president in November 2024.

Following the US election, DeFi TVL rose to as high as $138 billion on Dec. 17, but had retracted to $92.6 billion by March 10, as noted by analyst Miles Deutscher.

Solana has borne the brunt of criticism as its memecoin popularity fades, but Ethereum has faced its own challenges in recent cycles, with Ether (ETH) failing to reach a new all-time high despite Bitcoin (BTC) soaring past $109,000 on Jan. 20, the day Trump took office. Ethereum’s TVL has also dropped by $30.6 billion from cycle highs, DefiLlama data shows.

Ether’s record high price of $4,787 from November 2021 remains unbroken despite positive industry developments, such as spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launching in the US and Trump’s executive order for a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Nearly 800,000 ETH, worth approximately $1.8 billion, left exchanges in the week starting March 3, resulting in the highest seven-day net outflow recorded since December 2022, according to IntoTheBlock data.

The outflows are unusual given Ether’s 10% price decline during the period, hitting a low of $2,007, per CoinGecko. Typically, exchange inflows signal selling pressure, while outflows suggest long-term holding or movement into decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, such as staking or yield farming.

“Despite ongoing pessimism around Ether prices, this trend suggests many holders see current levels as a strategic buying opportunity,” IntoTheBlock stated in a March 10 X post.

Before March 3, Ethereum experienced net exchange inflows daily, indicating that investors were selling during the downturn, said Juan Pellicer, senior research analyst at IntoTheBlock, in comments to Cointelegraph. He noted that ETH’s drop to $2,100 may have triggered accumulation, which then led investors to withdraw funds from exchanges.

Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap has reduced congestion and gas fees but introduced liquidity fragmentation.

The upcoming Pectra upgrade aims to address this by enhancing layer-2 efficiency and interoperability. By doubling the number of blobs, it reduces transaction costs and helps consolidate liquidity. Additionally, account abstraction allows smart contract wallets to function more seamlessly across Ethereum and layer-2 networks, simplifying bridging and fund management.

The Pectra upgrade rollout encountered setbacks on March 5 when it launched on the Sepolia testnet. Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden reported errors on Geth nodes and empty blocks being mined due to a deposit contract triggering an incorrect event type. A fix has been deployed.

 With cumulative outflows reaching $4.75 billion over the past four weeks, the year-to-date inflows have dropped to $2.6 billion, according to CoinShares. 

Cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded a fourth straight week of outflows, with $876 million in losses during the past trading week.

After posting record weekly outflows of $2.9 billion last week, crypto ETPs continued their downward trend, bringing the four-week total outflows to $4.75 billion, CoinShares reported on March 10.

While the pace of outflows slowed, investor sentiment remained bearish, according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.

The analyst also suggested that the market has shown signs of capitulation.

Bitcoin (BTC) ETPs were the primary driver of outflows, accounting for $756 million, or 85% of last week’s total. Short-Bitcoin ETPs also saw outflows of $19.8 million, the most since December 2024. 

With cumulative outflows reaching $4.75 billion over the past four weeks, the year-to-date inflows dropped to $2.6 billion.

Total assets under management (AUM) declined by $39 billion to $142 billion, the lowest point since mid-November 2024, driven by both negative price movements and sustained outflows, Butterfill noted.

This bearish sentiment was also observed among a wide range of altcoins last week, with Ether (ETH) ETPs seeing $89 million of outflows.

Tron (TRX) and Aave (AAVE) were also among the most notable ETP losers, seeing $32 million and $2.4 million in outflows, respectively, according to the report.

Conversely, Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Sui (SUI) continued to see inflows totaling $16.4 million, $5.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, Butterfill wrote.

Among crypto ETP issuers, Fidelity Investments saw the largest outflows last week at $201 million, bringing its YTD outflows to $159 million.

BlackRock’s iShares exchange-traded funds (ETF) were the second largest loser, with weekly outflows amounting to $193 million.

Other major losses in the United States were seen by ARK Invest and 21Shares, which recorded $164 million in outflows, with YTD flows still standing positive at $110 million.

 Spain’s second-largest lender will allow its clients to buy, sell and manage cryptocurrencies on its mobile banking app. 

Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) announced on March 10 that it had received the nod from Spain’s securities regulator, the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), to offer Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) trading services to its customers. 

Spain’s second-largest bank’s crypto offerings in Spain will enable users to buy, sell and manage digital assets through its mobile app. The lender said it will use its own cryptographic key custody platform to maintain full control over customer holdings without third-party involvement. 

Initially, the rollout will be limited to a select group of users before gradually expanding to all private customers across the Iberian nation in the coming months.

BBVA’s foray into crypto began in Switzerland, where it launched Bitcoin custody and trading services for private banking clients in June 2021. The Swiss branch has since broadened its offerings to include Ether and the USDC (USDC) stablecoin.

In January 2025, BBVA’s Turkish subsidiary Garanti BBVA Kripto launched its crypto trading services to the public. With Spain now entering the fold, BBVA is broadening its crypto services in line with evolving European regulations.

BBVA’s expansion comes as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) reached full implementation at the end of 2024. While the framework is now in effect, crypto companies in the EU have until July 2026 to fully comply with its requirements under an 18-month transitional phase.

Since MiCA’s rollout, traditional finance firms have accelerated their efforts to secure MiCA licenses and integrate crypto services. Prime brokerage Hidden Road obtained its MiCA license in the Netherlands on Dec. 30, 2024. Standard Chartered followed on Jan. 9, receiving approval in Luxembourg, while Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody became Germany’s first MiCA-licensed crypto service provider on Jan. 17.

Crypto-native companies are also adjusting to the new regulatory landscape. In January 2025, major exchanges OKX, Crypto.com and HashKey all secured MiCA approval. Bybit, which suffered the largest hack in crypto history, was recently removed from France’s blacklist and has expressed intent to obtain a MiCA license next.

 Futures have emerged as a growing crypto trend, with major global groups, such as SGX and Japan’s Osaka Dojima, reportedly looking to introduce Bitcoin futures in 2025. 

Singapore Exchange (SGX), the largest exchange group in Singapore, reportedly plans to debut Bitcoin perpetual futures in the second half of 2025.

SGX is working to introduce Bitcoin (BTC) perpetual futures for institutional and professional investors in an effort to “expand institutional market access,” Bloomberg reported on March 10.

A spokesperson at SGX reportedly said that the company expects to offer a trusted alternative for trading cryptocurrency futures, with its Aa2 rating by Moody’s.

Strictly restricting retail investors, SGX’s planned Bitcoin products are awaiting approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the report stated.

Bitcoin futures fall under the category of cryptocurrency derivatives, which offer investors the ability to trade on the value derived from the price of an underlying cryptocurrency and speculate on future price movements without holding the asset.

Crypto futures allow investors to speculate on the price by a certain date and time, while perpetual futures offer no expiration date.

The potential arrival of perpetual Bitcoin futures to SGX comes amid Singapore becoming a global leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain acceptance, with the MAS adopting crypto-friendly regulations and doubling the number of crypto licenses in 2024.

According to Bloomberg, SGX is not the only exchange seeking the launch of Bitcoin futures trading in Singapore.

EDX Markets, a crypto asset firm backed by Citadel Securities, reportedly announced plans to offer crypto futures in the city-state in January 2025.

On March 4, Bloomberg News also reported that Japan’s Osaka Dojima Exchange — a Japanese-listed derivatives exchange — was also looking for approval to list Bitcoin futures in Japan.

If approved, Dojima could become one of the first traditional exchanges in Asia to handle Bitcoin futures.

Cointelegraph approached SGX and the MAS for a comment regarding the potential introduction of Bitcoin perpetual futures on the exchange but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

 If the Liberals win the federal elections, Canada could have a far more measured approach to crypto than the United States. 

Mark Carney, a Canadian economist and now Prime Minister-designate, is already under the microscope for his previous remarks regarding cryptocurrency. 

Carney, who replaced former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, took a measured and critical approach to cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin (BTC), in a 2018 speech he made at the Bank of England. He also shared concerns over private stablecoins and supported the idea of a central bank currency (CBDC) — a concept many crypto purists regard as antithetical to cryptocurrencies.

At the same time, Carney has said in his platform for the upcoming 2025 federal elections that he wants to make Canada a leader in emerging technologies, including “AI, tech, and digital industries.”

Carney’s previous statements, along with the US trade war on its former trading partners, have raised questions over the Prime Minister-designate’s economic platform and what part, if any, crypto will play.

While serving as governor of the Bank of England, Carney criticized the seminal cryptocurrency Bitcoin as being insufficient in fulfilling all three of the functions of a currency: a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account.

Addressing the question “How well do cryptocurrencies fulfill the roles of money?” he said, “The long, charitable answer is that cryptocurrencies act as money, at best, only for some people and to a limited extent, and even then only in parallel with the traditional currencies of the users.”

He also shared his concern over private stablecoins in the 2021 Andrew Crockett Memorial lecture. Carney stated that private stablecoins need a regulatory model with “equivalent protections to those for commercial bank money,” like liquidity requirements, central bank eligibility and means to compensate depositors. 

He also stated that a system that contains multiple competing stablecoins can “fragment the liquidity of the monetary system and to detract from the role of money as a coordination device.”

Carney contended that a central bank digital currency (CBDC), particularly a retail CBDC with API access to regulated, private firms — could prevent such fragmentation from happening, in addition to more common pro-CBDC arguments like expedited settlement times. 

In a Bloomberg interview in 2018, Carney said that he wanted to bring the cryptocurrency space up to standard with the rest of the financial industry. He said at the time that there was “lots of temptation” for market manipulation, fraud and other misconduct on crypto exchanges. 

“The best of the cryptocurrencies, I would suggest, will gravitate to the best of the exchanges if they’re regulated,” he said.

Carney further claimed that it’s a good thing if some cryptocurrencies “fall by the wayside” with regulation. “It is a privilege to be part of the financial system, to be connected to the financial system. And responsibilities come with those privileges,” he said.

Despite his more skeptical comments toward cryptocurrencies, Carney said in his 2018 speech that policymakers should be careful not to stifle innovation. 

He said that the “underlying technologies are exciting” and that lawmakers shouldn’t restrain solutions that can “improve financial stability; support more innovative, efficient and reliable payment services as well as have wider applications.”

Carney is also supportive of implementing other emerging technologies in government administration and making Canada more competitive in tech. His platform aims to reduce inefficiencies with AI and machine learning and “build a highly competitive, technology-enabled public service.”

The Canadian federal elections are slated to happen no later than Oct. 20, 2025, and could be called even earlier. 

Carney will face Conservative frontrunner Pierre Poilievre, who himself has made a number of pro-crypto statements. In 2022, he posted on X that he wanted to make Canada a blockchain hub and “expand choice, lower costs of financial products, [and] create thousands of jobs.”

During the Conservative Party’s leadership election, he said that cryptocurrencies would let Canadians “take control” of their money.

Related: Why Pierre Poilievre may not be Canada’s crypto savior

Still, observers of the Canadian crypto industry and Canadian politics have told Cointelegraph that crypto is unlikely to be a major factor in the upcoming elections, unlike its neighbor to the south. 

Morva Rohani, executive director of the Canadian Web3 Council nonprofit trade association, told Cointelegraph, “The reality is that most Canadians are either indifferent or skeptical about crypto, and larger issues like the affordability crisis, housing, inflation and immigration dominate the political conversation.”

Added to those economic concerns is the trade war with the US, which started when President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China — three of his country’s major trading partners. 

Trudeau’s response to Trump’s tariff threats has seen the Liberals close their gap in the polls, which earlier this year showed the Conservatives as decisively ahead. Carney’s response to the US’ hostile economic policies may be more of a key factor to victory than his stance on cryptocurrencies.

 Hackers leverage crosschain bridges to facilitate verifiable data transfers across networks, thereby enabling interoperability, often without reliance on a centralized intermediary. Through the lock-mint methodology, these crypto bridges secure the original token in a smart contract and subsequently mint a corresponding wrapped version on the target blockchain.For instance, when transferring an asset from Ethereum to Solana, the asset is first sent to a bridge contract on Ethereum, where it is “locked.” The bridge then notifies Solana, which creates a “wrapped” version of the asset, allowing it to function on the Solana network as a native coin.To reverse the process, the wrapped asset is “burned” on Solana. The bridge then notifies the Ethereum blockchain to unlock the original asset, maintaining supply balance across both chains.Hackers exploit vulnerabilities within these bridge transactions. They identify weaknesses that allow the creation of wrapped assets on the target chain without the corresponding locking of original assets on the source chain. They can also manipulate the system to unlock original assets without the required burning of wrapped versions. This allows for the theft of funds without a legitimate deposit. Here’s how it works:False deposit events: A common tactic hackers use is triggering false deposit events. Crypto bridges typically monitor blockchains for deposit confirmations before issuing corresponding tokens on another chain. Hackers trick the system by creating fake deposit events or using worthless tokens. An example of such an attack is the Qubit hack, where the hackers created false deposit events using a legacy function in the code.Validator takeover: Another method is validator takeover, which targets bridges relying on validator consensus for transaction approval. If hackers gain control of most validators, they can authorize malicious transfers. In the Ronin Network hack, attackers seized five out of nine validators, enabling them to move funds undetected.Fake deposits: Hackers can exploit vulnerabilities in deposit validation mechanisms. If they can forge a deposit through the validation process, they can withdraw funds fraudulently. A $320-million loss in the Wormhole attack resulted from a digital signature validation process flaw.Did you know? Often, crypto bridges are susceptible to attacks because of inadequate engineering. In the Harmony Horizon Bridge hack, the ease with which hackers compromised two out of five validator accounts, gaining access to funds, highlights this vulnerability. 

Hackers leverage crosschain bridges to facilitate verifiable data transfers across networks, thereby enabling interoperability, often without reliance on a centralized intermediary. Through the lock-mint methodology, these crypto bridges secure the original token in a smart contract and subsequently mint a corresponding wrapped version on the target blockchain.

For instance, when transferring an asset from Ethereum to Solana, the asset is first sent to a bridge contract on Ethereum, where it is “locked.” The bridge then notifies Solana, which creates a “wrapped” version of the asset, allowing it to function on the Solana network as a native coin.

To reverse the process, the wrapped asset is “burned” on Solana. The bridge then notifies the Ethereum blockchain to unlock the original asset, maintaining supply balance across both chains.

 Hackers use crypto bridges to hide the origin of funds, thereby increasing anonymity. The hackers use crypto bridges for money laundering in three key stages: placement, layering and integration. Here is a brief description of how crypto hackers launder stolen funds:Placement: In the placement stage, the criminals introduce illicit funds into the financial system. They break large amounts into smaller transactions to avoid detection. Then they use these funds to purchase cryptocurrencies, more often through intermediaries, making it harder for law enforcement to trace their origins.Layering: Hackers move funds across multiple transactions to obscure their source. Some exchanges enforce strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures, while others operate with little oversight. Hackers take advantage of the latter, using decentralized or loosely regulated platforms to move funds across chains.Integration: In this stage, criminals reintroduce laundered funds into the legitimate economy. By this time, the crypto has been cycled through various platforms and is no longer directly tied to criminal activity. Criminals may cash out through fiat off-ramps, use it for seemingly legal transactions, or reinvest in assets like real estate. Did you know? The inherent lack of interoperability between blockchains creates fragmented data, making it difficult to monitor crosschain activity. This lack of shared information hinders comprehensive activity tracking.

 Lazarus combined classic money-laundering tricks with modern DeFi and crosschain swaps, making this one of the most complex laundering cases in crypto history. Investigators have managed to freeze over $42 million, but the majority of the funds have already been hidden or converted into fiat via underground channels.Total amount stolen and asset breakdownBybit’s losses in the hack totaled roughly $1.46 billion. The stolen assets were primarily Ether and Ethereum-based tokens, including:401,347 Ether (ETH): worth approx. $1.12 billion​90,376 Lido Staked Ether (stETH): worth ~$253 million15,000 cmETH (a form of staked/pooled ETH): worth ~$44 million8,000 mETH (another wrapped ETH derivative): worth ~$23 million​In total, about 401,000 Ether (ETH) and 90,000 Lido Staked Ether (stETH) (plus smaller ETH-derivative tokens) were taken, which the hackers immediately consolidated and converted. According to Nansen’s analysis, the attackers swapped all non-ETH tokens (stETH, cmETH, mETH) into plain ETH soon after the breach​. This gave the hackers full control over ETH, a native asset that cannot be easily frozen by any central issuer​. The entire loot was then funneled into the attackers’ wallets for laundering.Laundering methods usedLazarus Group used a multi-layered strategy to hide and cash out the $1.46 billion stolen from Bybit. Their methods included:Splitting and dispersing funds: Right after the hack, they split 401,000 ETH into 50  wallets to make tracking harder. This tactic of spreading out funds (roughly $27 million per wallet) is designed to complicate tracking by diluting the honeypot. Over the next day, those 50 wallets were systematically emptied as Lazarus began moving the ETH into further layers of addresses and services.Swapping tokens via DEXs: They converted stETH, cmETH and mETH into ETH using DEXs (likely using platforms like Uniswap or Curve).Crosschain bridges: They used Chainflip and THORChain to swap ETH into BTC and move funds across chains. Approximately 361,000 ETH (over $900 million) was converted into BTC and distributed across 6,954 Bitcoin addresses (averaging ~1.7 BTC per address) to further break the trail.Mixers and no-KYC exchanges: They used Tornado Cash alternatives, non-Know Your Customer (KYC) swap services like eXch, and onchain coin swaps to obscure transactions. Elliptic identified eXch as a “major and willing facilitator” in this laundering operation: Over $75 million in Bybit hack proceeds were swapped through eXch within days​. Because eXch lets users convert ETH into other cryptocurrencies, like BTC or even privacy coins such as Monero (XMR), with no traceable linkage, any funds passing through it often go dark.DeFi platforms and DEX launchpads: The Pump.fun launchpad/DEX on Solana became unintentionally involved in a money-laundering operation when hackers used it to launch the QinShihuang token. The platform’s lack of preventive filters allowed hackers to create tokens and pair them with liquidity. This creative technique effectively “mixed” $26 million without using a traditional mixer. Once the scheme was discovered, Pump.fun’s developers swiftly intervened, blocking the token on their front-end UI to halt further trades. While other DeFi platforms like Uniswap and PancakeSwap also facilitated the token swaps, they weren’t complicit in the laundering.OTC and P2P networks: While not explicitly named in public reports, it’s strongly suspected that unregulated over-the-counter (OTC) brokers and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading networks were involved in the final conversion of these stolen funds to cash. Lazarus has historically relied on Chinese and Russian OTC desks to convert crypto to fiat (for example, selling BTC for Chinese yuan in cash)​.Did you know? Of the stolen crypto, exchanges have frozen $42.8 million worth of funds, but the North Korean threat actor has laundered all of the stolen 499,395 ETH, primarily through THORChain.

 To address crosschain fraud involving coin mixing, investigators follow a holistic approach and use specialized tools to track illicit transactions. This is different from legacy explorers that only focus on single-chain analytics. The following example will help you understand how crosschain crypto fraud tools help investigators. Suppose a spyware group extorts funds in Bitcoin and moves them to Ethereum via a crosschain bridge. Instead of cashing out, they swap the funds for a privacy coin using a DEX. Traditional tools require law enforcement to track each step manually, causing delays and errors. With automated crosschain tracking, investigators can trace transactions in one interface, identify the DEX used, and contact exchanges quickly. This accelerates investigations and improves the chances of recovering stolen assets. Notable features of such crosschain investigative tools, such as those offered by Elliptic and Chainalysis:Crosschain hopping detection: It flags instances where criminals transfer funds between blockchains to evade detection. By mapping these transactions, investigators can maintain a comprehensive view of the laundering trail.Attribution and entity identification: The capability of linking addresses to known entities, such as exchanges or DeFi platforms, helps law enforcement determine where stolen funds may have been processed.Automated investigation board: An automated investigation board simplifies the process by visualizing connections between multiple addresses across different chains. This enables investigators to quickly identify laundering patterns and trace the movement of illicit funds.VASP directory integration: For cases where illicit funds reach centralized exchanges (CEXs), virtual asset service providers (VASPs) directory integration allows investigators to contact exchanges, request account information, or freeze assets before they are fully laundered.Now, let’s find out how investigators attempt to catch perpetrators using such tools. Several ways they use include:Blockchain analysis: Investigators meticulously trace the flow of funds across various blockchains like Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Arbitrum and Polygon. This involves analyzing transaction histories, identifying patterns and mapping the movement of assets through different wallets and exchanges.Following the money trail: Even with the anonymity provided by mixers and crosschain transactions, investigators attempt to follow the money trail by tracing funds to CEXs where they might be converted to fiat currency. This often involves working with international law enforcement agencies to track funds across borders.Crosschain bridge monitoring: Investigators monitor bridge transactions for anomalies, such as unusually large transfers or suspicious patterns. They examine the smart contract code of bridges for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers.Analyzing onchain and offchain data: Investigators analyze both onchain (blockchain) and offchain (layer 2s, social media, forums, dark web) data to gather intelligence about potential fraud. This can include monitoring discussions about exploits, vulnerabilities and potential scams.Forensic analysis: When devices are seized from suspects, forensic teams can analyze the devices for crypto wallets, transaction history and other evidence.

 Crypto mixers, designed to obscure transaction trails, have increasingly drawn regulatory scrutiny due to their role in laundering illicit funds. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has sanctioned multiple mixers linked to cybercrime and national security threats in the US. Blender.io became the first-ever sanctioned mixer in 2022 after laundering $20.5 million from the Axie Infinity hack. Despite its shutdown, it resurfaced as Sinbad.io, which was sanctioned within a year for facilitating money laundering in high-profile hacks, including the Atomic Wallet and Horizon Bridge breaches.Tornado Cash, a non-custodial Ethereum-based mixer launched in 2019 by Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm, was sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022. However, a court overturned the sanctions in a January 2022 ruling. Pertsev was sentenced to five years and four months in prison for laundering by Dutch judges. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) classifies mixers as money transmitters, requiring compliance with AML laws.

 Crypto will need to find a delicate balance between privacy and security. While technologies like zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs will enable users to transact privately without compromising the blockchain’s integrity, they must also align with stricter AML regulations to ensure compliance while maintaining user anonymity.While privacy advocates champion financial sovereignty and protection from surveillance, security proponents emphasize the need for transparency and regulatory compliance to maintain market integrity. This tension is likely to be navigated through technological advancements such as ZK-proofs, differential privacy and federated learning, which offer potential solutions for enhancing privacy without compromising security. Simultaneously, governments will continue to develop regulatory frameworks that seek to strike a balance, potentially through tiered approaches that offer varying levels of privacy. Ultimately, the path forward requires collaboration between developers, regulators and users to create a sustainable ecosystem that safeguards individual privacy while preventing illicit activities and fostering trust.

 The Movement Network concurrently launched its public mainnet beta. The MOVE token has a fully diluted value of nearly $5 billion. 

Asset manager REX-Osprey is seeking to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) designed to hold the Movement Network’s native token, MOVE, according to a March 10 announcement. 

The filing comes as Movement, a layer-2 (L2) blockchain network, launches its public mainnet beta, Movement said. 

It is the latest example of a fund sponsor filing to list an ETF comprising an alternative cryptocurrency, or “altcoin.” 

“Traditional investors have expressed keen interest in gaining regulated exposure to emerging blockchain technologies without directly managing tokens,” Cooper Scanlon, Movement Labs’ co-founder, said in a statement. 

Movement is an Ethereum L2 blockchain designed using Move, a Rust-based programming language originally developed by Meta. 

Its public mainnet has approximately $250 million in total value locked (TVL), according to Movement. 

The MOVE token has a fully diluted value of around $5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission authorized ETFs holding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to list in the US in 2024 but has not yet approved any altcoin ETFs. 

“Breaking the pattern of ETFs limited to long-established cryptocurrencies opens doors for institutional capital to support next-generation blockchain innovation,” Rushi Manche, Movement Labs’ co-founder, said in a statement.

 The Bitcoin mining company has seen its profitability surge over the past year thanks to efficiency gains and rising BTC values. 

Bitcoin miner CleanSpark will join an important benchmark for US small-cap stocks, underscoring the company’s recent string of profitability despite industry volatility following the April 2024 halving. 

Beginning March 24, CleanSpark’s stock will be included in the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. As the name implies, the index measures the performance of small US companies that meet specific liquidity and stability criteria. 

As of March 2025, the index’s constituents must have a market capitalization of between $1.1 billion and $7.4 billion, maintain a public float of at least 10% of shares outstanding, and have positive trailing earnings for four consecutive quarters. 

CleanSpark CEO Zach Bradford said the company’s inclusion in the small-cap index demonstrates “the value of being a pure play, vertically integrated Bitcoin mining company,” which makes “exposure to our model more broadly available.”

CleanSpark’s profits surged to $241.7 million, or $0.85 per share, in the final quarter of 2024, up from just $25.9 million a year earlier. Company-wide revenues jumped 120% on a year-over-year basis to $162.3 million.

In February, the company further bolstered its Bitcoin (BTC) stockpile by 6% and now holds 11,177 BTC on its books. Only four other publicly traded companies own more Bitcoin.

Bitcoin miners have seen their revenues decline since the April 2024 halving event, forcing several industry players to diversify their business models. Several are pivoting toward artificial intelligence data centers, which can generate higher revenue than traditional mining. 

In September, Hive Digital executives Frank Holmes and Aydin Kilic told Cointelegraph that repurposing Nvidia GPUs for AI tasks could generate up to $2.50 per hour in revenues, up from just 0.$12 per hour for crypto mining.

For this reason, “institutions are much more interested in us with our AI than Bitcoin,” Holmes said.

Other mining companies are turning to mergers and acquisitions to reduce mining costs and increase hashrate, according to an August report by JPMorgan. The Wall Street bank singled out companies like Riot Platforms and CleanSaprk for increasing their M&A activity in the post-halving environment. 

Meanwhile, “Capital-constrained miners like IREN and [Cipher] focused on securing greenfield opportunities, which require less immediate capital,” JPMorgan said.

	Species in India endure potentially damaging highs for about 10 minutes per day

Trees in India’s Western Ghat mountains (shown) endure extreme high temperatures for about 10 minutes per day during the hottest months of the year, new research shows. While that’s not enough time to permanently damage tree leaves, it could impact other aspects of tree health. 

Akhil Javad

By Siddhant Pusdekar

1 hour ago

Ecologist Akhil Javad felt the thrill of fieldwork quickly fade when he was faced with the prospect of scaling trees over five times his height. But for some of the trees he was studying in India’s Western Ghat mountains, that was the only way to take their temperature.

So, Javad got climbing. Sensors that he placed on leaves in the upper canopy are providing unprecedented insights into how tropical forests are weathering global warming. The findings suggest that the trees may be in better shape than scientists thought, he and colleagues report in the February Global Change Biology.

In the summer, which lasts from March through June in the region, daily high temperatures in the mountains can cross 37° Celsius and are projected to rise by about 4 degrees Celsius in the next 60 years. That could be a problem for trees, since leaves can get much hotter than the surrounding air.

As the temperature of a leaf rises, its ability to harness sunlight to make sugar and oxygen becomes less efficient. On average, when leaves surpass 46.7° C, their photosynthetic machinery shuts down, lab studies have shown. When that happens, trees don’t get the energy they need. Many trees in the tropics are already experiencing temperatures beyond that average limit.

But what matters most is length of exposure, says ecologist Deepak Barua of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune. The new work is the first to study cumulative heat exposure in tropical trees, he says.

On a 6-hectare plantation that grows crops such as vanilla, cocoa and cashew, Javad placed 14 sensors on the leaves of 12 trees — a mix of rose sandalwood, ironwood, Ceylon boxwood and Kindal.

It wasn’t all smooth sailing, though. Sensors would often get dislodged by strong winds. One sensor was destroyed by wild langur monkeys. Another time, a thunderstorm wiped out a week’s worth of data. Perpetually repositioning, replacing and checking sensors was “a pain,” says Javad, now of the University of Leeds in England.

Such constant troubleshooting is one of the main reasons people avoid studying cumulative heat exposure, which makes this work even more valuable, says Andy Leigh, a plant ecologist at University of Technology Sydney who was not involved in the research.

“It’s really important for crazy scientists like us to get up trees and fight off monkeys, to put [sensors] on leaves,” Leigh says. “Otherwise, we really aren’t going to be able to understand how our natural systems … are going to be looking after us in the future.”

The sensors continuously recorded leaf and air temperatures throughout the four summer months in 2023. Meanwhile, in the lab, the team determined that species-specific critical thresholds for the area’s trees ranged from 43.37° C to 45.5° C, slightly below the average. Thirty minutes of continuous exposure to these temperatures can permanently damage leaves, the researchers found. But leaves crossed those temperature limits for less than 10 minutes a day, sensor data showed.

Trees in these forests will continue photosynthesizing with minimal reduction in efficiency despite rising temperatures, the findings suggest. However, exposure to elevated temperatures even for a few minutes a day could affect other aspects of tree health, like reproduction and drought resistance, Leigh notes. Her team is now gauging the extent of heat’s indirect impacts in Australia.

Barua is encouraged by the growing interest in heat exposure. Despite the logistical challenges, he expects more researchers will put temperature sensors to work in ecosystems across the world.

	DBS volunteers talk about how their treatment didn’t affect their identity

A brain implant hasn’t changed who Jon Nelson is. It has taken away the pain of depression, so that he can be more active and engaged and present in his life, he says.

In the fifth episode of The Deep End, Jon Nelson describes depression as a “no-casserole disease,” one that people are often afraid to acknowledge because of the stigma around mental health disorders. This episode lets listeners into the experience of having a disease that’s often misunderstood, and why that can be so harmful for people who struggle with depression. There’s a philosophical angle here, too: Where does a person’s self come from? And how does the brain fit into that answer?

Laura Sanders: This episode deals with mental illness, depression, and suicide. Please listen with care. Previously on The Deep End.

Shannon O’Neill: And DBS is not going to give you happiness. It’s not going to just be a device that turns on happiness 24/7. It’s to get you out of the hole and be on solid ground.

Jon Nelson: So has the device made me happy? The device has made me disease-free. That’s all that I needed it to do. It has not taken away the typical emotions in life that I’m going to have forever, and those are happiness, sadness, anger. I’m gonna have those and I’m going to have to learn how to live with having those.

Sanders: On the last episode, we heard how Jon had to make room for new emotions once his depression had lifted. On this episode, we’re going to talk not so much about depression, but about shame, the shame and the judgment of having a mental disorder, and all too often, the shame and the judgment of the treatment people seek. We’ll explore whether there’s something different about changing our brains versus any other part of our bodies. This is The Deep End. I’m Laura Sanders.

Like many who have struggled with a mental illness, Emily Hollenbeck has plenty of stories of people not quite getting it. She told me about some of these encounters, and one was particularly bad. It was when she was going in for ECT. That’s electroconvulsive therapy, and it’s when doctors send big doses of electricity into the brain to cause a controlled seizure. She was about to be anesthetized and her usual anesthesiologist wasn’t around that day.

Emily: One day this new guy came in and I’m laying on the table, like, it’s a very easy procedure. I really look forward to the, you know, the anesthesiologist doing his job, cause then I can just take my nap, you know, wake up later and have my little snack. But he was prepping everything, and he looks at me and goes, “Oh, you have a Ph.D. in psychology.” I was like “Yeah, like, I don’t know where this is going. It’s 8 a.m. Let’s go. Let’s get this done.” And he just like, his eyes just settled on me goes, “Huh, that’s ironic.”

Sanders: Oh my God.

Emily: And there was this palpable silence in the room, and I just sort of felt like, no one said anything, and I think it’s probably one of those moments where everyone was just kind of shocked, like, what are you talking about? Like, why would you say that? But I’m thinking like this guy is an anesthesiologist, like, of all the professionals, he should know. And of course in that moment with stigma, I mean, the problem is you’re always feeling like you’re the one who can’t say anything. So what really sticks out about that to me is with ECT oftentimes, you know, your memory is a little blurry. It’s a little fuzzy. I remember that moment. It pops up, you know, every now and then and it still, like, hits me in the chest, like, if this doctor at this really renowned hospital is saying this to me, what are other people thinking?

Sanders: So there she was, utterly vulnerable and in the hands of a doctor who clearly didn’t understand her disease at all. And who was about to give her drugs to make her unconscious.

Emily: And I think about, you know, like for the procedure, like, oftentimes they use, you know, they have to use the heavy-hitting anesthesia because they need to knock you out. And I wanted to say something. I remember I’m just literally biting my tongue and being like, “We’re not gonna sass the guy who’s injecting the propofol.”

Sanders: Feeling diminished, judged, and not understood is unfortunately something that happens a lot to people with depression, and other mental illnesses too. The shame this causes can lead people to hide their struggles.

Jon: The stigma keeps people silent. And the silence and you staying in your own head and you not being able to express how you feel just gets worse and worse and worse. And the entire goal, like I said, is to, to, is to have you take your own life. And the more you stay silent, the bigger opportunity you have to do that. And I despise it. And I despise the fact that it exists. It is real. The amount of times that I have had people say to me, “Snap out of it. What do you, dude, you got, you got a great life. You’re succeeding professionally, you got great kids, your wife’s awesome. Like, what, what do you have to be depressed about? What do you have to be depressed for?”

Sanders: Jon has ways of explaining it that really hit home. He calls depression a no-casserole disease. Cancer? People bring a casserole to your house. Broke a leg? Had a baby? Casserole. Depression? No casserole.

Jon: Cancer is horrific. It’s horrible. It’s awful. Nobody deserves it. Nobody wants it. But if you pass from cancer, you’re a warrior. You gave it all you got. People are bringing casseroles over to your house. Five-K races are going in your name, right?

Sanders: But with depression it’s different.

Jon: You tell people that you have it, and people will look at you and not say anything. Can you imagine telling somebody you have cancer, and them looking at you not saying anything, right? Awkward. Weird. If you take that exact same situation for severe mental illness, your entire mind’s getting wrecked. You’re doing it mostly in silence. People aren’t, aren’t really involved in helping out because of that. If you, if you are open about it, there’s judgment from it. And then if you pass, you take your own life, so your own life, so right there you’re stigmatized. You’re stigmatized because of the word suicide. You certainly aren’t getting life insurance. You have the, the family, “Can you believe that their dad took their life, right?” That’s what the disease is. The disease laughs at you even after death.

Sanders: Jon remembers a friend, a good friend, who finally got it.

Jon: With most diseases, Parkinson’s, cancer, you don’t have to understand what they are. You just know it sucks, right? Like, that sucks you have that, right? For some reason, people need to understand what depression is for them to get it and for them to care about it. But I had a huge insight after surgery. A week later, a friend came over. He’s been very helpful throughout all this, you know, we’d meet and walk when I could. We, you know, he was very, you know, he’d send me the text and be supportive. And he said, “How was it?” I said, “You have no idea.” I was like, “Dude, I can do normal things now.” I can, you know, which most people wouldn’t understand that being able to return your phone call is massive. Being able to walk outside? Massive. And so I’m sitting there telling him, it’s a week later, I’m like, “Man, I haven’t had a suicidal thought in a week.” And he looked at me, and he was like, “You’ve had a suicidal thought before?” And it was such, like, a mind-opening experience for me, where I’m like, this is an empathetic, kind, caring person, and they have no idea the hell that you go through.

Sanders: Patient 001 also struggles to get the experience across to people.

Patient 001: I’ve always explained to people, people don’t understand. Depression is not a character flaw. And what I mean by that is anytime you see people kill themselves, people that haven’t gone through depression, they’re like, “Oh, they give up.” People don’t give up. They’re in a fire. They’re in a fire and it doesn’t stop. And not only that, not only are they in a fire and it doesn’t stop, it’s almost like you’re possessed by a demon, like your brain, what it’s feeding you is wrong. It’s just telling you, “Kill yourself. Kill yourself every day, every day, every second.”

Sanders: There is so much about depression that people who haven’t had it don’t understand, can’t understand. But to really pile on, there are even more misconceptions about treatment for depression. Emily remembers telling someone about her upcoming ECT treatments.

Emily: I remember I was at a party, and I was telling a friend of a friend, you know, ‘Oh, I’m gonna have, start ECT next week.” And she goes, “How could you do that to yourself?” It’s like, if you saw the procedure, it’s one of those boring things. Like, it lasts like 10 minutes and you don’t feel anything. But, you know, this woman felt the need to like correct me about my, you know, medical choice.

Sanders: The real-world fallout from all those snap judgments are why I’m not identifying patient 001 by his name. He works in an intensely intellectual and competitive field, and with a new baby at home, he can’t risk losing business over people’s mistaken assumptions. He remembers telling his family he had decided to volunteer for the DBS experiment. They were skeptical at first.

Patient 001: When you go to your mom and you explain, “Mom, this is what I’m considering.” And she’s like, “Are you insane? You’re going to be a guinea pig basically? You’re going to have brain surgery?” It sounds like a bad sci-fi movie, right? At first, they were like, “What are you doing? This is so desperate. There’s so many other things, you get yada yada yada yada yada.” And then it’s like, “Oh, you’re back. You were right.” You know what I mean? Yeah, so I was like, I’m telling you. So that’s why I didn’t go to my family to sort of get their approval. I went to people that had gone through what I was going through, and it’s not because your family’s bad. Again, that’s perspective, it’s perspective.

Sanders: Don’t get me wrong. Patient 001 adores his family, but that doesn’t mean they fully understood. In a way, their reaction tracks with the bad reputations of other treatments for depression, and mental disorders more generally. Since their rise to prominence in the 1990s, antidepressants have been vilified by critics. Some people say these drugs can steal emotions and change personalities. ECT’s reputation is still suffering from the damage done by movies like One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. And even talk therapy can bring shame and secrecy, though much less so today than in the past. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the idea of electrodes implanted in the brain raises a whole new set of assumptions, of misgivings and judgments. But this made me wonder, “Why?” What’s the difference between antidepressants, for instance, and DBS? Is there one? Emily has thought about this distinction a lot.

Emily: I think if you talk to someone in this day and age, this would be my guess, and you said, oh, I’m taking Prozac and I’m, I’m scared it’s going to change the core of me. Then we would be like, why? And thinking about that argument with DBS, I could see why that would be potentially like more interesting to someone, or potentially more plausible, but biochemically, if you look at what’s happening, and you say, “Oh, you know, Prozac is changing me or DBS is changing me,” what does that even really mean?

People are much more concerned about modifications to brain-based, you know, like brain tissue or brain activity than they would be to the kidney. And obviously that makes sense, because a lot of what we experience comes through our brains, but is that really where our self is? And why are people so sensitive about the self, especially when coming to thinking about invasive treatments versus something like Prozac?

Sanders: I’ve been wondering the same thing. What sets the brain apart? And why are people so uncomfortable with attempts to change it? It’s a part of our body, just like the lungs and the heart and the kidneys, like Emily says. So why do we get squeamish when it comes to our brains?

In my reporting, I came across some examples of surprising side effects from DBS. One interesting case study sticks with me, and it highlights how the science here is very far from clear. A Dutch man was being treated for obsessive-compulsive disorder. When his stimulation was on, he developed a brand new and intense love of Johnny Cash hits. Especially Ring of Fire, Folsom Prison Blues, and Sunday Morning Coming Down. Before DBS, his favorites were Dutch language songs and classics by the Beatles and The Rolling Stones. But when his DBS was on, it was the Man in Black all the way. When his stimulation diminished or when his batteries ran down, the man subconsciously switched back to listening to his old favorites. The anecdote might sound a little bit trivial. This guy’s new musical taste didn’t bother him. It’s a very minor thing in the grand scheme of things, but that change, that switch, arguably bores straight to the core of our unease.

So many of us consider our brains, and the minds they create, the bedrock of our identity. After all, it’s where our memories live, our thinking, our personality, our worries, our taste in music. So when a disease attacks the brain or a treatment changes the brain, we get nervous. None of us likes the thought of having a brain implant tell us what music we like, especially if we’re not even aware of it. The stakes are much, much higher when it comes to how we feel, to our emotions.

Reporting this story, I actually heard a lot of jokes about being a cyborg, being Bluetooth enabled, bionic. People would kind of laugh as they said it, but is there anything more to these offhand comments? Does the brain implant change who you are in some fundamental way? Here’s what Jon thinks.

Jon: I can only tell you that it is, it is the exact opposite of that question. It purely eliminates the disease. It purely eliminates the factors and the issues that come about with the disease. That’s it. It does not, you know, sci-fi wise and movies and skits and all these shows we’ve seen, you know, it does nothing about that. And, you know, I’ve had, what’s the word? People have said before, like, “You’re the bionic man,” like friends of mine, right? They’ve said that and you just, yeah, yeah, totally dude.

Sanders: Amanda echoes that sentiment.

Amanda: Like I don’t feel like it’s, nothing I’ve done has ever changed my who I am or my personality. I’m still the same person, just like, suffering more or less. I feel like it lets me be me more, cause I’m not fighting with myself to be alive.

Sanders: Emily says that who she is, is a choice. Her depression is the thing that took that choice away.

Emily: It really altered who I was and of course it’s like this insidious progress. It’s not just, one day you have depression full blown. But I look back and I think about moments of like, you know, one particular disaster, disastrous meeting with the committee, and I want to go back and hug myself, and I’m almost upset like that I berated myself so much. But at that moment, that’s what my brain was predisposed to. In that moment, in those times, what really felt salient was, “I am uniquely and horribly bad. Something is uniquely, horribly wrong with me.” And now I don’t have that feeling. So which of those is correct? I don’t know, but I know which one I like better, like. So I, I don’t know, it’s not a satisfactory answer for your question, but I think what really gets to the heart of it is, I feel like I’m untethered, and I have an ability now to focus on the things that I really do care about, and that’s where my self lies.

Sanders: Shannon O’Neill, the psychologist who has worked with Jon and others, has a way to help people think about their identity, about their self, as they learn to live with DBS.

O’Neill: Do, I do have some thoughts of that, of, of identifying who the self is outside of depression. And I think that those are, those are next steps that we transition to when they have that abstract flexible thinking. One exercise I do is, it’s called the admirable person exercise. And it says, think about the individual that you absolutely admire in your life, not for fame, wealth, beauty, money, but who they are, as a person. And it can be anyone you want. And usually that person they identify, and the reasons why, really gets to their core values of what they appreciate and what they want to live by with meaning and purpose. And we try to move towards that of how can we have committed action in that version of yourself going forward.

Sanders: This way of defining yourself strikes me as particularly meaningful. This is purposeful. This is intentional. It’s defining yourself in the way that you choose. These days, Jon says, his self is lighter. Without the poison coursing through his body, Jon feels better, more energized, more present in his life. But as his daily surveys make very clear, he’s still a little bit crabby.

Jon: So poison was way over here, was 9 out of 10, right, before the disease. After the disease it’s at 0. I rate mental force field. So what mental force field is, is, “Why can’t I walk the dog, right? Like why can’t I do this?” Like, that was at 9 out of 10, 10 out of 10. That’s now out of 1 out of 10, right? I’m still a dude, I still have hard times doing certain things, but like, you know, going from a 10 out of 10 to 1 out of 10 is incredible. And then the one that’s pretty much remained consistent is irritability. And so irritability for me was at like a 6 or a 7 or an 8. Guess what? It’s still at a 6 or a 7 or an 8. And so, like my perspective to them on that is, it’s not that the surgery didn’t work. I guess I’m just like a cranky middle-aged dude now, right? Like that just is what it is.

Sanders: Barbara is one of best judges of who Jon is now. Is he someone new with DBS?

Barbara: I, like, yeah, like you can’t say his old self, there’s, he never, like, wasn’t himself through this whole process. It’s always, it’s just, he is more comfortable and happy and relaxed and productive and present and engaged. So the things that the disease was trying to steal from him, he’s getting back.

Sanders: So, no, Jon with a brain implant is not a new bionic Jon. He’s just Jon. On the next and final episode, we’re going to look to the future for Jon and to the future for DBS.

Mayberg: This is never where I expected to be. But you’re here, so step up. Why wouldn’t you step up? This is the experiment of a lifetime, you know? Even if you, if right this second after this call, I had to stop, I wouldn’t trade it for one second. But I’d sure like to see the last inning. And we’re all in. I’m all in.

What shapes are made by a spinning needle? This seemingly innocent problem has puzzled mathematicians for decades, but now a new proof is being called the biggest result of the current century as it could help solve many other tricky problems

Mathematicians have solved a decades-old problem related to spinning a needle, in what has been hailed as one of the most important mathematical results in recent times. Once seen as “impossible”, the solution should now unlock answers to a slew of other difficult problems that had seemed completely out of reach. “The paper is perhaps the biggest breakthrough in mathematics of…

Some male octopuses tend to get eaten by their sexual partners, but male blue-lined octopuses avoid this fate with help from one of nature’s most potent venoms

During mating, some male octopuses inject females with their potent venom to paralyse them – and avoid being eaten by their mates.

Typically, animals use venom to kill prey or defend themselves from predators. Some species of pufferfish, for example, produce one of nature’s most potent venoms, tetrodotoxin, as a defence mechanism. Several blue-ringed octopus species use tetrodotoxin as a powerful weapon to quickly immobilise and kill their prey.

Quantum fridges, batteries and clocks are brilliant inventions but still limited in power. Now physicist Nicole Yunger Halpern is charting a path to take them to the next level

By Thomas Lewton


                                    10 March 2025

The French inventor Jacques de Vaucanson is remembered for, among other things, producing three curious automata in the 18th century. A poster from the time advertised them all side by side: a figure that played a real flute, another that banged a tambourine and a duck that gobbled up corn and seemingly turned it into pellets of… well, use your imagination.

For physicist Nicole Yunger Halpern, based at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Maryland, these antiquated automata have a resonance with some of today’s most cutting-edge technology. Vaucanson’s inventions prefigured the industrial revolution, during which mechanisation went from being a quirky curiosity to a force that reshaped the globe. We may be at an analogous turning point today when it comes to quantum technology, says Yunger Halpern.

A bold new take on quantum theory could reveal how reality emerges

The steam-powered world of the industrial revolution may seem far removed from the quantum realm. But this period of dramatic change was bolstered by thermodynamics, which deals with heat, work and energy. And, recently, physicists have been applying its ideas to the subatomic realm to devise the new field of quantum thermodynamics. This has seen the development of machines like quantum fridges, batteries and clocks.

However, these are just the start of the quantum technology revolution, says Yunger Halpern. She was a co-author of a recent manifesto aiming to chart a path towards greater things. She spoke to New Scientist about what advanced quantum machines might look like, the astounding benefits they could bring and how we can work towards making them a reality.

Measles Misinformation Sparks Concern, Supreme Court Weakens EPA, and Scientists Engineer Woolly Mice

In this week's news roundup, we dig into measles misinformation, ozone recovery and new findings on using nasal cartilage to treat knee injuries.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American’s Science Quickly, I’m Rachel Feltman. Let’s kick off the week with our usual science news roundup.

First, a quick note about measles, which is still spreading in West Texas and has also cropped up in smaller numbers in eight other states. In an op-ed for Fox News published on March 2, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arguably downplayed the importance of vaccines, saying the MMR jab provides protection against measles while also calling vaccination a ""personal choice."" He also claimed that vitamin A supplementation has been shown to “dramatically reduce measles mortality.”

Since the publication of that op-ed, many experts have sounded the alarm on that plug for vitamin A. The research RFK Jr. referenced does exist, but there’s important context missing. The analysis he cited focuses on studies that mostly looked at low-income countries where many people have vitamin A deficiencies. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s most recent data, less than 1 percent of people in the U.S. have vitamin A deficiencies.

Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, told the Washington Post that vitamin A can play a role in treating children who are hospitalized with measles. But he and other experts conveyed concerns to the Washington Post about RFK Jr.’s framing creating a false equivalency between vaccination, which is an extremely effective way to prevent measles, and vitamin supplementation, which may or may not help children avoid complications from measles. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently put out a statement emphasizing that vitamin A supplementation is no substitute for vaccination and that it should only be conducted under the supervision of a medical professional. Vitamin A overdoses can cause bone fractures, liver damage and other serious issues.

Now let’s move on to a somewhat complex environmental ruling from the Supreme Court. The headline here is that in a 5-4 ruling last Tuesday, the justices sided with the city of San Francisco against the Environmental Protection Agency, weakening the agency’s ability to regulate pollution of the nation’s waterways.

Basically, San Francisco argued that the EPA was too vague in a permit governing the city’s release of sewage into the Pacific Ocean when extreme rainfall overwhelms a water-treatment facility. The permit tasks San Francisco with ensuring its wastewater discharge doesn’t cause the ocean to dip below “any applicable water quality standard,” but the city said that wasn’t enough information. Instead, San Francisco officials wanted the EPA to lay out exactly how much discharge was okay. During oral arguments, an EPA attorney said the agency only used those broad requirements because San Francisco wouldn’t provide the information needed to set specific dumping rules—a claim the city of course refuted.

The majority decision, penned by Justice Samuel Alito, concluded that the EPA exceeded its authority under the Clean Water Act by imposing the water quality requirements, which the ruling calls “end-result” provisions. With these provisions out of the picture, the onus will be on the EPA to figure out what cities—and other entities that dump sewage—need to do to keep their local surface water clean.

Back in October the San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved a resolution urging the city’s Public Utilities Commission to drop or settle its issues with the EPA ahead of oral arguments in the Supreme Court case, they argued that a win could weaken the agency’s ability to curb pollution—which would in turn put a real dent in San Francisco’s reputation as a green city.

In other environmental news, a study published last Wednesday in Nature offers some uplifting findings on the ozone layer. As you probably already know, back in the 1980s scientists detected an area over the South Pole where our atmosphere’s ozone layer, which helps protect the planet from the sun’s UV rays, had gotten thinner. This turned out to be due to chlorofluorocarbons and other similar human made chemicals. An international treaty called the Montreal Protocol, which went into effect in 1989, was aimed at phasing out the use of those substances. Data in recent years has shown that the ozone layer is recovering, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA projecting it could return to normal by 2066.

For the first time scientists have shown with confidence that the Montreal Protocol is indeed to thank for this incredible comeback. That’s great news; if some of the ozone layer’s recovery were due to uncontrollable factors like weather patterns, then we’d have to worry that we might lose some of our progress if those conditions shifted.

In the new study researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology created simulations of the atmosphere under different conditions. Some of their simulations showed a world without an increase in greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances, which helped them understand how the ozone layer might fluctuate without our interference. The researchers say we can now be quite sure that the ozone layer is healing because we’ve stopped using the chemicals that hurt it, which is a great reminder that we really can combat climate change and other human-driven environmental issues if we band together.

Speaking of humans doing stuff that doesn’t suck for once, another study published last Wednesday offers hope for people dealing with osteoarthritis. And that hope stems from a somewhat surprising source: your septum.

Generally ignored unless they’re deviated or pierced, septums are also a great spot for grabbing a bit of cartilage without super-invasive surgery. Nasal cartilage cells also seem particularly good at fighting inflammation. A group of scientists have been working on a method of using cartilage implants grown from itty-bitty septum samples to repair knee injuries for a number of years now. What’s new in the latest study, published in Science Translational Medicine, is that the researchers compared outcomes between people whose cartilage grafts were grown in the lab for the standard couple of days before insertion with people whose grafts spent a couple of weeks maturing instead. The clinical trial was small, involving just around 100 people. But the results do suggest that, when allowed to mature, these septum-grown grafts do a better job of fixing the injury in question—and they can actually lead to improvement in the health of surrounding cartilage, too. The team is about to undertake two large clinical studies on the use of this cartilage technique in treating osteoarthritis in the kneecaps.

Last but not least we’ve simply got to talk about woolly mammoth mice. Woolly mammice? Woolly mousemoths? Whatever.

Biotech company Colossal Biosciences, primarily known for its mission to bring the woolly mammoth and dodo back from extinction with the help of genetic engineering, announced last Tuesday that the team edited several different genes in mice embryos to make them—well, woolly.

It’s important to note, however, that these mice didn’t have woolly mammoth genes inserted into their genomes. Most of the edits involved tweaking mouse genes that prior research has shown dictate hair traits such as color and texture. But Colossal also looked at ancient mammoth DNA to find genes tied to hair pattern and fat metabolism and adjusted the corresponding mice genes. The result was some real Tribble-esque rodents. The company says this is a step toward doing something similar in Asian elephants, which are woolly mammoth’s closest living relatives. But in interviews with the Associated Press several experts pointed out that making an elephant woolier isn’t the same as bringing woolly mammoths back from extinction. Another expert pointed out to the Guardian that this money could perhaps be better spent preventing the extinction of the animals living on Earth right now, which is tough but fair. Those hairy little mice are very cute, though.

That’s all for this week’s news roundup. We’ll be back on Wednesday.

The common diabetes drug metformin works partly by excreting sugar from the bloodstream into the intestines, where gut bacteria then convert it into chemicals that improve the insulin response.

Since the 1990s, doctors have prescribed the drug metformin to treat type 2 diabetes, but scientists didn't fully understand how it worked.

Now, new research fills in one piece of the puzzle: Metformin triggers the body to expel glucose from the bloodstream into the intestines, where bacteria feed on the carbohydrate to make compounds that may help control blood sugar levels.

In the new study, published March 3 in the journal Communications Medicine, researchers calculated that metformin treatment increased how much glucose was released into the gut nearly fourfold. That seemed to boost the production of fatty compounds that help protect the gut and reduce inflammation.

Multiple pathways

Most research has focused on metformin's effects in the liver, where it boosts how cells respond to insulin and blocks the synthesis of the sugar glucose. But some studies have suggested that the drug also acts on the gut, perhaps by blocking glucose uptake into the bloodstream.

""Many people are working on the gut action of metformin because if you take metformin orally, the intestines are exposed to very high concentrations,"" said senior study author Dr. Wataru Ogawa, a medical researcher at Kobe University in Japan. (Ogawa received research support and lecture fees from the metformin manufacturer Sumitomo Pharma.)

Previously, Ogawa's team showed that the body excretes glucose into the hollow tunnel of the human gut where food and waste travel, known as the lumen. This happens in people with and without diabetes. ""It means that this is a physiological function that humans have,"" Ogawa told Live Science.

In the new study, the researchers found that metformin nearly quadrupled the rate of glucose excretion into the gut in five people with type 2 diabetes, and they replicated those findings in mice.

Keeping glucose out of circulation by directing it to the gut might directly lower blood sugar levels, but scientists told Live Science they think this explains only part of metformin’s therapeutic effects.

Nicola Morrice, a metformin researcher at the University of Dundee in Scotland who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email, ""I do not expect this to be the drug's main mechanism of action.""

Besides drawing sugar out of the bloodstream, excreted glucose could also have an indirect effect on blood sugar by feeding gut bacteria, other experts told Live Science.

Dr. José-Manuel Fernández-Real, a medical researcher at the University of Girona in Spain who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email, ""Some bacteria, particularly those that thrive on simple sugars, may experience increased growth, while others that rely on complex carbohydrates or fiber fermentation might be less affected.""

A glucose molecule has a backbone of six carbon atoms, so to determine the rate at which gut bacteria break down glucose into other molecules, Ogawa had to find a way to keep track of these carbons. His team injected mice with glucose containing a ""heavy"" isotope, meaning a version of carbon that carries an extra neutron. This allowed them to trace the heavy carbons as the bacteria transformed glucose into other compounds.

Stool samples revealed that bacteria in mice treated with metformin had converted the heavy glucose into short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). ""Bacterial species that produce short chain fatty acids are generally 'good' bacteria,"" suggesting metformin’s effects could potentially foster a healthy microbiome, Ogawa said.

Metformin treatment caused SCFAs containing heavy carbon to increase by just 1% in stool samples. However, Manuel Vázquez-Carrera, a pharmacology researcher at the University of Barcelona who was not involved with the study, told Live Science in an email that ""most SCFAs are rapidly absorbed and utilized rather than excreted."" That means the measurement was likely an underestimate.

And ""even a slight rise in SCFA production could enhance gut barrier function, reduce inflammation, and improve insulin sensitivity, all of which are beneficial for managing diabetes,"" Fernández-Real speculated.

—Sugar-loving fruit bats' genes could point to new diabetes treatments, scientists say

—In a 1st, scientists reversed type 1 diabetes by reprogramming a person's own fat cells

The study had a few limitations. First, the researchers did not assess how higher levels of gut SCFAs affected the health of the mice. It also included ""a very small number of participants who were receiving varying doses of metformin as part of their treatment regimes,"" Morrice said.

The mouse work also involved only male rodents, so possible sex differences in the drug's actions were not explored. Beyond testing metformin's effects on five diabetes patients, Ogawa said he has finished a larger, gold-standard trial in humans to further study the drug's impacts on the gut. The researchers haven't completed the analysis, but as of yet, they haven't seen any sex differences.

Morrice suggested that future work could explore how metformin affects glucose excretion in mice that consume different diets, such as high-fat, high-sugar diets, which are linked to obesity.

Splitting water molecules takes more energy than calculations suggest, and is a key roadblock to cheap hydrogen fuel production. Now, scientists have discovered why.

For the first time, scientists have observed water molecules splitting in real time to form hydrogen and oxygen.

And right before they split, the molecules did something completely unexpected: They flipped 180 degrees.

This micro acrobatic stunt takes energy, which offers a crucial explanation for why splitting water takes more energy than theoretical calculations suggested.

The researchers say that studying this further could offer key insights into making the process of splitting water molecules more efficient — opening a pathway to cheaper clean hydrogen fuel and breathable oxygen for future Mars missions. They published their findings March 5 in the journal Science Advances.

Hydrogen has a number of key properties that make it an enticing source of green energy. The energy-rich fuel is capable of powering trucks and even cargo ships, and it is the only alternative to fossil fuels in industries such as steel and fertilizer manufacturing. When it's burned, the fuel releases water instead of carbon dioxide.

Yet the steep energy requirements for hydrogen production severely limit the scale at which the fuel is produced. According to the International Energy Authority, 322 million tonnes (354 million tons) of hydrogen fuel needs to be produced each year to meet global energy needs. But in 2023, only 97 million tonnes (107 million tons) was manufactured at a monetary cost 1.5 to six times greater than fossil fuel production — and the vast majority of it was made using fossil fuels too.

Hydrogen fuel is made by adding water to an electrode and then splitting the water with an applied voltage into hydrogen and oxygen.

This process is most efficient when the chemical element iridium is used as a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction that cleaves oxygen from water molecules. But iridium only arrives on our planet from meteorite impacts, making it costly and scarce.

But even when using iridium, the process is less efficient than scientists believe it should be.

""It ends up taking more energy than theoretically calculated. If you do the math, it should require 1.23 volts. But, in reality, it requires more like 1.5 or 1.6 volts,"" study lead author Franz Geiger, a professor of chemistry at Northwestern University, said in a statement. ""Providing that extra voltage costs money, and that's why water splitting hasn't been implemented at a large scale.""

To better understand the energy requirements of this process and why it's less efficient than theory suggests, the researchers placed water on an electrode inside a container and measured the molecules' positions using the amplitude and phase of laser light shone onto them.

When the scientists applied a voltage across the electrode, they observed that the molecules rapidly flipped and rotated so that their two hydrogen atoms touching the electrode faced up and the oxygen atom faced down.

—Just a fraction of the hydrogen hidden beneath Earth's surface could power Earth for 200 years, scientists find

—Solar power stations in space could be the answer to our energy needs

—EV batteries could last much longer thanks to new capacitor with 19-times higher energy density that scientists created by mistake

""Electrodes are negatively charged, so the water molecule wants to put its positively charged hydrogen atoms toward the electrode's surface,"" Geiger said. ""In that position, electron transfer from water's oxygen atom to the electrode's active site is blocked. When the electric field becomes strong enough, it causes the molecules to flip, so the oxygen atoms point toward the electrode's surface. Then, the hydrogen atoms are out of the way, and the electrons can move from water's oxygen to the electrode.""

By measuring the number of molecules that rotated and the energy required for them to do so, the researchers found that this flipping was likely a necessary and unavoidable part of the splitting process. What's more, the researchers discovered that higher pH levels made this process more efficient.

Further studying this process could help scientists to design more efficient catalysts to use in the process, and to better understand the chemical processes involved, the researchers said, while also offering fresh insights into how water behaves.

""Our work underscores how little we know about water at interfaces,"" Geiger said. ""Water is tricky, and our new technology could help us understand it a bit better.""

""By designing new catalysts that make water flipping easier, we could make water splitting more practical and cost-effective,"" he added.

New research suggests that a binary pair of Kuiper Belt objects, known as the Altjira system, is actually made up of three separate bodies orbiting one another in a complex triad. This rare orbital configuration is often referred to as the ""three-body problem.""

Astronomers may have just identified a rare example of a ""three-body problem"" hiding in plain sight beyond the solar system's most distant planet. If the observation can be confirmed, it suggests that many more cosmic triplets could be hiding in the outer reaches of our cosmic neighborhood, researchers say.

Back in 2001, astronomers discovered what they thought was a binary system made up of two large bodies orbiting each other approximately 3.7 billion miles (6 billion kilometers) from Earth in the Kuiper Belt — a ring of asteroids, comets and dwarf planets, including Pluto, that lies beyond the orbit of Neptune.

The two icy rocks, collectively named 148780 Altjira, are separated by around 4,700 miles (7,600 km), or roughly one-fiftieth the distance between Earth and the moon. (The system is named after the creation deity of the Aboriginal Arrernte people from Australia.)

But in a new study published March 4 in The Planetary Science Journal, researchers propose that the inner body in the Altjira system is actually a pair of smaller objects circling extremely close to one another, making this a triple system.

The study team came to this conclusion after combining images from the Hubble Space Telescope with 17 years' worth of data collected by the W. M. Keck Observatory on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano. This revealed subtle shifts in the trajectory of the outer body, suggesting that it is being gravitationally tugged on by two objects instead of one. However, the system is too far away to get visual confirmation of the separation of the inner bodies.

""A triple system was the best fit [when comparing different modeling scenarios],"" study lead author Maia Nelsen, an astronomer at Brigham Young University in Utah, said in a NASA statement. However, it is also possible that the inner body could be a ""contact binary"" — two objects that touch each other and act as a single entity — or ""something that actually is oddly flat, like a pancake,"" she added.

Over the next 10 years, the Altjira system will be in its ""eclipsing season,"" where the outer body will be frequently positioned between the inner body and the sun, which could allow for more detailed observations of its orbital trajectory, the researchers wrote.

During this time, the James Webb Space Telescope is also scheduled to survey the Altjira system, which could conclusively settle the debate with its unmatched image-resolving powers, according to NASA.

When three objects with similar mass orbit one another, the mathematics involved in calculating their trajectories becomes extremely challenging and leaves very little room for error. That means the slightest change to one of the objects' trajectories can throw the whole system out of balance.

""The puzzle of predicting how three gravitationally bound bodies move in space has challenged mathematicians for centuries,"" NASA representatives wrote in the statement. This is often referred to as the three-body problem, which has also inspired a popular science fiction novel and a recent TV series of the same name.



Several types of triple systems have been found throughout the cosmos, including triple-star systems like our nearest stellar neighbors — the Alpha Centauri system — and ""Tatooine"" exoplanets with two suns, providing several solutions to this problem. However, there is no single generally accepted solution to working out the orbital mechanics of a triple system, so the ""problem"" is often considered unsolved.

If confirmed as a triple system, Altjira will be the second of its kind discovered in the Kuiper Belt; 47171 Lempo, which has a nearly identical configuration as the one proposed for Altjira, was also previously classified as a binary system.

—An interstellar visitor may have changed the course of 4 solar system planets, study suggests

There are around 40 other known binary systems in the Kuiper Belt, some of which could be unrecognized triple systems. However, there are likely many more three-body systems there.

So far, scientists have found around 3,000 Kuiper Belt objects, but they estimate that there could be ""several hundred thousand more"" smaller objects there, each wider than 10 miles (16 km) across, researchers wrote. Therefore, this part of the solar system could be a great place to hunt for many more of these systems.

""The universe is filled with a range of three-body systems,"" Nelson said. ""And we're finding that the Kuiper Belt may be no exception.""

A saucer-like space capsule touched down in the Australian outback last month, marking the first time a commercial spacecraft has landed Down Under.

Varda Space Industries' Winnebago-2 (W-2) space capsule reentered Earth's atmosphere and dropped down in South Australia on Feb. 28. In doing so, W-2 also set a world first by becoming the first commercial spacecraft to return to a commercial spaceport, according to a statement released by the Australian Space Agency.

The successful return of W-2 was a ""landmark moment for the Australian space sector,"" Australian Space Agency representatives wrote in the statement.

The company behind W-2, Varda, is an American startup based in California. W-2 originally left Earth from California on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 14 as part of the Transporter-12 rideshare mission — the Transporter carries satellites from various customers into space. W-2 then spent 45 days in orbit, carrying payloads from the U.S. Air Force and NASA before dropping down to the Koonibba Test Range, run by Australian aerospace company Southern Launch.

W-2 weighed 265 pounds (120 kilograms) and had various technologies onboard to advance space research. For example, W-2 carried Varda’s expanded pharmaceutical reactor, which allows for the production of medicine in space, according to a statement released by Southern Launch.

The space capsule was also equipped with a heatshield developed with NASA and a spectrometer built by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory. The spectrometer, known as Optical Sensing of Plasmas in the ReEntry Environment (OSPREE), measured the environment around the capsule as it reentered at speeds exceeding Mach 25, which is 25 times the speed of sound, or around 19,000 miles per hour (31,000 kilometers per hour), according to a statement released by Varda.

""We are ecstatic to have W-2 back on our home planet safely and are proud to support significant reentry research for our government partners as we continue building a thriving foundation for economic expansion to low Earth orbit,"" Varda CEO Will Bruey said in the statement.

The Southern Launch team watched the W-2 reentry from the ground with advanced tracking telescopes and led the recovery operations, which included representatives from the Far West Coast Aboriginal Corporation, the traditional owners of the land where the capsule landed, according to the Southern Launch statement.

""For Australia, this mission ushers in a new era of space capabilities for the nation,"" Southern Launch representatives wrote in its statement. ""The W-2 mission was the first time a commercial space craft re-entry was granted under Australian legislation and is just the first of many scheduled to return to the Koonibba Test Range.""

A fossil first discovered over 50 years ago has finally been identified as the remains of a pony-sized dinosaur that lived about 166 million years ago.

The fossil was spotted at the base of a cliff on the Isle of Skye in Scotland in 1973, but it was not collected by paleontologists for another 45 years due to its tricky location.

Now, according to a paper published March 6 in the journal Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, this fossil — which includes fragments of a spine, ribs, and hip bones — may be the remains of a dinosaur that lived during the Jurassic Period (201.3 and 145.0 million years ago).

This fossil, nicknamed the ""Elgol dinosaur"" after the village near where it was found, is now considered the most complete dinosaur fossil ever discovered in Scotland, as well as being the earliest ever unearthed there.

Located off the northwestern coast of Scotland, the Isle of Skye is the location of several dinosaur fossils and footprints from the Middle Jurassic period, which is poorly represented in the global fossil record.

""This is a wonderful addition to the rapidly growing set of Jurassic finds from the Isle of Skye which are enabling us to learn more and more about the rich ecosystem of the time,"" study co-author Stig Walsh, a senior curator of vertebrate palaeobiology at National Museums Scotland, said in a statement.

The newly identified dinosaur may have been about the size of a pony, and was at least eight years old when it died, according to the researchers.

The fossil was first recorded by paleontologists during field trips between 1971 and 1982, with a 1973 notebook entry mentioning ""bones of a dinosaur"" in a cliff with a small sketch. The original discoverers didn't realize its significance, and due to its awkward location, it was exceedingly difficult to remove from the ground.



Researchers rediscovered the fragmented fossil in 2015, and itwas eventually excavated and transported from its cliff location in 2018.

""This was a really challenging extraction, in fact we'd previously felt was too difficult to collect the fossil, but I thought it was really important to study it,"" study lead author Elsa Panciroli, a NERC Independent Research Fellow at National Museums Scotland, said in the statement.

""I was able to persuade the team to give it a try. It took a lot of hard work from a lot of people, but we did it: finally we can confirm and publish Scotland's first recorded and most complete dinosaur, and that makes it all worthwhile.""

Paleontologists then studied the fossil using a range of techniques, including micro-CT scanning, which is a non-destructive imaging technique that uses X-rays to create highly detailed 3D images of small objects at a microscopic scale.

The shape and microstructure of the bones, and the fact they were found within the Kilmaluag Formation — a geological formation dating to the Middle Jurassic — indicated that the fossil may be the remains of a cerapodan or ornithopod dinosaur.

Cerapodan dinosaurs are a major group of ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaurs, which have a pelvic structure resembling that of modern birds. Ornithopods are one herbivorous sub-group of cerapodans that lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and had beaked mouths for cropping vegetation. One of the most well-known groups of ornithopods were Iguanodons, which were one of the first dinosaurs ever named.

If this new dinosaur is indeed ornithopodan, it may be among the earliest ornithischian fossils, and possibly the oldest ornithopodan body fossil in the world.

""Some aspects of the bones indicate that the specimen may be an ornithopod, a group of plant-eating dinosaurs that are best known from the Cretaceous,"" study co-author Susie Maidment, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London, said in the statement.

""This specimen, however, would already have been a fossil by the time that the better-known ornithopods like Iguanodon and Hypsilophodon were walking the Earth,"" she said. ""Recent research on the fossils of Elgol has revealed a diverse ecosystem of extraordinarily preserved Middle Jurassic animals, and I'm sure there are more exciting discoveries to come.""

An AI model can scan your brain with non-invasive equipment and convert your thoughts into typed sentences — with no implants required.

Scientists at Meta have used artificial intelligence (AI) and noninvasive brain scans to unravel how thoughts are translated into typed sentences, two new studies show.

In one study, scientists developed an AI model that decoded brain signals to reproduce sentences typed by volunteers. In the second study, the same researchers used AI to map how the brain actually produces language, turning thoughts into typed sentences.

The findings could one day support a noninvasive brain-computer interface that could help people with brain lesions or injuries to communicate, the scientists said.

""This was a real step in decoding, especially with noninvasive decoding,"" Alexander Huth, a computational neuroscientist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the research, told Live Science.

Brain-computer interfaces that use similar decoding techniques have been implanted in the brains of people who have lost the ability to communicate, but the new studies could support a potential path to wearable devices.

In the first study, the researchers used a technique called magnetoencephalography (MEG), which measures the magnetic field created by electrical impulses in the brain, to track neural activity while participants typed sentences. Then, they trained an AI language model to decode the brain signals and reproduce the sentences from the MEG data.

The model decoded the letters that participants typed with 68% accuracy. Frequently occurring letters were decoded correctly more often, while less-common letters, like Z and K, came with higher error rates. When the model made mistakes, it tended to substitute characters that were physically close to the target letter on a QWERTY keyboard, suggesting that the model uses motor signals from the brain to predict which letter a participant typed.

The team's second study built on these results to show how language is produced in the brain while a person types. The scientists collected 1,000 MEG snapshots per second as each participant typed a few sentences. From these snapshots, they decoded the different phases of sentence production.

They found that the brain first generates information about the context and meaning of the sentence, and then produces increasingly granular representations of each word, syllable and letter as the participant types.

""These results confirm the long-standing predictions that language production requires a hierarchical decomposition of sentence meaning into progressively smaller units that ultimately control motor actions,"" the authors wrote in the study.

To prevent the representation of one word or letter from interfering with the next, the brain uses a ""dynamic neural code"" to keep them separate, the team found. This code constantly shifts where each piece of information is represented in the language-producing parts of the brain.

That lets the brain link successive letters, syllables, and words while maintaining information about each over longer periods of time. However, the MEG experiments were not able to pinpoint exactly where in those brain regions each of these representations of language arises.

Taken together, these two studies, which have not been peer-reviewed yet, could help scientists design noninvasive devices that could improve communication in people who have lost the ability to speak.

Although the current setup is too bulky and too sensitive to work properly outside a controlled lab environment, advances in MEG technology may open the door to future wearable devices, the researchers wrote.

""I think they're really at the cutting edge of methods here,"" Huth said. ""They are definitely doing as much as we can do with current technology in terms of what they can pull out of these signals.""

Experts explain the difference between what it means to experience cancer remission versus being cured of the disease.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.


After a patient has undergone treatment for cancer, they may be told that the disease is either in ""remission"" or that they have been ""cured."" But there's a distinction between these terms.

So what does it mean for cancer to be in remission, and what does it mean to have been cured?

First, it's important to note that there are two types of cancer remission: ""complete remission"" and ""partial remission."" Complete remission means that a person's cancer is responding to treatment, that they have no signs or symptoms of the disease, and there are no cancerous cells in their body that can be detected by a scan or a blood test, for instance.

Partial remission means that treatment is working but that tests show some cancerous cells remain in the body. In contrast, when a patient has ""stable disease,"" it means their condition is neither improving nor worsening in response to treatment.

Doctors can't predict how long remission will last, so there's a chance the cancer could come back. Remission can last weeks or years.

If a patient remains in complete remission for five years or more, then some doctors may say the patient is ""cured,"" which means they've shown a long-term absence of symptoms or signs of cancer.

Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

However, even if a patient is considered cured, they may still have undetected cancer cells lurking in their body that may cause a recurrence of the disease one day. Doctors may be more likely to say that a patient is ""cured"" if they have a type of cancer that has a high five-year cancer survival rate when detected early, such as breast cancer or melanoma, which is a type of skin cancer.



Epidemiologists may also use a term known as ""statistical cure"" in this context. This means that a patient survives long enough that their risk of death from cancer returns to that of the general public, Dr. Vijay Trisal, a surgical oncologist at the City of Hope cancer research center in California, told Live Science.

—Why America is losing its 50-year 'war on cancer,' according to scientist Nafis Hasan

—The 10 deadliest cancers, and why there's no cure

—New treatment for most aggressive brain cancer may help patients live longer

For instance, if someone had colon cancer 10 years ago and now they are free of the cancer, their risk of dying from the disease has effectively gone back to the baseline risk that would be expected of other people their age, he added.

Nevertheless, the term ""cure"" should be used with caution, Trisal said. Although it may alleviate some patients' anxiety and allow them to resume their normal lives, it can make others less vigilant and more likely to avoid future tests and screening that could help detect reoccurrence, he added.

Conference tournaments are the last chance for bubble teams to make their case to the selection committee for a spot in the NCAA Tournament. They could also take it out of the committee's hands entirely by securing the automatic bid. There are still eleven teams that I believe could go either way around the cut line. Here is a look at where each team stands with Selection Sunday less than a week away. 

Winning four of their last five has given the Razorbacks a nice boost. The one loss was to South Carolina, though, and a win in that one would've kept me from writing about them now. Arkansas gets another shot at the Gamecocks in the opener of the SEC Tournament. A win there should be enough to punch their ticket.

Baylor has a decent ranking in the predictive metrics, but it's just 18-13 overall. Only twice since 1994 has a team received an at-large bid that was not four games above .500. It seems unlikely that it would join that list, but you never know. The Bears will face Arizona State or Kansas State in their first Big 12 Tournament game.

The Broncos have a couple of good wins outside the league over Saint Mary's and Clemson. They also have a Quad 3 loss to Washington State and a Quad 4 defeat at the hands of Boston College. Their strength of schedule is OK and their other losses are not bad, but this is a profile that could use some juice. Boise State will open the Mountain West Tournament against fellow bubbler San Diego State. A third loss to the Aztecs will probably be one too many.

Colorado State is new to the bubble after a seven-game winning streak, including victories at Boise State and a sweep of Utah State. The Rams have a couple of Quad 3 losses along with a loss at Colorado, though, so it has taken a while to get back into bracket contention. It is possible that by the time CSU gets enough wins to secure an at-large bid that they are already the automatic qualifier.

Coach Mike Woodson agreed to resign at the end of the season and sparked a resurgence in his team. The Hoosiers have been hit-or-miss most of the season, but they have won four out of five to get into the bracket for now. They are the 9-seed in the Big Ten tournament and will open against Oregon. A loss may not be fatal to their tournament hopes, but a win could be enough to get off the right side of the bubble.

The Tar Heels are a spectacularly bad 1-11 in Quad 1 games. The win is UCLA, so that's nice, but it is hard to see a path to an at-large bid without adding to that lonely win. Unfortunately, UNC is the 5-seed in the ACC Tournament, which means that the first team it can see that helps them is Duke. The Blue Devils already have two double-digit wins over the Tar Heels.

Ohio State's loss at Indiana to end the regular season puts it in a difficult spot. The Buckeyes are now just 17-14 overall and 11-14 vs. the top three quadrants. Those are ugly numbers, but especially that last one. Only one team has received an at-large bid that was two games below .500 against that group. None have made it that were three games below. I do not believe the committee looks at that mark specifically, but it is certainly not a stretch to believe that a team that poor against the top three quadrants is of not at-large quality.

The Sooners will face Georgia to open SEC Tournament play, and a loss to the Bulldogs may be one too many.  A relatively heavy Quad 4 schedule has left Oklahoma right at .500 against the top three quadrants, so a loss drops it below .500 against that group. On the other hand, a win should secure a spot in the field as one of twelve or thirteen conference members in the bracket. Either of those numbers would be a record for most from a league.

San Diego State is living large off a nonconference win over likely No. 1 seed Houston. The Aztecs also have a nonconference win over Creighton. They swept fellow bubbler Boise State, but were swept by Utah State and UNLV.  They certainly need to avoid another loss to a non-contender, but a loss to Boise State in the Mountain West opener may be one too many.

The Mountaineers have some big hits on their ledger, including victories over Iowa State, Arizona and at Kansas. They are in the best shape of these teams, but an opening round Big 12 tournament loss to either TCU or Colorado could make selection Sunday nervy.

Xavier's Quad 1 record is not great at 1-8, but it does have two wins over likely tournament teams in Quad 2. The Musketeers also have a couple Quad 2 losses to non-contenders. A win over Marquette would be their second best win over the season behind their victory over the Golden Eagles in Milwaukee, but they may need more than that.

NC State decided to move on from Kevin Keatts as its men's basketball coach, firing the man who led the program to its first ACC championship since 1987 and first Final Four since 1983. It can be viewed as a cold, or even harsh, decision given what Keatts and the 2024 team did for generations of NC State fans, but the firing reflects a sense of urgency sparked by ego, emotion and, yes, some cold-hearted analysis about the current state of the Wolfpack program. 

Keatts, for his part, believes it's in a better place now than it was when he was hired in 2017. He inherited NCAA issues stemming from the FBI investigation that rocked college basketball, yet posted 20-win seasons in each of his first three years. There was a bump in the middle of his tenure, one that included a school-record for losses in a single season (21) in 2022. Keatts rebounded with a strong 2023, however, and thanks to five wins in five days in the 2024 ACC Tournament, delivered the first back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances for NC State in a decade. 

There should be some pride taken in the work done to guide NC State through NCAA issues early in his tenure. There should be an immense amount of credit given to Keatts for how he pushed the right buttons and helped the Wolfpack keep their composure as they rolled off nine straight wins last year, with the last seven of those coming against NCAA Tournament teams. 

But just because Keatts was fired on Sunday does not mean he was not thanked or rewarded. Winning an ACC championship and making the Final Four triggered a number of contractual bonuses, including an extension. When NC State made the decision to move on it, was not only complicated by the emotions of showing Keatts the door, but by the financial obligations that came with a larger buyout than what they faced in March 2024. 

That brings us to the cold-hearted analysis of NC State basketball, because prior to the 2024 ACC Tournament there was a desire to make a coaching change. The Wolfpack entered that tournament as the 10-seed and trailed last-place Louisville, a dead team walking, by one point at halftime of the Tuesday afternoon opening round in Washington, D.C. If NC State goes on to lose that game, then Keatts might have been fired later that week and athletic director Boo Corrigan would have entered a coaching carousel that saw multiple mid-major coaches on the rise make a move. 

But NC State came back, blew out Syracuse in the second round, stunned Duke in the quarterfinals, beat Virginia on an absolute miracle end-of-regulation sequence and then vanquished rival North Carolina in the title game. Even if NC State had been defeated by Texas Tech in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the fact that Keatts had just beaten Duke, Virginia and North Carolina to deliver the program's first ACC championship since 1987 would have made it difficult to collect the checks needed from the money people to make a change. 

Emotion kept the firing squad at bay, but there were reasons Keatts was on the hot seat. A proponent of the transfer portal even before it became the standard in college basketball, Keatts had mixed results with his evaluation and integration of new players. There were players that hit and a few years were everything gelled, but even the better teams lacked consistency in terms of results. NC State fans did not know what to expect -- not just on a year-to-year basis but even game to game; highs were matched by maddening lows. Four of Keatts final five years saw NC State finish ninth or worse in the ACC standings as the Wolfpack continued to backslide in a conference that itself was backsliding from its typical standard among the best leagues in the country. 

NC State could have moved forward with Keatts after this season, even with all the basketball reasons available to make a move, but the friction between coach and community started to damage some egos on both sides. 

Keatts' typically positive demeanor started to fade during this season, and in February he started to take aim at the fan base for a lack of respect or appreciation for what NC State did the previous season. After losing to Louisville at home on Feb. 12, he expressed disappointment in the fan support (or lack thereof) in the building. 

""We're busting our butt every day. And let's not forget this. Let's not forget one thing. Now, we did hang a banner, two of them. That hadn't happened in 37 and 40 years. So let's have some respect for that part of it,"" Keatts said, before encouraging fans to continue showing up even as the team was losing. 

""If there was a fan that had a business, and they wasn't doing well, I [would] still support their business,"" Keatts said. ""And when you in it, be in it -- don't be halfway."" 

Then, after snapping a nine-game losing streak against Boston College later that week, Keatts went to bat for guard Michael O'Connell, who hit the game-tying 3-point heave against Virginia in the ACC Tournament semifinals but was struggling this season. O'Connell faced unnecessary criticism from the fans, according to his coach, and Keatts believed the NC State faithful were ""taking for granted"" the success of 2024. 

""Don't take it for granted because a lot of folks took it for granted,"" Keatts said. ""They had to wait 40 years for it to happen, and we did something special. So that doesn't mean that this team gets grace, but Michael, man, guy hit a great shot against Virginia and, well, you would think he's the worst player that's ever played here. If it was up to him, he should have just retired right after the Virginia game.""       

The fact that Keatts recalled last season or bemoaned the lack of talent on his own team — ""this team doesn't have any superstars,"" he said after the loss to North Carolina — wore away some of the good will established by the miracle run of 2024. Keatts didn't think NC State was grateful enough, and NC State started to doubt whether it could afford to let Keatts continue to coast on hanging those banners. But making the move required passing the hat for what was now a much larger buyout, and having that money pulled together came after NC State completed one of the most embarrassing encores in modern ACC history. 

The Wolfpack went 0-11 in road games this season and 0-13 in road/neutral games. They did not have a single win against a top-50 KenPom team all season, but it was the way the Wolfpack lost on the road to bad teams that made the whole operation look broken. NC State led by 12 points with 6:08 left to go at Virginia Tech, a team that finished the regular season with a 13-18 record, and ended up losing to the Hokies by three. Then, on Saturday, NC State had an eight-point lead on last-place Miami with three minutes left to play, knocking on the door of their first road win, only to see the Hurricanes go on a 10-0 run to close the game and win by two. 

If there was an NC State booster or alum sitting on the fence about cutting a buyout check on Friday, there was nothing about Saturday's performance that suggested a healthy state of the program. Going from an ACC championship to being one of the first-ever teams to miss the ACC Tournament is a huge ego blow to one of the league's founding members and a community that has long valued its status from the ACC's glory years in the 1970s and 1980s. 

There are many different ways that NC State could have performed this season to where missing the NCAA Tournament would not have been a fire-worthy offense for Keatts, but the drop-off was historically bad, and Keatts' response was to allege ungrateful behavior to disappointed fans. Keatts wishes NC State had more investment in the wake of last season's success, and NIL is absolutely a concern for the program as it tries to woo a coach to Raleigh in the coming weeks. But raising money for NIL requires some confidence on behalf of the fan base, and unfortunately, suspicion that nothing had changed regarding the coach they were prepared to fire a year ago was proven true. 

NC State also had to act because of the way things are changing in the conference. Louisville clearly just hit a home run with the hire of Pat Kelsey, SMU seems happy with the Year 1 success of Andy Enfield, and even Stanford had a winning conference record with first-year coach Kyle Smith. Throw in the changes that are coming this year — Miami and Florida State have already made hires, while Virginia will be next in line — and the school has to see how inaction could result in being left behind. 

There's also the internal turnover of NC State getting a new chancellor at the end of the school year and the ACC entering into a new era of revenue distribution with bonuses for on-field success and TV ratings. Documentaries celebrating the 2024 season aren't going to drive bonuses in that department, so if Keatts was not poised to put together a team capable of winning in the postseason, then the time was right to move in another direction. 

So was firing Keatts a little bit cold? Yes. But if the relationship between coach and the fan base was fractured beyond repair, then it was not realistic to think that a major NIL boost was going to come prior to the 2024-25 season. Making this move gives NC State basketball a clean reboot, where the Keatts-led Final Four run remains a reminder of what can happen without carrying along the baggage of all of the disappointment that followed.

Over the course of a college football season, almost every team will need to turn to a backup quarterback. At Texas, Arch Manning stepped in and led the Longhorns to two wins when Quinn Ewers went down. Notre Dame's Steve Angeli spurred a run against Georgia in the national quarterfinals. The most famous example, of course, involved Ohio State's third-string QB Cardale Jones leading the Buckeyes to a national championship. 

But while quarterback depth only gets more important in the expanded College Football Playoff era, it's never been harder to keep players on campus. The transfer portal and NIL mean that any players without a pathway to the starting job typically leave. The opportunity cost is too great for most, which makes the deep rooms even more valuable.

It's worth clarifying: This is a ranking of the deepest quarterback rooms in the sport. It's not a listing of the best quarterbacks in the sport. Miami's Carson Beck may be the best QB in college football, but the backups are far more unproven. The same is true of Texas, which ranked among the best last season. With Arch Manning moving from backup to starter, the depth is far less special. The top dog being exceptional helps, but is certainly not a requirement. 

In fact, quarterback uncertainty can be a quiet blessing. Several of the top teams on this list have open quarterback competitions between qualified players. Opportunity is a great incentive to stick around into the fall. With that said, here are the six deepest quarterback rooms in college football heading into the 2025 season. 

Key players: Ty Simpson, Austin Mack, Keelon Russell

The Crimson Tide may have been down in 2024, but Alabama is coming into 2025 with the most impressive quarterback competition in the nation. Mack was well regarded when coach Kalen DebBoer recruited him to Washington, and he opted to follow DeBoer to Tuscaloosa. Simpson was a five-star who waited three years for his opportunity. The wild card is Russell, an early-enrollee who ranked as the No. 2 overall player in the Top247 out of Duncanville, Texas. While the group lacks starting snaps, the sheer amount of talent and practice experience makes it the envy of the nation. 

Key players: Garrett Nussmeier, Michael Van Buren

Nussmeier is perhaps the best returning quarterback in college football after clearing 4,000 yards as a first-year starter. He will have plenty to work with after LSU brought in an impressive portal class. Landing Van Buren from Mississippi State is a coup. He was essentially the only bright spot on a miserable Bulldogs squad and has all the tools to be LSU's quarterback of the future after throwing for more than 1,800 yards in Starkville. Behind Van Buren, the backup situation gets a little interesting. The Tigers moved running back Ju'Juan Johnson to quarterback. Freshman Colin Hurley suffered a serious car accident in January, and there have been few updates on his status. Still, the duo at the top should cover most situations. 

Key players: Sam Leavitt, Jeff Sims, Cameron Dyer

Leavitt has a strong case as the best returning quarterback in the Big 12 after leading the Sun Devils to the College Football Playoff. The former Michigan State transfer creates opportunities with both his arm and legs and could key another season of league contention. While Sims' career has been defined by frustration, he boasts more than 700 pass attempts across stops at three schools. He is one of the most experienced backups in the country. Furthermore, the freshman Dyer is a thrilling recruit at the position, ranked No. 141 in the Top247. If he sticks at quarterback, he could push for backup snaps. 

Key players: Sawyer Robertson, Walker White, Edward Griffin, Nate Bennett

The Bears boast a picture perfect quarterback room heading into a pivotal 2025 season. Robertson sits as one of the nation's most underrated signal-callers in the nation and leads all returning starters nationally in both EPA and QBR. He will make an All-American case. Behind him, White was a top-50 recruit who picked Auburn over Baylor during the recruiting process. After one year with the Tigers, he opted to transfer to Waco, giving Baylor a true quarterback of the future. The staff is also high on Griffin, a freshman from Coppell, Texas, who set Texas high school football's top classification on fire. Having a proven commodity, elite backup and a couple of high-upside swings is an ideal succession plan for a program that hopes to jump into the Big 12 title conversation. 

Key players: Steve Angeli, CJ Carr, Kenny Minchey

The Fighting Irish should have a dynamic battle for the starting quarterback position between Angeli and Carr, two players who have proven their loyalty to the program. Carr, the grandson of former Michigan coach Lloyd Carr, ranked as the top quarterback recruit at Notre Dame since Brandon Wimbush nearly a decade ago. Angeli has owned the backup snaps to this point, and he showed a speedy release and serious arm talent. Either should quickly bring an infusion of downfield passing ability to the Notre Dame offense, which has not been a guarantee in recent years. 

Key players: Jackson Arnold, Ashton Daniels, Deuce Knight

The Tigers don't have a surefire starting caliber player, but the sheer amount of on-field experience pushes them into the conversation. Arnold (Oklahoma) and Daniels (Stanford) were both starters last season at their respective programs. Arnold was a five-star recruit and the No. 1 player out of Texas when he chose the Sooners, while Daniels started for two seasons at Stanford. The pair combined for nearly 1,000 pass attempts over the past two seasons. Knight, a member of the Class of 2025, is a wildcard after coming to Auburn as the No. 56 player in the class. Auburn coach Hugh Freeze will have to move quickly after flipping the entire QB room, but the reps are there.

The Atlanta Falcons are parting ways with a franchise legend by releasing two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Grady Jarrett on Monday, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reports. 

Cutting him hours before the start of the legal tampering period at noon ET,  Atlanta will save $16.25 million in cap space by not letting Jarrett play out the final season of a three-year, $49.5 million contract. He didn't have any guaranteed money remaining on the deal, which is why the Falcons are saving as much as they are in the transaction. Jarrett's 36.5 career sacks are the sixth-most in franchise history, but he combined for just four across the last two seasons. That's probably why he was let go on Monday. However, it's undeniable that Jarrett's 10 years with the Falcons were anything but a hit after he was selected in the fifth round (137th overall) of the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson. Now, left tackle Jake Matthews is the only player remaining from Atlanta's 2016 NFC Championship season. 

Now that Jarrett is a free agent, let's take a look at five potential landing spots for the Pro Bowl defensive tackle.

Signing Jarrett would make sense for Dallas for a few reasons. One is simple: they need more depth at the defensive tackle spot. Re-signing Osa Odighizuwa after a career year was a nice first move, but they need more depth to push 2023 first-round pick Mazi Smith, who has underwhelmed through two seasons. Jarrett could start next to Odighizuwa and teach Smith a thing or two. Most importantly for owner and general manager Jerry Jones, Jarrett likely wouldn't break the bank.

The Jaguars defense was one of the worst in football a season ago, ranking bottom five in the league in many statistics. Jacksonville has two solid edge rushers in Josh Hines-Allen and Travon Walker, but it needs a difference-maker in the middle of the defensive line. Adding a veteran defensive tackle like Grady Jarrett could move the needle in an AFC South division that feels up for grabs each year despite the Houston Texans winning it in each of the last two seasons. 

The Lions' defensive line was decimated by injuries in 2024, and Levi Onwuzurike is hitting the open market at the age of 27. Jarrett could be a cost effective replacement for him while providing similar production.

The Bengals watched in horror as new deals for edge rusher Myles Garrett and wide receiver DK Metcalf drove up the prices for wide receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins as well as 2024 sacks leader Trey Hendrickson. Money will be tight in Cincinnati, which means re-signing defensive tackle B.J. Hill may or may not be in the cards. If Jarrett is willing to take less money to come help fix the defense opposite Joe Burrow's high-flying offense, this move could make some sense. 

San Francisco released defensive tackle Javon Hargrave this offseason, and they're not exactly flush with cash while staring down the barrel of a massive extension for quarterback Brock Purdy. However, they could perhaps get Jarrett to venture out west given they were playing in overtime of the Super Bowl just two seasons ago. Adding Jarrett and having better injury fortune could turn things around for the 49ers in a hurry.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Acbssports.com,College basketball rankings: How Michigan State can make its case for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament,https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/college-basketball-rankings-how-michigan-state-can-make-its-case-for-a-no-1-seed-in-the-ncaa-tournament/,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 13:22:00 GMT","

If the NCAA Tournament started today, the four No. 1 seeds would likely be Auburn, Duke, Houston and Florida.

But let's talk about Michigan State.

Tom Izzo's Spartans beat Michigan 79-62 on Sunday to improve to 26-5 overall, 17-3 in the Big Ten. As a result, they secured the outright conference championship by three games and remained in contention, I think, to be a No. 1 seed in the 2025 NCAA Tournament.

Do the Spartans control their own destiny?

Probably not.

But if Florida or Houston stumbles early in their conference tournaments, and Michigan State adds three more Quadrant 1 victories en route to winning the Big Ten Tournament, the Spartans would have a case to make. Based on current numbers, winning the Big Ten Tournament would likely have Michigan State with a 15-4 record in Q1 to go with a 5-1 record in Q2, which would have them sitting at 20-5 in the first two quadrants on Selection Sunday. 

Again, that might not be good enough if Auburn and Duke are locks to get No. 1 seeds, and if Houston and Florida win out (or at least get to their conference tournament title games). But if the Cougars or Gators get caught early, a door will open -- and the Spartans could be the team that walks through it.

Michigan State remains No. 5 in Monday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Auburn is No. 1 for the 61st consecutive day. The Spartans will open the Big Ten Tournament in Friday's quarterfinals against the winner of Thursday's game between Indiana and Oregon.

It's that awkward in-between time on the college basketball calendar where the offseason rigamarole has begun, bids are being earned and Selection Sunday is less than a week away. That was on full display in the last 24 hours when programs like High Point and Omaha (pray for the trashcans) punched tickets to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in school history. Oh, and NC State axed Kevin Keatts less than a year after he led them on a magical run to the 2024 Final Four team.

What a glorious and unforgiving sport. 

CBS Sports' Isaac Trotter and Cameron Salerno dive into various topics in the sport they're buying or selling, starting with the Wolfpack's shocking-to-some move.

Salerno: Sell. Keatts probably should've been fired last season. But that was before NC State went on a tear down the stretch and reached the Final Four for the first time since 1983. Sure, this season wasn't great, but firing a coach less than 12 months after going to the Final Four is cold. Although this decision was justifiable based on his body of work, the timing is bad. Change was going to be inevitable at NC State, but it's still surprising that it happened right now.

Trotter: Buy. From a human aspect, it feels gross to see Keatts forced to ""enter the transfer portal"" –– in his own words –– a year after leading NC State to the Final Four. But from a basketball perspective, this isn't even close to a question in my mind. Last year was an unprecedented heater that might not be replicated ever again. Those nine wins in a row were special and also wildly unsustainable. The multiple years of roster-construction whiffs were the reality and felt wildly sustainable. Keatts can fairly blame the lack of NIL all he wants, but NC State's portal evaluations last spring were not good enough, and if you watched NC State this year, it had no semblance of an identity on a nightly basis. There are numerous examples of good coaches losing March over and over again until they don't. The inverse also has to be true. One insane Big Dance run shouldn't cover up the same flaws that kept popping up year after year after year. I don't blame the NC State brass for deciding that enough was enough after a year when it missed the ACC Tournament and fan support was rapidly shrinking by the day. Plus, it has an upgrade on Line One.

Salerno: Buy. Alabama certainly has its flaws, but if we are talking about pure talent and the ability to win six consecutive games against quality opponents, the Crimson Tide check both boxes. Alabama struggled down the stretch last season but won four straight games to reach the first Final Four in program history. I still believe in the depth Alabama has. A key component of its Final Four run last year was unsung heroes stepping up in big moments. Pound for pound, Alabama has one of the best offenses in the country. The defense – and lack of physicality from the frontcourt — are two question marks heading into the tournament. Alabama was my preseason pick to win the title. I'm sticking with the Crimson Tide until the wheels fall off, which could happen sooner than later.

Trotter: Sell. The best version of Alabama includes a mean-muggin' Grant Nelson. His 25-point, eight-rebound showing against Auburn was enormous and equally frustrating because that snarl just hasn't shown up much throughout SEC play. Overall, Alabama's big fellas are holding me back from putting it in that top tier of title contenders with the likes of Auburn, Duke or Florida. It still feels like there are times when Nate Oats and his staff are searching for the best frontcourt pairing on a game-to-game basis. The defense is good when Cliff Omoruyi is on the floor and slips when he sits. But the offense usually improves when Omoruyi is on the bench. It's frustrating because it feels like there are plenty of times that Alabama can't get its best five players on the floor without something going awry. Of course, Alabama can win the title because it's battle-tested as anybody, but I wouldn't bet on it. There are too many other teams with fewer defects at the top of the national food chain.

Salerno: Buy. North Carolina got a tough draw in the ACC Tournament because by getting the No. 5 seed, it won't have an opportunity to pick up a Quad 1 win unless it beats Duke in the semifinals in Charlotte. The Tar Heels would have to win two games just to get there. UNC could then solidify a NCAA Tournament bid with a matchup against another Quad 1 opponent (Clemson or Louisville) in the ACC title game. But that's a lot of 'what ifs.' 

I said last week that UNC's game against Duke was a ""must-win"" game for its NCAA Tournament hopes, and I still stand by that. North Carolina has to pull an NC State to get into the tournament. Missing the NCAA Tournament for the second time in three years would be disastrous. UNC coach Hubert Davis will be back next season, but if his team misses the Big Dance this month, his seat will be red hot heading into the 2025-26 campaign.

Trotter: Sell. Saturday felt like North Carolina's last-gasp Super Bowl, and Duke still found a way to survive with a double-digit victory. I just don't see UNC getting back off the mat in the ACC Tournament after that emotional rollercoaster. I'm much more focused on teams like Baylor (more on them later), Indiana, Arkansas and a Mountain West Tournament that should be berserk. I think Xavier may have the most to gain in conference tournament week. If it earns the right to dance, Xavier has the recipe to make serious noise. Not just make the tournament but actually advance. No Big East team has had a higher net rating since Feb. 1 than Xavier. 

Salerno: Sell. This may end up becoming a cold take. I'm fine with it being just that because who doesn't love what Rick Pitino is doing at St. John's? The Red Storm has been one of the best stories in college basketball. They have taken on the identity of their coach. St. John's plays hard, rebounds like crazy and plays great defense. I'm still skeptical about how far this team can go in the tournament. The 3-point shooting is concerning, and the lack of wins against Quad 1 competition is also something that makes you think twice. My take: St. John's won't make it out of the first weekend.

Trotter: Buy. I certainly love what Xavier is cooking up these days, but the St. John's defense is still the best unit of any Big East club. Better than Creighton's brilliant offense. Better than Marquette's pressure defense. Better than UConn's beautiful offensive system. I think the Johnnies have what it takes to advance in March because they constantly win the shot-volume game, they're highly switchable, the perimeter size and athleticism is overwhelming and Rick Pitino is one of the elite coaches on the planet.

Salerno: Sell. But … There is an argument for it. Auburn's overall resume is better than Duke's, and the Blue Devils own the head-to-head advantage. Still, I have a hard time believing the committee would put Duke as the No. 1 overall seed just because of what Auburn did in SEC play against that level of competition. I thought Auburn locked up the No. 1 overall seed following a win over Alabama last month. Even after last weekend's loss to the Crimson Tide, I would still have Auburn firmly No. 1. Now, if Duke wins the ACC Tournament and Auburn has an early exit in its conference tournament, there may be a discussion about who should be the No. 1 overall seed this weekend. For now, Auburn gets the nod.

Trotter: Sell. Auburn's resume metrics are incredible. Eight Quad 1A wins are absurd, and it sits No. 1 in the nation in Wins Above Bubble. The predictive metrics lean toward Duke, and that's fine, but Auburn is the worthy top seed overall. A rematch in San Antonio would be sizzling. 

Salerno: Buy. There will be a level of urgency for Baylor at the Big 12 Tournament this week. The Bears are on the bubble as one of the ""Last Four In,"" and an early exit in the conference tournament will cause Scott Drew's squad to sweat next weekend. Baylor will face the winner of Oklahoma State vs. Kansas State in the second round of the Big 12 Tournament. The Bears need to win that matchup and potentially beat Texas Tech to feel comfortable. Still, a win in the first round will probably be enough unless there are numerous bid stealers during the next week.

Trotter: Buy. We'll see how the chase for bid-stealers coalesces, but Drake over Bradley in the Missouri Valley Conference championship game was a big one for bubblicious teams like Baylor. At the end of the day, I like Baylor's resume more than an Ohio State or even Arkansas. Baylor will be sweating on Selection Sunday, but I think Scott Drew's club ultimately gets in the field relatively safely if it avoids losing in its Big 12 Tournament opener.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Acbssports.com,MLB Power Rankings: The top 12 hitting duos for the 2025 season,https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-power-rankings-the-top-12-hitting-duos-for-the-2025-season/,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 12:55:00 GMT","

We've already run through the best lineups, rotations and bullpens in our top 10s that fill in for power rankings during spring training. Next up is a fun and quite debatable project. We're going to rank the best ""duos"" in baseball. And for this one, I'm going up to a top 12. 

The most fun part of this is it doesn't actually matter. The best teams will have more than two great players and a lot of times our picks for the top duo on the team don't even bat back-to-back. I'm also going to ignore pitchers because I feel like if we talk about teams with the best duo, part of the mindset is you can watch this duo play together on an everyday basis. 

As we've been doing with this series, this is a predictive ranking for the 2025 season. Past results don't matter as much as what lies ahead, but only for this year. The temptation might be to rank Dylan Crews and James Wood for the Nationals, for example, but my hunch is they aren't there just yet. 

And while defense can move the needle, this is mostly about offense. The purpose is basically to see a collection of lineups and these are the top 10 duos of players that would most jump out as imposing. If we went back to the last two World Series, it's a nice illustration of the purpose. The 2023 Diamondbacks had Ketel Marte and Corbin Carroll while the champion Rangers had Corey Seager and Marcus Semien. Last year, it was Aaron Judge and Juan Soto on the Yankees while the Dodgers actually had three stars standing out at the top of the order. 

As an added bonus on the list this week, you not only get to disagree with the ranking itself, but you'll also have an avenue to gripe with my choices as the top duo for each team. 

Also considered: Jarren Duran and Rafael Devers, Red Sox; Kyle Tucker and Seiya Suzuki, Cubs; Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette, Blue Jays; Jackson Chourio and William Contreras, Brewers; Elly De La Cruz and Matt McLain, Reds; Carlos Correa and Byron Buxton, Twins; Mike Trout and Jorge Soler, Angels; Lawrence Butler and Brent Rooker, A's; Julio Rodríguez and Cal Raleigh, Mariners; Willy Adames and Matt Chapman, Giants

In all likelihood, Altuve, who turns 35 this season, has hit his decline. And yet, he still hit .295/.350/.439 with 20 homers and 22 steals last season. He isn't the MVP-caliber player he used to be, but he's still a difference-maker in the lineup and the Astros are a formidable presence until they show us otherwise. 

Alvarez is among the most menacing hitters in baseball. His last three seasons average out to .303/.401/.587 with 162-game averages of 42 homers and 115 RBI. Of course, his career high in games was last season with 147 and he only played in 114 in 2023. His career high in home runs in an actual season is 37. He's a total stud and yet his ceiling still seems very slightly limited over the course of 162 games.

They needed to be included here, but these aren't the 2022-and-earlier Astros. 

Ramírez has been one of the best and most underrated players in baseball for a long time. A long time. Yes, he's long been known to be one of the best players to draft in fantasy baseball, but I'm talking among casual baseball fans. He's not nearly as well known as he should be. He finished third place in MVP voting back in 2017 and 2018. He finished fifth last season. He's still only 32 and is working on a pretty nice Hall of Fame case. He has to do a little heavy lifting here, but Kwan is a nice second piece, having hit .292/.368/.425 (126 OPS+) last season, his third in the majors. 

The Braves were tough for multiple reasons. First off, Austin Riley and Marcell Ozuna are also in the mix for being part of the top duo. Those two may end up better than the two I picked. There's also the fact that Acuña is coming off his second torn ACL. I ultimately picked him, but it also lands the Braves a few spots lower because he's a bit limited to start the season. This duo would've been in the mix for No. 1 after the 2023 season. In fact, I think it would've won, as Acuña had won 2023 MVP while Olson clubbed 54 homers with 139 RBI. 

There's no doubt Olson was worse than Ozuna last year, but I've got Olson taking a step forward and getting a bit closer to his 2023 self while Ozuna is 34 years old and will likely soon hit his decline. It was tough to leave Riley off. Among this foursome, though, I don't feel like there's a wrong answer. And if anything, this ranking will prove too low. 

Tatis looked like he was becoming the next great face of baseball after the 2021 season. Then came the 2022 disaster that included a PED suspension and shoulder surgery. He hasn't been the same since, but his immense talent cannot be denied and that's why I'm taking him over Jackson Merrill here. It's his upside. He's still only 26 years old and capable of becoming that 2021 version of himself again. 

Machado is heading to his age-32 season, so that age-related decline should remain a few years away. He was MVP runner-up in 2022, but has battled consistency issues since. Still, he hit .275 with a 120 OPS+, 29 homers and 105 RBI last year. 

If I was basing this ranking on last season, Tatis and Machado would probably fall out of the top 12. If I was basing it only on upside for the 2025 season, they could hit the top five. There's plenty of variance with these two but, again, their upside is monstrous. 

Marte looked like the biggest challenger to Shohei Ohtani for a second last season, but a late injury knocked him down to third place in the MVP race. He's still in the middle of his prime and coming off his best year yet (.292/.372/.560, 155 OPS+, 6.8 WAR). He also might be the second-best player on his own team. Carroll was a superstar in 2023, winning NL Rookie of the Year and finishing fifth in MVP voting. He followed it up with an utterly miserable start to the 2024 season. He did find himself down the stretch, though, hitting .254/.343/.557 in his last 75 games. He finished with 22 doubles, 14 triples, 22 homers, 74 RBI, 35 stolen bases and 121 runs. A full season of both players firing on all cylinders means the D-backs offense is one of the best in the league. 

The perpetual injury concern for Seager lingers and Semien is coming off his worst year since 2018. I think we have to consider the World Series hangover is real with Semien. He plays every single game. He appeared in 162 games in 2021, 161 in 2022 and 162 in 2023. Tack on 17 playoff games in 2023 that bled into November and it's possible he was just exhausted last season. It happens. I'm counting on him looking a lot more like 2023 this year. Seager is, of course, an MVP-caliber player whenever he's on the field. In the last two seasons, he's hit .303/.371/.567 (160 OPS+) with 63 doubles, 63 homers and 170 RBI in 242 games. 

The Rangers were and are much more, but the won the 2023 on the strength of this duo and they remain a force. 

It was a tough call to pick these two and not include Trea Turner, but make sure to take note that I'm leaning on how imposing the two players look, offensively, on the lineup card. 

In his three seasons with the Phillies, Schwarber has averaged 44 home runs per season. Last year, he raised his batting average over 50 points and posted a .366 on-base percentage while leading the NL in walks. He's hit the 100-run mark three straight years and even topped 100 RBI twice despite hitting leadoff a good portion of the time. 

Harper's OPS+ in the last three seasons? 146, 145, 149, respectively. Basically, he's going to be between 45% and 50% better than average while posting a good batting average and hitting home runs at a full-season pace of mid-30s (he's averaged 34 home runs for every 162 games during his time in Philly).

This isn't the highest-ranked duo where this is the case, but it should be noted that one individual can drag the other member of the duo up a bit higher. It doesn't have to be an equal partnership. That was always going to be the case with the Royals, whether I went with Vinnie Pasquantino or stuck with the venerable Sal. Perez is 35 years old this season, but he's still got plenty of power, having hit 27 homers with 104 RBI last season. The 119 OPS+ was his best mark since the 2021 season when he hit 48 bombs. 

This is, of course, mostly about Witt, though. There's heavy competition, but there's also an argument to be made that he's the single best player in baseball this season. In 161 games last year, he collected 211 hits, which included 45 doubles, 11 triples and 32 homers. He drove home 109 runs while scoring 125 times. He stole 31 bases. He hit .332 with a .588 slugging percentage. He joined the legend George Brett as the only Royals players to ever top 9.0 WAR. He doesn't even turn 25 years old until June. 

We're banking on bounce-backs here from the second half in 2024. After the All-Star break, Rutschman hit .207/.282/.303 while Henderson's OPS was .956 before the break and .799 after. Henderson was still a beast all season long and finished fourth in AL MVP voting, but there was a downgrade there. I'm counting on both of these players to much more closely resemble who they were in the first half and the wall in left field coming in a bit with give the switch-hitting Rutschman a boost from the right side. 

With the departure of a player who will be (spoiler alert) in the No. 1 spot, Aaron Judge is left to do a lot of heavy lifting with anyone else for the Yankees' top duo. He's plenty capable of that, though. He didn't have an obvious Robin to his Batman in 2022, when he hit 62 home runs with 131 RBI. Last season, he was ridiculous, slashing .322/.458/.701 with 58 homers and 144 RBI. I think Bellinger is really going to enjoy playing his home games in Yankee Stadium, with that violent-looking swing tailor-made for the short right-field porch.

This ranking is mostly about Judge, though. He's just that good at the plate. 

The Dodgers suffer here from the exercise being limited to two players. If we did best trios, we'd loop in Freddie Freeman and put the Dodgers at the top without a second thought. It was difficult to choose between Freeman and Betts and I wouldn't argue with anyone deciding to use Freeman, coming off his historic World Series performance. I chose Betts because Freeman is now 35 years old and on a surgically repaired ankle. 

There's not a ton of explanation needed for Ohtani and Betts being ranked this high. It's two MVPs -- Betts has one with three second-place finishes while Ohtani has three along with one second-place finish -- who fill up the stat sheet regularly. 

The shiny, new toy bumps the Mets to the top of the list. Lindor was stellar last season, finishing second in NL MVP voting to Ohtani while Soto finished third on the AL side behind Judge and Witt. Soto is the best on-base machine in baseball and he also hit 41 home runs last season. He again walked more than he struck out. He's now sitting right behind Lindor, who hit .308/.376/.560 with 26 homers and 23 steals in his last 107 games last regular season before a good postseason that included a series-clinching grand slam. 

Lindor is 31 years old while Soto is still only 26. This is the best duo in baseball for 2025.

Derrick Henry's debut season with the Baltimore Ravens went so well that general manager Eric DeCosta didn't rule out extending the All-Pro running back's contract during his season-ending press conference in late January following a 27-25 AFC divisional-round playoff loss to the Buffalo Bills. ""Derrick proved he had a lot left in the tank, DeCosta said. ""We'll look at that. ... I'm so grateful Derrick chose us last year.""

Henry had the best NFL season ever for a 30-year-old running back in 2024. He was second in the NFL with 1,921 rushing yards, led the NFL with 16 rushing touchdowns, tied for the second-most total touchdowns with 18 and posted a career-high 5.9 yards per carry, which was tops among running backs. 

According to the NFL's Next Gen Stats, Henry's 1.77 rushing yards over expectation per attempt was the league's best mark. He did all of this while facing eight or more defenders in the box 33.23% of the time, which was the NFL's third-highest rate. 

Henry added 186 rushing yards on 26 carries to set a Ravens single-game playoff record in a 28-14 AFC wild-card win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was Henry's third postseason contest with 175 or more rushing yards, which is an NFL record.

Henry's performance in 2024 was overshadowed by Saquon Barkley, who arguably had the best season in NFL history for a running back. Barkley had a legitimate shot at breaking Eric Dickerson's 40-year-old, single-season record of 2,105 rushing yards before the Philadelphia Eagles decided to rest him for the regular-season finale against the New York Giants since the game didn't affect playoff seeding. 

Henry is entering the final year of a two-year, $16 million contract worth up to $20 million through incentives. He is scheduled to make $7 million on a $12.895 million salary cap number in 2025. The $7 million consists of a $6 million base salary and a $1 million fifth day of the 2025 league year roster bonus due on March 16. None of this money is guaranteed.

The Ravens and the rest of the NFL were caught off guard when the Eagles extended the three-year, $37.75 million contract averaging $12,583,333 per year (worth as much as $46.75 million through incentives and salary escalators) with $26 million in guarantees, of which $24.5 million was fully guaranteed at signing, Barkley received in 2024 free agency a few days ago. Barkley became the NFL's first $20 million-per-year running back on a two-year, $41.2 million contract extension averaging $20.6 million per year with $36 million fully guaranteed. 

There are $15 million of incentives and salary escalators in Barkley's contract. Out of the $15 million in performance bonuses, only $1.5 million were already in Barkley's old contract so $13.5 million are new.

The 2024 NFL Offensive Player of the Year replaces Christian McCaffrey at the top of the running back salary hierarchy. After being named 2023's NFL Offensive Player of the Year, the San Francisco 49ers signed McCaffrey to a two-year, $38 million extension averaging $19 million per year with $24 million fully guaranteed last June.

In hindsight, the Ravens should have moved quicker given that Henry was already underpaid. Barkley's deal only exacerbates the problem.

Henry isn't among the NFL's 10 highest-paid running backs by average yearly salary. He is tied for 12th with D'Andre Swift. Since Henry signed with the Ravens last March, James Conner, Chuba Hubbard, Aaron Jones, David Montgomery and Rhamondre Stevenson, who are vastly inferior, have gotten deals averaging more than his $8 million per year.

The New England Patriots signed Stevenson to a four-year, $36 million extension (worth up to $48 million through incentives) averaging $9 million per year with $17.116 million fully guaranteed last June. Montgomery signed a two-year, $18.25 million extension averaging $9.125 million per year with the Detroit Lions in October. He splits carries with Jahmyr Gibbs in Detroit. 

The Carolina Panthers rewarded Hubbard with a four-year, $33.2 million extension (worth up to $37.2 million) with $16.558 million of guarantees in early November. Conner received a two-year, $19 million extension averaging $9.5 million per year from the Arizona Cardinals at the end of November. Aaron Jones, who is 30, just agreed to a two-year, $20 million deal with $13.5 million in guarantees where $11.5 million is fully guaranteed to remain with the Minnesota Vikings.

The Ravens should be willing to make Henry one of the five highest-paid running backs in the NFL. Josh Jacobs is currently fifth on the four-year, $48 million contract averaging $12 million per year he signed with the Green Bay Packers as an unrestricted free agent last March. 

Henry, who turned 31 in January, is three years older than Barkley and McCaffrey was on the verge of turning 28 when he signed his extension. Barkley has 1,546 career carries. McCaffrey was at 1,297 when he signed.

The age gap and Henry's mileage should prevent him from getting a new deal in the same neighborhood as these two. Although Henry isn't showing any signs of slowing down, his 2,355 rushing attempts rank 32nd in NFL history.

Approximating the average of the NFL's five highest-paid running backs may be more appropriate. This number is $14.9 million per year with 2.6 new years being the average length of contract. Doing so would put Henry third on the running back salary totem pole. That distinction belongs to Jonathan Taylor. He received a three-year, $42 million extension averaging $14 million per year from the Indianapolis Colts early in the 2023 regular season.

DeCosta shouldn't have an issue with this type of contract if he is sincere about the effusive praise he heaped on Henry while speaking to the media at the NFL combine in late February. ""Derrick is just a phenomenal worker,"" DeCosta said. ""He's a pro. He does everything the right way, the way that he practices, the way that he takes care of his body, his mentality on the field, his leadership, his talent -- he's freakishly talented -- his combination of size and speed. He was just a perfect player for us last year -- the right addition, and he brought a lot to the table on the field and also off the field with intangible qualities. ""We're blessed to have him, and I would expect his successes last year to continue this year.""

DeCosta further added when asked about the value of running backs. ""I think they're looked at as probably replaceable by some people, but if you have a great one, if you have a historic one, you can't replace those guys. They impact the game in many different ways, and they create nightmares for defenses.""

Henry can make a good case that he qualifies as a historic running back. Of the nine running backs with a 2,000-yard rushing season as Henry achieved in 2020 when he had 2,027 yards, he has come the closest to duplicating the feat. Prior to Henry's 1,921 rushing yards last season, Dickerson's 1,821 yards in 1986 were most in trying to repeat. Dickerson was 26 years old.

The Ravens would be paying Henry for his expected contribution, though, and not his career accomplishments. Henry's work ethic and professionalism give him more than a fighting chance at preventing the Ravens from having buyer's remorse because of severe diminishing returns.

Hall of Famer Curtis Martin had the most productive season for a 31-year-old running back. In 2004, as a member of the New York Jets, he led the NFL with 1,697 rushing yards on a league-most 371 carries, both career highs. Martin had 2,927 career rushing attempts prior to the 2004 season. 

Chicago Bears legend Walter Payton has the most rushing yards in a season at both 32 and 33. He was the MVP runner-up in 1985 after gaining 1,551 yards on 324 rushing attempts. He entered that season with 3,047 career carries. Payton followed up with 1,333 rushing yards (fifth in the NFL) on 321 carries in 1986. He had carried the ball 3,371 times heading into the 1986 season.

It should be noted that no running back has hit the 1,000-yard rushing mark more than twice during the 21st Century after having at least 2,000 career carries prior to turning 30. Henry had 2,030 rushing attempts before signing with the Ravens. Emmitt Smith did it twice in 2000 and 2001 during his last two seasons with the Dallas Cowboys at ages 31 and 32 when he had 1,203 and 1,021 yards. He had 3,537 career carries heading into the 2001 season. Smith also topped the 1,000-yard mark in 1999 when he was 30 with 1,397 yards. 

A two-year, $30 million extension averaging $15 million per year would run through the 2027 season. Having $3 million of annual salary escalators to increase the 2026 and 2027 base salaries would make the deal worth as much as $36 million. 

The thresholds for the escalator would have to be high but realistically achievable, like $1.5 million for first team All-NFL and an additional $1.5 million for leading the NFL in rushing yards. There are three recognized media outlets (the Associated Press, Pro Football Writers of America and the Sporting News) for performance bonuses under the NFL collective bargaining agreement. The Pro Football Writers of America and the Sporting News named Henry first team All-NFL in 2024.

Henry would have just turned 34 when the contract expires. With a continued workload similar to 2024's, Henry would have 3,300 career carries at this point and would likely be just over 3,000 heading to the final year of the deal.

The Ravens could pick up $4 million of 2025 cap space with an extension before March 16 when the $1 million roster bonus is due. Henry's 2025 compensation would increase from $7 million to $12 million. There would be $10.5 million as a signing bonus that's prorated at $3.5 million on the salary cap from 2025 through 2027. Henry's base salary would be $1.5 million. The $2 million of incentives that are a 2025 cap charge from being classified as likely to be earned and the $1 million roster bonus would be eliminated in the new deal. His new 2025 cap number would be $8.895 million consisting of the $3.895 million of existing signing bonus proration from Henry's original Ravens contract, $3.5 million in new signing bonus proration and a $1.5 million 2025 base salary.

Henry would make $12.5 million each in 2026 and 2027 with his 2026 compensation being fully guaranteed at signing, but 2027 would be unsecured. Between the $12 million in 2025 and the $12.5 million in 2026, Henry would have $24.5 million fully guaranteed. His cap number would be $16 million in 2026 and 2027.

Henry got 56.25% or $9 million of the $16 million from his existing Ravens contract in the first year. Under the extension, Henry would have $17.5 million of the $30 million in new money through the first new contract year. That's 58.33% of the new money, which is a slight improvement with the cash flow percentage in Henry's current contract.

Henry would have a contract that better reflects his place among NFL running backs, but also takes into account his age and heavy usage. Provided Henry continues to hold off Father Time, his earnings from the contract would be in striking distance of the base value in Barkley and McCaffrey's extensions.

Justin Fields has decided to enter free agency for the first time in his career. The former first-round pick will be eligible to hear offers from other teams starting on Monday after Fields did not re-sign with the Steelers prior to the start of the league's legal tampering period. 

Fields can still re-sign with Pittsburgh, but he now has a chance to see if there any better offers/opportunities out there. The Steelers and Fields are open to a reunion, but Fields wants to see what his other options are before he makes a final decision, according to ESPN. The New York Jets continue to be a team that is reportedly interested in Fields. 

Last offseason, Fields was acquired by the Steelers via a trade with the Bears to back up Russell Wilson, who like Fields was also brought to Pittsburgh last offseason. Fields got to start the season's first six games after Wilson re-aggravated a calf injury that he had initially injured just before the start of training camp. 

With starting, the 2024 Steelers went 4-2 that included win over the playoff-bound Broncos and Chargers. Fields scored 10 total touchdowns (five rushing and five passing) in those games while throwing just one interception. 

In his fourth start, Fields threw for a season-high 312 yards while also rushing for 55 yards and two touchdowns in a loss to the Colts. Fields also ran for two scores in Pittsburgh's Week 6 win over the Raiders that was ultimately his final start of the season. 

Despite his success, Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin decided to go back to Wilson ahead of the Steelers' Week 7 showdown with the Jets. Wilson played well in that game and throughout his first seven starts as the Steelers went 6-1 over that span. But Wilson and the team struggled after that, as Pittsburgh ended the season on a five-game losing streak that included a wild-card playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens. 

During his final press conference of the 2024 season, Tomlin said that Fields showed him enough to warrant consideration to be the Steelers' starting quarterback in the future. Steelers president Art Rooney II said that the team's preference was to re-sign either Fields or Wilson. Recent reports suggested that the team was leaning towards re-signing Fields. 

The Steelers are reportedly open to considering other options at quarterback, although it's safe to assume that their preference remains re-signing either Fields or Wilson.

The roars return to TPC Sawgrass this week when the 2025 Players Championship tees off on Thursday, March 13. The 2025 Players Championship field is one of the strongest of the season, featuring 48 of the top 50 players in the Official World Golf Ranking. Scottie Scheffler, the No. 1-ranked player in the world, is the two-time defending champion and can become the first golfer to successfully three-peat at the Players if he's able to finish on top of the leaderboard. According to the latest 2025 Players Championship odds, Scheffler is the +360 favorite (risk $100 to win $360). 

He's followed by Rory McIlroy (+800), Collin Morikawa (+1600), Xander Schauffele (+1600), Ludvig Aberg (+2000), and Justin Thomas (+2000) on the PGA odds board. Should your 2025 Players Championship picks include backing one of the favorites, or should you look at a longshot like Jason Day (+6500), Jordan Spieth (+8000) or Rickie Fowler (+11000)? Before locking in your 2025 Players Championship picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.

SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up nearly $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.

This same model has also nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters -- its third Masters in a row -- and last year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting apps like FanDuel, DraftKings and Fanatics. 

Now that the 2025 Players Championship field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.

One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2025 Players Championship: Xander Schauffele, a nine-time PGA Tour champion and one of the top favorites, stumbles this week and barely cracks the top 10. Schauffele secured a T-2 finish at the Players Championship in 2024 but has dealt with injuries and inconsistent play early in 2025. 

Schauffele is coming off a T-40 showing at the Arnold Palmer Invitational last week, his first start back from a rib injury that kept him sidelined since The Sentry, where he finished T-30 in January. Schauffele's rusty return from injury was magnified with his short game at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. He lost 2.84 strokes putting in Round 1 and lost 1.79 shots around the greens. He's not a strong pick to win it all and there are far better values in the 2025 Players Championship field. See who else to fade here.  

Another surprise: Hideki Matsuyama, a 30-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday.

Matsuyama has had tremendous success at TPC Sawgrass in recent years. The 2021 Masters champion has finished T-6 or better in his last two starts at the Players Championship. He's an 11-time winner on the PGA Tour, which includes finishing on top of the leaderboard at The Sentry in January. Matsuyama enters this week's event ranked sixth in strokes gained: total (1.641), 12th in strokes gained: tee-to-green (1.167) and 13th in one-putt percentage (44.21%). Those impressive stats, plus his long odds, make him a strong value pick for your 2025 Players Championship bets. See who else to pick here.  

The model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of 30-1 or longer who will make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.

Who will win the 2025 Players Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world? Check out the 2025 Players Championship odds below and then visit SportsLine to see the projected leaderboard, all from the model that's nailed 13 golf majors, including the last three Masters and three majors in 2024.

JOSH ALLEN, MYLES GARRETT, DK METCALF AND DAVANTE ADAMS 

Show me the money! On the eve of the NFL's free agent negotiation window, Josh Allen and Myles Garrett got record-setting contracts, while DK Metcalf joined the party after being traded to the Steelers, and the Rams signed Davante Adams. 

We'll start with Allen, because ... wow. It's a six-year, $330 million extension for the reigning MVP, including an NFL-record $250 million guaranteed. The $55 million per year is tied for second-most of any player, only behind Dak Prescott. Allen still had four years left on his current deal, but this ties him to Buffalo through 2030. 

After a testy last month, Garrett isn't going anywhere, either. The 2023 Defensive Player of the Year agreed to a four-year, $160 million extension; the $40 million per year makes it the most lucrative ever for a non-quarterback. Garrett requested a trade more than a month ago, and as recently as Friday, Browns owner Jimmy Haslam refused to meet with Garrett. But cooler heads (and a lot of money) prevailed. 

This was also a big win for Micah Parsons, Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Trey Hendrickson, the non-quarterbacks seeking big paydays, Garrett Podell notes. 

As for a player whose trade request did come to fruition, Metcalf is heading to Pittsburgh for a second-round pick and getting a five-year, $150 million deal as well. In his trade grades, Bryan DeArdo liked this move for the Steelers, but when Cody Benjamin graded the biggest moves of the weekend, he wasn't as optimistic. 

Now the Steelers must figure out who will throw the ball to Metcalf, George Pickens and others. Here are the options. 

The Seahawks also need a quarterback after trading away Geno Smith, who's reuniting with Pete Carroll in Las Vegas after he and Seattle couldn't settle on an extension. The Raiders sent a third-round pick Seattle's way. 

Finally, Adams is joining the Rams on a two-year, $46 million deal. I like the move for both sides -- Jared Dubin even had Adams and the Rams together in his NFC free agent matchmaking -- and Sean McVay is going to have a ton of fun with the Matthew Stafford/Puka Nacua/Adams/Kyren Williams four-headed monster. 

Here's more from the weekend: 

Here's our live blog tracking every move, and here's our top 100 free agents tracker. 

LEBRON JAMES AND THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS 

The Lakers' excellent vibes came to an immediate and painful halt Saturday night, with LeBron James exiting Los Angeles' eventual 111-101 loss to the Celtics in the fourth quarter with a groin strain. He is expected to miss at least one to two weeks. 

Sam Quinn details how Los Angeles can survive without James. 

Yes, a lot of big names have come off the board via re-signings and released players finding homes. 

But at the stroke of noon ET today, another wave of madness is coming as the free agency negotiating period begins. 

Six of Pete Prisco's top 10 free agents remain on the market, with Sam Darnold leading the way. In his bold predictions, Garrett has Darnold returning to one of his former teams. 

Make sure you keep our live blog and our top 100 free agents tracker up and running all day. Here's more: 

No. 7 Alabama certainly lost some believers amid late-season struggles. The Crimson Tide may have just gained a lot of them back this weekend, topping No. 1 Auburn, 93-91, in overtime in The Jungle on Mark Sears' floater as time expired. 

Sears struggled much of the afternoon, but Grant Nelson (23 points), Labaron Philon (15) and Clifford Omoruyi (15) were excellent, helping the Crimson Tide keep pace with Johni Broome's 34 points, eight rebounds and five blocks. Not only is this a huge win in a rivalry game, but it puts Alabama in the running for a No. 1 seed, Jerry Palm writes. 

Auburn, meanwhile, has lost two straight. Though the Tigers remain atop Gary Parrish's Top 25 And 1, Kyle Boone projects they fall to No. 2 in today's AP Top 25. 

Kyle has No. 2 Duke surging to the top spot, and for good reason: The Blue Devils thumped North Carolina, 82-69, to take the ACC regular-season title. I was really impressed by Duke, which went on the road and overcame not only a big game from R.J. Davis on Senior Night but also Cooper Flagg's foul trouble. Trailing by six with under 13 minutes left, Duke went on a 12-0 run and never looked back, earning a place among the winners in our weekend winners and losers. 

North Carolina, meanwhile, remains in the ""First Four Out"" of Jerry's bracketology, and wins from fellow bubble teams like Oklahoma and Indiana didn't help. 

Elsewhere ... 

That means this week's conference tournament brackets are set. Here are the biggest ones: 

Several teams have already clinched their bids as conference tournament champs: 

Two more bids go out tonight. Here's our tracker. 

I sure hope you weren't just focused on the men's side this weekend, because the women's conference tournaments absolutely brought the heat, none more so than the Big Ten Tournament, where UCLA overcame a double-digit deficit to beat USC, 72-67, in the championship game. 

How big was this one? CBS Sports bracketologist Connor Groel projects the Bruins will earn the No. 1 overall seed come Selection Sunday. 

UCLA lost the first two meetings, and it looked like the Trojans would make it a three-game sweep, leading 48-35 early in the third quarter. But the Bruins outscored the Trojans 37-19 the rest of the way, with Lauren Betts leading the charge offensively (13 second-half points) and everyone chipping in on defense. USC star JuJu Watkins managed just 11 points on 4 of 15 shooting in the second half. The Bruins committed to bottling up Watkins at every turn, yet what also emerged was a UCLA squad that appeared to rediscover its mojo, writes Jack Maloney. 

The Bruins' quest for the top seed was aided by South Carolina thumping Texas, 64-45, in the SEC Tournament championship. The Longhorns had been No. 1 in the country -- and in line for the No. 1 overall seed -- before an anemic offensive showing doomed them. 

The Longhorns aren't the only ones who slumped at the wrong time. Duke upset Notre Dame, 61-54, in the ACC Tournament semifinals. The Blue Devils went on to beat NC State in Sunday's final, but the stumbling Fighting Irish might be the bigger story. Ranked No. 1 in late February, Notre Dame has lost three of five entering the NCAA Tournament. 

Here's our conference championship roundup, and here's our tracker for every tournament.

The New York Liberty star will play a WNBA preseason game in Oregon, where she enjoyed a historic collegiate career.  





The New York Liberty will play a preseason game at the University of Oregon, meaning former Oregon Ducks Sabrina Ionescu and Nyara Sabally will get a chance to once again compete in Eugene. The Liberty will face off against the Toyota Antelopes of the Women’s Japan Basketball League in the exhibition on May 12th at 10pm ET. 

“I can’t wait to get back on the court in Eugene with the New York Liberty at Matthew Knight Arena,” Ionescu said in a statement. “I’ve got some great things in store throughout the weekend for my teammates: past and present, Oregon Women’s Basketball fans, the Eugene community and the SI20 Foundation.”

Ionescu enjoyed a storied career at Oregon that was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She is the NCAA’s all-time triple-doubles leader, and is Oregon’s all-time leader in points, assists, and three-point shots. Sabally, meanwhile, received All-PAC-12 honors twice, averaging 15.4 points and 7.8 rebounds in her final collegiate season. 

Both players were major contributors in the Liberty’s 2024 title run, with Ionescu hitting one of the biggest shots in basketball history in Game 3, and Sabally serving as a critical spark off the bench in Game 5. 

“As a player-first organization, we strive to be as collaborative and innovative with our athletes as possible,” said Jonathan Kolb, the Liberty’s general manager. “Bringing New York Liberty basketball to Eugene with two program greats, Sabrina and Nyara, was a natural next step coming off our franchise’s first championship. We would like to thank the University of Oregon Athletic Department and Toyota Antelopes for their partnership in bringing this vision to life.”

Last Spring, the Las Vegas Aces played a preseason game at the University of South Carolina, in celebration of former Gamecock and three-time WNBA MVP A’ja Wilson.

This spring, several games have already been scheduled bringing WNBA teams to college campuses. Notably, on May 4th, the Indiana Fever are playing a preseason game at the University of Iowa, Caitlin Clark’s alma mater. That game will be held against the Brazilian National Team; Fever forward Damiris Dantas is a Brazilian native and played on the national team for the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics.  

Similarly, the Chicago Sky will play the Brazilian National team at LSU on May 2; LSU is Angel Reese’s alma mater, while Kamilla Cardoso is a Brazilian native. 

These exhibition games are helping bridge the gap between college hoops and the pros. They’ll also allow college fans to see some of their all-time greats compete in person again. 

The Aces’ South Carolina game seems to have helped establish a new precedent for other WNBA teams to follow as they schedule future exhibition play — and luckily for fans at Oregon, Iowa, and LSU, some of their teams’ all-time greats will be making the highly-anticipated trip this Spring.

A veteran CB agrees to a HUGE deal in Carolina.

If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

There’s been very little reason to pay attention to the Carolina Panthers in recent years — especially on defense, which is why Jaycee Horn becoming the highest-paid DB in NFL history is sure to turn heads before free agency opens.

On Monday it was announced that Horn and the Panthers have reached a deal on a 4 year, $100M extension with $70M guaranteed. It sets a new market for cornerbacks under the ever-increasing salary cap, and is sure to be a temporary high water mark before Derek Stingley Jr. and Sauce Gardner sign new deals.

Horn, the No. 8 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, has been one of the Panthers most pivotal defensive figures. While he’s not a lockdown corner in the strictest sense of the word, he thrives as being a multi-faceted tool for defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero. Horn thrives at using his 6’1, 200-pound frame to play the joker as needed, either in a pass rushing role or in run support.

It’s here where Horn really shines. In 2024 Pro Football Focus graded him as the No. 8 pass-rushing cornerback in the NFL, 11th among corners in run-stopping, and he finished 3rd in the NFL for sacks among cornerbacks. This is the value he brings to the Panthers inside-out approach, which puts more emphasis on running the ball and stopping the run, rather than solely worrying about covering outside passes.

While the initial reaction might make this feel like an overpay, it’s really not. We’re simply seeing a new-normal being set in response to the salary cap increasing. Horn’s contract will get dwarfed soon, and could be surpassed as soon as this free agency period with the likes of Jevon Holland, D.J. Reed, and Carlton Davis all being on the open market.

The Carolina Panthers said they were being very selective at identifying players who were critical to their football vision, and getting deals done. So far the team has re-signed three key players in Horn, center Austin Corbett, and tight end Tommy Tremble. Now with more money to spend the front office will try to address the biggest needs on both sides of the ball.

Tracking every move made as NFL free agency opens

The NFL’s legal tampering period has arrived. Beginning at noon Eastern on Monday, unrestricted free agents are free to begin contract negotiations with potential new teams. However, as we have seen over the past several seasons, those negotiations wrap up rather quickly, as shortly after noon today we will learn about players agreeing to terms with new organizations.

We will be tracking the moves all week long. Before things truly get going feel free to check out our predictions for the top free agents, dive into the top free agents by position, or continue to read about some of the moves that have already been made via trade.

And yes, Sam Darnold might be the big target in free agency. What a time to be alive.

Did we settle on “pre-agency” for these moves? I believe we did.

Prior to the beginning of the legal tampering period, some trades were announced. While none of those moves can be made final until the league year officially begins on Wednesday here are the trades that have been agreed to:

Welp ...

It doesn’t seem like it would be that difficult to come up with yearly ideas for new baseball hats. Throw in some new colorways, play with some vintage logos — perhaps commission a well-known artist to reimagine a hat for each team. Somehow everything keeps going wrong, and this year’s New Era “Overlap” hats are going viral for creating some of the funniest, stupidest, most-amazing hats we’ve ever seen.

Conceptually the idea is simple: What if we overlaid a team logo on top of the name of the city or the team? Unfortunately nobody paused for two seconds to think what this would create, and so we got THESE.

Let’s rank the best 2025 NFL free agents, and prediction where they will land.

NFL Free Agency officially begins on Wednesday, March 12 at 4 p.m., but as usual we’re going to start hearing about deals far before that. The league’s legal tampering period opens at noon on Monday, March 10 — and this is when deals can start being made and agreed to, even if pen can’t be put to paper.

The 2025 free agent class is fascinating. It’s light on earth-shattering, big-name talent — but deep when it comes to really good football players who can legitimately help teams turn the corner, or get over the hump. Couple this with numerous teams amassing a large amount of cap space, and contenders struggling to get under the cap figure — well, it’s going to be a busy period.

Today we have assembled our final list of the Top 50 free agents this year, and offered a brief prediction on where we think they’re going to end up.

Past team: Tampa Bay BuccaneersPrediction: New England PatriotsSigned with: Tampa Bay Buccaneers

The New England Patriots have a massive need at wide receiver, even after drafting both Ja’Lynn Polk and Javon Baker a year ago. They also have a lot of money to spend.

Past team: Miami DolphinsPrediction: Jacksonville Jaguars

It feels like Holland is the odd man out for the Dolphins’ future after a pretty down year in 2024. Despite that, his versatility to play on the roof of a defense will be in high demand. He will not have to move far, however.

Past team: Minnesota VikingsPrediction: Seattle SeahawksSigned with: Seattle Seahawks

We had this as a clear-cut re-signing in Minnesota, and then the Geno Smith trade happened. Signs now point to the Seahawks focusing on Darnold, and the Vikes won’t bother getting into an intense bidding war.

Past team: Philadelphia EaglesPrediction: Arizona Cardinals

The Arizona Cardinals need some help up front, and a reunion between Josh Sweat and Jonathan Gannon, his former defensive coordinator, makes a lot of sense.

Past team: Philadelphia EaglesPrediction: New England PatriotsSigned with: New England Patriots

The New England Patriots granted defensive tackle Davon Godchaux permission to seek a trade. That, plus their cap space, could open the door to Williams in New England.

Past team: New York JetsPrediction: New York JetsSigned with: Detroit Lions

It is hard to believe that new head coach Aaron Glenn, a former defensive back himself, is going to let D.J. Reed play somewhere else next season.

Past team: Detroit LionsPrediction: Detroit LionsSigned with: New England Patriots

Davis should command a strong market after a standout season in Detroit before injury. For teams needing feisty man coverage corners, Davis is near the top of the list. That should lead to him staying with the Lions ... if they can afford his asking price.

Past team: San Francisco 49ersPrediction: Carolina Panthers

Ward wants a move to the east coast and Carolina is exactly the type of place that need another solid cornerback. It’s a great place to showcase his skills, and the organization could be the nurturing place Ward needs right now.

Past team: Atlanta FalconsPrediction: Chicago BearsSigned with: Chicago Bears

GM Ryan Poles is going all-in on fixing the Bears’ offensive line for Caleb Williams and center is the last problem spot. Dalman is an elite run blocking C, and good enough in pass pro to help take the next step forward.

Past team: Minnesota VikingsPrediction: Minnesota Vikings

The Vikings gotta keep one of their DBs, right? Murphy broke out this past season en route to a Pro Bowl nod, so the best thing for both sides might be keeping this good thing rolling.

Past team: San Francisco 49ersPrediction: San Francisco 49ers

It would be hard to see Greenlaw leave San Francisco, where he makes for the perfect running mate next to Fred Warner. Both sides should try to get a deal done.

Past team: Indianapolis ColtsPrediction: Miami Dolphins

Mike McDaniel has not exactly prioritized the interior offensive line during his Miami tenure. That should change this offseason and Fries would be a very good addition for them.

Past team: New York JetsPrediction: Arizona CardinalsSigned with: Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Returning to where it all began, but this time with support. Haason Reddick really hasn’t been happy since he left the Eagles, and reunited with former DC Jonathan Gannon is a good place to find his footing.

Past team: Pittsburgh SteelersPrediction: Pittsburgh SteelersSigned with: New York Jets

Justin Fields showed early last season that he can run Arthur Smith’s offense. With Pittsburgh sitting at No. 21 in the first round the Steelers are likely out of range of one of the top QBs, but Fields with a Day Two pick might be the best course of action for them.

Past team: Buffalo BillsPrediction: Green Bay Packers

Green Bay needs to make some additions to their wide receiver room, and adding a veteran in Cooper might also aid Jordan Love’s development under center.

Past team: Los Angeles ChargersPrediction: New Orleans Saints

With both Asante Samuel Jr. and Kristian Fulton hitting free agency, Los Angeles might have a tough time getting both back. Samuel will get some interest on the open market and the Saints have glaring needs in the secondary.

Past team: Las Vegas RaidersPrediction: Las Vegas RaidersSigned with: Carolina Panthers

Moehrig is too good for the Raiders to leave, and Pete Carroll has always had an affinity for safety play. Expect this to be a priority to Las Vegas early.

Past team: Las Vegas RaidersPrediction: Tampa Bay Buccaneers

It’s unlikely the Raiders will commit cap space to Koonce now they’ve locked up Maxx Crosby, and that opens a window. The Bucs need edge rush help, and coming off an injury Koonce is precisely the kind of value pickup they’ll look for.

Past team: Los Angeles ChargersPrediction: Los Angeles ChargersSigned with: Los Angeles Chargers

After cutting Joey Bosa it’s extremely unlikely the Chargers allow Mack to walk as well. This seems like a clear-cut signing for both parties.

Past team: Minnesota VikingsPrediction: Kansas City Chiefs

As things stand right now the Chiefs are going to protect Patrick Mahomes’ blind side with D.J. Humphries and Kingsley Suamataia. Expect that to change after what we saw in Super Bowl LIX.

Past team: Houston TexansPrediction: Kansas City Chiefs

This would be an extremely Chiefs signing. The team is in dire need of more weapons on offense, but lacks the cap space to make a truly splashy move. Diggs would be incredible in Kansas City, if he can get along with people and remain healthy.

Past team: Kansas City ChiefsPrediction: Buffalo Bills

The Bills are in dire need of an upgrade at safety, and Justin Reid fits the bill perfectly. Not only is this a good football move, but the precise kind of knife the Bills want to drive into the Chiefs.

Past team: Chicago BearsPrediction: Chicago Bears

Jenkins was about the only good thing on the Bears’ OL. They have the cap space to make this happen. It’s almost a foregone conclusion they’ll keep him unless Chicago has a big move up its sleeve.

Past team: New York JetsPrediction: Denver BroncosSigned with: New England Patriots

The Broncos need upgrades at linebacker and Sherwood is one of the best all-around options in free agency.

Past team: Detroit LionsPrediction: Washington Commanders

The Commanders were one of the worst run-stopping teams in the NFL last season and need to bolster their inside. Onwuzurike will help upgrade the interior immensely, and still have enough tread on the tires to give Washington a full contract of production.

Past team: San Francisco 49ersPrediction: New York Jets

Aaron Glenn is going to put a premium on defense in New York, and Hargrave is the ideal anchor and locker room presence he needs.

Past team: New Orleans SaintsPrediction: Tampa Bay BuccaneersSigned with: New York Giants

The Bucs’ ethos in 2024 was lots of scoring, but allowing a ton of yards through the air. Adebo would be a solid addition at a price that won’t break the bank. It would allow the corner to stay in the NFC South, but upgrade to a team with a much brighter future.

Past team: Green Bay PackersPrediction: Atlanta Falcons

With Drew Dalman off to Chicago — at least in these predictions — a hole will open on the interior of Atlanta’s offensive line. Josh Myers would be a solid Plan B for the Falcons.

Past team: Indianapolis ColtsPrediction: New Orleans SaintsSigned with: Chicago Bears

The Saints don’t have a lot of room to operate, meaning Odeyingbo is pretty much the ceiling of where they can operate. We have them losing Chase Young in this free agency period, and this would be a solid replacement.

Past team: Detroit LionsPrediction: Minnesota Vikings

Interior offensive line is a massive problem for Minnesota. If it’s indeed J.J. McCarthy’s time to start they need to bolster this quickly, and Zeitler is a solid veteran who can bridge for them.

Past team: Minnesota VikingsPrediction: Minnesota Vikings

There’s a lot of cap room to play with here, and that means Minnesota won’t part ways with a crucial offense weapon who can make life easier for J.J. McCarthy in his first season as starter.

Past team: Washington CommandersPrediction: Los Angeles Rams

This would be a solid landing spot for a guy looking to make a couple of playoff runs into his 30s. Allen is slowing down, there’s no questioning that — but he’s still a good rotational pass rusher with a chance to get reps.

Past team: San Francisco 49ersPrediction: San Francisco 49ersSigned with: Washington Commanders

The 49ers aren’t dumb when it comes to knowing who to retain. Hufanga is too important to their defense to lose, and it’s not in his best interest to head elsewhere.

Past team: New Orleans SaintsPrediction: Cincinnati Bengals

With the Bengals losing both Sam Hubbard (retirement) and potentially Trey Hendrickson, they’ll need to make multiple additions on the edge. Chase Young seems like a worthy flyer of an investment.

Past team: New York GiantsPrediction: Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Assuming the Buccaneers lose Chris Godwin in free agency — as we are assuming here with a prediction he lands in New England — Tampa Bay will need to add a receiver or two this offseason. Slayton would give them a solid option, while they might look for a slot presence in the draft as well.

Past team: Buffalo BillsPrediction: New England Patriots

Patriots fans are clamoring for Travis Hunter with the fourth-overall pick, but adding Douglas in free agency gives them an option across from Christian Gonzalez should Hunter come off the board with one of the first three selections.

Past team: New York GiantsPrediction: Carolina Panthers

The Panthers are in dire need of help at edge rusher and have said they have plans in free agency. The 24-year-old is precisely the kind of move that makes sense to add youth at the position and potentially someone who can make a name for himself on a new team.

Past team: Seattle SeahawksPrediction: Carolina Panthers

The Panthers need a low-cost, high-skill veteran receiver who can work the outside. Lockett is the kind of burner the team needs, and there’s ample familiarity between HC Dave Canales and GM Dan Morgan after their time together in Seattle.

Past team: Pittsburgh SteelersPrediction: Las Vegas Raiders

With the Geno Smith trade the Raiders are likely out of the market for a quarterback with the sixth-overall selection. Both WR and RB are needs for Las Vegas, making Ashton Jeanty an option for them in that spot. But should the Raiders go in a different direction and address WR in the draft, Harris is another means of adding to their running game.

Past team: Los Angeles ChargersPrediction: Los Angeles Chargers

With the assumption Asante Samuel Jr. finds a suitor on the open market, the Chargers work to keep Fulton in the mix for 2025.

Past team: Philadelphia EaglesPrediction: Tennessee Titans

I think Becton’s market is going to be interesting to watch. Does he remain at guard, or try and get tackle money in free agency? His best year was as an emphatic run blocking guard, but someone is going to bank on the potential.

Past team: Washington CommandersPrediction: Buffalo Bills

With Khalil Shakir signed to a new deal Buffalo has their option in the slot, but they need a receiver on the outside that can stress defenses and give Josh Allen a playmaker on the boundary. Dyami Brown could return to Washington, but the Bills make a great deal of sense.

Past team: Miami DolphinsPrediction: Detroit Lions

At 38-years-old the allure for Campbell will be trying to get that ring before his career comes to an end. There’s a need in Detroit, and he’d fit well here both from a scheme and personality perspective, but also the money will be right

Past team: Baltimore RavensPrediction: Jacksonville Kaguars

Mekari is a below-average run blocker, which isn’t great for a guard — but he’s a very solid pass protector that the Jaguars are in need of. We know inside-out is how teams are building offensive lines now, which makes this a good fit.

Past team: Los Angeles ChargersPrediction: San Francisco 49ers

It might be a short-term deal to pair up the Bosa bros, but there will be a lot of internal pressure to do it. This is a very 49ers move to shore up their pass rushing.

Past team: Minnesota VikingsPrediction: Cleveland Browns

Cleveland needs some help in the middle of the field, and Bynum gives them a solid option at free safety.

Past team: Cincinnati BengalsPrediction: Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Once again the Bucs look to overhaul their secondary in a cheap, effective way. Hilton would add to a struggling unit and help morph Tampa Bay from being one dimensional.

Past team: Pittsburgh SteelersPrediction: New York Giants

Russ doesn’t cook anymore, he microwaves soup. At this point he’s probably a backup in the NFL, but the Giants are in such a bad spot at QB that they’ll likely take a flier on him to be their bridge QB.

Past team: Cleveland BrownsPrediction: Pittsburgh Steelers

Jameis is the perfect backup for a high-end team. He’s a positive force in the locker room, doesn’t create drama, and performs when called for. We have the Steelers re-signing Justin Fields, so they need a steady backup in case things go off the rails.

Past team: Dallas CowboysPrediction: Washington Commanders

This would be a low-stakes, rotational pass rushing move for the Commanders who have cap space to make moves. Lawrence would bolster the unit as a whole and has familiarity with Dan Quinn from their time in Dallas.

Everything you need to know about the 2025 F1 season.

The 2025 Formula 1 season is finally here. The year begins in Melbourne with the season-opening Australian Grand Prix this weekend. 

For fans of the sport new and old, you might have some questions heading into this year.

Let us try and anticipate — and answer — those questions for you. 

That’s right.

After 246 race starts, 84 Grand Prix wins, 12 seasons, 8 Constructors’ titles, 7 Drivers’ Championships, and one knighthood, Lewis Hamilton is no longer a Mercedes driver.

When the lights go out Sunday in Melbourne he will be behind the wheel of one of Ferrari’s SF-25s alongside his new teammate, Charles Leclerc. Seeing Hamilton in red is still taking some getting used to.

Yes Charles Leclerc, the pianist as well as the winner of the 2024 Monaco Grand Prix and the driver who finished third in the F1 Drivers’ standings a season ago is a self-taught pianist who composes his own music.

For example, here is “MON23 (1:3):

Consider this a musical interlude of sorts. 

This might be his best chance since 2021.

Ferrari finished 14 points behind McLaren a season ago for the 2024 Constructors’ title. While Max Verstappen claimed his fourth consecutive Drivers’ Championship, both McLaren and Ferrari seemed on the front foot during pre-season testing in Bahrain two weeks ago, while Red Bull conceded that they have some work to do with the RB21.

Furthermore, Verstappen himself admitted in recent days that at least when it comes to the season-opening race in Australia, he does not think he’ll be among the favorites.

Last year Hamilton returned to the top step of a podium in an emotional win at Silverstone, his first win since the 2021 season and his final British Grand Prix with Mercedes. He then notched a second win when teammate George Russell was disqualified at the Belgian Grand Prix, and Hamilton was promoted to first after finishing second. 

More importantly, the SF-25 seems to have pace, and he is still “going for the gaps” as he admitted to media, including SB Nation, at last season’s Miami Grand Prix.

He can win another title. But will he? That is a tougher question. 

Yes, Hamilton is not alone in moving teams for 2025!

Esteban Ocon left Alpine for Haas. Nico Hülkenberg left Haas for Sauber, which is set to become Audi next season. Carlos Sainz Jr., after Hamilton took his spot at Ferrari, is now driving for Williams. Liam Lawson, after another super-sub stint at Visa Cash App Racing Bulls in place of Daniel Ricciardo, is back for 2025 but as a teammate of Max Verstappen at Red Bull.

So those are some of the faces in new places, but not all of them as some rookies are joining the grid.

Not, exactly.

There have been some significant changes on the other side of the pit wall as well.

Red Bull Sporting Director Jonathan Wheatley has left the team, and will become the new Team Principal at Sauber starting in April, ahead of the team becoming the Audi works operation for the 2026 F1 season. 

Laura Mueller is a new race engineer at Haas, and will make history as the first female race engineer in F1. She’ll be working with Esteban Ocon this season. 

Then there are all the changes coming to Aston Martin. Mike Krack, last season’s Team Principal, has moved into a new role as the team’s Chief Trackside Officer. Andy Cowell has taken over as Team Principal. 

Oh, and Adrian Newey just joined Aston Martin at the start of March as their Managing Technical Partner. He might know a thing or two about designing cars, however, since he did not join the team until after they launched the AMR25 his focus will likely be on upgrading this year’s challenger before he turns his attention to the AMR26, and the new regulations that go into effect next season.

More on those in a moment. 

Yes, five rookies are joining the grid, in addition to Lawson whose status as a rookie remains something of a contested point. Some consider him a rookie given he does not have a full season under his belt, others point to his stints in both 2023 and 2024 and think he’s a bit more of a veteran.

But joining Lawson as new drivers on the grid are: Gabriel Bortoleto, the 2024 F2 Drivers’ Champion who will drive for Sauber alongside Nico Hülkenberg; Jack Doohan, the Alpine reserve driver who was promoted to a full-time spot alongside Pierre Gasly; Isack Hadjar, who finished second behind Bortoleto in F2 a season ago and will drive for VCARB; Oliver Bearman, who scored points in place of Carlos Sainz Jr. for Ferrari in his F1 debut last year, joins the grid alongside Ocon at Haas, and 18-year-old Andrea Kimi Antonelli gets the task of stepping into Lewis Hamilton’s shoes at Mercedes.

Yes, he got his road driving license recently. 

You feel old now, don’t you?

This weekend’s Australian Grand Prix kicks off a 24-race marathon that criss-crosses the globe.

Of those 24 race weekends six of those — the Chinese Grand Prix, the Miami Grand Prix, the Belgian Grand Prix, the United States Grand Prix, the São Paulo Grand Prix, and the Qatar Grand Prix — are F1 Sprint Race weekends. 

Just about!

Following the Hungarian Grand Prix at the start of August, the grid will go silent until the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of the month. The factories will go quiet, the work will stop, and the team members will enjoy some much needed R&R before the final stretch of the season.

Article 24.1 of the F1 Sporting Regulations requires two “factory shutdown” periods. The first comes right in the middle of the season. Termed the “Summer Shutdown,” Article 24.1 requires that the first such factory shutdown cover: 

“... fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days during the months of July and/or August. If two consecutive Competitions during this period are separated by only seventeen (17) days a shutdown period of thirteen (13) consecutive calendar days must be observed. In either case Competitors should notify the FIA of their intended shutdown period within thirty (30) days of the start of the Championship.”

For those wondering, the second shutdown begins on Christmas Eve, and runs for nine days until the new year.

During this time all work stops, including any development of the teams’ cars at the factory. Pursuant to Article 24.2 of the Sporting Code no wind tunnel operation is allowed, no Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) work is allowed, no assembly is allowed, and as Williams pointed out in this explainer, “[p]ut simply, any activity that could contribute to making a better or faster car is strictly forbidden in this window. It is even prohibited to send emails, make calls or hold meetings about any such topics.”

Teams can engage in work involving repairs to a car “seriously damaged during the Competition preceding the shutdown period,” as well as work on projects “with no direct relation to Formula One.”

Why does F1 implement this rule? In addition to this rule helping control costs under the sport’s cost cap, it is aimed at the health of team members. Between the long grind that is the F1 season, and the fact that teams often work incredibly hard during the holidays given preparations for the next season, this break helps team members rest and reset before the final stretch of the schedule. 

Here you go, this is “MIA23 (1:2):

There are!

We previously covered the new rules at length in this piece, but here is a snapshot of the new rules for 2024.

We can start on the technical side of the ledger. The cars are going to be slightly heavier this year, with the minimum weight increased by two kilograms. The sport is also imposing increased restrictions on both the Drag Reduction System and “flex wings,” hoping to avoid last year’s McLaren “mini-DRS” controversy. To aid driver safety — and avoid a repeat of the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix — the FIA is mandating a driver cooling kit when extreme weather is present. 

On the sporting side of the rules, if you liked the bonus point given for the fastest lap we have some bad news. That is being eliminated this season, perhaps due in part to what happened at the 2024 Singapore Grand Prix. VCARB called Daniel Ricciardo into the pits in the closing stages, with Ricciardo running well outside the top ten, and bolted a set of softs onto his VCARB RB01. He instantly laid down the fastest lap of the race, denying the driver who won that race that extra point.

That driver? That was Lando Norris, who was at the time locked in a title fight with Max Verstappen. VCARB’s status as a sister team to Red Bull led to some ... consternation at McLaren after that moment. 

In addition, teams now have to run four “young driver free practice sessions,” an increase over the two required under the rules in previous seasons. Also, to codify the process for setting the grid if qualifying cannot take place the FIA changed Article 42 of the Sporting Regulations, and if qualifying cannot take place then the Drivers’ Championship standings will set the grid.

Oh, and the drivers might not want to swear, because they could face escalating fines, suspensions, and even a deduction in championship points.

Well, they can.

But they might not want to unless they are feeling charitable.

Swearing and driver language were two of many flashpoints during the 2024 F1 season. Yuki Tsunoda was fined for using ableist language over team radio at the Austrian Grand Prix, and Charles Leclerc was fined for swearing in the FIA Press Conference at the Mexico City Grand Prix.

But the big flashpoint involved Max Verstappen. Answering questions about the RB20 in the Thursday FIA Press Conference ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix Verstappen used a swear in his description, describing the car as “f----d.”

For this transgression, the driver was hit with a fine by race stewards and ordered to participate in community service.

Verstappen did not let the matter go. After qualifying second for the Singapore Grand Prix he was required to participate in the post-qualifying FIA Press Conference. He gave truncated answers to each question before remarking “I would prefer if you ask these questions outside [the FIA Press Conference] room.”

He then held an impromptu session with the media where he gave extended answers to their questions.

In an attempt to at least standardize the penalties available to race officials, the FIA implemented a series of changes to the Sporting Code ahead of the 2025 motorsport season. In this updated Appendix B, which we discussed at length in this piece, drivers face escalating fines for “misconduct,” which includes swearing.

Those fines also increase depending on what series the driver is participating in, with the heaviest fines reserved for F1 drivers. For example, a first offense carries a fine of €10,000, a second offense carries a fine of €20,000 plus a one-month suspended sentence, and a third offense is a €30,000 fine, a one-month suspension, and a “deduction of Championship points.”

For F1 drivers the fines are multiplied by four.

Weeks ago the FIA handed down the first fine under this updated Appendix B, fining World Rally Championship driver €10,000 — with a further €20,000 suspended — for swearing in a post-race Rally.TV interview. However, the FIA also chose not to fine Dan Ticktum, a Formula E driver, for a lengthy rant over the team radio at the Jeddah E-Prix that included multiple profanities.

That is at least an indication that the FIA will penalize drivers for swearing during media appearances/press conferences, but not penalize drivers for what they say in the heat of battle.

Unless, of course, there is aggravated language such as in Tsunoda’s case last year in Austria. 

Yes, some changes are coming to the Monte Carlo streets this season.

The Monaco Grand Prix remains the crown jewel of the F1 calendar. One of the three races — along with the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans — that comprise the “Triple Crown of Motorsport,” the Monaco Grand Prix combines history, glitz, glamour, celebrity, yachts, and historical landmarks for the biggest event on the F1 schedule.

But the race itself has become something of a dull affair.

Qualifying Saturday at the Monaco Grand Prix is perhaps the most thrilling hour of the F1 season, as the drivers push themselves and their machines to the limits and beyond. But the race itself resembles more of a parade than a race, given just how difficult it is to overtake on the tight and narrow Monte Carlo streets. That was exacerbated last season when a massive shunt on the opening lap involving Sergio Pérez, Nico Hülkenberg, and Kevin Magnussen brought out the red flag, and brought the rest of the grid into the pits.

Most drivers simply bolted on hard tires, and made it the rest of the way following behind race winner Charles Leclerc.

I sat down with Oscar Piastri, who had a pristine view of Leclerc’s rear wing for almost the entire race as he finished second behind him, after the Monaco Grand Prix and the young driver explained just how tough it is to overtake in Monaco. 

“It’s incredibly tough [to overtake in Monaco]. I think for me the difficult thing is that whilst I was right behind Charles for a lot of the race, it wasn’t because he was slow,” started Piastri. “It was because he was deciding to go slow, right?

“So it’s not like somewhere else where they have clear strengths and weaknesses and you can kind of set them up [for an overtake]. Like for him, if he wanted to go faster, he could have, literally depending on what he wanted to do with his right foot,” added the McLaren driver. “So that also made it tough.”

Piastri admitted he made one attempt, but reviewing the race afterwards, he conceded it would have been difficult to make the overtake stick.

“I tried once into Turn Eight to try and get by. But, yeah, I watched it back and to be honest, I was even further back than I thought. So it definitely wouldn’t have worked. But yeah, that is just the nature of Monaco, I guess.”

And while some may have found the lack of overtaking frustrating watching the race on Sunday, Piastri admits that as the laps were winding down, he was rather glad to be on the tight Monte Carlo streets.

“To be honest, for the last 10 laps of the race, I was pretty happy we were racing Monaco [because] my tires were struggling a bit,” added Piastri. But yeah, it’s just the nature of the beast around there.”

Now, the sport is hoping to improve the racing, or at least up the chaos.

Starting this year drivers will be required to make two pit stops in Monaco and Monaco alone, in both dry and wet conditions. Under this change drivers must use “at least three” sets of tires in the Monaco Grand Prix, with a minimum of two different tire compounds to be used if the race is run in dry conditions.

Will that improve the racing, or simply increase the chaos along pit lane?

We’ll find out in May.

Imagine, if you will, a sport deciding every few years to redo the rule book. Take the NFL. Picture a situation where Roger Goodell announces that “in two seasons passing touchdowns will be worth 12 points, field goals over 50 yards will be worth five points, and a Pick-Six will be worth ten points.”

That might change how teams construct their rosters and call plays going forward, right?

It is an extreme example, but it is something that F1 does put into action. The sport is as much an engineering puzzle to be solved as it is a race to be won, and coming in 2026 is a host of new technical regulations that contain revised aerodynamic regulations as well as new power unit rules.

In a nutshell, the cars will use a power unit running on 100% sustainable fuel, the internal combustion engine and electrical power will be a 50/50 split, and the front and rear wings will include “active aerodynamics,” including “movable front and rear wings.” 

These are just part of the incoming regulations that go into effect next year.

What might that mean for this season? It might mean that some teams stop developing and upgrading their 2025 cars before you know it, and turn to getting ready for 2026, with an eye on getting a jump on the field. Recently SB Nation caught up with former Haas Team Principal Guenther Steiner and put that question to one of the sport’s most recognizable figures.

“I actually spoke with some people which are doing this in F1, in the moment which are faced with this, because I think everybody will shift to the ‘26 car in May because that is the future,” said Steiner. “If you develop until May the ‘25 car, you still bring parts until the middle of the year, because until you develop and then you have to make the parts, obviously that takes time.

“So I do not think that there will be a lot of development going into a ‘25 car after May, beginning of June. Except somebody may be fighting for the world championship, you know, if the battle is close, then obviously you decide, ‘[h]ey, we need to go a little bit longer [with developing the 2025 car] we win this championship.

“But I think everybody making their plan in the moment, I would say in June we are on 95% or 97% [the] ‘26 car.”

You might also want to read that interview to get Steiner’s thoughts on swearing for ... reasons. 

This is “MC24 (1:4):

If you have made it this far you are either my mom — hi mom! — or a true F1 fan.

So you might be wondering if you can get to a race this season.

For those in the United States, there are three you can choose from! The Miami Grand Prix at the beginning of May, the United States Grand Prix in Austin in October, and the Las Vegas Grand Prix in November.

If you do make it to one of those races this year, stop by and say hello! 

Friday brought word that after a lengthy process, F1 had formally approved the new partnership between TWG Motorsports and General Motors for an 11th team to join the grid, competing under the Cadillac brand.

However, you will need to wait a little longer to see them on the grid. That team has been approved to join the series starting in 2026. 

That will not slow down speculation over who their two drivers will be, however. 

Now we get to where the rubber truly meets the road.

Earlier this calendar year I published a piece on the bold predictions for the 2025 season, but deferred predictions on the Drivers’ and Constructors’ titles to a later date.

My masterful gambit has failed, as that date has arrived.

Welp, I cannot hide any longer.

Joking aside, fans of four different teams — Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull, and McLaren — all have reasons to be confident heading into 2025. While pre-season testing data is always to be taken with a grain of salt, McLaren’s race pace in Bahrain was truly impressive. But both Mercedes and Ferrari seemed to be close behind McLaren’s pace, and with Ferrari having sorted out their tire degradation issues last year — and having two talented drivers in Hamilton and Leclerc — they might look at the 14-point gap to McLaren from 2024 as something they can overcome.

As for Red Bull, they still have Verstappen.

In the end, this looks to be another duel between Ferrari and McLaren, and similar to 2024, I think Team Papaya carries the day. 

There are many moments from my week in Austin for the 2024 United States Grand Prix that are seared into my memory.

Sitting down at the bar at the Four Seasons shortly after landing to chat with Pierre Gasly is certainly one. Talking padel and more with Oliver Bearman is another, as is getting to interview Lewis Hamilton just minutes after he spun out on the second lap of the Grand Prix. It was an incredible few days in Austin, and another reminder that I am truly, truly lucky to get to do this job.

But then there was standing in front of Lando Norris, minutes after the Grand Prix ended, and not just hearing him talk about his latest on-track clash with Max Verstappen, but seeing the look in his eyes.

Norris is a very introspective athlete, and perhaps his own toughest critic. Even when he wins, he finds something to criticize regarding his performance. That afternoon in Austin, as he talked about how you cannot race Verstappen halfway — “The thing is with Max you’ve got to commit, but people don’t understand that kind of thing. With Max, you can’t just go half-hearted,” said Norris to the media, including SB Nation, in Austin — there was a look in his eyes. One that spoke louder than his words.

The look of an athlete who had come to understand just what it takes to win at this level.

Norris did not chase down Verstappen last year, but he learned what he needed to do. That look in Austin told me everything I needed to know.

He will overtake him this season.

Preston Boespflug crashed during qualification for the 250 East / West Showdown at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana, and broke his femur. The crash occurred in one of the rhythm sections. 

Hardy Munoz could not avoid the fallen rider and ran over his legs before also crashing. The session was red-flagged, and Boespflug was carted off track by the Alpinestars Medical team.

“Rough day today in Supercross,” Boespflug said in a social media post, archived by RacerxOnline.com’s Mitch Kendra. “Ended up with a broken femur and a dislocated knee, but other than that, I’ll be good.”

Boespflug attempted to make his third feature start of the season after finishing 22nd in Tampa, Florida, and 19th in Detroit, Michigan.

Tennis fans were left stunned after one of the most famous couples in the world was spotted courtside in Indian Wells on Sunday.

Two-time Oscar nominee Timothee Chalamet and reality star Kylie Jenner, who have reportedly been dating in 2023, were among the interested spectators in Tennis Paradise over the weekend.

The couple were joined by Kylie’s older sister, model Kendall, for action on Stadium 1, watching Holger Rune defeat Ugo Humbert before Mirra Andreeva’s win over Clara Tauson.

The super-couple’s appearance quickly spread over social media, and in a cheeky message, 12th seed Rune was keen to recognise their support.

Former world No 4 Rune took to Twitter/X, and posted “Love the support out here @BNPPARIBASOPEN”, quoting an ATP Tour tweet highlighting Chalamet and Jenner’s appearance.

Though they are arguably the most famous faces to be spotted in the stands so far this year, Chalamet and Jenner are far from the only celebrities to take in some tennis action in the desert over the years.

We take a look back at some of the biggest names who have been spotted in Indian Wells.

You only have to rewind twelve months to come across another modern super couple who enjoyed some tennis action at the famed ATP and WTA 1000 event.

Acting stars – and real-life couple – Zendaya and Holland were among the special guests on Finals Day in 2024, watching Iga Swiatek beat Maria Sakkari before Carlos Alcaraz downed Daniil Medvedev.

The main reason the couple were present was Zendaya’s impending starring role in Challengers, which was released just one month after action in Indian Wells concluded.

Zendaya and Swiatek in fact met, and were pictured together, after the latter claimed her second title in the space of three years.

One of tennis’ most famous fans, Ben Stiller has been a regular figure at multiple tennis events over the years; he was spotted at both Roland Garros and the US Open in 2024.

However, the Hollywood star and wife – and fellow star – Christine Taylor have also attended Indian Wells in the past.

The pair were courtside multiple times in 2022, watching multiple Rafael Nadal matches as the Spaniard went all the way to the final, ultimately falling to US star Taylor Fritz.

Stiller and Taylor were also pictured at the event in 2012 and 2019, and his love for tennis was mentioned by Coco Gauff after the two met at the Oscars last week.

She said: “I saw Ben Stiller out there. I wasn’t so surprised at him because I know he’s a tennis fan, but I told him he has to come to one of my matches because I only really see him at the men’s matches – so I told him he has to come.”

Oscar-winning icon DiCaprio might not be as famous of a tennis fan as Stiller, but the legendary star has been spotted in Indian Wells in the past.

The actor was sighted at the tournament back in 2017 and has also been spotted at the US Open over the years.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Afootball365.com,Jack Grealish went to the pub and that's a story?!,https://www.football365.com/news/jack-grealish-media-nonsense-john-nicholson,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 09:35:13 GMT","

Do you take any notice of, or consume the mainstream football media?

I ask because last week they were in typically grotesque form over Jack Grealish. Although their models are slowly dying, millions still buy newspapers and they can’t be spending that money in the belief that they’re reading a dystopian version of the truth. They must believe it to be on some level true, because who pays money to be lied to?

We will soon be subjected to an avalanche of the most dumb-ass sports news piggery when Thomas Tuchel takes his first game as coach. The Second World War will be relitigated, even as the real enemy lies to the west and the assembled snouts will invent bizarre questions that exist only in their own soiled corner of the media farmyard.

We’ve already seen their xenophobic instincts, only shared by some of the outer fringes of talk radio, which relies on these blood-boiler crazies for content. He will look on, like many before him, with astonishment at the sports news pigs’ unique sort of stupidity in pursuit of content.

Last week the focus of attention was on Jack Grealish and what he did on a day off, even to the extent that his manager was quizzed about it. It’s a non-story about a man in a couple of pubs and the look, frequently seen on Pep Guardiola’s bewildered face, of disbelief as he struggles to comprehend the fuss, as any sentient adult would, showed how the press is divorced from reality and live inside a kind of sports news pig fart, with only sports news pigs for company.

This, though, is quite typical. Things of insignificance are dwelt on for days and are blown up into a big story to further feed the sports news pigs’ cravings for content. And that’s it – content. Not quality or truth or facts, just content.

I can’t be the only one who finds themselves astonished that the public has anything to do with these organs and their battle between truth and dystopian distortion.

As we know only too well, the need for traffic to provide advertising money distorts everything. Everything gets reduced to reporting on a few big clubs and most everything else is simply ignored. You might be critical of that and few of us would wish it to be the case in the best circumstances, but that’s simple economics.

But if you’ve got pretensions to be a newspaper of record, you’d think they would have a broader vision beyond making up stories that aren’t of any interest e.g. ‘famous footballer spotted in restaurant just hours after defeat’.

As Mediawatch points out every day, the football pages have their own peculiar relationship to words, both in terms of how they’re used and what they do or don’t mean. They imply untruths, they invent improbable speculations, they overstate nonsense like it’s important, as per the Grealish thing. They write ‘five things we learned’, four of which are self-evident. Claim records that are not records and any amount of fictions and twisted contortions, all delivered in a lexicon of words that barely make sense. Imagine being these people making this sh*t up? Look what the sports news pigs have become.

Fifty years ago, tabloids always produced sensationalist tittle-tattle but there was always genuine news. They wouldn’t have produced the modern typical sports news pig slurry and I don’t believe anyone was interested in reading about a footballer in a restaurant or in a pub. It’s just…nothing. Reporters had relationships with players and protected footballers from public scrutiny, instead of exploiting them.

Why read that at all? To do so, you must think, to some degree, that it’s going to contain truth. But their words don’t mean anything. Words should have a meaning and not just be tools to create a bizarre fiction. Their history of being liars or truth distorters is long and storied so why fill your synapses with it?

Obviously, it’s clear that their approach is, ironically, one of the reasons behind their decline. The narrow focus, the shallow sh*te, the distortions and dishonesty all work against them in the long term. Obviously, their websites attract traffic and that’s where they see their future but why click on anything? Why waste your time? It might not cost you any money but it costs you in intelligence, creating a dystopia where the news and reality is subsumed by the ceaseless lust for clicks.

It doesn’t matter how or what distortions and lies get you to click, as long as you click. Standards? Never mind such legacy principles. Click clicks clicks. Why does any business want to be exposed to that traffic? I’ve never understood why anyone continues to advertise on stupid, not to say dishonest websites? Is it because they want to attract people that are gullible and easily manipulated?

Numbers surely don’t matter if the large majority of them are disengaged. So surely newspapers would be better off producing interesting intelligent content that leads to longer dwell times and engagement and reflects well on brands placed on that content. Is that just naive? Do they keep writing it because people keep clicking on it? If so, stop. That will end it, I guarantee it. Are we living in an idiocracy?

Is there more money in stupidity, made-up rubbish, endless witless speculation or pointless observation? Maybe there’s a constituency for it? In which case, God help us all, we’re surrounded by idiots who’ve surrendered their minds to garbage.

Where are we going? Is it a race to the bottom, appealing only to the unquestioning and intellectually unambitious with intelligence and thought confined to a few ‘elitist’ places, led by the news pigs? Or are we already there?

I think you know the answer.

Gary Neville has thrown cold water on Liverpool’s hopes of a famous treble in Arne Slot’s first season in charge.

The Reds are 15 points clear at the top of the Premier League and within touching distance of the title after Arsenal drew with Manchester United on Sunday.

Liverpool strengthened their stranglehold on the title race by coming from behind to beat Southampton and can now turn their attention to the Carabao Cup final.

Sunday’s final at Wembley is Slot’s first direct crack at silverware since taking over from Jurgen Klopp last summer and Neville believes the Reds will have too much for Newcastle United.

With the Premier League all but sewn up, an 11th League Cup win for Liverpool would be the first part of an emphatic domestic double.

Newcastle have other plans but Neville’s prediction takes into account some significant personnel issues facing Magpies boss Eddie Howe.

Anthony Gordon is suspended after he was sent off against Brighton in the FA Cup. Lewis Hall is out for the season, joining other long-term absentees on the sidelines.

But former Man Utd defender Neville is unconvinced by Liverpool’s ability to turn two trophies into three and expects the Champions League to be a competition too far.

Liverpool have a 1-0 aggregate lead going into Tuesday night’s Champions League Round of 16 second leg against PSG but Neville believes even an exit in this round is possible.

Speaking on his Sky Sports podcast, Neville said: “Liverpool have got [the Premier League] in the bag. I think they will win it in April.

“The Champions League is a different story, it can be over in a one-off game. I’m not quite sure I see them wining it – you can never write them off obviously – but I don’t quite see it.

“It wouldn’t surprise me actually if they went out this week. It’s a 50-50 game for me, either team could easily win, PSG are a good side.”

Liverpool have shown no more sign of slowing down in the Champions League than they have domestically. Their first leg win was inspired by goalkeeper Alisson but puts them in a strong position ahead of the home leg.

But they cruised through the league phase, winning seven of their eight matches to finish top of the mega-table, and remain among the favourites.

If Liverpool knock out PSG this week, a quarter-final tie against Aston Villa or Club Brugge will be next.

Neville is correct that it can all go wrong in 90 minutes but the Reds will be fancied to reach the semi-final. Villa have a 3-1 lead after the first leg of their tie but haven’t beaten Liverpool since a 7-2 win behind closed doors in October 2020.

The Reds will fancy themselves to reach the last four at least and after that, it’s anyone’s game.

Slot’s treble hopes do rely on Liverpool holding their nerve in a series of knockout matches and Newcastle might be as big a threat as anyone.

Added firepower is a crucial aim for Chelsea in the summer transfer window and the Blues are reportedly honing their options.

Despite possible competition from Premier League rivals Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle United, the Blues are determined to upgrade Enzo Maresca’s attack.

Chelsea have turned their attentions to Bayer Leverkusen striker Victor Boniface and “are doing whatever it takes to win the race” according to reporting by CaughtOffside.

24-year-old Nigerian international Boniface arrived in Europe with Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in 2019 before spending a single season in Belgium with Union Saint-Gilloise.

Boniface signed for Leverkusen in 2023 and scored 14 goals in 18 starts as Xabi Alonso steered them to an incredible Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal double last season.

He’s added seven more league goals this term as well as another in the Champions League against AC Milan.

Chelsea are understandably attracted by that level of production. Despite sitting in fourth in the Premier League, the Blues’ need for a scorer is clear.

Nicolas Jackson has scored nine times in the Premier League this season but isn’t reliably prolific. He’s also injured, leaving Maresca with the Christopher Nkunku as his only recognised centre forward.

👉 Chelsea decide ‘four high-quality goalkeepers’ will ‘compete’ for No. 1 shirt in 2025/26

With Nkunku not firing and Cole Palmer struggling for form in front of goal, Chelsea’s need to strengthen has been exposed.

“Chelsea are increasingly moving towards Boniface as a top priority target ahead of next season, so they’ll hope they can remain at the front of the queue for his signature,” reports CaughtOffside.

That queue apparently comprises Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle, as well as Saudi Pro League also-rans Al-Nassr, who tried to sign Boniface to play alongside Cristiano Ronaldo in January and ended up signing Aston Villa striker Jhon Duran.

While Chelsea intend to fend off attention from elsewhere, interest in Boniface from their Premier League rivals makes just as much sense.

Man Utd are getting precious little return from their meagre centre forward options and will look to back Ruben Amorim in the summer. Arsenal’s woes up front have been picked over repeatedly since Kai Havertz joined Gabriel Jesus in the treatment room.

Newcastle’s situation is different. Alexander Isak is by many measures the most effective striker in the Premier League.

If the Magpies finish in a Champions League spot, they should be able to hold on to their key man. If not, the interest from elsewhere will be constant and widespread. Arsenal in particular have been frequently linked with a move for Isak in the past.

Boniface’s contract runs to the summer of 2028 but he would come at a lower cost than Isak, for whom Newcastle will fight tooth and nail.

If the Gunners decide to cut out a step and go straight for the Nigerian, it’s likely they’ll find Chelsea standing in their path.

Ongoing financial complications at Barcelona could open the door for a surprise move to the Premier League for one of Europe’s most dynamic attacking players.

Barcelona have been restricted in their ability to register players and the objects of their desire also attract plenty of interest from England.

Chelsea are reportedly keen to sign AC Milan winger Rafael Leao, who is also a long-term target for the Spanish league leaders and is rated at €75 million.

Leao’s contract runs to 2028 but he has struggled this season to translate his undeniable talent into a smooth relationship with successive Rossoneri managers.

Calciomercato reports that super agent Jorge Mendes “is working on a possible departure for Rafael Leao in the upcoming transfer window with Barcelona, as well as Chelsea, emerging as potential destinations.”

The definition of ‘super agent’ is open to interpretation but that fact that Leao – who the Italian publication call ‘distracted’ – is no longer represented by Mendes or Gestifute offers as handy a clue as any.

Leao remains a key player for Milan but the Portuguese winger found himself on the bench in the autumn with compatriot and manager Paulo Fonseca questioning his tactical discipline.

Fonseca’s own discipline has been in the spotlight. After he was sacked by Milan, Fonseca was appointed by Ligue 1 side Lyon but has been banned for nine months for an ugly confrontation with a referee.

Sergio Conceicao, Fonseca’s successor at Milan, is thought to have a similar view of Leao, persuading Leao and Mendes to court Barcelona with the aim of securing a move.

While consecutive managers vocalising doubts should give pause for thought for interested clubs, Leao has scored ten goals in all competitions in the 2024-25 season and his ability to impact a match is indisputable.

If Chelsea’s apparent interest is serious, they could benefit from Barcelona’s self-inflicted recruitment handbrake to attract Leao to London.

The 25-year-old is yet to hit anything like his peak and the Blues need a match-winner.

Their reliance on Cole Palmer has been laid bare by his recent dip in form and Chelsea have beaten only Wolverhampton Wanderers, West Ham United, Southampton and Leicester City in Premier League action since the turn of the year.

Barcelona club president Joan Laporta and sporting director Deco met with Mendes during the club’s visit to Lisbon to play Benfica in the Champions League and Leao was reportedly one of the players discussed.

Leao started his professional career with Benfica’s rivals Sporting CP before catching Milan’s eye in a terrific but brief spell in France with Lille.

If the winger does leave Milan for a fee this summer, Lille would be entitled to 20 percent thanks to a sell-on clause in the deal that took him to Italy in 2019.

Liverpool, Brighton and David Moyes are flying. But Spurs have no more excuses, Wolves without Matheus Cunha are doomed and Arsenal have a clear problem.

 

Premier League winners

 

Liverpool
It does not particularly have the air of a 25-game unbeaten Premier League run, perhaps owing to the insistence on pretending there has been any sort of jeopardy or title race since about December, or how those draws with Everton and Aston Villa were magnified to a quite laughable degree.

But only Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United have ever had longer streaks without defeat in Premier League history, which is patently ridiculous for a manager in his debut English top-flight season.

Not for the first time, Arne Slot changed the game with his substitutions. And although making three of them at half-time asks uncomfortable questions of the manager and the players coming off, when it prompts the sort of reaction Liverpool inflicted on Southampton, outcome bias dictates that there can only be praise.

The gap between first and second is bigger than the gap between second and 10th. It is early March and Liverpool are guaranteed a top-half finish with Spurs and Manchester United unable to catch them. None of this is particularly normal.

 

Mo Salah
Only Erling Haaland (29 in 2022/23) has ever scored more goals by this stage of a Premier League season. Just Mesut Ozil (18 in 2015/16) has ever provided more assists after 29 games. Both bars were set in breaking the respective records for one whole campaign and Salah is on course to catch them simultaneously. That is especially not normal.

👉 Did Bruno Fernandes ‘effectively end Arsenal’s title hopes’? Did he balls

 

Nottingham Forest
As ever with Forest, it is difficult to single out one individual for praise from a specifically team-centric performance.

Nico Dominguez made twice as many tackles as any player for either side while not putting a foot wrong in possession. Murillo reprised his engrossing role as chief clearance-maker. Callum Hudson-Odoi has developed a remarkable knack for scoring in 1-0 wins over sides who have habitually fought for the title over the past few seasons. Neco Williams has undergone a wonderful transformation under Nuno, whose career hex over Pep Guardiola has resulted in him becoming only the second manager ever to beat the Spaniard with at least three different teams.

They are third and there entirely on merit, with Manchester City just the latest brick to fall into place. Forest have now beaten 21 of the 23 different sides they have faced in the Premier League since promotion, and while Bournemouth do appear to have their number, it is remarkable that Luton are League One-bound as their old relegation rivals confidently approach the Champions League one year on from a battle which reflected abysmally on Mark Clattenburg’s former employers.

The Manchester City victory was necessary too, their first in the league since the 7-0 thrashing of Brighton on February 1 and a timely tightening of wheels which might otherwise have fallen off if left unchecked. Forest’s longest winless run of the season stands at three games, which only Liverpool (two games) can better.

 

Crystal Palace
Fifth in the European form table is ludicrous in itself but Crystal Palace threatening consecutive top-half Premier League finishes is really quite daft.

It is particularly curious, considering Eintracht Frankfurt specifically cited the negative ‘overall performance in the second half of the season’ as a factor in their decision to part with Oliver Glasner, that Palace have been so strong in the second half of his first full campaign, to the extent that only Liverpool (25) have earned more points than the Eagles (19) since January 4, and that from two extra games.

Palace’s current run of three straight league wins is as long as Arsenal’s best sequence of consecutive victories this season. Glasner really is one of the most quietly impressive managers in the division.

 

Brighton
Sixth in that European form table, which is perhaps even more absurd as these six successive victories were preceded by that 7-0 thrashing against Nottingham Forest.

Fabian Hurzeler deserves immense credit, ceding the possession which betrayed them against Forest for more defensive stability and a tweak in shape. But he has also reversed the recent trend of Brighton starting campaigns well but finishing them poorly. They already have as many points in the second half of this season as they accrued in the entire second half of 2023/24 (18).

Much of that comes down to the sort of attacking variation that only a club-record spend can really buy. Yasin Ayari became the 18th different player to score or assist a Premier League goal for Brighton this season when he crossed for Jan Paul van Hecke’s wonderful headed equaliser against Fulham; only Chelsea and bizarrely Everton (both 19) can beat that, and the Seagulls share the burden far more equally.

 

Manchester United
Ruben Amorim was so deeply apologetic about deploying a low block that it seems unlikely he will celebrate the first three-game unbeaten run of his tenure. But these are baby steps in the right direction, pale green shoots barely visible above the surface.

That move which resulted in the wing-back to wing-back chance for Noussair Mazraoui from Diogo Dalot’s cross should sustain Manchester United for a couple of weeks as a tantalising glimpse of what could be achieved.

If that sounds like a low bar that’s because it is; the fact is Manchester United have had nothing like that sort of proof of a clear and coherent message getting through on the training ground in what feels like years.

 

David Moyes
The king of the mid-season managers. Moyes has picked up 1.78 points per game at Everton, beating Graham Potter (1.43 at West Ham), Vitor Pereira (1.17 at Wolves), Ruben Amorim (1.12 at Manchester United), Ruud van Nistelrooy (0.47 at Leicester) and Ivan Juric (0.27 at Southampton) with varying degrees of comfort.

At least two of those stand as proof of how wrong Everton could have got the appointment of Sean Dyche’s successor having made the right call in parting with him.

Only four managers have ever accrued more Premier League points with a single club. Give Moyes (658 with Everton) a year and he will catch Jurgen Klopp (705 with Liverpool).

 

Chelsea
A first pair of consecutive Premier League clean sheets since September might be cause for revelry if they didn’t come against the two worst teams in the league.

It also leaves Chelsea facing one of the tougher runs of remaining fixtures of any side, but their ability to put to the sword the teams in the bottom half should not be overlooked. Only Liverpool have more points or goals against those in 11th and below, which is a marked improvement on what was a Mauricio Pochettino blindspot.

 

Robin Olsen
Aston Villa’s standout performance came slightly further forward but Olsen keeping his first Premier League clean sheet since January 2023 was a surprise. Have a guess who that came against; the entirely inevitable answer will be at the bottom.

 

Spurs
The problem with the entirely valid injury caveat was always that once that card was removed from the deck and unable to be played again, performances and results had to improve almost immediately. If supporters were expected to show patience while Spurs managed that crisis, asking them to remain calm as those returning take time to find their feet is preposterous.

When your starting forwards cost £127.5m and are not involved in either the overhit cross or penalty which crowned this comeback draw, there will be consternation at being outplayed at home by a team which cost a fraction of the price under an exciting, vibrant coach who has changed to cope with his own persistent injury issues.

The same goes for an overrun £50m midfield and expensive porous defence; Cristian Romero was only ever going to look shaky in his first appearance for more than three months but that is the point: Spurs cannot simply point to injuries and then the bedding-in period as part of the rehabilitation to those injuries as the overriding reason behind these substandard displays.

It makes a mockery of the idea Ange Postecoglou could not possibly have adapted his system and ideals to suit the players he had available through those difficult months.

And while his comments on “the atmosphere in the stadium” might have been lost in translation, bringing supporters into constant underperformance in any way never ends well for the manager who chooses that path, especially when those same fans have already been asked for their unabating consideration and understanding in exchange for the club’s worst season in two decades at increasingly costly ticket prices.

 

Bernardo Silva
He might forever remain the one player Pep Guardiola will never sell, only now because of a lack of feasible buyers rather than a desperation to keep him.

Barcelona and PSG came close to prising the Portuguese away on a number of occasions but both have long since undergone the sort of transformation to focus on youth which Manchester City hope to successfully implement soon. It is similarly difficult to envisage a place in that future for a knackered 30-year-old whose contract expires next year.

Through these Manchester City troubles, Silva has been a comfort blanket whose availability Guardiola has clung to this season. Having ranked sixth and seventh in the squad for total minutes in all competitions in the last two seasons respectively, Silva is up to third in 2024/25 and has been used in a variety of different positions to plug any and all gaps.

But it seems beyond him now, at least at the sort of dependable level which made him one of the league’s best players a few years ago. The sight of Silva being given the midfield runaround has become all too frequent. While Manchester City have far bigger problems to address, an inability to rely as comfortably on their former paragon of consistency sums up this general malaise.

 

Arsenal
Their record this season in Premier League games when they have more than 60% possession is P10 W3 D5 L2 F12 A8. Last season it was P17 W13 D1 L3 F47 A15. It is a massive discrepancy which basically accounts for that 15-point gap to Liverpool by itself.

Fulham
Perhaps Champions League qualification was always only ever a distant possibility, and never an objective set within the club. But Fulham absolutely were positioned perfectly to capitalise on a wide-open race and defeat to Brighton was a costly misstep.

Fulham had been imperious against their nearest challengers for the European places. There is ample opportunity to atone but they are struggling to build momentum and might soon consider the FA Cup back door as their best way in.

 

Brentford
Seven wins and one draw in their first eight home games, then two draws and five defeats in their next seven.

Brentford are the highest-ranked club in no other competitions for the remainder of the season, with neither Europe nor relegation a feasible reality in any way. It is a serenity they deserve praise for achieving but these final two months will also be entirely bereft of any real drama. In short: it seems quite early in the season for teams to be heading to the beach.

 

Wolves without Matheus Cunha
‘Football team not as good without best player’ is not an especially groundbreaking revelation but it is pertinent in the case of Cunha for as long as he decides to incur avoidable suspensions.

Wolves’ record in the four Premier League games Cunha has not started this season is W0 D1 L3. Marshall Munetsi’s goal was the first they have scored in those matches; before then, Wolves had conceded nine without reply.

The rank hopelessness of the three teams below them mean it would not be a monumental shock if Wolves already had enough points to survive, but that is not a gamble they can really afford to take – especially if his latest ban is extended as expected and he is sidelined for the pivotal trip to Ipswich.

 

Bournemouth
It is a measure of how far they have come that failing to beat Spurs away is perceived as a negative, but those were points dropped by Bournemouth in every sense.

As Iraola said: “Before coming here it is probably not a bad result but after how the game went and how well we performed, we are not happy with a point. We have to be more clinical and smarter.”

Even just in a basic sense his point is clear: Bournemouth are the fifth-biggest underperformers in terms of xG and their ratio of goals per shot (0.09) is the lowest in the top half. The room for improvement is obvious.

Leicester
It would be interesting to know which of Leicester’s 11 defeats from 12 Premier League games – a victory over Spurs, obviously – prompted Ruud van Nistelrooy to belatedly decide things might not be working and that a formation change could be necessary.

The good news is that was the closest Leicester have come to keeping a clean sheet since that remarkably misleading win over West Ham in Van Nistelrooy’s first game. The bad news is that they still lost, which they are on course to do a club-record number of times in a single Premier League season.

 

Ipswich
Still the last team to come from behind at half-time to win a league game at Old Trafford, but Kieran McKenna will probably weirdly want to focus on this season rather than the endurance of an irrelevant 41-year-old statistic.

He is right to talk about “margins” and “developing”, of how Ipswich were “competitive” in defeat, but supporters are equally entitled to grow frustrated at being given the same meal each without the promise of a bit of variety in their diet. If this squad is “learning” then some proof would be welcomed.

It is an achievement to be bottom of any table this season while Southampton are striving to achieve historic awfulness. But there Ipswich are, the absolute worst of any team in the second half of games in almost a complete inverse of their strong finishes in the Championship last campaign.

 

Ivan Juric
He noticed “some really good things” from Southampton and it probably didn’t even rank in their worst 25 performances or results of the season. But that really is remarkably damning after a 3-1 defeat.

The Derby record remains within reach but beyond that, Juric is competing for the unofficial title of absolute worst Premier League manager ever. He has fewer points per game than Terry Connor, Jan Siewert and Nathan Jones, with only Neil Adams and Jimmy Gabriel worse off for single-season awfulness. Lose every remaining game and he overtakes both. And he doesn’t even have a charming gimmick like Connor’s clipboard to remember him by.

 

Spurs again
Of sodding course Olsen kept his last Premier League clean sheet against them.

The Arsenal fall-out continues after yet another draw. This Arsenal is doing worse than Unai Emery’s Arsenal in 2019, apparently.

Arsenal do have enough attackers
As per regular mailbox norm, anything other than a comprehensive Arsenal win and the knives are out, the crowing begins and the think pieces begin. I mean, hey, let’s be honest, Arsenal have largely been very good but too often been frustratingly out-stubborn’d by the opposition. Arsenal stubbornly stick to suffocating the opposition, and the opposition have learned to hold their breath longer.

The one thing that keeps on persisting though, and it baffles me, is that Arsenal don’t have enough attackers. Arsenal have plenty of attackers! Plenty. Arsenal have two quality players for each position.

On the left we have Martinelli and Trossard. Both would easily start for most Premier League teams and for me at least, they are equally talented. Martinelli being pacey and direct; Trossard being more technical and swivel-hipped. (I myself am more Trossard).

On the right we have Saka and Sterling. Saka is arguably the best winger in the world, and Sterling certainly WAS one of the best, although this season it appears he has regressed massively. If we assume that Saka starts and Sterling covered, then those two are a fine set of right sided wingers. Sterling, at the start of the season anyway, would walk in to most Premier League teams.

Through the middle we have Havertz and Jesus. Havertz, it’s fair to say, divides opinion. Most Arsenal fans seem to love him but also seem to have the least patience with him. If Arsenal are deploying a “false 9” or “two 10’s” then he’s a fabulous player who works really well in that system. If we need to go a bit more spunky and direct up top, then there’s Jesus. He’s not the player he once was, but as a striker to come on at 70 minutes to terrorise a knackered defence, he’s really good.

This season, we’ve seen Nwaneri play right wing, we’ve got Reiss Nelson and Fabio Vieira on loan, and we’ve got a couple of academy players who occasionally make the bench.

We might be lacking quality in some places, but we’re not lacking numbers is my point. In terms of sheer numbers and quality in attack, Liverpool and Man City are ahead of us, and Chelsea are possibly ahead of us. Also let it be known that Arsenal, in terms of quality and numbers, are way ahead of every other team in terms of defenders. Arsenal also have the meanest defence – and so we should because we have the quality and numbers.

It’s just injuries, that’s all it is. We have had Saka, Martinelli, Havertz, Jesus all out for weeks, simultaneously. Odegaard’s been out. Nwaneri’s come in and been a minor revelation but let’s not forget he got injured too.

Big summer of Arsenal this year! Looks like Zubimendi is almost-certain, Nico Williams is fairly likely, and Benjamin Sesko is also… quite likely.

24-25 is looking like a bit of a write-off, so here’s to next season 😊
Dale May, Swindon Wengerite

 

This is Stewie but good Arsenal points are made…
Just wanted to mention two points that truly reflect what a Fraud Antonio El Pulis Arteta is:

Remember that “shocking team Arteta inherited” from Emery? Well, in the 2018/19 season, after 28 games Unai Emery had collected 56 points as Arsenal manager. Emery was in 4th place, some distance behind the top team (curiously, that was Liverpool!).

The kicker? Emery was widely deemed to have had a mediocre season by most – yet Emery, with a team of stiffs (according to Arsenal fans) was actually “only” 13 points behind Liverpool! Emery did this playing with Fake Luminaries such as Sokratis, Iwobi, Mustafi, Calum Chambers, Kolasinac etc. A veritable who’s who of utter shite (most of them Wenger detritus).

Antonio El Pulis meanwhile, in return for 10 transfer windows, £750m and £15m a season in this Fake Process? El Pulis has *55 points*! 😳. He is 15 points behind Liverpool – so performing far worse than Emery given the time and money afforded. But remember, as Trump and Brexiters would affirm: ignore the evidence of your eyes and ears. Emery was doing this with Mustafi et al.

The second point is, that if Arsenal as expected, are made to form a guard of honour for Liverpool at Anfield, this will mean that in the past 21 Years, Arsenal would have performed more guards of honour than won league titles!!! 😂😂😂. Is there a single club anywhere in Europe that can honestly attest to such a pathetic record of Choking? Can someone genuinely please verify this?!

At this point it’s like hate-watching humiliation BDSM material involving someone you fancy, and reinforcing that humiliation by streaming an action replay 21 times (apt for Netflix FC tbf 🤣).

Watching Arteta’s post-match interview where he was tetchy, petulant and couldn’t wait to duck out of accountability for his shitshow of a season was tantamount to watching the last days of Rishi Sunak. An over promoted nobody with zero CV of achievement, the Young “generational leader” who is actually upon scrutiny, deeply mediocre and has delivered sod all despite being given a gentle ride by the media. The game is up and he knows it, those of us not drinking the Emirates Kool-aid know it…so, lash out at manically at the first prospect of accountability.

Credit to Arteta though, the speed at which he ran away from that post-match Sky interviewer’s legitimate simple question, beats anything I’ve seen from Fake Spanish Kevin Nolan or Sterling all season!

A less exciting Arsenal take
I do think it is slightly ironic that the first of 16 Conclusions includes a reflection on how sensationalist discussions on this Arsenal season should be shelved, but half the remaining points, as well as an article by Steven, suggest Arteta needs to radically overhaul his tactics at the arse end of a season.

Arsenal do play control football and that massively raises the floor of the team. We’re currently good value for two seasons of the best defensive record in the league and whilst this isn’t thrilling the neutral, it will keep us in an excellent position not to crumble in a season where every other team suffering systemic injury crises have fallen apart. As you seem to so aptly have put in your conclusion one, when we lose that control, it’s almost like we become more vulnerable – I am much happier with draws away to Nottingham Forest and Man United than losses, for example.

So rather than general handwaving about becoming more instinctive, what would you practically have us do?

Having a more robust plan B sounds great, but ultimately what would that look like? Premier League teams know that to not get entirely undressed by an Arsenal team that still has excellent talent everywhere until the final third, there’s one way to play (see PSV for what not to do) and the reality is that lots of teams struggle when faced with the hyper-defensive approach, unless you have your key gamebreakers available (again, the main difference between Arsenal and Liverpool is that they have the whole season and we haven’t).

You’re basically asking Arteta to solve a massive problem with both arms tied behind your back, which feels a pretty unrealistic ask.

No reasonable Arsenal fan is putting much further judgement into this season – we are where we are and the shortcomings are well rationalised as well as the misfortunes. I actually don’t think any narrative needs to be written about the team at all unless there is a complete meltdown. But I know we get the clicks, so another reheated article needs to be published and morons in the mailbox need to be indulged.

Shush
A good point from Minty re: Declan Rice’s shushing celebration, and one I’d like to expand on as I do think it sums up all that’s wrong with the Arsenal squad and manager.

Firstly, what is Declan Rice shushing? In my view, a celebratory shush should be used only where you are silencing your doubters.

Does a later equaliser against a very poor side justify this? I’d always say no, but even more so in the context that you are the second best side in the country and nothing less than 3 points is the minimum requirement to keep you vaguely in the title conversation.

Is he then shushing his own critics? Well, I’d argue that he’s nowhere near a £100 million player, yet somehow doesn’t seem to attract much, if any criticism from the press or rival fans. Probably because he plays for England.

So why the shushing? You can’t shush people if you’re not actually silencing them. We’re all sat here the next day laughing at 2 more dropped points against a dross side, another Stewie email and continuing to dissect Arteta and his squad.

But this is just completely Arsenal, isn’t it? Rice likely *did* think he and his team were silencing the doubters. They *do* think that they deserve the league title despite being 15 points adrift. They *do* think everyone is against them despite all evidence. And that’s why this team will never succeed – unless you can step back and make a realistic assessment of where you are, properly consider your strengths and weaknesses, you can never fix them and will never therefore solve them.

For me with Arsenal it’s mentality, the shushing celebration over a measly draw to an abject United l, confirming your place as also rans (being generous there) will always be in place while Arteta is there because it’s top down.

Long may it continue I guess!

Who cares how Liverpool have won the title?
While marathon training over the weekend and listening to various podcasts, I kept hearing the same narrative—Liverpool’s challengers have been weak. This reminded me of Will Ford’s mischievous article making claim they need an asterisk.

Before I go on, Will, this is a safe space. So, tell us—did Liverpool FC steal your girlfriend before prom? Did they pants you in the playground? Or was there some “Gavin and Stacey” fishing trip incident you’re still working through by writing passive-aggressive clickbait?

Now, let’s get into it.

Is this Liverpool team better than Klopp’s peak side that amassed 110 points over two seasons, winning both the Premier League and Champions League? Obviously not.

Have Man City or any other Premier League team truly pushed them to the limit? Again, no – though credit where it’s due, the recent PSG game was a real test.

Have they been lucky with injuries? Some might say so, but isn’t managing fitness and game intensity part of being a top team? Liverpool haven’t recklessly chased extra goals when it wasn’t necessary—they’ve been smart about energy conservation, as seen in the Southampton game where they didn’t start the car until the second half, and then didn’t get out of first gear. They play for 3 mins, scored twice, then coasted to full-time with the PSG second leg in mind.

Then there’s the debate on Klopp’s legacy. On Sky Sports News, they asked whether Arne Slot winning the Premier League and Champions League in his first season would diminish Klopp’s achievements. To me, that’s nonsense. Klopp left with one Premier League and one Champions League, but he was three goals and one poor goalkeeping performance away from winning three of each. More importantly, he transformed the club, playing some of the best football English fans have seen in generations—all while competing against teams with, let’s say, questionable financial virtue!!!!!

People don’t talk enough about how much Guardiola has underachieved given the resources at his disposal. And let’s not forget, the 115 charges against City are due any day.

So no, Klopp did not underachieve. And if Slot wins three trophies in his first season, he should take Klopp out for an expensive meal to say thanks. That’s not to say Slot is just riding Klopp’s coattails—he’s refined and tweaked things where needed while keeping what was already working.

My girlfriend moaned when I paid £500 for 2 early entry Coldplay tickets, my response was that you’re not going to be upset when we’re right at the front with excellent views. Likewise, if Liverpool do win 1-2 or 3 trophies this season I’m not going to care who was in charge, how they were won, or the level of the teams we played against. I’m just going to enjoy it.

READ: When will Liverpool win the league? Earliest, funniest, Arsenal guard of honour, Anfield decider

 

Decoding the bias of covering the PL season
Here are the predictions before the PL season began basis a collective reasoning of all stakeholders:
Gooners to finally win the title
City to occupy the 2nd spot;
Between Liverpool, Chelsea, ManU; the CL spots were to be decided.

Sitting in March, 2025;
The collective reasoning narratives have been shredded and flushed down by the seemingly inexplicable laws of the beautiful game;
In simple terms status quo of pundit predictions have failed and football journalism is in total meltdown.

And thus, the Arsenal apologists and the City excuse makers form the majority of the contributors which honestly is now just sad.

Here are the most common reasons cited by the apologists:

1. City have been utter garbage because they lost a world class CDM (x alternate POV, one player’s absence can justify a dip in the collective result NOT a collapse)

2. Arsenal have collapsed due to injuries and the lack of a striker; interestingly post the Old Trafford game; every Pundit is citing that a striker would have miraculously pushed Arsenal CLOSER to the title;

Only Roy Keane (respect) had the common sense of contributing the fact that he wouldn’t bet on this Arsenal side with a striker for next season as the larger issue seems to be that of a mentality narrative; given the fact that Liverpool and City will most likely strengthen in the summer.

But what happens when a manager from Feyenoord, with no PL experience, and no signings + a keen sense of rotating his squad to ensure the best fitness for his players (read that again Arsenal Apologists) has driven Liverpool within touching distance of a 20th title?

The narrative becomes about the side being lucky, making excuses for the sh*t contemporaries (covered enough above)

The only other fan base that I empathise for is the Arsenal fans (the reasoning kind) – Do read the narratives in discussions; everyone is mostly pitching your team as an almost team even with a striker next season- Title winning teams have always operated on 3 key pillars-

1. An astute tactician in the form of a Manager
2. One-two super stars (Salah, Ronaldo, Henry)
3. A collective winner mentality (Most recent example, the PSG-Liverpool game, see SAF’s + Mourinho’s underperforming teams nicking it)

Someone in the Mailbox equated Arteta to Brendan Rodgers; and that’s apt, he has got them on the verge but need that winner mentality instilling coach.

And while F365 and other outlets will continue to find ways of belittling Slot’s achievements in the guise of satire journalism, the man has done a brilliant job whatsoever, and Kudos to this Liverpool team.

Man Utd open heart surgery has been botched
One thing that gets thrown around a lot with United’s current woes is that Ralf Rangnick comment about ‘open-heart surgery’ from a few years back. People cite it as an example of the Glazers and Ineos failing to clear out the dead wood, player power getting managers fired, etc.

Far be it from me to defend the current ownership structure, but it is worth pointing out that in the less-than-three years since Rangnick made that comment the entire executive team has been restructured and replaced – and in one notable case already left – and of the 43-man squad at the time just eight players remain (that’s 81% of the squad gone for those counting). Of those, one is Tom Heaton and another is current persona non grata Rashford.

Yet, today, the performances are worse, the football is worse, and the results are far worse than they were at what I and many other United fans incorrectly thought at the time was the nadir of the team’s Premier League era.

I’m not saying Rangnick was wrong, far from it. But people throwing it around like it hasn’t very clearly and obviously already happened, and to no avail, need a reality check.

Amorim right to go back to the future
I’ve heard and read many fans and pundits calling for Ruben Amorim to abandon his formation and philosophy, with comments such as “He needs to play to the players’ strengths,” or “He should change the system to address the results,” or “Ole/Roy Keane could get this team playing better.” Whilst it’s hard to watch the team struggling with Ruben’s approach, and to disagree with statements like the examples given here, I believe he is doing the right thing in sticking to his guns, and wanted to share why.

Another coach would change the formation to suit the players we currently have. However, Ruben has been brought in to transition the current team and style to one fitting his own. That means we are going to be playing 3-4-3, or a variation of it.

The issue is the current squad are either not good enough, not good enough to transition, or not willing to transition. So that suggests, to optimize results, we should stick to what the majority of players are good at, and make the change at a future point in time.

My question is – when? Let’s say we revert back to, for argument’s sake, a classic 4-4-2. Right now, Amorim has brought in one player who’s suited to a 3-4-3. So that means we now have 10 players suited to 4-4-2 and 1 suited to 3-4-3. If logic follows that putting your players in their best positions, in their preferred style, is the best way to get the best out of them and the team – then we’ve just made that 4-4-2 team weaker.

Let’s imagine he had brought in 2 more players in January – we’d now have 8 players suited to 4-4-2 and 3 suited to 3-4-3, arguably making the team weaker and forcing players purchased for one system to transition into an outdated system for the rest of the season. Is this when we should change it to 3-4-3?

Come the summer, when we can hopefully make some significant moves to bring in players suited to a 3-4-3, we will hopefully tip the squad’s balance in favour of 3-4-3, so is that the time we should transition to the new style and formation? When those already acquired 3-4-3 suited players have spent half a season transitioning to a redundant 4-4-2 system, and those established 4-4-2 suited players that survived the cull, having spent all season playing to their strengths in a 4-4-2 then needing to transition to 3-4-3. That would bring all the pain we’ve seen in the last few months next season, potentially meaning we need to write-off 2025/2026 as well.

The deficiencies of this squad have been ignored and papered over with bags of cash for far too long, so any rebuild was always going to be painful, and the pain will be much more worth it when the players who are not good enough, not good enough to transition, or not willing to transition are gone, and those who remain have spent half a season getting fit for purpose. When the new players come in this summer, they’ll hopefully be joining a team that is settled, or at least educated and primed for the manager’s new style and philosophy in a 3-4-3 formation. The benefits of the pain we’re feeling and performances we’re witnessing will only be felt when this happens.

Would another manager get a better tune out of the current players? Probably, but that would be going backwards, without moving forwards. At least Amorim’s methods provide hope of a different future than the current players are able to promise.

We have to let the guy do his thing, and support him through the pain. The benefits will be worth it, and the toxicity of that dressing room has to be lanced for any meaningful progress to happen. At the very least Amorim’s hardline approach has a chance to address the damage brought on by years of poor recruitment and ridiculous contracts being given to players with bad attitudes and too much influence; and formation, philosophy, professionalism and team ethic can become the foundation for success.

Mikel Arteta has established himself as a top manager during his tenure with Arsenal so far, but there are a total of eight managers who he’s faced and has never won against.

For context, David Moyes, Thomas Frank and Brendan Rodgers are the managers that Arteta boasts the most wins against, with six triumphs over each of them.

We’ve taken a closer look at his track record with Arsenal and have found the eight managers who Arteta has never beaten.

If this record continues beyond the single 2-2 draw from October 2024, then Arteta and Arsenal will have a problem.

Granted, Liverpool are not infallible despite racing clear at the top of the Premier League and Arteta does have a handy record against most of the Big Six.

But their next meeting in May will take place after the Reds have won the title in Slot’s first season, which will sting considering many thought this was Arsenal’s time.

Chelsea have been hopelessly inconsistent since Christmas, but were touted as title challengers beforehand after an impressive string of results during the autumn.

One of those came against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge, with Maresca’s side holding the Gunners to a 1-1 draw thanks to Pedro Neto’s lashed equaliser.

Arteta faced Gasperini for the first time earlier this season as Arsenal took on Atalanta in the Champions League group stage.

The Gunners struggled to find their usual attacking flow against the Italian side as the game ultimately finished goalless.

Atalanta came closest to winning the game in the second half when they were awarded a penalty, but David Raya came to the rescue and denied Mateo Retegui from the spot.

“I don’t know him personally, but as a coach he has all my respect,” Gasperini told reporters when discussing Arteta. “It’s a beautiful team to watch.”

Arteta was the youngest manager in the Premier League when he was appointed as Arsenal boss back in 2019, but that title now belongs to Brighton’s Hurzeler.

The 31-year-old has hit the ground running and his side arguably had the better chances when Brighton travelled to the Emirates earlier this season.

Aided by a Declan Rice red card, Brighton claimed a 1-1 draw against Arsenal back in August and also held Arsenal at the AMEX in January.

TRY A QUIZ: Can you name every Arsenal player to score under Mikel Arteta?

Arsenal fans won’t have many fond memories from their 3-3 draw with Southampton back in April 2023. After all, it was arguably this result that saw the Premier League title slip out of their grasp.

Southampton were practically nailed on for relegated when they travelled to Arsenal, but Selles’ side still put in a spirited performance and they even found themselves 3-1 up at one stage of the game.

Late goals from Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka rescued a point for the home side, but the draw seriously dented the Gunners’ title chances that season.

Given Selles is now managing Reading in League One, it seems unlikely that he’ll come face-to-face with Arteta again any time soon.

Carrick has established himself as a top manager in the Championship with Middlesbrough and he faced Arteta back in 2021 while he was in temporary charge of Manchester United.

Despite the Red Devils being all over the place in the weeks leading up to their clash with Arsenal, Carrick managed to get a tune out of his players as they beat Arteta’s side 3-2 at Old Trafford.

It’s the only time Carrick has ever faced Arteta in the dugout, although if he continues on his current trajectory with Middlesbrough, we reckon he’ll get back to the Premier League one day.

While Arteta’s stock is much higher than Benitez’s in 2024, you can’t look past what the 64-year-old has achieved in the game.

Arteta has only faced Benitez as a manager on one occasion and that saw the experienced Spaniard walk away with all three points.

The game took place back in December 2021 and resulted in a 2-1 win for Everton at Goodison Park.



QUIZ: Can you name every Spanish manager in Premier League history?

Attacking impotence has marred Arsenal’s 2024-25 campaign, a flaw that was apparent during their 1-0 defeat to Internazionale in the Champions League group phase.

Without Martin Odegaard and with Bukayo Saka double-marked on the wing, Arteta’s side fell behind to a Hakan Calhanoglu penalty and were unable to wipe out the deficit.

Inzaghi is a wily customer and set his Inter side out to frustrate Arsenal, a tactic that has been replicated by other managers.

Here is the worst player at each Premier League club this season, according to the algorithm anyway.

We are only including players with at least 18 league appearances in 2024/25 and are using average match ratings from WhoScored.

Arsenal: Ethan Nwaneri (6.61)
Unfortunately, the immediate message is to take all of this with a pinch of salt. Nwaneri has been brilliant for Arsenal.

 

Aston Villa: Ian Maatsen (6.32)
Villa paid big money to sign Maatsen from Chelsea after an impressive six months on loan at Borussia Dortmund.

It’s not going very well for him this season, as you can see.

 

Bournemouth: David Brooks (6.39)
Brooks has two goals in 21 appearances this season, starting eight times in total.

 

Brentford: Fabio Carvalho (6.26)
Former Liverpool youngster Carvalho has been restricted to mainly substitute appearances but has rarely impressed when on the pitch. He did score in a recent drubbing of Leicester City, mind.

 

Brighton: Simon Adingra (6.29)
With two goals and one assist in 19 Premier League matches in 2024/25, Adingra has been surprisingly underwhelming.

👉 Premier League player stats: Van Dijk most touches, Salah most goals, assists, xG

 

Chelsea: Malo Gusto (6.43)
Gusto has played a lot since signing for the Blues in January 2023, owing a lot to Reece James’ woeful injury record. Only seven Chelsea players have more minutes (1,546) than the French right-back in the Premier League this season.

 

Crystal Palace: Daichi Kamada (6.30)
Signed on a free last summer, a lot of people expected Kamada to be one of the bargains of the season. He was involved in Palace’s winner against Ipswich, which came via a debatable Kalvin Phillips error leading to goal.

 

Everton: Jack Harrison (6.39)
Harrison finally scored his first Premier League goal of the season against Wolves!

 

Fulham: Tom Cairney (6.24)
We do sympathise with Cairney considering he has only started two games but he has still played in 18.

 

Ipswich: Jack Taylor (6.18)
We don’t sympathise with Cairney as much as Taylor – who has one start and 21 substitute appearances this term.

 

Leicester: Bobby De Cordova-Reid (6.13)
It has been a miserable campaign for Leicester and De Cordova-Reid surely regret joining them last summer.

 

Liverpool: Darwin Nunez (6.56)
It has to be someone and we are not surprised at all that it is Darwin. The Uruguayan has five goals and two assists in eight starts and 15 substitute appearances.

The Uruguayan got away with a blatant kick on Southampton’s Kyle Walker-Peters after Liverpool went 1-0 down, going on to score in an eventual 3-1 win.

 

Man City: Manuel Akanji (6.43)
It was Kyle Walker with his 6.27 before he escaped to Italy. It is now Akanji, who has been a brilliant signing for City but a bit off the boil this term, like all of his team-mates.

 

Man Utd: Rasmus Hojlund (6.21)
Hojlund was supposed to kick on this season but has somehow gotten even worse, and he was bad for 85 per cent of last season. Two goal involvements is a very poor return for a £70m striker, especially when you realise Man City goalkeeper Ederson has more.

Newcastle: Joe Willock (6.26)
Willock has two assists in 800 minutes of Premier League football this campaign.

 

Nottingham Forest: Taiwo Awoniyi (6.08)
Life comes at you fast. Awoniyi’s goals kept Forest in the top flight in 2022/23 and now he can’t get a sniff because of Chris Wood and his 18 league goals while the club chase an unlikely return to the Champions League.

 

Southampton: Cameron Archer (6.15)
Southampton are historically bad that singling out one player for criticism would be wrong – they have all been shocking, besides a regretful Aaron Ramsdale.

 

Tottenham: Archie Gray (6.19)
If there is one player here we will defend, it’s Gray. He is a scrawny teenager whose natural position is midfield, who has been thrusted in right, centre and left-back due to an insane injury crisis.

All things considered, he has done exceptionally well in a struggling Spurs side.

 

West Ham: Carlos Soler (6.29)
Soler joined the Hammers on loan with high expectations considering he was coming from Paris Saint-Germain. He has probably not been as bad as his rating suggests but the Spaniard has definitely not looked a class above his team-mates.

 

Wolves: Tommy Doyle (6.16)
With one goal involvement in 24/25, Wolves’ man is Doyle.

Liverpool received a timely boost as Cody Gakpo returned to training ahead of their crucial Champions League second-leg tie against Paris Saint-Germain. The Dutch forward was spotted at the club’s AXA Training Centre on Monday, raising hopes of his availability for the upcoming fixture.

Gakpo’s absence in recent weeks has been noticeable, with the forward missing four of Liverpool’s last six matches in all competitions. He sat out games against Wolves and Aston Villa but managed short substitute appearances in wins over Manchester City and Newcastle. However, he was not involved in training before the first-leg clash in Paris, resulting in his omission from the squad that night.

Saturday’s victory over Southampton also went ahead without him, as Liverpool edged closer to securing the Premier League title. A brace from Mohamed Salah and a goal from Darwin Núñez sealed the win, but Gakpo’s absence remained a concern.

— Sky Sports News (@SkySportsNews) March 10, 2025

Before the Southampton match, head coach Arne Slot provided an update on Gakpo’s condition, saying:

“He didn’t train yesterday yet, so let’s see if he can train with us today [Friday]. Again, [a] close call it will probably be. It’s not a long-term injury but he still had a bit of pain yesterday so he was not able to train. Let’s see where he is today, so I can’t give you the answer yet.”

This uncertainty surrounded his availability, but his participation in Monday’s open training session suggests he is edging closer to a return.

Seeing Gakpo back in training will be a relief for Liverpool as they prepare for a defining week. His potential inclusion against PSG would bolster the attacking options as they look to overturn their first-leg deficit. Beyond that, Sunday’s Carabao Cup final against Newcastle could also see him play a key role.

Meanwhile, there were no fresh injury concerns from the session. Conor Bradley and Joe Gomez remain unavailable, but otherwise, Liverpool’s squad appears in good shape for the challenges ahead.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"
https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22health%20news%22%20site%3Anews-medical.net,"MRNA vaccines, once a Trump boast, now face attacks from some in GOP",https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250310/MRNA-vaccines-once-a-Trump-boast-now-face-attacks-from-some-in-GOP.aspx,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 10:57:00 GMT","

Researchers racing to develop bird flu vaccines for humans have turned to a cutting-edge technology that enabled the rapid development of lifesaving covid shots.

There's a catch: The mRNA technology faces growing doubts among Republicans, including people around President Donald Trump.

Legislation aimed to ban or limit mRNA vaccines was introduced this year by GOP lawmakers in at least seven states. In some cases, the measures would hit doctors who give the injections with criminal penalties, fines, and possible revocation of their licenses.

Some congressional Republicans are also pressing regulators to revoke federal approval for mRNA-based covid shots, which President Donald Trump touted as one of the signature achievements of his first term.

The opposition comes at a critical juncture because vaccines using mRNA have applications well beyond avian flu and covid. They hold the promise of lifesaving breakthroughs to treat many diseases, from melanoma to HIV to Zika, according to clinical trials. The proposed bans could block access to these advances.

MRNA is found naturally in human cells. It is a molecule that carries genetic material and, in a vaccine, trains the body's immune system to fight viruses, cancer cells, and other conditions. An advantage of mRNA technology is that it can be developed more quickly to target specific variants and is safer than developing a vaccine made from inactivated virus.

""Right now, if we had a bird flu pandemic, we would have a shortage of the vaccine we need,"" said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. ""The one thing that could save us is mRNA vaccine. The challenge would be if mRNA is banned. This is truly dangerous policy.""

The pushback conflicts with innovations championed by Trump. He assembled tech tycoons at the White House just after his inauguration to announce Stargate, a $500 billion artificial intelligence initiative that could help transform cancer treatment by creating tumor-targeting mRNA vaccines. The fledging partnership between Oracle, SoftBank Corp., and OpenAI, co-founded by Elon Musk, envisions leveraging AI in part to improve health outcomes. Patients would undergo blood tests and AI would be used to find cancer.

Scientists would examine the DNA and RNA (RNA and mRNA serve different functions in a cell) of a specific patient's tumor to create a vaccine to teach that person's immune system to target and destroy cells driving cancer growth.

""Imagine early cancer detection, the development of a cancer vaccine for your particular cancer aimed at you, and have that vaccine available in 48 hours,"" Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said at the White House event.

Scores of mRNA clinical trials for cancer vaccines are underway and some have shown dramatic results, cutting the risk of death and recurrence roughly in half for certain patients. In research led by the Yale School of Medicine, for example, patients with advanced kidney cancer remained cancer-free about three years after an mRNA-based treatment in an early-phase trial.

But some politically conservative doctors, lawmakers, and researchers question the safety of mRNA vaccines, especially covid shots made with the technology. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unsuccessfully petitioned the FDA in 2021 to rescind approval for covid shots and called them ""the deadliest vaccine ever made"" — a controversial statement that has been refuted.

Now that he's newly confirmed as Health and Human Services secretary, Kennedy is poised to oversee federal approvals of vaccines, with the power to shape policy such as immunization schedules and appoint vaccine opponents to committees that advise on the approval of shots.

Bloomberg reported late last month that Trump administration health officials were reevaluating a $590 million contract for bird flu shots that the Biden administration awarded to Moderna as part of its push to examine spending on mRNA vaccines.

HHS and White House spokespeople didn't return emails seeking comment.

Support for an mRNA ban is coming from other sources too. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on March 5 urged the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending the covid-19 vaccine for children and called for a state ban on mRNA vaccine mandates. In February, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said on X that the ""FDA should immediately revoke approval of these shots,"" and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is leading an investigation into the safety of the vaccines. Trump in February signed an order to strip federal funds from schools that require covid shots for attendance.

Vaccine skepticism has become pronounced among Republicans since the pandemic. Four in 10 Republicans who responded to a KFF poll published in January said it was ""probably"" or ""definitely true"" that ""more people have died from covid-19 vaccines than from the virus itself."" Just a quarter of Republicans reported holding that view in 2023.

The effort is also finding traction at the local level. A district health department outside Boise, Idaho, last year banned its health department from administering covid-19 vaccines, and local lawmakers in Franklin County, Washington, passed a resolution in February against mRNA vaccines.

The CDC recommends covid vaccines for anyone 6 months and older, especially seniors and people who are immunocompromised. About 29 million doses had been administered to adults in the 2024-25 season in retail pharmacies and doctors' offices through Feb. 8, based on federal data.

Given as a shot, mRNA enters muscle cells and teaches them to produce a spike protein found on the surface of a virus. The body's immune system then targets the spike protein, priming it to identify and fight the virus — in this case, the coronavirus that causes covid. The body's cells then break down the mRNA and remove it, according to federal health researchers.

More than 13 billion covid vaccines had been administered worldwide as of August 2024.

Researchers say the vaccinations saved countless lives — estimates for the first year alone go as high as 19.8 million — in the throes of a pandemic that had hospitals ordering refrigerated mobile morgues and deliberating over which patients to put on ventilators. Two University of Pennsylvania scientists credited with developing the mRNA technology behind the shots were awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 2023.

The FDA says the covid vaccines are safe, with fewer than 1 in 200,000 vaccinated individuals experiencing a severe allergic reaction or heart problems like myocarditis or pericarditis, and the agency notes that ""inaccurate information about these vaccines, particularly the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, continues to circulate.""

While many people hadn't heard of the mRNA platform until the covid shots were rolled out, it was discovered in the 1960s. The first mRNA flu vaccines were tested in mice in the 1990s. A clinical trial involving direct injection of mRNA to fight cancer occurred in 2008. Clinical trials involving the covid mRNA vaccines involved tens of thousands of volunteers.

Reviews of mortality data showed ""no unusual patterns of death were detected that might suggest a potential safety concern,"" based on a September 2024 report by a technical working group that provided guidance to the CDC.

But those calling for a ban on all mRNA vaccines say there is a dearth of long-term safety data, and they say covid vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were hastily approved without proper vetting. They assert without strong evidence that the vaccines cause serious injuries to the heart, nerves, and immune and reproductive systems, and can lead to cancer.

The vaccine has been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation and inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart, although the severity has varied and most patients fully recovered, the CDC says.

""The allegations are beyond reason,"" said Anne Schuchat, a career scientist who worked on covid and who twice served stints as acting director of the CDC. ""The mRNA covid vaccines were extensively studied after use and do not have those problems.""

""I'm concerned about the whole mRNA technology. I don't trust anything that fools the body,"" said Stephanie Seneff, a computer scientist and anti-vaccine activist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""I'm really glad people are waking up and realizing it's not the thing to do anymore.""

Vaccines generally work by tricking the body into producing antibodies to fight illnesses.

Pfizer spokespeople didn't return an email seeking comment. A Moderna spokesperson, Chris Ridley, said legislative efforts to ban or restrict mRNA medicines are largely driven by misunderstandings about their safety profile and mechanism of action. While mRNA-based shots do not modify DNA, for example, that misconception is frequently cited in support of restrictions, Ridley said.

""If enacted, these measures could hinder important research and limit patient access to innovative treatments, potentially delaying life-changing medical advancements,"" Ridley said in a written statement.

Groups opposed to the mRNA technology have built a vast and well-funded legal, marketing, and social media network. Members hold conferences to discuss strategies, fund lawsuits against vaccine mandates, and produce reports on the covid vaccines.

As for state legislative efforts, measures introduced this year have varied and their progress has been mixed. Montana's measure, for instance, was blocked. Idaho lawmakers in February held a hearing on its bill, which calls for a 10-year moratorium on mRNA vaccines. Idaho's proposal, likely to be amended, as well as Iowa's and Montana's have featured criminal penalties for providers who administer all or certain mRNA vaccines. In addition, some state bills, such as legislation in Pennsylvania and Tennessee, focused on the use of the vaccine in livestock and food production.

Various bills are pending in the Texas Legislature to restrict mRNA vaccines in both livestock and humans. South Carolina's pending bill would require anyone administering certain covid mRNA vaccines to inform patients that the shot is contaminated with fragments of ""bacterial plasmid DNA.""

Covid mRNA shots may have minute amounts of residual DNA from production processes but they are heavily degraded and pose no risk, according to the Global Vaccine Data Network, which evaluates vaccine safety concerns.

Speakers at some legislative proceedings have included representatives from Children's Health Defense, an activist, anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy.

The Florida surgeon general in January 2024 called for a halt in the use of covid mRNA vaccines. And in Texas, Attorney General Ken Paxton in January moved to appeal a lawsuit he filed claiming Pfizer misrepresented the safety of its mRNA shot.

Efforts to restrict the shots have raised the profile of groups such as the Independent Medical Alliance, which advocates for mRNA-based covid vaccines to be withdrawn from the market.

""We should stop it and test it more before we move forward,"" said pediatric cardiologist Kirk Milhoan, a senior fellow at the alliance.

Groups opposed to mRNA shots are pointing to a recent study to urge more caution. Yale University researchers reported in February that they found spike protein still circulating in a subset of individuals with a debilitating, post-vaccination condition. Some of the individuals who experienced chronic illness after getting the shots had detectable levels of spike protein more than 700 days after vaccination. This study was small — 42 participants — and not peer-reviewed.

Its findings also don't show the spike protein is a health risk or a cause of vaccine injury.

""It's an initial, provocative study in which you can't draw conclusions,"" said William Schaffner, past medical director of National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. ""This is one of the most widely used vaccines around the globe. It's the furthest thing from an experimental vaccine.""

But what this growing pushback shows, according to some researchers, is that distrust isn't coming only from fringe groups anymore.

""There are truly amazing mRNA cancer vaccines out there,"" said Kate Broderick, chief innovation officer at Maravai LifeSciences, which works on vaccine development. ""My fear as a scientist is that it's been tainted in the public.""

Joseph Shea, who sells athletic wear in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, wonders and worries about the food he eats.

The chemical ingredients with mystifying names. The references on product labels to unspecified natural or artificial flavors. The junk food that fits his budget but feels addictive and makes him feel unwell.

Shea, one of 1,310 people who responded to a poll the health policy research group KFF conducted on health care priorities, said he assumes the FDA is making sure the ingredients are safe.

In many cases, it is not.

The FDA's restraints on food ingredients are limited and relatively feeble, especially compared with those in Europe, a KFF Health News examination found. There are at least 950 substances in our food that are not permitted in Europe, according to one expert's estimate, and chemicals linked to health concerns show up in hundreds of products that line the shelves of American supermarkets.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has railed about the risks of food additives for years and has said he wants to end ""the mass poisoning of American children."" At a March 6 confirmation hearing, Marty Makary, President Donald Trump's nominee to head the FDA, expressed concern about foods ""with a lot of molecules that do not appear in nature.""

""These are chemicals that the industry insists are safe, a subset of which are concerning,"" he said.

But the Trump administration's initial moves to reduce staff at the FDA led the director of its food safety unit, Jim Jones, to resign last month and raised fears among food safety specialists that the administration could weaken oversight.

To a great extent, the FDA leaves it to food companies to determine whether their ingredients and additives are safe. Companies don't have to tell the FDA about those decisions, and they don't have to list all ingredients on their product labels.

Though pharmaceutical companies are required to share research on humans with the FDA, the agency is largely blind to what food-makers know about their products.

""The food industry does massive amounts of research that we have no access to,"" Robert Califf told a Senate committee in December on his way out as FDA commissioner.

As a result: The FDA's oversight of food additives is much weaker than its oversight of prescription drugs.

""There is good reason to be concerned about the chemicals that are routinely included in much of our food,"" Califf testified.

Food is a big business. American consumers spend almost $1.7 trillion annually on food and beverages, according to Circana, a research and advisory firm.

Yet American food companies keep secret much of what they put in their products.

KFF Health News asked nine of the largest food manufacturers — The Coca-Cola Co., Conagra Brands, General Mills, Kellanova (successor to Kellogg), The Kraft Heinz Co., Mondelēz International, Nestlé, PepsiCo, and Unilever — for the number of ingredients, if any, that go unnamed on their product labels and the names of those ingredients deemed safe without involvement by the FDA, and substances used in their products in the United States but not in Europe, and vice versa.

None provided answers to those questions.

""We focus on the quality of the ingredients that we use, and all comply with applicable regulatory requirements,"" Nestlé spokesperson Dana Stambaugh said.

Chemicals such as titanium dioxide and potassium bromate, whose safety has been debated, are allowed in foods in the United States but not in Europe.

Corporations may turn a blind eye to potential dangers, a July 2024 FDA-funded report warned.

Potentially harmful ingredients ""are not necessarily required to be named on a product label,"" the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, an adjunct to the agency, said in the report, which was based largely on interviews with representatives of companies across the food supply chain.

""Companies may choose not to track the presence of these ingredients/compounds due to concern about future litigation,"" the report said.

Some additives can remain hidden from the public behind such catchall terms as ""spices"" and ""artificial flavors,"" as the Center for Science in the Public Interest has reported, or shrouded by other exemptions from disclosure requirements.

And some ingredients that should have been listed on product labels — potential allergens such as milk, wheat, eggs, and dyes — have at times gone undisclosed, according to a series of food recalls. Gaps in oversight have alarmed political leaders on both sides of the aisle, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, watchdog groups such as the CSPI, and academic researchers.

Adding to the concern: the profusion of ultra-processed foods, which use a wide array of chemicals to add flavor and color, extend shelf life, reduce cost, control texture or consistency, and generally tempt people to eat more. Ultra-processed foods now make up 73% of the U.S. food supply, researchers have estimated. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has said there's growing evidence they are ""deliberately designed to be addictive,"" contributing to an epidemic of obesity — a rare point of agreement between him and Kennedy.

At his confirmation hearing, Makary said some ingredients cause a chronic, low-grade inflammatory reaction in the gastrointestinal tract. ""And what are we doing? We are drugging our nation's children at scale,"" he said.

The KFF poll found that 58% of respondents want the Trump administration to prioritize setting stricter limits on chemicals in the U.S. food supply.

The Consumer Brands Association, which represents many of the largest food-makers, defends the regulatory system as ""rigorous,"" ""evidence-based,"" and ""proven."" The system enables companies ""to innovate to meet consumer demand,"" Sarah Gallo, the association's senior vice president of product policy, said in a statement to KFF Health News.

""Food manufacturers attest to the safety of an ingredient through the development of extensive scientific evidence and third-party expert review,"" Gallo added.

More than a decade ago, Pew Charitable Trusts estimated that there were about 10,000 additives allowed in food in the United States — and that the FDA had not reviewed the safety of about 3,000 of them.

""The system is fundamentally broken,"" said Thomas Neltner, one of the authors of the Pew study. ""It's so bad, nobody knows — not even FDA knows — what's in our food.""

The FDA allows titanium dioxide to be used to enhance the appearance of foods, among other purposes. According to an Environmental Working Group database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 1,900 products, including many candies.

The European Union takes a more cautious approach. In 2021, an EU regulatory panel concluded that titanium dioxide ""can no longer be considered as safe when used as a food additive."" The panel said it couldn't rule out the possibility that titanium dioxide could damage chromosomes.

The FDA allows potassium bromate to be used in baking, and, according to the EWG database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 200 products, including bread, buns, and bagels.

Potassium bromate has been banned from food in many countries, including those of the European Union, Canada, India, and Peru. In 2023, California banned it from food effective in 2027. The United Kingdom prohibited it in 1990. The International Agency for Research on Cancer identified it as possibly carcinogenic more than 25 years ago. A joint committee of the United Nations and the World Health Organization identified it as a ""genotoxic carcinogen"" in 1992.

On its website, the FDA says it has worked with industry to minimize potassium bromate levels and is reviewing the chemical, among others.

The EWG says that it created the database to help consumers make healthier choices and that the raw data on product labels is supplied by Label Insight — which is owned by NielsenIQ, a major provider of data to industry. The EWG has called for tighter regulation of foods.

Based on a review of FDA and European Commission databases, it appears that at least 950 more additives are used in foods in the United States than are allowed in the European Union, said Erik Millstone, an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex in England who has been studying food safety policy since the 1970s.

Direct comparisons are difficult because the two regulatory systems and the way they keep their records differ greatly.

A definitive count is elusive because the FDA doesn't require industry to inform it of everything used in foods in the United States.

""That kind of casual neglect totally would be unacceptable in Europe,"" Millstone said.

When the FDA formally approves substances for use in food, it can let decades pass without reassessing them — even when subsequent research raises doubts about their safety.

In January, when the FDA banned Red Dye No. 3 from foods, it cited research published in 1987. (The FDA said it had no evidence the dye puts people at risk; invoking one of the stricter consumer protections, it said a law from 1960 prohibits the use of additives found to induce cancer in animals.)

In the European Union, substances used in foods must pass regulatory approval before being introduced. The EU has also required that its regulators reassess all additives that were on the market before Jan. 20, 2009, a process that is ongoing.

""In the FDA, although we have authorization to do post-market reviews, there’s no statutory mandate to do them,"" Jones, the former deputy commissioner of the FDA's Human Foods Program, told a Senate committee in December. ""We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized at some point in the past.""

The FDA website lists 19 post-market determinations since 2010 that substances were not ""generally recognized as safe."" Four involve chemical constituents of one mushroom and the mushroom itself. Others include an anabolic steroid, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, cannabidiol (CBD), Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, and partially hydrogenated oils.

Meanwhile, trichloroethylene, banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in December as ""an extremely toxic chemical known to cause liver cancer, kidney cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,"" is still allowed under FDA rules for use as a solvent in the production of foods.

FDA spokesperson Enrico Dinges said the agency will work with new leadership at HHS ""to safeguard the food supply through pre-market and post-market safety evaluations of chemicals in the food supply.""

The biggest gap in the FDA's oversight of foods goes back generations.

In 1958, Congress mandated that, before additives could be used in foods, manufacturers had to prove they were safe and get FDA approval. However, Congress carved out an exception for substances ""generally recognized as safe,"" which came to be known simply as GRAS.

As conceived, GRAS promised regulatory relief for standard ingredients like salt, sugar, vinegar, and baking powder — along with many chemicals.

Over time, ""the loophole swallowed the law,"" said a 2014 report by Neltner and Maricel Maffini for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Companies can unilaterally decide their ingredients are already recognized as safe and use them without asking the FDA for permission or even informing the agency.

A better translation of GRAS would be ""Generally Recognized as SECRET,"" the Natural Resources Defense Council report said.

A federal watchdog reached a similar conclusion. ""GRAS substances can be marketed without FDA's approval or even its knowledge,"" the Government Accountability Office warned in 2010.

That spared the FDA from spending time reviewing countless substances.

For advice on whether ingredients are GRAS, companies may convene panels of specialists. The FDA has noted that panel members could be paid by the companies commissioning the review, but, in guidance to industry, it says ""such compensation is not itself an unacceptable conflict.""

About 3,000 flavoring ingredients have been deemed GRAS by a panel of scientists working for an industry group, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association of the United States, known as FEMA, said George Southworth, the organization's executive director.

The scientists on the FEMA panel ""adhere to stringent conflict-of-interest policies,"" and their GRAS determinations are submitted to the FDA, which includes them in an online database, Southworth said.

Southworth described the panel as independent, and the FEMA website says panel members have never been employees of companies in the food industry.

Asked how many times FEMA's panel found that a flavoring didn't meet the test, Southworth wouldn't say. He indicated that some reviews are called off before a conclusion is reached.

""Publicly reporting these numbers without full context could lead to misinterpretations about the safety of substances,"" he added.

Food companies have another option: They can voluntarily notify the FDA that they believe their product is GRAS for its intended use and lay out their reasons — giving the FDA a heads up and essentially seeking its blessing.

If they take that route, they don't have to wait for an answer from the FDA to begin marketing the product, the agency has said.

And they don't risk much. If the FDA spots weaknesses in a company's argument or reasons to worry about a chemical's safety, it routinely calls off its review instead of declaring the substance unsafe.

FDA records posted on the agency's website show that the FDA often coaches companies to ask the agency to cease its evaluation. That, too, leaves the company free to sell the product, food watchdogs said.

For companies that voluntarily run their products past the FDA, victory is a letter saying the agency has no questions.

But if companies market products as ""generally recognized as safe"" without firm grounds, they run the risk that the FDA could one day take enforcement action, such as issuing a warning or stopping sales. That's if the FDA notices.

On March 8, 2022, a Canadian company, Psyched Wellness, issued a news release saying it had a green light to market products in the United States.

An ""independent review panel of scientific experts"" concluded that an extract the company developed, AME-1, was ""Generally Recognized As Safe,"" paving the way for it to be sold in bulk and used as an ingredient, the company said.

The company described the panel's judgment as a successful ""certification"" and ""a key milestone."" The extract was derived from a hallucinogenic mushroom, Amanita muscaria, which the company said ""has incredible healing and medicinal powers."" As the company later put it in a news release, it had obtained ""self-Gras status.""

In June 2024, the company announced that it would soon release Amanita muscaria watermelon gummies.

However, the FDA later took issue with the company and its product.

In a memo dated Sept. 9, 2024, an FDA toxicologist said Psyched Wellness' claim of GRAS certification was false. The firm failed to show that its extract was generally recognized as safe, the FDA memo said.

Speaking of the mushroom, its extracts, and its known ""pharmacologically active constituents,"" the FDA memo posted on the agency's website said they have ""potential for serious harm and adverse effects on the central nervous system.""

The FDA was focusing on the mushroom against the backdrop of a spate of medical problems linked to another company's ""Diamond Shruumz"" brand chocolate bars, gummies, and infused cones. When it recalled those products in June 2024, that other company announced that a chemical found in Amanita mushrooms was a possible cause of symptoms, including seizures and loss of consciousness.

The FDA memo discussed that recall and said one death and 30 hospitalizations might have been related.

The memo did not connect Psyched Wellness to the outbreak or the Diamond Shruumz products.

The chief executive of Psyched Wellness, Jeffrey Stevens, did not respond to an interview request or written questions.

As recently as Feb. 1, Psyched Wellness said in a securities filing that it will ""continue to market its products in the U.S. using the Self-GRAS designation.""

If food ingredients cause acute reactions — sending people to emergency rooms, for example — the potential dangers may be relatively easy to identify, and regulatory action might naturally follow. Some critics of the system say they worry more about health effects that could take years or decades to develop.

Then, when it's too late, it could be hard to trace the harm to any particular ingredient.

All that leaves Joseph Shea of Myrtle Beach in a tough spot.

For a while, Shea tried shopping at a market that has a lot of organic offerings, he said in an interview. That proved too expensive.

Shea said the entire picture is ""incredibly frustrating.""

""They're probably poisoning us, and we don't know,"" he said. ""We'll figure it out 30 years down the road when we get sick.""

Green lights flickered on the wireless router in Barbara Williams' kitchen. Just one bar lit up — a weak signal connecting her to the world beyond her home in the Alabama Black Belt.

Next to the router sat medications, vitamin D pills, and Williams' blood glucose monitor kit.

""I haven't used that thing in a month or so,"" said Williams, 72, waving toward the kit. Diagnosed with diabetes more than six years ago, she has developed nerve pain from neuropathy in both legs.

Williams is one of nearly 3 million Americans who live in mostly rural counties that lack both health care and reliable high-speed internet, according to an analysis by KFF Health News, which showed that these people tend to live sicker and die younger than others in America.

Compared with those in other regions, patients across the rural South, Appalachia, and remote West are most often unable to make a video call to their doctor or log into their patient portals. Both are essential ways to participate in the U.S. medical system. And Williams is among those who can do neither.

This year, more than $42 billion allocated in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is expected to begin flowing to states as part of a national ""Internet for All"" initiative launched by the Biden administration. But the program faces uncertainty after Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick last week announced a ""rigorous review"" asserting that the previous administration’s approach was full of ""woke mandates.""

High rates of chronic illness and historical inequities are hallmarks of many of the more than 200 U.S. counties with poor services that KFF Health News identified. Dozens of doctors, academics, and advocates interviewed for this article unanimously agreed that limited internet service hinders medical care and access.

Without fast, reliable broadband, ""all we're going to do is widen health care disparities within telemedicine,"" said Rashmi Mullur, an endocrinologist and chief of telehealth at VA Greater Los Angeles. Patients with diabetes who also use telemedicine are more likely to get care and control their blood sugar, Mullur found.

Diabetes requires constant management. Left untreated, uncontrolled blood sugar can cause blindness, kidney failure, nerve damage, and eventually death.

Williams, who sees a nurse practitioner at the county hospital in the next town, said she is not interested in using remote patient monitoring or video calls.

""I know how my sugar affects me,"" Williams said. ""I get a headache if it's too high."" She gets weaker when it's down, she said, and always carries snacks like crackers or peppermints.

Williams said she could even drink a soda pop — orange, grape — when her sugar is low but would not drink one when she felt it was high because she would get ""kind of goozie-woozy.""

Connectivity dead zones persist in American life despite at least $115 billion lawmakers have thrown toward fixing the inequities. Federal broadband efforts are fragmented and overlapping, with more than 133 funding programs administered by 15 agencies, according to a 2023 federal report.

""This is America. It's not supposed to be this way,"" said Karthik Ganesh, chief executive of Tampa, Florida-based OnMed, a telehealth company that in September installed a walk-in booth at the Boligee Community Center about 10 minutes from Williams' home. Residents can call up free life-size video consultations with an OnMed health care provider and use equipment to check their weight and blood pressure.

OnMed, which partnered with local universities and the Alabama Cooperative Extension System, relies on SpaceX's Starlink to provide a high-speed connection in lieu of other options.

A short drive from the community center, beyond Boligee's Main Street with its deserted buildings and an empty railroad depot and down a long gravel drive, is the 22-acre property where Williams lives.

Last fall, Williams washed a dish in her kitchen, with its unforgiving linoleum-topped concrete floors. A few months earlier, she said, a man at the community center signed her up for ""diabetic shoes"" to help with her sore feet. They never arrived.

As Williams spoke, steam rose from a pot of boiling potatoes on the stove. Another pan sizzled with hamburger steak. And on a back burner simmered a mix of Velveeta cheese, diced tomatoes, and peppers.

She spent years on her feet as head cook at a diner in Cleveland, Ohio. The oldest of nine, Williams returned to her family home in Greene County more than 20 years ago to care for her mother and a sister, who both died from cancer in the back bedroom where she now sleeps.

Williams looked out a window and recalled when the landscape was covered in cotton that she once helped pick. Now three houses stand in a carefully tended clearing surrounded by tall trees. One belongs to a brother and the other to a sister who drives with her daily to the community center for exercise, prayers, and friendship with other seniors.

All the surviving siblings, Williams said, have diabetes. ""I don't know how we became diabetic,"" she said. Neither of their parents had been diagnosed with the illness.

In Greene County, an estimated quarter of adults have diabetes — twice the national average. The county, which has about 7,600 residents, also has among the nation's highest rates for several chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, stroke, and obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows.

The county's population is predominately Black. The federal CDC reports that Black Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and are 40% more likely than their white counterparts to die from the condition. And in the South, rural Black residents are more likely to lack home internet access, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank.

To identify counties most lacking in reliable broadband and health care providers, KFF Health News used data from the Federal Communications Commission and George Washington University's Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity. Reporters also analyzed U.S. Census Bureau, CDC, and other data to understand the health status and demographics of those counties.

The analysis confirms that internet and care gaps are ""hitting areas of extreme poverty and high social vulnerability,"" said Clese Erikson, deputy director of the health workforce research center at the Mullan Institute.

Just over half of homes in Greene County have access to reliable high-speed internet — among the lowest rates in the nation. Greene County also has some of the country's poorest residents, with a median household income of about $31,500. Average life expectancy is less than 72 years, below the national average.



By contrast, the KFF Health News analysis found that counties with the highest rates of internet access and health care providers correlated with higher life expectancy, less chronic disease, and key lifestyle factors such as higher incomes and education levels.

One of those is Howard County, Maryland, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., where nearly all homes can connect to fast, reliable internet. The median household income is about $147,000 and average life expectancy is more than 82 years — a decade longer than in Greene County. A much smaller share of residents live with chronic conditions such as diabetes.

One is 78-year-old Sam Wilderson, a retired electrical engineer who has managed his Type 2 diabetes for more than a decade. He has fiber-optic internet at his home, which is a few miles from a cafe he dines at every week after Bible study. On a recent day, the cafe had a guest Wi-Fi download speed of 104 megabits per second and a 148 Mbps upload speed. The speeds are fast enough for remote workers to reliably take video calls.

Americans are demanding more speed than ever before. Most households have multiple devices — televisions, computers, gaming systems, doorbells — in addition to phones that can take up bandwidth. The more devices connected, the higher minimum speeds are needed to keep everything running smoothly.

To meet increasing needs, federal regulators updated the definition of broadband last year, establishing standard speeds of 100/20 Mbps. Those speeds are typically enough for several users to stream, browse, download, and play games at the same time.

Christopher Ali, professor of telecommunications at Penn State, recommends minimum standard speeds of 100/100 Mbps. While download speeds enable consumption, such as streaming or shopping, fast upload speeds are necessary to participate in video calls, say, for work or telehealth.

At the cafe in Howard County, on a chilly morning last fall, Wilderson ordered a glass of white wine and his usual: three-seeded bread with spinach, goat cheese, smoked salmon, and over-easy eggs. After eating, Wilderson held up his wrist: ""This watch allows me to track my diabetes without pricking my finger.""

Wilderson said he works with his doctors, feels young, and expects to live well into his 90s, just as his father and grandfather did.

Telehealth is crucial for people in areas with few or no medical providers, said Ry Marcattilio, an associate director of research at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. The national research and advocacy group works with communities on broadband access and reviewed KFF Health News' findings.

High-speed internet makes it easier to use video visits for medical checkups, which most patients with diabetes need every three months.

Being connected ""can make a huge difference in diabetes outcomes,"" said Nestoras Mathioudakis, an endocrinologist and co-medical director of Johns Hopkins Medicine Diabetes & Education Program, who treats patients in Howard County.



At Williams' home in Alabama, pictures of her siblings and their kids cover the walls of the hallway and living room. A large, wood-framed image of Jesus at the Last Supper with his disciples hangs over her kitchen table.

Williams sat down as her pots simmered and sizzled. She wasn't feeling quite right. ""I had a glass of orange juice and a bag of potato chips, and I knew that wasn't enough for breakfast, but I was cooking,"" Williams said.

Every night Williams takes a pill to control her diabetes. In the morning, if she feels as if her sugar is dropping, she knows she needs to eat. So, that morning, she left the room to grab a peppermint, walking by the flickering wireless router.

The router's download and upload speeds were 0.03/0.05 Mbps, nearly unusable by modern standards. Williams' connection on her house phone can sound scratchy, and when she connects her cellphone to the router, it does not always work. Most days it's just good enough for her to read a daily devotional website and check Facebook, though the stories don't always load.

Rural residents like Williams paid nearly $13 more a month on average in late 2020 for slow internet connections than those in urban areas, according to Brian Whitacre, an agricultural economics professor at Oklahoma State University.

""You're more likely to have competition in an urban area,"" Whitacre said.

In rural Alabama, cellphone and internet options are limited. Williams pays $51.28 a month to her wireless provider, Ring Planet, which did not respond to calls and emails.

In Howard County, Maryland, national fiber-optic broadband provider Verizon Communications faces competition from Comcast, a hybrid fiber-optic and cable provider. Verizon advertises a home internet plan promising speeds of 300/300 Mbps starting at $35 a month for its existing mobile customers. The company also offers a discounted price as low as $20 a month for customers who participate in certain federal assistance programs.

""Internet service providers look at the economics of going into some of these communities and there just isn't enough purchasing power in their minds to warrant the investment,"" said Ross DeVol, chief executive of Heartland Forward, a nonpartisan think tank based in Bentonville, Arkansas, that specializes in state and local economic development.

Conexon, a fiber-optic cable construction company, estimates it costs $25,000 per mile to build above-ground fiber lines on poles and $60,000 to $70,000 per mile to build underground.

Former President Joe Biden's 2021 infrastructure law earmarked $65 billion with a goal of connecting all Americans to high-speed internet. Money was designated to establish digital equity programs and to help low-income customers pay their internet bills. The law also set aside tens of billions through the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, to connect homes and businesses.

That effort prioritizes fiber-optic connections, but federal regulators recently outlined guidance for alternative technologies, including low Earth orbit satellites like SpaceX's Starlink service.

Funding the use of satellites in federal broadband programs has been controversial inside federal agencies. It has also been a sore point for Elon Musk, who is chief executive of SpaceX, which runs Starlink, and is a lead adviser to President Donald Trump.

After preliminary approval, a federal commission ruled that Starlink's satellite system was ""not reasonably capable"" of offering reliable high speeds. Musk tweeted last year that the commission had ""illegally revoked"" money awarded under the agency's Trump-era Rural Digital Opportunity Fund.

In February, Trump nominated Arielle Roth to lead the federal agency overseeing the infrastructure act's BEAD program. Roth is telecommunications policy director for the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Last year, she criticized the program's emphasis on fiber and said it was beleaguered by a ""woke social agenda"" with too many regulations.

Commerce Secretary Lutnick last week said he will get rid of ""burdensome regulations"" and revamp the program to ""take a tech-neutral approach."" Republicans echoed his positions during a U.S. House subcommittee hearing the same day.

When asked about potentially weakening the program's required low-cost internet option, former National Telecommunications and Information Administration official Sarah Morris said such a change would build internet connections that people can't afford. Essentially, she said, they would be ""building bridges to nowhere, building networks to no one.""

Over a lunch of tortilla chips with the savory sauce that had been simmering on the stove, Williams said she hadn't been getting regular checkups before her diabetes diagnosis.

""To tell you the truth, if I can get up and move and nothing is bothering me, I don't go to the doctor,"" Williams said. ""I'm just being honest.""

Years ago, Williams recalled, ""my head was hurting me so bad I had to just lay down. I couldn't stand up, walk, or nothing. I'd get so dizzy.""

Williams thought it was her blood pressure, but the doctor checked for diabetes. ""How did they know? I don't know,"" Williams said.

As lunch ended, she pulled out her glucose monitor. Williams connected the needle and wiped her finger with an alcohol pad. Then she pricked her finger.

""Oh,"" Williams said, sucking air through her teeth. ""That hurt.""

She placed the sample in the machine, and it quickly displayed a reading of 145 — a number, Williams said, that meant she needed to stop eating.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22health%20news%22%20site%3Anews-medical.net,Enhancing pediatric health evaluations through improved PROMs,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250310/Enhancing-pediatric-health-evaluations-through-improved-PROMs.aspx,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 14:47:00 GMT","

Children's health assessments differ significantly from adults due to varying cognitive abilities, language skills, and developmental stages. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), which are self-reported questionnaires, offer valuable insights into a child's health status, but their design and implementation in pediatrics are complex. Challenges include determining the appropriate age for self-reporting and ensuring the reliability of proxy reports from parents or caregivers. Previous studies have shown that children as young as 8 can reliably report their health, but younger children often require proxy reports, which may not accurately reflect their experiences. Based on these challenges, there is a pressing need for more in-depth research to optimize the use of PROMs in pediatric healthcare.

A team of researchers from Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and other institutions published a review (DOI: 10.1002/pdi3.77) on June 1, 2024, in Pediatric Discovery, providing an extensive overview of systematic reviews on pediatric PROMs. The study analyzed 44 SRs, identifying 123 recommended PROMs and evaluating their methodological quality. The research highlights the most frequently used PROMs, such as the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, and calls for improvements in the reporting of psychometric properties and the development of tailored tools for assessing pediatric PROMs.

The study reviewed 44 SRs, encompassing 1,888 studies and 635 different PROMs, with 123 PROMs being recommended. The most frequently recommended PROM was the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), followed by the EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire. These PROMs were primarily used to assess quality of life, body functions, and emotional functions. The study found that 36 different conditions were addressed, with mental, behavioral, or neurodevelopmental disorders being the most common. However, the methodological quality of the SRs varied, with only 22.7% scoring high on the AMSTAR tool. Key issues included inconsistent reporting of measurement properties, such as content validity and internal consistency, and a lack of clarity on the appropriate age for self-reporting. The study also highlighted the need for more diverse PROMs to cover a broader range of pediatric conditions and improve the evidence base for their use in clinical practice.

The findings highlight the importance of improving the methodological quality of systematic reviews on pediatric PROMs. We need more standardized reporting and tailored tools to ensure that clinicians can select the most appropriate measures for children's health assessments.""

Dr. Yaolong Chen, lead researcher on the study

The study's findings have significant implications for pediatric healthcare. By identifying gaps in the current use of PROMs, the research paves the way for more targeted and effective health assessments in children. Improved PROMs can enhance communication between healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers, leading to better long-term care management. Future research should focus on developing more diverse PROMs, standardizing reporting methods, and determining the optimal age for self-reporting to ensure reliable and valid health assessments in pediatric populations. This will ultimately contribute to better health outcomes for children and adolescents worldwide.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22health%20news%22%20site%3Anews-medical.net,Low semen quality linked to shorter lifespan,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250310/Low-semen-quality-linked-to-shorter-lifespan.aspx,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 08:48:00 GMT","

New research reveals a dose-dependent relationship between male infertility and mortality risk, suggesting semen quality may serve as a universal biomarker for long-term health outcomes.

 Study: Semen quality and lifespan: a study of 78 284 men followed for up to 50 years. Image Credit: natrot / Shutterstock.com

In a recent study published in Human Reproduction, researchers determine how low semen quality may impact mortality risk.

In addition to its direct effects on reproduction, male infertility may also reflect an individual’s susceptibility to certain diseases and premature mortality. In fact, several studies have reported a dose-dependent relationship between semen quality and impaired health, as well as sperm concentrations and mortality risk.

Although most men who are seeking reproductive counselling are young and less likely to be diagnosed with chronic health conditions, infertile men often have more comorbidities than comparable fertile men. Despite these observations, it remains unclear how the presence of existing health issues prior to semen quality assessment impact the potential association between male infertility and mortality.

Semen parameters are related to increased morbidity and shorter life expectancy..thus, semen quality may be a universal biomarker of morbidity and mortality.”

The current study included 78,284 men with a median age of 32 years who underwent semen quality screening due to couple infertility. All semen analyses were performed in a public laboratory between 1965 and 2015 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Mortality data were gathered from national registers over a median period of 23 years, with the longest follow-up period being 50 years.

Life expectancy and survival differences were calculated between groups and stratified by semen quality. In a subgroup with later results obtained between 1987 and 2015, educational status and medical conditions were also recorded to allow for the analysis to consider the impact of these factors on patient outcomes.

Among the study cohort, the median sperm concentration was 51 million/mL in men with a diagnosed illness at the time of testing as compared to 47 million/mL in healthy men. Lower median sperm counts were more likely to be reported in individuals with a history of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diseases of the reproductive tract.

Throughout the follow-up period, 8,600 deaths were reported, which reflected 11% of the study cohort. A dose-dependent relationship was observed between survival rates and decreasing semen quality. All semen parameters exhibited the same pattern, even after adjusting for education and the presence of illnesses at the time of the examination.

Men with a total motile sperm count (TMSC) of 120 million or more had a life expectancy (LE) of about 80.3 years. Comparatively, men with azoospermia, which is defined as a TMSC of zero, experienced a reduction in their life expectancy rates by 2.7 years to an average of 77.6 years. Men with azoospermia also had a 39% increased risk of death as compared to fertile men.

Men with a TMSC between zero and five million had a median life expectancy of 78 years. The risk of death was 61% higher in men with TMSC between five and 10 million, thus making these individuals at the greatest mortality risk.

In obstructive azoospermia, the man is healthy and sperm production is normal; however, sperm cells cannot be released into the semen due to a blockage. In non-obstructive azoospermia, sperm production is very low or absent, thus indicating underlying disease. The current study did not differentiate between individuals with obstructive or non-obstructive azoospermia.

The mortality risk was 38%, 27% and 16% higher for those with sperm counts between 10-40, 40-80, and 80-120 million, respectively. As compared to healthy men, men with pre-existing health conditions had a higher mortality risk in each stratum, thus indicating that disease activity was likely already severe.

Some men with low semen quality are more likely to die from any cause at relatively earlier ages. In the current study, reduced semen quality parameters, even when greater than the male infertility threshold, led to lower overall survival rates.

Previous studies suggest that declining health is associated with impaired semen quality. Thus, as compared to healthy men, survival outcomes are reduced for infertile men who were already diagnosed with one or more diseases.

Male reproductive function is a biomarker of long-term survival.”

Lower semen quality predicted a shorter lifespan, with this association consistent across all semen parameters. Men with high-quality semen were found to live 2.7 years longer as compared to men with the lowest semen quality.

There was no difference in patient outcomes after considering educational status and pre-existing disease conditions. Thus, additional studies are needed to validate these findings and identify exactly what diseases are associated with lower semen quality.

Future research should also identify at-risk populations with greater specificity to support the development of preventive programs.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22health%20news%22%20site%3Anews-medical.net,Limiting screen time and promoting physical activity may help safeguard children’s mental health,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250310/Limiting-screen-time-and-promoting-physical-activity-may-help-safeguard-childrene28099s-mental-health.aspx,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 14:06:00 GMT","

A recent Finnish study suggests that limiting screen time and promoting physical activity from childhood may help safeguard mental health in adolescence. The findings are particularly significant given that mental health problems affect up to 30% of young people and pose a growing societal challenge.

The study, conducted by the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences at the University of Jyväskylä and the Institute of Biomedicine at the University of Eastern Finland, followed 187 adolescents over an eight-year period. Researchers found that children who spent more time on screens -especially mobile devices - were more likely to experience higher levels of stress and depressive symptoms in adolescence.

Conversely, higher levels of physical activity and participation in organized sports were associated with lower stress and fewer depressive symptoms. However, the link between physical activity and depressive symptoms was weaker than that of screen time and depressive symptoms. Adolescents with both high screen time and low physical activity had the highest levels of stress and depressive symptoms.

Several international, evidence-based recommendations suggest that the leisure screen time of children and adolescents should be limited to two hours per day.

Personally, I think that even this figure is high, as it amounts to almost one month of screen time per year.""

Eero Haapala, Senior Lecturer from the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, University of Jyväskylä 

These findings emphasize the need to promote healthy lifestyle habits early in life. Encouraging children to engage in physical activity and setting reasonable limits on screen time could play a crucial role in preventing mental health challenges later in life.

""The modern sedentary lifestyle, with high screen exposure, challenges the mental health of children and adolescents,"" says Dr Eero Haapala.

""Recent discussions have rightly focused on screen time and social media, but I hope our findings encourage adults in young people's lives to promote a broad spectrum of healthy habits - especially by balancing screen time and physical activity.""

""Achieving change requires collaboration,"" Haapala emphasizes.

""Society as a whole - from families to policymakers - must invest in promoting healthy lifestyles for children and adolescents by ensuring balanced screen time, sufficient physical activity, adequate sleep, and a nutritious diet.""

The PANIC Study is part of the Metabolic Diseases Research Community at the University of Eastern Finland. The research community is dedicated to investigating major cardiometabolic diseases. By leveraging genetics, genomics, translational research, and lifestyle interventions, the community aims to provide robust evidence on disease mechanisms and advance early diagnosis, prevention, and personalized treatment. The research community consists of 20 research groups, spanning basic research to patient care.

Meghan Markle fans are attempting their own honey lemon layer cakes and other recipes from her new Netflix show — and the Duchess of Sussex is loving it!

Meghan, 43, highlighted just a few social media posts that her show With Love, Meghan has inspired via her Instagram Stories on Sunday, March 9. Among the posts are people taking inspiration from Meghan’s crudités platters, citrus cake, one-pot pasta and the royal’s focaccia recipe.

“Love seeing how inspired you are by With Love, Meghan,” the duchess wrote over the various social media screenshots she shared. “Keep up the beautiful work!”

“Let me tell y’all something. I made Meghan the Duchess of Sussex menu items from her show With Love, Meghan on @netflix and all I’m saying is that everyone loved it!!” wrote one Threads user alongside pictures of the tasty dishes they cooked up.



They added, “OMG. I made the Honey Lemon Layer Cake with Raspberry, the pasta in episode one and the Focaccia. So so good. Listen if you don’t do anything else, make yourself one of these. I’m going to try the Tempura Fried Chicken next.”

“Tell me you watched the new Netflix show without telling me which show,” shared another Threads user, who captured their attempt at making Meghan’s one-pot pasta recipe, which combines spaghetti, olive oil, tomatoes, green vegetables and cheese.

“You put the dry pasta in, you pour boiling water on top, and that’s it,” Meghan said on the show, emphasizing how easy the dish is to make at home.

With Love, Meghan has received a mixed reaction from viewers since it dropped Tuesday, March 4, on Netflix.

The show’s director, Michael Steed, praised Meghan’s kitchen skills in an interview with People. “Her cooking is pretty spot-on. She’s not a chef, and it’s definitely not meant to make it seem like she is, but there’s just a love of cooking that is palpable,” Steed told the outlet in an interview published Saturday, March 8.

However, celebrity chef Jameson Stocks was less complimentary of the show. “I honestly thought it was terrible. Everything — the music is quite slow, it’s quite lethargic, it’s quite painful to watch. I think she should go back to acting,” he said in an interview with GB News. “She’s quite a good actress. In real life or on screen. People should stick to what they do best.”

With Love, Meghan will return for a second season, which has already been filmed, later this year.

Lauren Graham is aware that Gilmore Girls fans want another revival series — but acknowledged it’s not an easy task to accomplish.

“How do you honor those people who have kept [Gilmore Girls] alive?” Graham, 57, asked host Dax Shepard on the Monday, March 10, episode of his “Armchair Expert” podcast. “Is it giving them more? Is it doing what Reese Witherspoon is doing with Legally Blonde, Elle the prequel? Is this a Captain Marvel multiverse where you wanna follow whoever? Or do you try to go back?”

Gilmore Girls ran for seven seasons on the WB from 2000 to 2007. The show starred Graham as Lorelai and Alexis Bledel as her daughter Rory. Nine years after the series finale, the drama was revived for a miniseries on Netflix titled Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. For Graham, coming back to the series after nearly a decade was a rewarding experience.

“For me, it was an incredibly satisfying, beautiful, cried every day experience,” she reflected. “I could mark some growth I felt I had in terms of that character, that time. Working with [creator] Amy [Sherman-Palladino]. It felt different so all the stuff I love about it was the same but it was better and different than a more grown-up version.”



Graham has seemingly thought about how to continue the beloved WB series, since she had an idea of how they can proceed with the narrative.

“I always say — it’s not me trying to get out of the question — it is literally what I could picture given everyone’s lives and schedules is [a] Christmas movie,” she said. “Because that’s what I think the Brits do so well with their beloved shows … You get the Christmas special. It’s not [multiple] episodes but it’s seeing all your friends together again.”

Graham added that the idea of having the cast reunite for a special holiday moment did well when she and costar Scott Patterson — who play Graham’s love interest Luke — joined forces for a WalMart commercial last year. The actress shared that she thought it was “a sweet ‘where are they now?’ thing” for the pair’s characters.”

However, Graham acknowledged that if Gilmore Girls was going to do another revival it faces a challenge, especially with how the Netflix revival ended. (Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ended on a cliffhanger where Rory revealed to Lorelai that she is pregnant.)

“The problem is where we left the characters, well not the problem,” she said. “Now Luke and Lorelai got married, Rory is maybe having a baby. It’s not necessarily going to be the two of us circling the gazebo.”

Graham added that in order for the show to have another life “it just can’t be the same,” which is why she thinks a holiday catchup would be the best bet.

While Graham is grateful that the decision is not in her hands, she said if she gets the call for another revival she’ll “do it.”

Kelsey Grammer is hopeful that Frasier will be revived again — but he isn’t interested in bringing the show back on Paramount+.

“There’s a better home for it,” Grammer, 70, told The New York Post on Thursday, March 6. “I think they gave it sort of a good try, but they weren’t particularly passionate about the project. I mean, obviously, they didn’t really promote or spend much time on it.”

Grammer didn’t rule out another return, adding, “We’ll end up somewhere where people are passionate about it … Listen, it’s got a huge audience, a big following, and if people know where to find it, I think they will.”

The original Frasier series, which aired from 1993 to 2004, served as a spinoff of the hit sitcom Cheers. It followed psychiatrist Frasier Crane (Grammer) as he returned to his hometown of Seattle as a radio show host while reconnecting with his family.



Paramount+ revived the show in 2023 with stars Grammer, Jack Cutmore-Scott, Nicholas Lyndhurst, Toks Olagundoye, Jess Salgueiro and Anders Keith. Grammer told Variety at the time that he wanted a “sillier” version of the famous sitcom.

“There’s enough groundwork laid between these human beings,” he said about hoping to do “another 100 episodes” at least. “They are wonderful characters. I want to see where they go. And I want to see what happens to Frasier.”

The revival was ultimately canceled earlier this year. Despite Frasier not returning to Paramount+, Grammer wants a future installment to feature his former Cheers costar Ted Danson.

“Ted and I might actually visit something together, we’ve been talking about it,” Grammer teased. “A couple ideas, maybe on Frasier. We don’t know, but there is still certainly something, some fields to be mined there, in terms of that relationship, as long as it’s still a relevant relationship it’s still relevant for the show.”

The duo costarred on Cheers before reuniting on Frasier. A potential collaboration between Grammer and Danson, 77, wouldn’t feature Cheers, with Grammer adding on Thursday, “[It] will not come back, [cocreator] Jimmy Burrows has always said, ‘No, that bar doesn’t exist anymore.'”

Grammer also addressed his fallout with Danson, which they discussed on Danson’s “Where Everybody Knows Your Name” podcast late last year.

“It got a little blown out of proportion. It really wasn’t an argument. It was at a time in my life when I was actually going through a lot of self-doubt, self-loathing, honestly,” Grammer explained at the time. “It was when I was drinking a lot. Ted had just come up and said, ‘You know, I’m kind of mad at you that sometimes you don’t show up ready to go.'”

He added: “Maybe what happened for Ted was, he stepped away from what might have been a better friendship. Maybe he had to protect himself.”

Fraiser is currently streaming on Paramount+.

Kate Hudson and Chet Hanks go way back.

“[Hudson’s family] lives five minutes away from my parents, and Kate used to have these awesome parties at her house where she would invite a bunch of people and play games, specifically Mafia,” Chet, 34, told Bustle in an interview published on Monday, March 10.

This is hardly the first time Hudson’s famous Mafia parties have made headlines. The actress spoke about her star-studded get togethers in 2022 during the Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery press tour.

For Chet, however, knowing Hudson via her epic game nights allowed their relationship to eventually translate on screen.



“It makes it easier when you already have a rapport with someone,” he told Bustle. Chet stars as basketball star Travis Bugg alongside Hudson’s Isla Gordon in Netflix’s Running Point, which premiered late last month.

The actor noted during Monday’s interview that he was shocked that the show’s creators, including Mindy Kaling, didn’t have him in mind when writing the part — mostly because of their similarities.

“It was the character description: Travis is the white point guard. He’s covered in tattoos. He’s a wannabe rapper, but he’s a huge liability because of the controversial s— he posts on social media,” Chet recalled. “I literally said to myself, ‘If I don’t get this role, I should just quit.’”

Chet is the famous eldest son of Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson. The couple are also parents to 29-year-old actor Truman Hanks. (Tom, 68, is also a father to son Colin, 47, and daughter Elizabeth, 42, whom he welcomed with late ex-wife Samantha Lewes.)

“My dad’s an actor. My older brother’s an actor. My mom. This was the family business,” he added. “So I [knew] that was something I would go into at some point.”

What he didn’t expect was to be dubbed Tom and Wilson’s controversial son. Chet went viral in 2020 for putting on a fake Jamaican accent on the Golden Globes red carpet and releasing the song “White Boy Summer” the following year. Chet admitted that people were “perplexed” by his actions at the time and acknowledged the “long road” to find success — even with a famous family. (Chet has been sober since 2015, after checking into a rehab for a cocaine addiction.)

“It’s been blood, sweat, and tears, and I don’t take any of it for granted,” he added. “Fortune favors the bold and I just want to keep doing it all.”

The White Lotus has found very creative ways to feature those viral full frontal scenes over the years.

HBO’s hit series, which debuted in 2021, focuses on the guests and employees at a fictional resort as they experience a slew of personal ups and downs while on vacation. The anthology series is also known for featuring a mysterious murder — or two — that is eventually revealed at the end of each season.

The structure has also allowed various characters to strip down on screen. Creator Mike White has previously recalled the trepidation he has faced when it came to directing sex scenes.

“I’m very timid about asking people to undress and get into sexual situations. It’s not my wheelhouse. There were definitely times on this shoot that I was like, ‘What have I got myself into?’ My threshold for awkwardness is very low,” he told NPR in November 2022. “The actors are much more confident and uninhibited than I am. That was new terrain for me. It just felt like it was important because it really is baked into the narrative.”



White was asked about fan reactions to those NSFW moments, saying, “It’s funny, though, how now that the show is airing, how much you realize a graphic sex scene or a sex scene that kind of is titillating for various reasons, does just spike and generate an interest in the populace, for better or worse.”

Keep scrolling for the most unfiltered quotes about those full frontal scenes:

The first season kicked off with Zahn’s character, Mark, stripping down amid a health scare. “I didn’t even have to do that part,” Zahn told The Hollywood Reporter in 2021. “It’s somebody else wearing a prosthetic. That’s about as absurd as it gets, right?”

During season 2, viewers were shocked when Harper (Aubrey Plaza) accidentally snuck a peek at Cameron (Theo James) while he undressed. Although the moment wasn’t a sex scene, the actor opened up about bringing the risqué scene to life.

“The truth of it was you go into these things and you have a conversation with the director and the producers, and they go, ‘OK, for this, we’re going to use a prosthetic, we’re gonna use something,’” James explained during a December 2022 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. “It’s a pee-pee prosthetic.”

James didn’t want the prosthetic to be too “distracting” for the audience. “He needs to be [a] regular Joe because the scene’s not about the pee-pee, it’s about power play in sex [and] whether he did it deliberately or whether it was an accident,” he continued.

As for how true to form the prosthetic was? “I mean, it’s bigger than that. It’s like she stole it off a donkey in the field,” he quipped. “The thing is ginormous.”

The third installment was set in Thailand — and this time it was Schwarzenegger’s character Saxon seen headed to the bathroom while completely nude.

“Yes, that’s my real butt. No stand-in,” he teased to Esquire in February 2025. “Once I read the script, I knew what was coming, but before that, I didn’t.”

Patrick’s father, Arnold Schwarzenegger, also had plenty to say on the matter, writing via Instagram, “I was so pumped to take a break from filming to celebrate @patrickschwarzenegger at the White Lotus Season 3 premiere. What a show! I could claim to be surprised to find out he has a nude scene, but what can I say — the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. Don’t miss it this Sunday — trust me.”

During season 3, Timothy (Isaacs) was spiraling about being sent to prison for money laundering and bribery. He tried to take his mind off the money issues by taking his wife Victoria’s (Parker Posey) anti-anxiety meds, which caused him to accidentally flash his family when his robe pops open.

“Yeah, it is now in my contract for every show I do, so we’ll see,” Isaacs joked to Entertainment Weekly in March 2025. “It’ll get easier, hopefully. He’s drugging himself into a stupor to try not to think about the fact that his entire life is blowing up and trying to work out what to do about it,” he noted. “It was actually quite challenging — I remember reading the scripts thinking, ‘Wow, I’ve got to keep my powder dry for five or six episodes, and then this s–t really kicks off.'”

He continued: “You haven’t seen other things that are coming, but I just remember thinking, ‘I better dig deep and produce something here.’ Because there’s a lot of parts you can go through and tell a very dramatic story without your character going through anything extreme. But there’s some big, old acting coming up.”

The latest season of Love Is Blind continued to have more explosive moments off camera than on.

During the season 8 reunion, which started streaming on Netflix Sunday, March 9, fans received updates from all five couples, with Taylor and Daniel happily married and the other four duos — Ben and Sara, Virginia and Devin, Lauren and Dave, and Monica and Joey — all taking swipes at each other.

Mason, Meg, Alex and Madison were also all in attendance. After dating “a couple times” in the past year, Mason and Meg revealed they were better off as friends. Alex and Madison are on less friendly terms, accusing each other of being different on and off camera.

There was also a random countdown of the most memorable moments in LiB history — the correct winner would’ve been Jessica’s dog drinking the wine out of her cup, but we digress — and a major Perfect Match spoiler with season 6 star AD Smith and Love Is Blind UK’s Ollie Sutherland announcing their engagement, let Us break down the biggest takeaways by couple:



Taylor and Daniel

The only successful relationship from the season, Taylor and Daniel are still going strong, recently buying their first home in Minneapolis. And if the twosome gushing about their romance wasn’t enough to make fans believe in their love story, Daniel showed off his insane (and giant) new tattoo of Taylor’s eyes on his chest.

Virginia and Devin

Ben and Sara 2.0, anyone? While it seemed like a shock to some when Virginia said no to Devin at the altar, it turns out that they were arguing over politics and values behind the scenes too. After saying that she didn’t feel comfortable sharing Devin’s views, Virginia made hers clear. “I 100 percent support the LGBTQ community. I also believe that women should have the decision to choose if they want to have an abortion or not,” she said. “I also believe that different religions should be valued.”

Devin, who stated he is a Christian, didn’t really respond, but argued that couples “didn’t need to agree on everything” to get married. If that wasn’t enough, Virginia accused Devin of hiding the $1,000 wedding check that his mother gave him and claimed she found a note from an ex-girlfriend in his hotel room ahead of their big day. While he didn’t have a good explanation for the check, Devin claimed that the “ex-girlfriend” in question was one of his “best friends” who is now in a relationship with someone in his wedding party.

Sealing the deal that these two weren’t a match, Virginia and Devin argued over who “ghosted” who and left Us with more questions than answers.

Ben and Sara

Ben continued to play the amnesia game during his hot seat moment with Sara, telling his ex and the crowd that he didn’t “remember” his church’s views on the LGBTQ+ community. He eventually admitted that he likely didn’t pay attention to any mention of the LGBTQ+ community at his parish because it didn’t directly affect him.

When the topic shifted to the headline-making TikTok allegations against Ben, Sara reiterated that she wanted to trust him at the time, but no longer does. “Knowing now what I know about Ben, a TikTok like that makes sense,” she said.

According to Sara, the twosome tried to date and lived together for a week or so after their failed wedding. Ben even allegedly agreed to temporarily move to Nashville with Sara. After she left for Music City (with Ben supposedly set to join her at a later date), Sara claimed Ben removed her from Find My Friends and ended things with “three very scripted apologies.” Ben argued that the duo had a conversation that he perceived as a breakup before Sara left, but she insisted that the plans for him to move in with her were still in place.

When the twosome did finally talk again weeks later, Ben reached out to try to get on good terms with Sara — because he was advised by a former cast member to get on the same page with his ex ahead of the reunion. While Ben didn’t want to name names, Sara quickly revealed it was season 6 star Jimmy Presnell who told Ben to script responses with Sara. (It’s hard not to laugh thinking about Ben taking advice from Jimmy — another missed opportunity for the cameras!)

Sara concluded that she felt “love-bombed” by Ben, who didn’t really do much besides try to awkwardly smile his way through the rest of the segment. (If he did prepare a script, he should’ve considered a different writer!)

Monica and Joey

Monica came out swinging in a way viewers likely didn’t expect, accusing Joey sliding into costar Madison’s DMs. While Joey said he reached out to several cast members and tried to downplay the message, Madison eventually revealed that he had complimented her new pink hair and told her that he wished they talked more at the group hangout that was featured on the show. (Not a crime, but also not a message you should be sending days before your wedding!)

Despite dating in the pods, Madison made it clear that she had no interest in Joey, and Monica accused her ex of gaslighting her as Joey denied ever telling Monica that Madison was a potential threat to their romance.

Watching the show back was also clearly difficult for Monica. “It was embarrassing,” she said. “[I’m thinking to myself], ‘This man is not interested in you romantically … how could you not see?’” Joey tried to argue that Madison’s sister’s lack of acceptance was why he pulled away, Nick Lachey had a good point — it happens! — arguing that Monica’s sister might have picked up on Joey’s skepticism and didn’t want her sister to get hurt.

Lauren and Dave

Justice for Lauren was served when Dave admitted that Lauren’s former fling was reaching out for the wrong reasons. While he “absolutely” regrets listening to “the other guy,” Lauren wasn’t buying it. “I just don’t fully believe it. You had my phone number for the last year,” she said. “You made no effort to show that in any capacity.”

After (correctly) declaring that she had a lot more “emotional maturity” than Dave, Lauren clarified that she doesn’t agree with the social media comments about Dave being a “narcissist or manipulator.” She concluded that he “tried his best with the information he had.”

While we still didn’t get much clarification about his sister — and his refusal to meet Lauren — Dave claimed that she had watched the show and “struggled” with “seeing how hurt Lauren was and how hard it was for her to go through that.”

Andy Cohen is playing coy about Tamra Judge’s future on The Real Housewives of Orange County.

“I got the report of what happened last night,” Cohen, 56, said on the Monday, March 10, episode of SiriusXM’s Radio Andy. “All I will say is this. I can’t comment on what’s going on while we’re filming shows.”

On Sunday, March 9, Judge, 57, seemingly announced she was quitting The Real Housewives of Orange County while filming a cast trip in New Orleans.

“It was a long run!” she wrote via her Instagram Story. “When life gives you real problems this reality s— doesn’t make sense. Peace out … I’m out.”



The next day, Judge posted a selfie from an undisclosed airport with the message, “Mental health is health.” (Us Weekly has reached out to Bravo for comment.)

Cohen was quick to remind listeners that Judge’s close friend, Teddi Mellencamp, is going through a serious health scare, which could have an impact on her outlook on filming season 19.

“I guess the only thing that is at the top of my mind is that one of her best friends, if not her best friend, is going through an incredibly intense health crisis,” he shared. “So maybe keep that in mind, otherwise I really don’t have anything to say on the subject.”

Although Bravo hasn’t confirmed the final cast for the new season, Judge has been spotted in New Orleans with castmates including Shannon Beador, Heather Dubrow, Katie Ginella, Gina Kirschenheiter, Jennifer Pedranti and Emily Simpson.

Gretchen Rossi, who was previously confirmed to return to the Real Housewives of Orange County as a “friend” of the group, was also photographed with the ladies attending the New Orleans Dog Parade.

In the middle of filming season 19, Judge learned Mellencamp, 43, was going to have surgery to remove brain tumors.

While the former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star continues to recover from surgery at home, Judge is vowing not to share any personal updates about her close friend.

“You know, a lot of people are reaching out to me and they want me to get them an update,” Judge said during the February 19 episode of iHeartRadio’s “Two Ts in a Pod” podcast. “It’s not my place. What do you guys want me to do? Do you want me to take pictures from the hospital and post them? I’m not doing that.”

While speaking through tears, Judge added, “All I can do is pray on her and love her like all of her friends are doing. And that’s it.”

Fans first met Judge when she joined The Real Housewives of Orange County for its third season in 2008. The Vena CBD cofounder remained a main cast member on the reality series for 12 seasons until her exit in 2020, but she returned to the show in 2022 for season 17.

Andy Cohen is breaking his silence on what went down last night with RHOC's Tamra Judge.

While speaking on his SiriusXM’s show ""Andy Cohen Live,"" he made a brief comment.

If you didn't see the news, Tamra seemingly quit the show while filming and announced the news on her social media, saying, “It was a long run! When life gives you real problems this reality shit doesn’t make sense. Peace out ✌️ Im out.""

Keep reading see Andy Cohen's comment...

Andy responded to the news by saying on the air today, “I got the report of what happened last night. All I will say is this, I can’t comment on what’s going on, in you know while we’re filming shows. I guess the only thing that, the thing that is at the top of my mind is that one of her best friends, if not her best friend, is going through an incredibly intense health crisis. So maybe keep that in mind, otherwise I really don’t have anything to say on the subject.”

The best friend Andy is referring to is seemingly Teddi Mellencamp, who underwent emergency brain surgery after tumors were found. Our continued thoughts are with Teddi and her loved ones, including Tamra.

Amid a series of global outages of social media platform ‘X’, its CEO Elon Musk on Monday claimed that there was and still is a “massive cyberattack” against the microblogging medium. He suspected that either a large, coordinated group or a country is involved in this.

“Tracing…” Musk wrote in a post on X.

Earlier in the day, the Elon Musk-owned platform was facing multiple outages as per Downdetector, restricting thousands of users in the US from accessing their handles.

The number of outage reports increased to around 26,579 after a brief down trend, the user data on the outage tracker website said. This number in the day went as high as 40,000 users.

In the United Kingdom as well, more than 10,800 users reported an outage earlier in the day. However, the cause of this said outage was not immediately clear.

Several users had complained about not being able to load pages or refresh their timelines on X. They posted saying, ""Twitter went down for an hour but seems to be okay now?"", while another wrote, ""Everyone going to X now Twitter is down"".

The services to the microblogging platform, however, resumed shortly after the global outage.

According to Downdetector, 56 per cent of the issues were reported for the X app, while 33 per cent were reported for the website. The tracker website's data is based on reports submitted by users, which means that the actual numbers of affected numbers may vary.

The social media platform, which was previously known as Twitter, experienced a series of glitches back in March 2023 for more than an hour, with links not working and some users unable to even log in to their accounts.

Musk had took over Twitter in 2022, following which he renamed the platform to 'X'. The rebranding of site lead to 'tweets' being called as 'posts' and 'retweets' as 'reposts'.

Musk also switched the iconic blue bird logo with a white X on a black background.

Elon Musk said X (formerly Twitter) was hit by a massive cyberattack on Monday, suggesting that a large, coordinated group or even a nation-state could be behind it. The attack led to three outages throughout the day, each lasting nearly an hour.

""There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against X. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing...,"" Elon Musk posted on X.

There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against 𝕏.We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved.Tracing … https://t.co/aZSO1a92no

According to Downdetector, the platform faced three outages throughout the day, with interruptions peaking around 3:00 pm with nearly 2,200 reports from Indian users, surging again at 7:30 pm with 1,500 reports, and continuing later around 9:00 pm as users faced further access issues.

Elon Musk acquired X in 2022 for $44 billion. In 2023, he became the first person to reach 200 million followers on X.

The tracking website showed that nearly 52 percent of problems were related to the website, 41 percent to the app and 8 percent had to do with server connection problems.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

LONDON — A fuel tanker and a cargo vessel were involved in a fiery collision off the British coast in the North Sea on Monday, the U.K. coast guard said. 

The tanker, MV Stena Immaculate, was struck by the Portugal-registered Solong container ship, according to a statement from Crowley, the company that manages the the tanker. The Stena Immaculate is a U.S. vessel that was anchored off the North Sea coast near Hull at the time, the company said. 

""The Stena Immaculate sustained a ruptured cargo tank containing Jet-A1 fuel due to the (collision),"" the statement said. ""A fire occurred as a result of the (collision), and fuel was reported released."" 

A defense official told NBC News that the ship was carrying fuel that was to be used by U.S. Navy ships. 

The scene was one of chaos in video footage published by The Guardian newspaper, with both vessels apparently on fire and sending thick black smoke billowing into the gray North Sea sky.

Crowley confirmed that all crew aboard the Stena Immaculate abandoned the vessel following multiple explosions onboard. Everyone was ""safe and fully accounted for,"" the company said.

Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East, told Sky News that 32 people had been brought ashore alive. The town of Grimsby is around 60 miles southeast of the city of York. 

""There was a line of ambulances waiting to take them to the Princess Diana hospital,"" Boyers said.

""I'm concerned to hear of the collision between two vessels in the North Sea this morning and am liaising with officials and HM Coastguard as the situation develops,"" British Transport Minister Heidi Alexander said in a post on X. 

""I want to thank all emergency service workers involved for their continued efforts in responding to the incident,"" she added.

A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the situation was “extremely concerning"" and details are still ""becoming clear."" 

""We’re obviously monitoring the situation, we’ll continue to co-ordinate the response and we’re grateful to emergency personnel for their continued efforts,"" the spokesperon said.

While NBC News has been unable to independently verify that information, the nonprofit Royal National Lifeboat Institution said in a statement that four lifeboat crews had been called to support two ships after they had collided off the East Yorkshire coast early Monday. 

“There were reports that a number of people had abandoned the vessels following a collision and there were fires on both ships,” the RNLI said in a media statement. 

It added that at shortly before midday local time, while its Cleethorpes crew had been called back, three more crews from Bridlington, Mablethorpe and Skegness continued to support search and rescue efforts. 

The Stena Immaculate had been sailing from the Greek port of Agioi Theodori, near Athens, while the Solong had just left the nearby British port of Immingham and was on its way to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, according to Marine Traffic, a maritime analytics provider.  

His Majesty’s Coastguard, which acts as the United Kingdom's national maritime emergency service, earlier said that it was coordinating a response to reports of a collision between a tanker and cargo vessel off the coast of East Yorkshire in England.

It said an alarm was raised alerting the agency to the incident at 9:48 a.m. local time (5:48 a.m. ET). 

A coast guard rescue helicopter was last being dispatched to respond to the collision, the British government's Maritime and Coastguard Agency said in a media statement. 

It added that a coast guard aircraft and nearby vessels with ""fire-fighting capability"" were also being deployed.

The United States is closing 83 percent of USAID programmes that do not meet Washington’s interests. The announcement was made by the head of the US State Department Marco Rubio on Monday.

Rubio said that the “5200 contracts that are now canceled spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States.”

“In consultation with Congress, we intend for the remaining 18 percent of programs we are keeping (approximately 1,000) to now be administered more effectively under the State Department,” he added.

The decision came after a six week review of the programs, Rubio set out, citing their funding as antithetical to the core interests of the United States:

“After a 6 week review we are officially cancelling 83% of the programs at USAID.

Thank you to DOGE and our hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform.”

In February this year, President Donald Trump’s administration announced that it was cutting off more than 90 percent of foreign aid provided through USAID. According to media reports, a total of about 5,800 grants were canceled, and more than 500 USAID grants were frozen.

Earlier this month, the US Supreme Court rejected the authorities’ request to suspend the payment of about $2 billion to foreign organizations through USAID for already completed projects.","{'href': 'https://www.financialexpress.com', 'title': 'The Financial Express'}"

Health authorities are calling attention to a looming consequence of the Trump administration’s gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development: the risk of a global surge in tuberculosis cases and deaths.

The World Health Organization warned last week that the sweeping funding cuts could endanger millions of lives, since many countries depend on foreign aid for TB prevention, testing and treatment.

“Without immediate action, hard-won progress in the fight against TB is at risk,” Dr. Tereza Kasaeva, director of the WHO’s Global Programme on TB and Lung Health, said in a statement Wednesday.

Globally, tuberculosis is responsible for the most deaths of any infectious disease. Around 1.25 million people died from the bacterial infection in 2023, the latest data available, and new cases hit an all-time high that year, with around 8.2 million people diagnosed, according to the WHO.

Until recently, USAID provided about a quarter of the international donor funding for tuberculosis services in other countries — up to $250 million annually, according to the WHO. The agency operated tuberculosis programs in 24 countries.

The WHO said that because of the U.S. funding cuts, drug supply chains in other countries are “breaking down,” laboratory services are “severely disrupted” and surveillance systems are “collapsing,” making it difficult to identify, monitor and treat tuberculosis cases. Some research trials have been halted, as well.

That has incapacitated some national tuberculosis programs, with the WHO warning of devastating impacts in 18 countries with the highest burden of disease, many of which are in Africa.

In Uganda, the rollback of USAID funding has made it hard to pay community health workers, leading to understaffing, said Dr. Luke Davis, a clinical epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health. Such workers play a critical role in notifying people who test positive for tuberculosis, getting them treatment and screening their close contacts for infection.

“Patients may get a diagnosis of TB after they’ve left the clinic because they’re waiting for the results, and they may be at home with TB and not know they have TB. There’s literally not the resources to go out and reach those people,” he said. “People are dying because they have disease that hasn’t been diagnosed, hasn’t been treated, hasn’t been prevented.”

Since Jan. 24, the discontinuation of USAID funding may have led to an estimated 3,600 additional tuberculosis deaths and 6,400 additional infections, according to a project modeling the impact of the cuts. The model is coordinated by the Stop TB Partnership, a United Nations organization that aims to eliminate tuberculosis as a public health problem.

Any increase in the disease’s spread could affect the U.S., since it would allow more people who live or travel abroad to bring the disease in. Already, tuberculosis cases in the U.S. have risen: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded more than 9,600 cases in 2023, a nearly 16% increase from the year prior and a 9% increase over prepandemic levels in 2019.

A persistent outbreak in Kansas has led to 68 active cases since January 2024.

“What happens when we travel overseas? I’ve known servicemen and -women who come back with multidrug-resistant TB after a tour of duty. I’ve known of bankers, people from Silicon Valley who work overseas, come back with the disease,” said Dr. Kenneth Castro, a professor of global health at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health.

“The problem with all these infectious diseases is that they know no borders, and neither should our efforts stop at the border,” he said.

A resurgence of tuberculosis in the U.S. from 1985 to 1992 was attributed, in part, to a decline in tuberculosis control programs and rising global cases.

The White House declined to comment.

People with active TB usually develop a bad cough and chest pain. They may cough up blood and mucus and have difficulty breathing. Left untreated, the bacterial infection can damage the lungs and spread to other parts of their body such as the brain, kidneys and spine. It can be fatal for up to two-thirds of people with active cases who aren’t properly treated, according to the WHO.

But treatment is no quick matter: Tuberculosis patients must usually take antibiotics for six months, and stopping in the middle can lead a person to become resistant to the antibiotics, then spread that drug-resistant TB strain to others.

Until the recent cuts, USAID had been instrumental in conducting surveillance to identify new tuberculosis cases, improving supply chains to get medicine to sick patients, and investing in clinical trials for new therapies and diagnostic tests. In communities that lacked radiologists to read X-rays, USAID also funded portable X-ray systems that use artificial intelligence to make diagnoses.

Additionally, the agency helped countries procure drugs at lower costs, in part by funding the Global Drug Facility, a group that negotiates drug prices with suppliers.

Many of those efforts came to a halt when the Trump administration stripped the agency down to bare bones. After firing or furloughing contractors in January, the administration laid off 1,600 staffers, then placed thousands more on administrative leave last month. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that the administration had canceled 83% of USAID programs after a six-week review, and that the remaining programs would be absorbed by the State Department.

In January, Rubio had issued a waiver allowing USAID’s lifesaving humanitarian programs — including tuberculosis prevention and treatment — to continue, despite a 90-day freeze on foreign aid. But in a memo to staffers last month, a USAID official said that nearly all of the funding needed to keep those programs going had been terminated.

The official warned of “preventable death, destabilization, and threats to national security on a massive scale,” then was placed on administrative leave after sending the memo.

The downsizing of USAID has been part of the broader effort to reduce federal spending led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk said on X last month that he was “feeding USAID into the wood chipper,” and that he and Trump agreed the agency should be shut down.

So far, federal judges have denied requests from USAID staffers and contractors to continue their work while lawsuits challenging their terminations play out. The Supreme Court on Wednesday, however, said the Trump administration had to pay USAID contractors $2 billion for work already completed.

The WHO has a goal to reduce tuberculosis cases by 80% and deaths by 90% by 2030. That was already aspirational but is even further out of sight now, said Dr. Priya Shete, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco.

USAID played a significant role in getting diagnostic tools and treatments over the “last mile” to patients, Shete said. That included finding ways to transport drugs when road conditions were poor and funding mobile clinics that offered X-rays and bacterial testing.

“The loss of resources to get across the finish line is what’s really disturbing to some people, and will end up costing millions of lives potentially,” she said.

Experts worry the disruption to clinical trials will also hinder the development of treatments for drug-resistant infections and of new ways to detect cases in children, who are often hard to diagnose.

“The innovations do come back and benefit the U.S., as well,” Davis said.

Canada's Incoming PM Carney Faces Trump, Tariffs and Looming Election

By David Ljunggren and Anna Mehler Paperny

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Former central banker Mark Carney claimed a landslide victory on Sunday to lead Canada's Liberal Party and become its next prime minister, setting him up for a clash with the Trump administration.

Liberal party members bet on Carney as the man best placed to take on U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened annexation as well as launching a trade war and punishing tariffs on the longtime ally.

Liberal sources say Carney - who arrived on Parliament Hill on Monday to meet outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - will soon call for a general election.

""The Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country ... if they succeed, they will destroy our way of life,"" Carney said in his acceptance speech late Sunday.

Carney, who supports dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs in response to Trump's measures, could speak to Trump as early as Monday, Politico said.

Carney, who has no political experience, is normally more reserved than Trudeau, who often had a combative relationship with Trump.

The United States is due to slap a 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum on Wednesday. Ottawa imposed a 25% tariff on C$30 billion worth of U.S. imports when Trump last month announced his initial tariff plans.

""My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect,"" Carney said on Sunday.

Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said on Monday it was imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to New York state, Michigan and Minnesota in protest.

""President Trump's tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They're making life more expensive for American families and businesses,"" Premier Doug Ford said in a statement.

""Until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario won't back down.""

Ford told reporters that he would not hesitate to cut off electricity exports if need be. The surcharge affects power exports to 1.5 million homes in the three U.S. states.

Trump's move to impose tariffs has triggered an angry backlash in Canada, where provinces pulled U.S. alcohol off the shelves and urged people to buy Canadian.

MAINTAINING MOMENTUM

Carney won with 86% of the votes cast by party members. The Governor General, the representative of Britain's King Charles in Canada, will soon invite him to form a government and formally replace Trudeau as prime minister.

The Globe and Mail newspaper said the official handover could take place on Thursday or Friday.

The reconstituted Liberal government is likely to be short-lived. If Carney does not call an election, his political opponents have said they would defeat the government at their first opportunity when Parliament reconvenes in late March.

For months the opposition Conservatives led in the polls, often by double-digits ahead of the governing Liberals.

However, the political landscape shifted with the return of Trump to the White House, the prospect of tariffs and the threat of annexation. This coincided with a surge of support for the Liberals, who have ridden a wave of renewed national unity to come neck-and-neck with the opposition party, according to the latest polls.

Now the challenge will be to maintain that momentum and convince Canadians to give a party that spent a decade in power another go - while fighting a trade war on multiple fronts.

""Without overstating it, the challenges are almost unique in Canadian history, if not unique in the post-war period,"" said Cameron Anderson, a politics professor at Western University.

Carney, former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, will be the first person to become Canada's prime minister with no prior experience in electoral politics.

He has promised to scrap an unpopular consumer tax on carbon, stop a planned increase in the capital gains tax and pledged to remove barriers to trade within Canada.

Liberals sought to compare Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre to Trump in a recent advertisement. Poilievre in turn ramped up attacks on Carney on Sunday.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday the United States was cancelling 83 percent of programs at the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in January demanding a freeze on all US foreign aid to give his administration time to assess overseas spending, with an eye to gutting programs not aligned with his ""America First"" agenda.

""After a 6 week review we are officially cancelling 83% of the programs at USAID,"" Marco Rubio said on social media platform X.

""The 5,200 contracts that are now cancelled spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States,"" he added.

USAID distributes US humanitarian aid around the world, with health and emergency programs in around 120 countries.

The State Department, which oversees USAID, had announced on February 26 its intention to cut 92 percent of the agency's program funding, identifying 5,800 grants to be eliminated.

Marco Rubio on Monday notably thanked the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which billionaire Elon Musk is leading in a drive to slash costs and cut jobs across government departments.



Trump and his allies have argued that foreign assistance is wasteful and does not serve US interests.

But aid groups argue much of the assistance supports US interests by promoting stability and health overseas, and warn that cutting aid threatens the lives of vulnerable people.

New Delhi: Brazil’s incoming COP30 presidency has urged countries to view the November climate summit as a crucial turning point for global action, invoking the football concept of “virada” — fighting back when defeat seems almost certain.

In a vision document presented on Monday, COP30 President-Designate André Aranha Corrêa do Lago outlined plans to revitalise climate efforts amid significant setbacks, including the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and disappointing finance commitments at last year’s talks.

“Together, we can make COP30 the moment we turn the game around, when we put into practice our political achievements and our collective knowledge to change the course of the next decade,” the document states.

The summit faces unprecedented challenges as it will be “the first to undeniably take place at the epicentre of the climate crisis,” according to the Brazilian presidency. January 2025 marked the warmest month on record globally, continuing a trend after 2024 became the first calendar year with average global temperatures exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

February was the third-highest on record.

Adding to the urgency, the Financial Stability Board – the international body that monitors the global financial system – reported in January that climate shocks can threaten world financial stability. The summit will also be the first hosted in the Amazon, described as “one of the world’s most vital ecosystems, now at risk of reaching an irreversible tipping point, according to scientists.”

COP30, scheduled to be held in Belém in the Amazon region, will coincide with significant climate agreement anniversaries — 20 years since the Kyoto Protocol entered into force and a decade since the adoption of the Paris Agreement.

The Brazilian presidency plans to focus on pushing countries to submit climate plans aligned with limiting warming to 1.5°C and implementing the “Baku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3T” finance framework agreed at COP29, which it describes as “a fulcrum for leveraging finance to low-carbon and climate-resilience pathways in developing countries.”

While acknowledging that NDCs are “nationally determined and hence not subject to multilateral negotiations,” Brazil promised to “stimulate a frank collective reflection on bottlenecks that have been hampering climate ambition and implementation.”

“We will be judged in the future by our willingness to firmly respond to the growing climate crisis,” the document warns. “Lack of ambition will be judged as lack of leadership as there will be no global leadership in the 21st century that is not defined by climate leadership.”

The presidency called for “ambitious NDCs that privilege quality as a follow-up to legal obligations under the Paris Agreement,” urging countries to turn their climate plans “into platforms for a prosperous future that enshrine national determination to contribute and transform.”

Progress has notably slowed this year, with most G20 members including China, India, and the European Union missing the February deadline to update their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) for 2035. Only a handful of countries including Canada, Japan, Brazil, the UK and UAE have submitted updated targets.

These delays follow a contentious conclusion to COP29 in Baku, where developed countries’ offer of $300 billion in annual climate finance by 2035 was widely criticised as inadequate. The amount fell well short of the $600 billion sought by some developing nations.

India led opposition to the finance package, with negotiator Chandni Raina stating during the closing plenary: “We are extremely disappointed. Trust is the basis for all action and this incident is indicative of a lack of trust.”

Further complicating global climate efforts, U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered America’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and the rollback of key climate policies. The US is responsible for approximately 20% of historical CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2022, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.

The Brazilian presidency invoked the indigenous concept of “mutirão” — a community coming together to work on a shared task — in its call for renewed collaboration. The document concludes that “2025 must be the year we channel our sadness and indignation towards constructive collective action” while warning that “change is inevitable – either by choice or by catastrophe.”

Toronto: Former central banker Mark Carney coasted to a landslide victory on Sunday to become the new leader of the ruling Liberal Party, paving the way for him to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada’s prime minister.

Carney, 59, garnered nearly 86% of the approximately 152,000 votes cast by registered party members. His closest rival, former deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, could only manage 8% support in the leadership race.

In his victory speech at the Roger’s Centre in Ottawa on Sunday, Carney focused his attention on the threat posed to Canada by US President Donald Trump, as he said the country faced “dark days.”

“We needed big changes, guided by strong Canadian values,” he said, in order to confront Trump. “I will use those values again as we face the most serious threat in a generation,” he stressed.

“Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country,” he warned, adding, “He’s attacking Canadian families, workers and business and we cannot let him succeed, and we won’t.”

Carney also attacked his principal rival, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, but also adopted several policies that the opposition has backed in the last year, including eliminating a consumer carbon tax, stopping a hike in capitals gains tax, reducing Government spending and building energy pipelines.

Carney, who will celebrate his 60th birthday next Sunday, is expected to be sworn in as Canada’s 24th PM during the course of the week ahead as Trudeau demits office after over nine years at the helm in Ottawa.

Carney is expected to call for early federal elections, which could take place in late spring instead of as scheduled in October. He repeated used the phrase “Canada Strong” which could be his slogan.

“Canadians want positive leadership that will end division and held us build together,” he stressed, adding that meant creating a “stronger economy” creating “new trading relationships with reliable trading partners” and securing the country’s borders.

Carney also thanked Trudeau, who was in the arena, for his “hard work” and “service” to Canada.

Max Cameron, professor of political science at the University of British Columbia, felt Carney would take the party to the centre. “He’s not, in any way, a radical. He’s fiscally conservative and socially liberal,” he said.

Professor Cameron said the Liberals’ electoral fortunes appeared to have turned since Trudeau’s resignation and part of that could be because Carney came into the picture. Being a “new face” could help him but in leading the party into federal elections, he was “untested in electoral terms.”

“Can he really connect with voters?” was the question Cameron said will determine his political future specially since Carney has never fought or won an election.

Former British Columbia premier Ujjal Dosanjh felt that Carney “is a good thing happening to Canada.” He said the country needed to move to the centre and away from the “excessive pandering” by Trudeau that led to a “splintering of society.”

Dosanjh, also a former federal cabinet minister from the Liberal Party, said he expected Carney to practice “economic pragmatism” while “enhancing social cohesion.” He said Carney has already revived the fortunes of the Liberals, which had cratered under Trudeau, though that was, in part, attributable to Trump’s “antics.”

Poilievre and the Conservative Party, as expected, have Carney now as their target. On Sunday, the Conservative leader posted on X, “Liberals are trying to trick Canadians into electing them for a fourth term by replacing Trudeau with his economic advisor, Mark Carney.” Carney has chaired a task force on economic growth that has been advising Trudeau since September last year.

Earlier, Trudeau also addressed the gathering, after being introduced by his daughter Ella-Grace. Trudeau said that “being Prime Minister of this country has been the honour of my life”.

He added, “I’m damn proud of what we have accomplished over the last 10 years.” A tribute to Trudeau played out before he appeared on stage and he reminisced about entering politics 18 years ago, as he first became an MP from Papineau in Quebec, as well as 2013, when he became leader of the Liberal Party, and 2015, when he won his first term as PM in 2015, with the only majority his party enjoyed under his command.

Carney becomes the leader after Trudeau’s 12 year tenure. The winner said that Canda faced “new challenges” which required “new leadership.”

In what will become the campaign theme of the next election, Carney reiterated that Canada faced the “greatest crisis of our lifetimes.”

But, he said, “Canada never ever will be part of American n any way, shape or form.”

The leadership race was precipitated by Trudeau’s announcement on January 6 that he intended to resign once his successor was selected by the party. That process concluded on Sunday, with Canada now looking ahead to a post-Trudeau polity after nearly a decade of his rule.

A month ago, Elon Musk called for Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to be shut down, tweeting: ""It's just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of US taxpayer money.""

It's in keeping with Musk's DOGE initiative, prompting the administration to slash jobs, cut programs and even seek to sever funds for contracts already in progress throughout the federal government.

In the weeks since, Trump administration officials have asserted greater control over the Voice of America's parent, the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Several DOGE aides have been sent to the agency, which has commenced an initial batch of firings of probationary employees at Voice of America. And leaders at other U.S.-funded networks that broadcast overseas fear Musk's grander wish — for a full shutdown — may be coming true.

Those outlets include such storied networks as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia, started up to counter Communist propaganda.

These institutions, unlike the government-owned Voice of America, are separate not-for-profit entities. Yet they are fully funded by the U.S. government through the same federal parent agency.

Were the government to withhold money for any appreciable length of time, ""We would bleed out,"" an official at one of the international broadcast networks said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fear of reprisal.

(NPR has no affiliation with the U.S. Agency for Global Media and typically receives about 1% of its annual budget from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.)

This account is based on interviews with 12 people with knowledge of developments at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which is the federal agency that oversees all these international broadcasters and distributes money to them. All spoke on condition they not be named for fear of recrimination, given the backdrop of government firings and budget cuts. The agency did not reply to two requests for comment for this story.

The networks' mission is to deliver news coverage and cultural programming to places where a free press is threatened or doesn't exist. They are also designed as a form of soft diplomacy, by modeling independent journalism that incorporates dissent from government policy. Together, according to the agency, the networks reach 420 million people in 63 languages and more than 100 countries each week.

That comes with diplomatic complications. The reporting of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has vexed autocratic-minded leaders in Russia and Hungary as well as their allies. The networks' journalists have been imprisoned or detained in Russian-controlled Crimea, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Russia itself.

The network's Farda news service reports intensely on life in Iran and is a thorn in the side of the regime there. The Iranian government, a sworn enemy of the U.S. and frequent irritant to President Trump, is allied with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In December, the regime sentenced former Radio Farda reporter Reza Valizadeh to 10 years in prison for ""cooperating with a hostile government.""

""Clearly, this regime feels threatened by the forces of freedom, including independent journalism,"" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty chief Steve Capus said at the time. ""It's why Radio Farda's mission of providing uncensored news and other programming to the Iranian people is more important than ever. Journalism is not a crime.""

Similarly, Radio Free Asia's reports on the oppression of Uighur Muslims by Chinese authorities helped to bring their plight to international attention. In 2020, North Korean officials executed the owner of a fishing fleet for secretly listening to broadcasts by Radio Free Asia while at sea, the network reported. Authorities brought in 100 of his peers to watch the execution as a warning of the dangers of tuning in.

According to six people with knowledge, officials at the international broadcasters are closely monitoring deep cuts at the U.S. State Department to international relief efforts for which money has already been contracted. (Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.)

They also see parallels to the financial crisis at the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit organization that awards grants to strengthen democracy in 100 countries. Like the networks, it receives a direct appropriation annually from Congress.

The endowment is suing the Trump administration, saying the White House has unlawfully withheld nearly $240 million in congressionally approved funding, the bulk of it already obligated. 

No concrete proof of such broad intentions at USAGM has publicly surfaced. The question of whether the agency could cut off funding for the networks is further complicated by two countervailing facts: Congress directly appropriates money for them, granting the agency only a small degree of latitude to redirect funds; on the other hand, Congress has not passed a budget for the current year in progress, and the current stop-gap measure is set to run out on Friday.

Trump has announced he wants Kari Lake, a former Phoenix local TV news anchor turned two-time unsuccessful MAGA political candidate, to be the next director of Voice of America; hers, by law, is not a presidential appointment. She legally must await the Senate confirmation of Trump's pick to lead USAGM — the conservative media critic Brent Bozell III. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has not yet set a date for a confirmation hearing. Then Lake has to be approved by a bipartisan board overseeing the network; the White House fired its members upon Trump taking office.

In the meantime, Lake is helping to lead the agency as a senior adviser to Trump. She has made conciliatory remarks to the journalists and networks in her official communications, while signaling changes and cuts may be in store.

""I understand the challenges faced by those who cover news both in front of and behind the camera, and I have immense respect for the men and women who do the job with honesty and integrity,"" Lake wrote in a memo to staff obtained by NPR.

""Sadly, journalism is experiencing dark days right now,"" she continued. ""The public has lost almost all trust in the media. For those reading this — it is critical we recognize our agency is funded by hardworking American taxpayers, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet.""

""I am committed to quickly reforming and modernizing the agency into something the American people are willing to support,"" she wrote.

In outside statements, Lake has been blunter. ""We won't become Trump TV,"" she said at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, ""but it sure as hell will not be 'TDS TV.' You can find all the Trump Derangement Syndrome that you want over on CNN, MSNBC, PBS, 60 Minutes, The Washington Post and The New York Times.""

That said, journalists throughout the agency's networks say she has not met to talk substance or her plans with their newsrooms or senior executives. (They spoke on condition of anonymity given a climate of fear.)

Following the DOGE playbook, the U.S. Agency for Global Media has demanded that agency and VOA employees give weekly updates of their accomplishments, in correspondence reviewed by NPR. Several VOA staffers, speaking on condition of anonymity due to fears of repercussions, say there have been offers of buyouts, which they believe will be followed by broader layoffs. 

In addition, the agency has also fired nine journalists at Voice of America who held probationary status. The agency also fired two journalists from the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, which is similarly fully owned by the U.S. government and runs Radio and TV Martí. The agency did so over the objections of Voice of America's senior management, according to three people with knowledge of events, speaking on condition they not be named for fear of reprisal. Voice of America did not reply to requests for comment.

Ostap Yarysh, a host and correspondent for the Ukrainian language service of the Voice of America, was among those fired. He tells NPR that he was pulled in a few hours before his show last Thursday and told not to do any more work. Yarish says the network hired him as a contractor in 2019, but promoted him in 2023 to a full-time employee. He says he was still in the last legs of a two-year probationary period, and hence vulnerable.

""I was given no notice, basically,"" Yarysh says. ""There's speculation this was political retribution. I don't think that was the case. It was just a probationary employee directive and they got everyone.""

He said the U.S. Agency for Global Media first tried to fire him two weeks earlier but Voice of America leaders objected, designating him as an employee critical to its mission. This time, Yarysh says, he received a termination notice saying he had not been designated as mission-critical - despite what news executives at Voice of America said.

During the final year of Trump's first presidential term, his appointee as chief executive of the U.S. Agency for Global Media similarly tried to upend it and its networks. Many of the efforts of then-CEO Michael Pack were overturned in court and found to have broken laws.

Pack's acting vice president of legal, compliance and risk was cited by a 2023 federal investigative report as having failed to observe federal law in several instances. That executive, Mora Namdar, wrote the chapter on USAGM and international broadcasting in Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation's suggested blueprint for Trump's second term. Though Trump disavowed it during the campaign, many of his administration's actions have closely hewed to its suggestions.

In her chapter for Project 2025, Namdar called for consolidation of many of the foreign language services, stricter scrutiny of visas for journalists who are citizens of other countries, and the scrapping of many ""firewall"" provisions intended to protect the journalists who work for the networks from political meddling.

In fall 2020, Pack assigned two political appointees at the agency to investigate senior White House correspondent Steve Herman; it was decried as a witch hunt and found by a federal judge to be an unconstitutional breach of the firewall's free speech protections. Similarly, in early 2021, veteran reporter Patsy Widakuswara had been shifted from her assignment after pressing then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over the January 6th siege of the U.S. Capitol.

Two weeks ago, Herman, was suspended and is being once more investigated over his social media posts of articles critical of the Trump administration. The network also reassigned Widakuswara from her beat covering the White House.

Both moves were said to have been done by the network's news leaders, not political appointees at the agency; VOA's director, Michael Abramowitz is a veteran editor at the Washington Post and former head of Freedom House, the free speech and journalism advocacy organization.

As of this month, Namdar appears to be back on board, spotted last week at USAGM, according to four people with knowledge who spoke on condition they not be named, citing fear of retribution. Namdar is said to be advising Lake.

USAGM did not respond to NPR's questions about Namdar's role at the agency.

At 83 years old, Bernie Sanders has emerged as an unlikely leader of the Democratic resistance to Donald Trump

WARREN, Mich. -- Bernie Sanders is standing alone on the back of a pickup truck shouting into a bullhorn.

He's facing several hundred ecstatic voters huddled outside a suburban Detroit high school — the group that did not fit inside the high school's gym or two overflow rooms. The crowd screams in delight when he tells them that a combined total of 9,000 people had shown up for the rally.

“What all of this tells me, is not just in Michigan or in Vermont, the people of this country will not allow us to move toward oligarchy. They will not allow Trump to take us into authoritarianism,” Sanders yelled. “We’re prepared to fight. And we’re going to win.”

At 83 years old, Sanders is not running for president again. But the stooped and silver-haired democratic socialist has emerged as a leader of the resistance to Donald Trump's second presidency. In tearing into Trump's seizure of power and warning about the consequences of firing tens of thousands of government workers, Sanders is bucking the wishes of those who want Democrats to focus on the price of eggs or “roll over and play dead.”

For now, at least, Sanders stands alone as the only elected progressive willing to mount a national campaign to harness the fear and anger of the sprawling anti-Trump movement. 

He drew a crowd of 4,000 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Friday night. He faced another 2,600 or so the next morning a few hours away in Altoona, Wisconsin, a town of less than 10,000 residents. And his crowd of 9,000 in suburban Detroit exceeded his own team's expectations. By design, each stop was in a swing U.S. House district represented by a Republican.

Sanders, who was just elected to his fourth Senate term from Vermont, conceded that this is not the role he expected to play at this stage of his career.

In fact, his team intentionally waited in the early weeks of the Trump presidency to launch what they are now calling his “stop oligarchy tour” to see if a high-profile Democrat would fill the leadership void. Instead, Sanders — who is not a Democrat himself despite allying with Senate Democrats and running twice for the party's presidential nomination — has people wondering if he's considering another White House bid.

“This is like presidential campaign rallies, isn’t it? But I’m not running for president, and this is not a campaign,” Sanders told The Associated Press. “You gotta do what you gotta do. The country’s in trouble and I want to play my role.” 

Since losing the White House, Democrats across Washington have struggled to coalesce behind a consistent message or messenger to stop Trump's aggressive moves to slash the government workforce, weaken federal oversight and empower tech titan Elon Musk to execute his vision. 

There has been no centralized movement to organize the anti-Trump resistance.

“You look around — who else is doing it? No one,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said of Sanders' efforts. “My hope is that the dam will break in terms of Democrats going on the offense ... We need to take the argument directly to the people.” 

Ocasio-Cortez, a longtime Sanders ally, said she would join him on the road in the coming weeks. She's also planning solo appearances in Republican-held congressional districts in Pennsylvania and New York — and perhaps others in places where Republicans have declined to hold in-person town halls where they might face protests. 

“It’s not about whether Bernie should or shouldn’t be doing this. It’s about that we all should,” she said. “But he is unique in this country, and so long as we are blessed to have that capacity on our side, I think we should be thankful for it.”

Beyond Sanders' tour, angry voters have so far relied on grassroots groups like Indivisible to organize a series of local protests. They have been effective in pressuring Trump's allies in some cases. A number of House Republicans facing angry questions have criticized Musk or questioned the cuts being carried out at his allies' behest.

Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, who has been critical of many Democratic leaders, praised Sanders for stepping up.

“I wish more Democrats were traveling the country, including to red states, to rally the the majority against Musk and Project 2025,” Levin said. “Sure as hell beats (House Democratic leader Hakeem) Jeffries traveling the country for his children’s book tour during a constitutional crisis.”

During last month's congressional recess, Jeffries made two appearances to promote a children's book about democracy. He has also traveled to support House Democrats. This past weekend, he was in Selma, Alabama, to mark the 60th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.

The truth is that few, if any, Democratic leaders have the capacity to draw such crowds on short notice or organize the related logistics on a national scale. The party’s nascent class of 2028 presidential prospects, a group that includes California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, have limited national profiles and they have been reluctant to step too far into the national spotlight so far. 

Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, among the more outspoken Trump critics in Congress, said that Democrats must be better organized. 

“People are desperate to be plugged into action right now. People see the threat. They are anxious and angry and motivated and they want to be sent in a direction to help,” he said. 

Murphy acknowledged that Sanders still has plenty of detractors within the Democratic Party who view him and his progressive policy ideas — replacing private and job-based health insurance with a government-funded “Medicare for All” plan, free public college, and the “Green New Deal” on climate policy — as too radical.

Indeed, it was just five years ago when Democrats coalesced around Joe Biden to effectively block Sanders from winning the party's 2020 presidential nomination. 

“There still are a lot of folks who view Bernie as a danger to the party,"" Murphy said, ""whereas I see his message as the core of what we need to build on.”

Sanders was a staunch supporter of Biden over the last four years but criticized the Democratic Party in the aftermath of Kamala Harris' loss last fall, declaring that Trump's victory was possible only because Democrats had “abandoned” the working class.

United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who introduced Sanders in Michigan, said more Democrats need to ""follow his lead to focus on working-class people and working-class issues.""

“They’ve got to take a hard look in the mirror, in my opinion, and decide who the hell they want to represent,"" Fain said of Democrats. “We’ve been clear as a union, if they aren’t looking out for working-class people, we’re not going to be there for them.”

The voters who packed venues across Wisconsin and Michigan over the weekend composed a diverse group, including some who did not support Sanders’ past presidential campaigns. Most said that Democratic leaders have not done enough to stop Trump. 

“I’m here because I’m afraid for our country. The last six weeks have been horrible,” said Diana Schack, a 72-year-old retired lawyer who attended her first Sanders rally on Saturday. “I am becoming a more avid Bernie fan, especially in light of the work he’s doing traveling around the country. These are not normal times.”

In Kenosha the night before, Amber Schulz, a 50-year-old medical worker, demanded that her party “step up and do something.” 

“Bernie is the only politician I trust,” she said.

Tony Gonzales, 56, an independent from Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, said he's worried that Trump will “dismantle historic American standards” and try to stay in office beyond this term. The Constitution bars presidents from serving more than two terms, even as Trump has suggested he deserves a third.

“It's a dangerous time right now,” Gonzales said. “What Bernie has to say — and the turnout — is important. His voice is still being heard.”

Sanders delivered the same fiery populist message over the weekend that he has for decades, seizing on the nation's economic inequality to call for free health care, free public higher education and stronger social safety net programs. Sanders was especially focused on the team of billionaires Trump has appointed to serve as leaders in his administration, including Musk and a half dozen others. 

“They want to dismantle the federal government and cut programs that working people desperately need,"" Sanders warned. 

“Yes, the oligarchs are enormously powerful. They have endless amounts of money. They control our economy. They own much of the media, and they have enormous influence over our political system,” he continued. “But from the bottom of my heart, I believe that if we stand together, we can beat them.”

It’s unclear how long that Sanders, an octogenarian who was hospitalized for a heart condition during his 2020 campaign, will continue in this role. A spokesperson said Sanders hasn't had any health issues since the 2019 episode. 

He is not expected to slow down anytime soon. Sanders is leaning on his 2020 presidential campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, to organize his stops, backed by a handful of former presidential campaign staffers working on a contract basis. 

Shakir, who lost his bid to become the new chair of the Democratic National Committee, acknowledged strategic differences within the party about how best to combat Trump.

Last month, veteran political strategist James Carville penned an opinion piece calling for Democrats to “roll over and play dead,” betting that Trump and his party would ultimately suffer a political backlash from voters for going too far. 

“One theory is you can play dead; you can strategically retreat,” Shakir said. “Or, you play alive, and you go out to people and you talk to them with conviction and integrity.”

National Review editor-in-chief Rich Lowry discusses how the Trump campaign can respond to Vice President Kamala Harris' changing stances on key issues on 'America Reports.'

The U.S. Postal Service unveiled a new postage stamp Thursday featuring conservative icon William F. Buckley, Jr., the founder of the conservative editorial magazine National Review. 

Buckley, a leading voice for the modern conservative movement, founded National Review in 1955 to publish conservative commentary and analysis focused on politics, current events and culture. The magazine still exists today and publishes 12 magazines annually, in addition to its daily news site. 

The stamp features a graphite and charcoal portrait of Buckley, drawn by Dale Stephanos, according to the U.S. Postal Service. 

Historian George Nash described Buckley as ""arguably the most important public intellectual in the United States in the past half century"" in 2008 following Buckley’s death. 

""For an entire generation he was the preeminent voice of American conservatism and its first great ecumenical figure,"" Nash wrote in National Review. 

The magazine forged together several ideological branches and provided an outlet for views including free-market capitalism, libertarianism, traditionalism and anti-communism, according to the Bill of Rights Institute.

In addition to spearheading National Review, Buckley also hosted the Emmy Award–winning television program ""Firing Line"" from 1966 to 1999, which became well-known for its ideological diversity of guests ranging from former President Ronald Reagan, former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, economist Friedrich Hayek, scholar Noam Chomsky and liberal author Gore Vidal. 

""The success and long run of Firing Line proved that there was a place on television for civilized debate between conflicting ideologies that could entertain and inform the American public,"" according to Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. 

The public policy think tank, led by former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, houses a massive videotape collection of ""Firing Line’s"" more than 1,500 episodes, in addition to program preparation materials, photographs, transcripts and sound recordings. 

Buckley, a devout Catholic, also authored dozens of books, including ""God and Man at Yale: The Superstitions of ‘Academic Freedom,’"" published in 1951, about his experience attending Yale University. The book offered a harsh assessment of Yale’s secular academic climate, and Time magazine cited it in 2011 as one of the top 100 ""best and most influential"" books written in English since 1923.

New York Times columnist David Brooks, who launched his career as an intern with National Review, wrote after Buckley’s death in 2008 that Buckley’s ""greatest talent was friendship,"" and that the conservative icon was an avid writer of letters.

""His second great talent was leadership,"" Brooks wrote in the New York Times. ""As a young man, he had corralled the famously disputatious band of elders who made up the editorial board of National Review. He changed the personality of modern conservatism, created a national movement and expelled the crackpots from it.""

""He loved liberty and felt it must be constrained by the invisible bonds of the transcendent order,"" Brooks wrote.

President Trump may want more than the long-anticipated minerals and economic partnership deal to end the pause he has put on U.S. military and intelligence support for Ukraine in its war against Russia, but his specific terms for restarting aid remain murky.

""The president of the United States did not say it has ended. He said it is paused. That is transitional,"" U.S. envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg told Margaret Brennan in conversation at Council on Foreign Relations on Thursday. The envoy indicated he personally was unaware of what would determine that decision.

""That's his call. And I would leave it up to him to make the decision when he thinks it's equitable or when a pause should be lifted,"" Kellogg added. 

Diplomatic sources told CBS News on Sunday that there is no indication that U.S. aid will be switched back on.

""I think we can see the impact. It's certainly, on the one hand, emboldened Russia to really step up the attacks. And it's also not just blindsided, but also partially blinded Ukraine,"" said Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the U.S. National Security Council during Mr. Trump's first administration, on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.""

""And frankly, I think it's going to be an impetus to other allies to start stepping up their own capabilities and questioning themselves about the virtues of sharing with the United States,"" Hill added. ""I mean, this is a two way street. We have to remember that other countries also share pretty vital information with the United States, even if the scale is not quite the same.""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to meet with Ukrainian officials this week in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for the first face-to-face discussions since the explosive Oval Office confrontation between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that triggered the U.S. cutoff. National security adviser Mike Waltz made remarks Friday in the Oval Office that raised expectations that he would discuss not only reviving a minerals deal but also try to get a ceasefire in place, and ""drive peace home."" Trump friend and envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff separately announced that he'd be part of the team. 

Ukraine's Zelenskyy will not be in the Tuesday meeting. He announced that he would be in Saudi Arabia on Monday, and that a Ukrainian delegation — including key aide Andry Yermak, along with Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, and deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa — would meet with the Americans.

""The fact they are coming here at senior levels is a good indication to us that they want to sit down and they're ready to move forward,"" a senior State Department official told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.

Ukraine envoy Kellogg told Brennan on Thursday that the Trump administration was waiting on what he referred to as Ukraine's ""term sheet"" for ending the war, and said the Russian version had already been received. Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokesperson, said in a statement on Friday that Rubio spoke with Ukraine's foreign minister about ""all sides"" taking steps to secure a sustainable peace, which would suggest a request for Ukrainian concessions. It is not clear if Russia has offered any at all. Kellogg said that Trump has talked about the potential of Ukraine getting territory back from the Russians, but acknowledged that the U.S. president did not specify which territory.

It is also unclear what would trigger any U.S. pressure on Russia. Mr. Trump posted on social media that he would consider sanctions on Russian energy and banking, but then later said in the Oval Office that Putin's stepped up attacks on Ukraine during the U.S. pause was something ""anybody would do.""

""I don't believe what he said for a second about the sanctions,"" said Fiona Hill on ""Face the Nation."" ""I believe more what he just said there in the Oval Office, sitting behind, you know, the resolute desk.""

""He sees, you know, obviously, the Ukraine- Ukrainians, and he said that in the Oval Office during the meeting with President Zelensky, that he sees them on the back foot, as losing, and he's basically telling them that they have to capitulate. Very clear,"" she continued

Kellogg said Thursday that there was room for further U.S. pressure on Moscow especially when it comes to enforcement of existing sanctions.

""I think it was between one to 10, we're probably at a seven. The problem is with enforcement, we're probably at a three,"" Kellogg said. ""I think the most important thing is the enforcement sanctions, not to serve the sanctions themselves.""

CBS News confirmed via three U.S. officials that the U.S. has paused lethal intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which includes no longer providing coordinates for targeting of Ukrainian strikes for U.S.-provided weapons like HIMARS.

National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency on Sunday confirmed to CBS News it had suspended sharing satellite imagery with Ukraine.

""In accordance with the Administration's directive on support to Ukraine, NGA has temporarily suspended access to the Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery system, or GEGD, which is the primary portal for access to U.S. government-purchased commercial imagery,"" an NGA spokesperson said.

In a statement Saturday, private sector imagery company Maxar confirmed that the U.S. government had ""temporarily suspended Ukrainian accounts"" in its Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery program, which provides Ukraine access to commercial satellite imagery collected by U.S. intelligence.

The Trump administration also halted the transfer of any of the $3.85 billion in remaining military equipment designated for delivery to Ukraine. In addition, the European Command told CBS in a statement that it had been ordered to mothball deliveries of weapons already in transit from past shipments approved by the Biden administration prior to January 20th.

Two U.S. officials confirmed that the government is still sharing some intelligence with Ukraine to allow its forces to protect themselves against Russian attacks. Republican Rep Brian Fitzpatrick, of Pennsylvania, a member of the intelligence committee, told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that lawmakers would be briefed on the specifics of the Trump intel cutoff this coming week.

Margaret Brennan is moderator of ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" on CBS. Based in Washington, D.C., Brennan is also the Network's chief foreign affairs correspondent and a contributing correspondent to 60 Minutes. Additionally, she appears regularly on the ""CBS Evening News,"" leading coverage from Washington when news breaks on the political and foreign affairs fronts.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is signaling that the Trump administration has finished its six-week dismantling of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development

WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday the Trump administration had finished its six-week purge of programs of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development, and said he would move the 18% of aid and development programs that survived under the State Department.

Rubio made the announcement in a post on X. It marked one of his relatively few public comments on what has been a historic shift away from U.S. foreign aid and development, executed by Trump political appointees at State and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency teams.

Rubio in the post thanked DOGE and “our hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform” in foreign aid.

President Donald Trump on Jan. 20 issued an executive order directing a freeze of foreign assistance funding and a review of all of the tens of billions of dollars of U.S. aid and development work abroad. Trump charged that much of foreign assistance was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.

Rubio's social media post Monday said that review was now “officially ending,"" with some 5,200 of USAID's 6,200 programs eliminated.

Those programs “spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States,” Rubio wrote.

“In consultation with Congress, we intend for the remaining 18% of programs we are keeping ... to be administered more effectively under the State Department,” he said. Democratic lawmakers and others call the shutdown of congressionally-funded programs illegal, saying such a move requires Congress' approval.

The State Department in one of multiple lawsuits it is battling over its rapid shutdown of USAID had said earlier this month it was killing more than 90% of USAID programs. Rubio gave no explanation for why his number was lower, and no details of what programs were spared or how the State Department would run them.

The dismantling of USAID that followed Trump's order upended decades of policy that humanitarian and development aid abroad advanced U.S. national security by stabilizing regions and economies, strengthening alliances and building goodwill. 

In the weeks after Trump's order, one of his appointees and transition team members, Pete Marocco, and Musk pulled USAID staff around the world off the job through forced leaves and firings, shut down USAID payments overnight and terminated aid and development contracts by the thousands. 

Contractors and staffers running efforts ranging from epidemic control to famine prevention to job and democracy training stopped work. Aid groups and other USAID partners laid off tens of thousands of their workers in the U.S. and abroad.

Lawsuits brought by some of the nonprofit groups and businesses that had partnered with USAID say the form-letter contract terminations purge eliminated even programs that Rubio had said he wanted to save, violated the contract terms and stiffed aid groups and businesses of billions of dollars.

The shutdown has left many USAID staffers and contractors and their families still overseas, many of them awaiting U.S.-paid back payments and travel expenses back home.

The U.S. stock market’s sell-off is worsening Monday as Wall Street questions how much pain President Donald Trump is willing for the economy to endure in order to get what he wants.

The S&P 500 was down 2.1 per cent in midday trading, coming off its worst week since September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 405 points, or 0.9 per cent, as of 11:20 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 3.6 per cent lower.

The main measure of the U.S. stock market is on track for a seventh swing of more than one per cent, up or down, in the last eight days following a scary stretch dominated by Trump’s on -and- off -again tariffs. The worry is that the whipsaw moves will either hurt the economy directly or create enough uncertainty to drive U.S. companies and consumers into an economy-freezing paralysis. The S&P 500 is down eight per cent from its all-time high set on Feb. 19.

The economy has already given some signals of weakening, mostly through surveys showing increased pessimism. And a widely followed collection of real-time indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests the U.S. economy may already be shrinking.

Asked over the weekend whether he was expecting a recession in 2025, Trump told Fox News Channel: “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing.” He then added, “It takes a little time. It takes a little time.”

Trump says he wants to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, among other reasons he’s given for tariffs. His Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has also said the economy may go through a “detox” period as it weans itself off an addiction to spending by the government.

The U.S. job market is still showing stable hiring at the moment, to be sure, and the economy ended last year running at a solid rate. But economists are marking down their forecasts for how the economy will perform this year.

At Goldman Sachs, for example, David Mericle cut his estimate for U.S. economic growth to 1.7 per cent from 2.2 per cent for the end of 2025 over the year before, largely because tariffs look like they’ll be bigger than he was previously forecasting.

He sees a one-in-five chance of a recession over the next year, raising it only slightly because “the White House has the option to pull back policy changes” if the risks to the economy “begin to look more serious.”

“There are always multiple forces at work in the market, but right now, almost all of them are taking a back seat to tariffs,” according to Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.

The worries hitting Wall Street have so far been hurting some of its biggest stars the most. Big Tech stocks and companies that rode the artificial-intelligence frenzy in recent years have slumped sharply.

Nvidia fell another 4.9 per cent Monday to bring its loss for the year so far to 20.2 per cent. It’s a steep drop-off from its nearly 820 per cent surge over 2023 and 2024.

Elon Musk’s Tesla fell 8.7 per cent to deepen its loss for 2025 to more than 40%. After getting an initial post-election bump on hopes that Musk’s close relationship with Trump would help the electric-vehicle company, the stock has since slumped on worries that its brand has become intertwined with Musk. Protests against the U.S. government’s efforts to cull its workforce and other moves have targeted Tesla dealerships, for example.

Stocks of companies that depend on U.S. households feeling good enough about their finances to spend also tumbled sharply. United Airlines lost 8.3 per cent, and cruise-ship operator Carnival fell 8.2 per cent.

It’s not just stocks struggling. Investors are sending prices lower for all kinds of investments whose momentum had earlier seemed nearly impossible to stop at times, such as bitcoin. The cryptocurrency’s value has dropped back toward US$80,000 from more than US$106,000 in December.

Instead, investors have been herding into U.S. Treasury bonds as they look for things whose prices can hold up better when the economy is under pressure. That has sent prices for Treasurys sharply higher, which in turn has sent down their yields.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled again to 4.21 per cent from 4.32 per cent late Friday. It’s been dropping since January, when it was approaching 4.80 per cent, as worries about the economy have grown. That’s a major move for the bond market.

All the uncertainty, though, hasn’t shut down dealmaking on Wall Street. Redfin’s stock jumped 68.1% after Rocket said it would buy the digital real estate brokerage in an all-stock deal valuing it at US$1.75 billion. Rocket’s stock sank 14.9 per cent.

ServiceNow fell 6.3 per cent after the AI platform company said it was buying AI-assistant maker Moveworks for US$2.85 billion in cash and stock.

In stock markets abroad, European indexes largely fell following a mixed session in Asia.

Indexes fell 1.8 per cent in Hong Kong and 0.2 per cent in Shanghai after China said consumer prices fell in February for the first time in 13 months. It’s the latest signal of weakness for the world’s second-largest economy, as persistent weak demand was compounded by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.

A 15-year-old Wisconsin boy accused of killing his mother claims he was inspired by a Netflix documentary about the Menendez brothers.

Reed Gelinskey will be tried as an adult for the March 4 killing of his mother, Suzanne Gelinskey, at their home in Caledonia, Wis., according to a criminal complaint.

The complaint says Gelinskey sent a photo of his deceased mother lying on her back to a girl on Snapchat, which led to her call the Caledonia Police Department. When officers arrived at the Gelinskey home, the complaint states that he was sitting on the front stoop of the house in bloody clothing while holding onto a knife.

“She is dead,” he told officers, according to the complaint. “She is dead from what I did.”

Just before the killing, Gelinskey told officers he was watching the Menendez brothers documentary, about the 1989 double murder, on Netflix.

“Gelinskey stated he then developed the plan to kill his parents. He stated it came to him while he watched the ‘shotgun scene,'” referencing the beginning of Monsters: The Lyle And Erik Menendez Story — a recreated scene depicting Lyle and Erik Menendez gunning down their parents in their California living room.

The complaint says Gelinskey “felt depression and an urge to kill his parents” and that he had been taking his brother’s anxiety medication for about a month.

Gelinskey told officers that he hid his sleeping medication and asked his mother to help search for it. When she turned her back, he allegedly “struck his mother over the head with a dumbbell in an attempt to knock her out so he could stab her with the knife.”

He then shoved his mother to the floor and jumped on top of her with the knife in his hand, the complaint states.

He allegedly stabbed his mother five times, three in the chest and twice in the neck, according to the complaint.

“Gelinskey stated his mother asked him, ‘Why?’ and he replied, ‘pain,'” the complaint reads.

Suzanne Gelinskey was found unresponsive “on the ground in the foyer near the front entrance with apparent stab wounds and blood-soaked clothing,” according to the complaint.

“Gelinskey stated he searched the home for a hammer because he was going to kill his father when he came home from work but could not find one large enough,” the complaint adds.

Reed Gelinskey’s father, Ryan Gelinskey, appeared at his son’s Friday court hearing by Zoom but did not make any statements.

Gelinskey has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide and faces life imprisonment if convicted.

A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Wednesday and Gelinskey’s bail was set at $1 million. He was also allowed monitored contact with his father.

Erik and Lyle Menendez have remained in prison for 30 years following the shotgun killings of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, on Aug. 20, 1989, in their Beverly Hills mansion, which captured the public’s attention.

Prosecutors argued the Menendez brothers killed their parents for financial gain. The brothers’ lawyers never disputed that the pair killed their parents, but argued that they acted out of self-defence after years of emotional and sexual abuse by their father.

After an initial mistrial, the brothers were convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Los Angeles County prosecutors recommended resentencing for the brothers in October 2024, arguing that they had demonstrated good behaviour and rehabilitation in prison. They have support from their family, and lawyers have presented new evidence of the sexual abuse the brothers allege they suffered at the hands of their father.

In February, lawyers for the Menendez brothers said California Gov. Gavin Newsom had ordered the state parole board to investigate whether the brothers would pose a risk to the public if they were released after nearly three decades in prison for the 1989 killing of their parents.

The state’s legal standard for parole is whether an inmate poses an unreasonable risk to public safety. That must be determined before the governor can make a decision on commutation.On March 10, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said he’s asking the court to withdraw the previous district attorney’s motion for resentencing for the Menendez brothers, calling their claims of self-defence “lies.”

“We are prepared to go forward” with the hearing regarding their resentencing case, Hochman said at a news conference Monday. “However, we are asking the court to withdraw the previous district attorney’s motion for resentencing, because we believe there are legitimate reasons and the interests of justice justifies that withdrawal.”

The resentencing hearing is set for March 20 and 21.

            The rout on Wall Street steepened Monday afternoon as US stocks plunged and the Dow fell 1,000 points — its largest single-day decline since December.
    


            The widespread selloff was mostly driven by concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on economic growth. In an interview that aired Sunday, Trump said the US economy would see “a period of transition” and refused to rule out a recession.
    


            When asked on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo” if he was expecting a recession this year, Trump said “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big.”
    


            The Dow’s losses equal 2.5%. The broader S&P 500 also plunged, dropping by 3.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite plummeted 4.6%.
    


            Tech stocks were leading the selloff Monday, weighing on the S&P 500 and dragging the Nasdaq into correction territory. As of the afternoon, the S&P 500 was down 9% from its record high on February 19, and the Nasdaq was on track for its worst day since September 2022.
    


            The “Magnificent Seven” of tech stocks — Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) — were all in the red on Monday, driving the broad selloff.
    


            “President Trump’s comments not necessarily taking a recession off the table unnerved investors who were already unnerved,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise.
    


            Tesla was down 14.8% on Monday. After the US presidential election in November, shares of Tesla surged. However, Tesla stock is down more than 44% this year, wiping out its gains since November.
    


            The company’s shares have taken a massive hit in recent weeks amid protests against CEO Elon Musk for his oversized role in the Trump administration, as well as slumping sales in Europe.

            Nvidia fell 5% and Palantir (PLTR), another star of the artificial intelligence trade, slid 10%.
    


            “When stocks overextend on the upside, they overextend on the downside,” said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email.
    


            The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged to its highest level this year. “Extreme fear” has been the sentiment driving markets for the past two weeks, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index.
    


            “This uncertainty has been swirling in the market,” Saglimbene said.
    


            Stocks have been hammered so far this month amid uncertainty around Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff policy. The S&P 500 slid 3.1% last week, posting its worst week since September.
    


            Trump threatened a massive tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico but then announced a reprieve until April 2. He doubled the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20% from 10%, and a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports is set to take effect March 12. In addition, Trump threatened last week to enact a 250% tariff on Canadian dairy products and a “tremendously high” tariff on its lumber. On Sunday he told Fox that tariffs may still “go up as time goes by.”



            “The talk of tariffs is, in a lot of ways, worse than the implementation of them,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group. “The tariff talk, reversal, speculation, and chaos only fosters uncertainty.”
    


            “I do not believe the administration knows how the tariff situation will play out, but if I were a betting man I would say that it will persist long enough to do damage to economic activity for at least a quarter or two, and ultimately result in a deal with different countries that make everyone wonder why we went through all the fuss,” he said in a note Monday.

            And cracks are forming elsewhere: Layoffs are mounting, hiring is slowing, consumer confidence is eroding and inflation is picking up.
    


            The yield on the 10-year US Treasury slid to 4.215% as investors snapped up government bonds, signaling concerns about uncertainty and economic growth.
    


            Looking ahead this week, investors will be attuned to monthly inflation data expected on Wednesday and Thursday to gauge whether inflation remained stubborn in February.
    


            A recession is commonly defined by two consecutive negative quarters of gross domestic product growth. The National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee, the official arbiters, says a recession “involves a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.”
    


            “How long this period of investor caution persists depends on how quickly it will take the global trade clouds, and the resulting threat of recession, to dissipate,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, in a note Monday.
    


This is a developing story and will be updated.

Three separate outages appeared to hit Elon Musk's X social media site Monday, as the tech titan claimed it was suffering a ""massive cyberattack."" 

Thousands of reports of trouble accessing or using the site were first registered by Downdetector.com around 5:30 a.m. ET Monday. It took about an hour before those issues subsided.

Then, around 9:30 a.m., the issues appeared to flare up again, with as many as 40,000 outage reports detected. It again took about an hour for that incident to dissipate. 

Finally, around 11:10 a.m., the issues cropped up again, according to Downdetector. 

A representative for X could not immediately be reached for comment.

On Monday afternoon, Musk posted to X that there had been a ""massive cyberattack"" against the site. 

""We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources,"" Musk said. ""Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved."" 

Though he didn’t post any evidence of a cyberattack, experts said that the outage was consistent with a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, a rudimentary but sometimes effective hacker tactic to overwhelm a website with traffic, effectively knocking it offline.

Isik Mater, the director of research at NetBlocks, a company that tracks global internet connectivity, told NBC News that X had suffered intermittent outages since Monday morning. While establishing a DDoS attack with certainty can be difficult, Mater said Musk’s claim was plausible.

“It’s difficult to be certain, but given the pattern of three observed outages, a denial service attack targeting X’s infrastructure can’t be ruled out,” she said. “It’s certainly one of the longest X/Twitter outages in our records.”

Waymo announced last week that it is logging more than 200,000 paid self-driving rides each week. The company is currently operating in the Valley as well as Los Angeles and San Francisco. 

Not only is this a double of Waymo’s numbers in less than a year, but it is also a staggering twenty-times increase in the last two years.  

https://twitter.com/Waymo/status/1895189359600771169

Waymo One operates around the clock across 315 square miles in Metro Phoenix, offering rides in Phoenix, the East Valley, and Scottsdale. 

Waymo reports that its self-driving system covers over 1 million miles each week. It is now by far the leading autonomous ride service company.

Catching a flight

Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport recently partnered with Waymo, becoming the first airport to offer Waymo’s driverless cars for rides to and from. 

https://twitter.com/PHXSkyHarbor/status/1892298631824208037

The company also partners with Arizona community organizations such as the Arizona Diamondbacks, Phoenix Children’s Hospital, and the Social Spin Foundation. 

Their operations are expected to increase as the company expands its commercial robotaxi services in Austin and Atlanta through a partnership with Uber. Additionally, Waymo will likely launch a commercial robotaxi service in Miami in early 2026.

Hello A-J readers!

Three months in to 2025, Lubbock has already seen some shakeups in the business community. This week brought a review of February developments and a feature on a woman who has made a name for herself in the Landman business.

February was a relatively slow month for business updates, with the A-J reporting on six notable developments over the month. However, it did bring some unexpected losses, with the closures of Cinemark Southwest Lubbock Movies 16 and XD, 5721 58th St., and On The Border Mexican Grill and Cantina, 6709 Slide Road.

I spoke with Kathy Robertson, senior vice president and manager of Oil & Gas Property Operations for PlainsCapital Bank, about her nearly 20-year career as a landman. Robertson told me of her journey into the business, which helps people understand their mineral rights and much more. She also offered some advice for anyone looking to get into the career path.

""I got into it and fell in love with it,"" Robertson said. ""It was a little bit accidental, one of those things where you're in the right place at the right time.""

I have several messages out to companies regarding tariffs at grocery stores, upcoming locations and rumored new businesses. Nothing is on the books yet, but I hope my contacts get back to me in time for the next weekend edition.

AKRON, Ohio — Akron is one of seven municipalities that was selected for the Small Business Boost Initiative.

The city, alongside the national Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, made the announcement Monday. The goal is to connect local, small business support services to the Financial Empowerment Center (FEC) initiative, which is operated by United Way of Summit and Medina. 

""Our small businesses are the heart of our community,"" said Akron Mayor Shammas Malik in a news release. ""We want to help entrepreneurs start and grow their businesses as well as manage their own personal financial journeys. We saw success with the Small Business Boost pilot program and are looking forward to continuing that growth with support from the CFE Fund and Principal® Foundation. They are choosing to support Akron, so it is exciting to support them.”

Akron received a $90,000 grant to support the new initiatives. 

Professional one-on-one finance counseling is being offered through the FEC as a free public service. Business owners and entrepreneurs can call 211 to make a counseling appointment, or click here.

“Small business ownership can be a powerful pathway to opportunity, helping entrepreneurs build financial stability and wealth for themselves, their families, and their communities – but for too many people, personal finances are an obstacle to a strong start,” said Jonathan Mintz, President and CEO of the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund. “We’re thrilled to team with Mayor Malik and the Principal® Foundation on Small Business Boost, which will help entrepreneurs manage their personal finances and better access capital and generate wealth.”

Akron said in the release while owning a business is regarded as a pathway toward building wealth, there are many owners and entrepreneurs that face personal finance barriers that may affect their ability to grow or even start a business. 

Principal® Foundation, a global nonprofit, is supporting the initiative as well to help local business owners improve personal finances and set them up for success.

“Small businesses are the mainstay of our nation’s economy, the pathway to financial security for millions of Americans, and the backbone of our communities,” said Jo Christine Miles, director, Principal® Foundation, and Community Relations. “Principal® Foundation supports organizations and programs that remove barriers and create opportunities for small business owners and entrepreneurs so they can grow their business and build financially secure futures. It’s why we continue to support the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund and its Small Business Boost initiative – a program that has had a positive impact on local small business owners and their communities.”

Akron was among the first municipalities selected in the pilot Small Business Boost in March 2022-2023. That program explored managing and improving personal finances and setting a foundation to build and grow a business. Through the city's participation, this next iteration will use the information from the pilot program to encourage the new initiatives between financial counseling services and small business support programs. There will also be research into the small business client journey and the impact personal finances can have on a business' success.

The city will work with Progressive Alliance, North Hill CDC and The Well, specifically the Akron Food Works team to reach different neighborhoods around Akron. Any small business in the city can join this program. The Akron Financial Empowerment Center has helped more than 3,000 residents increase savings by $3,449,790.

Business owners can schedule virtual, or in-person at either the Medina or Summit locations of United Way of Summit and Medina","{'href': 'https://spectrumnews1.com', 'title': 'Spectrum News 1'}"

PHILADELPHIA & PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Comcast Business today announced the launch of a new multichannel brand campaign, titled “Powering the Engine of Modern Business,” highlighting its capabilities as a global enterprise technology partner. Debuting today, the campaign includes three TV spots depicting real-world scenarios the company has deployed for its customers. The TV spots feature cameos from Billy Horschel, golf legend Tom Watson and Golf Channel’s Rich Lerner, with narration from Josh Brolin. Comcast Business also announced a new two-year agreement with eight-time PGA TOUR event winner Billy Horschel as brand ambassador ahead of the return to his hometown tournament, THE PLAYERS® Championship.





""This new campaign reflects the evolution of the Comcast Business brand as a global technology solutions partner, demonstrating not just what could be possible, but what we’re actively doing for customers across industries today,” said Eileen Diskin, Chief Marketing Officer, Comcast Business. “And as our new Comcast Business brand ambassador, the confidence, swagger and roll-up-your-sleeves mentality Billy brings to the golf course aligns perfectly with how we approach our customers’ needs every day, and our partnership with THE PLAYERS Championship and the PGA TOUR couldn’t be a better launch platform.”



The campaign’s three playfully scripted spots bring Comcast Business’ capabilities to life through a series of vignettes depicting experiences the company is making possible for customers today from small businesses to large enterprises including the PGA TOUR and THE PLAYERS Championship. Narrated by Josh Brolin, the spots demonstrate how Comcast Business helps transform companies into “seamlessly-restocking, frictionless-paying, poke-bowl-ordering, line-skipping” models of service and efficiency. Whether it’s retailers, restaurants, hotels, hospitals – or even the PGA TOUR – businesses all rely on leading connectivity and networking, advanced cybersecurity, and expert partnership. Comcast Business keeps their complex networks running like engines of modern business.

To celebrate the second year as a Proud Partner of THE PLAYERS Championship, the campaign includes a spot dedicated to the PGA TOUR and features cameos from Golf Channel’s Rich Lerner, golf legend Tom Watson and pro Billy Horschel. In his role as brand ambassador, Horschel, an eight-time PGA TOUR event winner and past United States President’s Cup representative, will feature the Comcast Business logo on his hat for the 2025 and 2026 PGA TOUR seasons.



The latest example of what Comcast Business makes possible for businesses is providing the technological backbone of THE PLAYERS Championship, in addition to its role as the Official Business Internet, Voice, Wi-Fi and SD-WAN Service Provider of the PGA TOUR. Comcast Business’ provides connectivity solutions at the PGA TOUR Global Home in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, and at Tournament Players Club (TPC) properties around the nation, including TPC Sawgrass.

Comcast Business “Powering the Engine of Modern Business PGA TOUR”



The new campaign debuts March 10 and includes TV, digital, and social media. Goodby Silverstein & Partners (GS&P) led the creative development of the campaign.



“It’s stuff most of us take for granted,” says Jeff Goodby, Co-Chairman and CCO at GS&P. “Like having the products you want when you want them or being able to enter a stadium with a tap of your wrist. Comcast Business is the backbone of it all.”



Comcast Business “Powering the Engine of Modern Business Small Business Reliability”

COPENHAGEN, Denmark--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Genmab A/S (Nasdaq: GMAB) announced today that Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has decided that it will not exercise its option to receive a worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize HexaBody-CD38 (GEN3014). While the initial HexaBody-CD38 clinical data is promising and showed robust clinical efficacy, following a thorough evaluation of the data, the market landscape, and Genmab’s rigorous portfolio prioritization, Genmab will not pursue further clinical development of HexaBody-CD38.





“While we are disappointed that J&J has decided not to advance HexaBody-CD38, the data confirms the clinical potential of the HexaBody platform, reinforcing its value for future applications,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab. “With EPKINLY® (epcoritamab) moving from strength to strength and two wholly owned assets, rinatabart sesutecan (Rina-S™) and acasunlimab in Phase 3 development, we are confident in the potential of our existing pipeline of innovative antibody therapeutics. Genmab intends to maintain its laser sharp focus on and disciplined investments in our promising late-stage proprietary clinical pipeline and continues to execute against our capital allocation framework ensuring future growth.”



As stipulated by the development and option agreement between Genmab and J&J for HexaBody-CD38, Genmab provided J&J with data from a clinical proof-of-concept study in multiple myeloma, including a head-to-head comparison with DARZALEX FASPRO® (daratumumab and hyaluronidase fihj).



The Phase 2 expansion Part B of the study assessed the objective response rate (primary endpoint) of intravenous HexaBody-CD38 versus subcutaneous daratumumab in patients with anti-CD38 antibody- naïve relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.



Preliminary data submitted by Genmab to J&J, inclusive of 88 patients who received a study treatment and 84 patients who were response evaluable (42 in each arm), demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 55% (95% CI: 39%, 70%) in the HexaBoby-CD38 IV arm vs. 52% in the daratumumab SC arm (95% CI: 36%, 68%); very good partial response (VGPR) or better rate was 29% vs. 17%; and complete response (CR) or better rate was 7% vs. 2%.



Due to the relatively short follow-up time, secondary efficacy endpoints including duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were not mature yet. Treatment emergent Adverse events (TEAEs) above 20% in the Hexabody-CD38 arm were neutropenia, infusion related reactions, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. No new safety findings were observed in the daratumumab arm of the study. TEAEs leading to death included one patient in the HexaBody-CD38 IV arm and two patients in the daratumumab SC arm; none of these deaths was related to the study treatment. Follow-up is ongoing and more mature data will be presented at a future medical conference.



This news does not impact Genmab’s 2025 Financial Guidance.



Conference Call Details



Genmab will host a conference call to discuss this event today at 5:00 PM CET / 4:00 PM GMT / 12:00 PM EDT. To join the call or listen to the webcast, please register using the following link: https://genmab-investor-update-mar2025.open-exchange.net/.



An archived webcast of the call will be available at https://www.genmab.com/investor-relations.



About the 3014-01 Trial



3014-01 is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center trial to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of HexaBody-CD38 as a monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and other blood cancers. The trial consists of three parts: a dose-escalation phase (Phase 1) and an expansion phase (Part A and Part B). The primary objective of Phase 1 is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose and the maximum tolerated dose as well as establish the safety profile of HexaBody-CD38 monotherapy. The purpose of Phase 2 Expansion Part A is to assess the objective response rate of HexaBody-CD38 for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and other blood cancers. The purpose of Phase 2 Expansion Part B is to assess the objective response rate of HexaBody-CD38 versus subcutaneous daratumumab in patients with CD38 antibody naïve relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. More information on this trial can be found at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04824794).

				Sponsorship & Events 

Trinifold Sports Management has confirmed its commitment to women’s golf with the signing of three of Europe’s up and coming talents – Spain’s Carla Tejedo, Italy’s Anna Zanusso and the Isle of Man’s Ana Dawson.

The last two years have witnessed a strong vindication of the Trinifold model for providing long-term athlete development, encouragement of potential, and support within the professional arena.

Trinifold has helped Sam Bairstow finish 36th in the 2024 DP World Tour Race to Dubai in just his second full year as a professional, while Will Enefer completed a remarkable journey from the third tier of the men’s game to rookie status on the DP World Tour thanks to Trinifold’s unique and transparent pathway of opportunity.

Trinifold’s desire to back tomorrow’s champions now turns to the women’s game, and the new arrivals offer excitement for the future.

Tejedo, 24, enjoyed a stellar amateur career for Spain and a decorated spell at Louisiana State University. In 2023, encouraged by a debut in the Augusta National Women’s Amateur, she won both the European Ladies Team Championship and the World University Championship. 

Her potential in the pro game was highlighted when she finished tied seventh alongside her celebrated compatriot and Solheim Cup legend Carlota Ciganda in the 2022 Open de España Femenino.

A rookie on the Epson Tour this year, Tejedo said: “I’m excited to officially start this new chapter in my professional golf career with the support of Trinifold Sports Management. Having a strong team behind me is invaluable and I’m ready for the challenges and opportunities ahead. 

“This journey has been a dream of mine for years, and I can’t wait to compete, grow, and push myself to new levels. I’m looking forward to learning from those around me and making the most of every experience along the way!” 

Her new Trinifold stable-mate Zanusso is also 24 and succeeded Tejedo as World University Championship winner in 2024. Captain of the University of Denver women’s golf team from 2021 to 2024, she claimed three Summit League collegiate titles and carded a course record-equalling 61 in the Westbrook Invitational.  

Her talent impressed no less a figure than the legendary Annika Sorenstam who selected her for the ANNIKA Developmental Progam, an invaluable support network that provides mentorship from the Swedish winner of 10 major championships plus access to Old Barnwell, one of North America’s premier golf facilities.

Zanusso, who is competing on the Ladies European Tour in 2025, said: “I am incredibly excited to take this next step in my professional golf career. I know that surrounding myself with the right people will be key as I start my first season on the Ladies European Tour. 

“This is a dream come true, and I’m ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that come with competing at this level. I’m looking forward to growing as a player, learning from the best, and making the most of this amazing journey!” 

The pair join Dawson, who is relishing being an ambassador for the Isle of Man by being its first golfer to play on the LET as she heads into her third season as a professional.

“After seeing the community and team environment that Trinifold has created amongst the guys I’m excited to have be involved in a similar environment with the girls,” she said. “Golf can be a lonely sport at times, so I’m really excited to get to know everyone else at the company. 

“My main goal for the year is gaining full playing rights on the Ladies European Tour. I’m also super-excited to started a partnership with Hyatt, such a big company who believe in me and see my potential. I’m excited to see where this will take me across the season and the relationship I will build with the company and people in it. 

“I’m also thrilled to continue my relationship with RL360 who have been a part of my journey since I turned professional. I would love to progress to the next level with them by my side. RL360 have a prominent role supporting Manx athletes and it feels really rewarding to be involved with a company like this.”

Jimmy Byers, Chief Executive Officer at Trinifold, said: “There is no price for providing opportunity. It was always in our plans and also extremely important to everyone at Trinifold Sports to replicate our Men’s division for Women in golf. 

“A focus on transition from amateur to professional is key for us and making that step as seamless as possible. Ana Dawson, Anna Zanusso and Carla Tejedo are not just wonderful talents but, more importantly, respectful young people with values and a very genuine appreciation of everyone in their team.” 

Critical to the success of Trinifold has been the involvement of Club de Golf Alcanada in Mallorca. The facility has opened its arms to the Trinifold team.

“Alcanada have been supporting the not-for-profit Golfing4Life initiative and Trinifold for over 12 years now,” explains Byers. “They’ve helped develop some of the great amateurs within our set-up as well as the likes of Sam Bairstow and Will Enefer that have gone on to play the DP World Tour. They have been at the forefront of everything we do in regards to support.

“Hans-Peter Porsche and Kristoff Both have been incredibly welcoming to all of our players, whether that’s 12-year-old Sebastian Duffield who has won the US Kids European Championship for two years in succession and the World Championship in Pinehurst, or it’s Sam Bairstow playing the DP World Tour. Now all the girls are welcomed and that support has been incredible.”

Both himself explains that Alcanada enjoys the relationship. “We have been an unofficial winter base for the German Golf Federation’s teams for 20 years and I remember Martin Kaymer coming here as a 15-year-old boy practising with the German national team,” he said. “We take a lot of pride in allowing these young kids to practice and train at our facility.

“So when I met Jimmy Byers I thought there was the possibility of something similar for Trinifold and it’s worked out wonderfully. Now we have this fantastic story with Sam Bairstow, who made his career jump here in Alcanada in the Challenge Tour Grand Final and he showcases our logo on his golf bag during his maiden year on the DP World Tour.

“When the Trinifold guys and girls come over here to train, it’s always very friendly and polite. It’s kind of like old school golf.

“We like seeing their progress and being a little part of their journey and we like Golfing4Life. It’s about vital qualities: relations with people, giving back, being educated. We appreciate those values and love welcoming Trinifold golfers.”

				Greenkeeping & Agronomy•Interviews 

Héctor Forcén, The R&A’s Sustainable Agronomy Service’s newly appointed agronomist for Central and Northern Europe, talks about his role and the services that he offers to help golf club owners and course managers meet the challenges of maintaining their facilities in this part of the world



Can you tell us about your background and your journey to becoming The R&A’s Agronomist for Central and Northern Europe?

My journey in golf began with a deep passion for the game, which led me to study agronomy to further my career in the golf industry. For my final project studying agronomy, I worked on the construction of a public golf course, sparking my interest in specialising in golf course management skills  which I find valuable every day in my role as an agronomist. 

To develop my expertise, I joined professional associations and trained at Gleneagles, where I gained a strong foundation in greenkeeping. The mix of experience in practical greenkeeping and technical skills from studies has given me a rounded skillset and understanding of everyone’s role in golf. 

During Spain’s golf boom, I worked on several major projects, collaborating with leading designers while furthering my knowledge through specialised turfgrass management studies at the University of Georgia. I then joined a British company on the Tour, gaining valuable experience in global tournament preparation and course conditioning.

In 2009, I moved to Switzerland, where I managed golf course maintenance, consultancy and sustainability initiatives, refining my skills and a particular passion for environmental stewardship. These experiences ultimately prepared me for my current role as The R&A’s Agronomist for Central and Northern Europe.

What do you see as the biggest agronomic challenges for golf courses in Central and  Northern Europe, and how do you plan to address these through The R&A Sustainable Agronomy Service?

The biggest agronomic challenges for golf courses in Central and  Northern Europe stem from climate change, water management and pesticide regulation, and biodiversity pressures.

Climate change is causing drought issues through increased competition for the use of water due to population growth. We also see more frequent extreme weather events, and increased disease pressure because of environmental stress and the demands placed on the turf from golfers. To address this, we promote the development of drought-tolerant turf species through careful management of the golf course environment and maintenance strategies. The successful implementation of appropriate irrigation strategies and integrated pest management practices will be at the heart of success. 

Our access to irrigation water is facing greater restriction due to regulation and public perception. We see inefficient use of irrigation in many situations because of ageing infrastructure.  Supporting clubs in reasoning for upgrading their irrigation systems and becoming more astute with the application of water is one of the main areas of how we help clubs implement actions for raising the standards on the golf course. This may include water recycling solutions and audits to improve long-term sustainability.





Our drive to reduce the use of chemicals is key with regulation tightening and likely to become even more restrictive . We advocate for naturalised areas, precise nutrition, and the use of non-synthetic plant protection products to improve soil health practices and enhance turf resilience. We must ensure that the turf conditioning is healthy and strikes the balance with appropriate and sustainable standards for performance of the playing surfaces. For instance,  soil compaction and nutrient imbalances can also impact turf vitality. We implement soil testing, tailored fertilisation plans and efficient aeration programmes in a well-managed microclimate.

Biodiversity conservation is increasingly important. Our work at The R&A promotes biodiversity using many different strategies in creating pollinator-friendly habitats, incorporating native planting and monitoring biodiversity gains. 

Bringing all of this together in clear and actionable communication is needed for all areas of the golf club and the wider industry. We provide ongoing training through workshops, webinars and field demonstrations to ensure best practices are shared and adopted.

Sustainability is an increasingly significant concern in the golf industry. How will your services support clubs in adopting more environmentally responsible and sustainable practices while maintaining playability?

The R&A Sustainable Agronomy Service is supporting clubs in adopting sustainable practices while maintaining high standards of playability.

Integrated turf management helps minimise resource use and optimising mowing and cultural management practices. We find the balance between intensively managed playing areas and lower-input naturalised zones. We understand the need for setting achievable and optimum standards for each and every course. No two courses are the same either in their environment or resourcing. 

Water conservation is a key priority as already discussed but it’s an important point to reiterate as greenkeeping has come a long way with the introduction of technology such as soil moisture assessment and mapping. We encourage clubs to adopt the collection of meaningful and accurate, measurements to promote the use of efficient irrigation systems.

Improving soil health reduces the need for chemical inputs. We focus on organic matter management, efficient drainage, precision nutrient programmes and productive microclimate conditions to enhance turf resilience. These are intrinsically linked and one will not succeed on its own if the holistic management is not managed with care and understanding.

We also support carbon reduction efforts through minimal-maintenance landscapes, renewable energy adoption and carbon-sequestering practices such as tree and grassland habitat management. 



Which specific innovations or technologies do you believe hold the most promise for promoting sustainability in turf management over the next decade?

Several emerging technologies hold great potential, including:

Precision irrigation using soil moisture sensors and climate-based controllers conserve water by targeting irrigation needs in real-time.

Autonomous and electric equipment reduces emissions and optimises labour efficiency.

Advanced turfgrass breeding has produced drought- and salt-tolerant varieties, which reduce water use and withstand extreme conditions. This will be important for the resilience of turfgrass against increasing disease pressure.

Data-driven management through drones and AI improves turf monitoring and predictive maintenance.

Organic and bio-based solutions – including bio-stimulants, compost and biological pest control – reduce chemical reliance while improving turf resilience.

Carbon sequestration technologies like biochar enhance soil health and carbon storage, and a greater understanding of the benefits of grassland management.

We also see innovation in digital platforms for sustainability tracking, habitat restoration using GIS and drones, and renewable energy adoption for irrigation systems.

These advancements, combined with collaboration and knowledge sharing, will position golf courses to lead by example in sustainability. Our goal is to make these technologies accessible and effective for clubs worldwide.

Wales Golf has launched a new scheme to expand the quality of coaching around the nation, to help develop more talented coaches and young players. 

Golff Coach Cymru provides a high quality and unique face-to-face coach development opportunity to help align the Wales Golf pathway and further develop its coaching workforce.  

“This is really important for the development of our pathway, and a really exciting programme,” explained Gareth Jenkins, Wales Golf Director of Performance and Pathways, . “In the past, there’s been coach development online, but we felt that an additional high-level face-to-face programme will upgrade the coach CPD experience and really help our coaches on their journey to developing talent and longer-term plans with players. This is why we have created Golff Coach Cymru.” 

The 18-month course is aimed at PGA qualified coaches within Wales who want to grow the game and are experienced in working with juniors. The course will be delivered by the Wales Golf national coaching team, and supported by outside experts to explore the complete player journey and their long-term development. 





Included in the course will be all technical, tactical, physical, and psychological elements, and will be covered through a practical approach aimed at adding to a coaches’ understanding and toolbox when working with players. The plan is to develop the next group of coaches who can have a profound impact on talent development, deepening the pool of top coaches around Wales. “Talent can emerge from anywhere in Wales, so the more coaches we have to provide the best development from the start, the better. This is about recognising all the coaches in the pathway and helping each one progress. “We want to talk the same language around our ‘winning skills’ at all levels and develop age and stage appropriate activities which develop brilliant basics and keep players engaged and wanting to improve and compete. It is not just about putting, scrambling, wedge play, driving – it is also about communication and lifestyle – there are a lot of different elements in developing a top golfer. “This coach education plan could be about identifying the next group of coaches in the pathway for whenever our national coaches move on, or it could be about recognising and celebrating the jobs people do now at junior levels. Either way, it is about strengthening the pathway and the support available in Wales. We will choose 8-12 applicants, depending on the quality – all of which must be committed to the programme, prepared to travel, have passion and commitment, as well as an affinity with talent.” Applications for Golff Coach Cymru are now open, with a closing date of March 28. Find out more here.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,Baroness makes the cut at West Essex,https://golfbusinessnews.com/news/greenkeeping/baroness-makes-the-cut-at-west-essex/,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 09:45:18 GMT","

Every blade of grass at West Essex Golf Club is cut by a Baroness mower – the case for the last seven years and one that looks set to stay for the foreseeable future, according to Course Manager Paul Kimber. 

The fleet currently consists of two LM315 greens mowers, two LM2700 fairways mowers, an LM331 for tees and a GM2810 rotary mower for roughs which the team say demonstrate outstanding reliability and cylinders which deliver an industry-leading quality of cut. 

Paul has been at the parkland course on the outskirts of Epping Forest for 37 years, and in the top job since 2018. He explains that the origins of the club’s relationship with Baroness was very much a happy accident. 

“We were welcoming a new head greenkeeper who purchased a suite of Baroness machines, and then didn’t end up actually joining – leaving us with these mowers we knew very little about,” Pual says. “We started using it and that was it, we were sold straight away and have never looked at anything else since. Our team all have experience with various makes of mower and consider Baroness to not only be superior, but also at a more competitive cost point.” 

In particular, Paul notes the quality of the cutting units. “These are just next level. You barely have to touch them to put them on cut, and they then stay on cut forever. They do not wear down easily, robust enough to cut through anything!” The robust theme continues, “The machines as a whole are well built and reliable. We like that everything is mechanical, not electronic, so we can keep on top of routine maintenance ourselves and not end up with graveyards of kit waiting for diagnostic testing or replacement parts.” 

The fleet of cylinder and rotary mowers were supplied by dealer George Browns Ltd who, together with Stuart Gray at Baroness, have delivered second-to-none support and service. “They’re all a pleasure to deal with and go the extra mile to get answers or solutions to any questions we have. It’s just another reason why we’d never look anywhere else.”

Complimenting the mowers is a Baroness SP05A bunker rake which Paul admits the club could now not live without. “It’s one of those few machines where, if it broke today, we’d be ordering a new one tomorrow. We use this machine at least three times a week to brush and smooth the bunkers but, in addition, ours has a front blade which acts like a plough so we can use it for moving and spreading path material.”

He concludes, “Anyone who hasn’t thought to try a Baroness mower, get your hands on one and give it a try. You won’t be disappointed!”

CHAMPAIGN — A downtown hotel that opened a little over a decade ago has been sold to new owners.

Hyatt Place Champaign/Urbana, located at 217 N. Neil St., is now part of the portfolio of ICON Lodging, a hospitality company headquartered in Dallas.

“With spacious guest rooms, thoughtful amenities, and an unbeatable location near the University of Illinois, we’re excited to bring ICON Lodging’s signature commitment to service and excellence to this dynamic community,” the company wrote in a LinkedIn post.

“This acquisition marks another step forward as we continue to grow and deliver outstanding guest experiences. Stay tuned for more updates as we elevate hospitality at Hyatt Place Champaign/Urbana!”

Property records show that ICON purchased the property through an LLC for $18.25 million from YG Hotel Investors LLC.

The company does not appear to be affiliated with Icon Hospitality, the developer on the Hotel Royer project in Urbana.

Hyatt Place Champaign/Urbana opened in June 2014.

Hans Grotelueschen, developer on the project and part of YG Hotel Investors, could not be reached for comment.

The sale of the Hyatt closed on Dec. 16, 2024.

Just a few days later, on Dec. 19, Green Street Realty closed on the purchase of three properties that formerly belonged to Downtown Champaign Holdings LLC, including the building that houses Carmon’s at 804 N. Neil St.

Downtown Champaign Holdings LLC, which is managed by Grotelueschen, had previously reached an agreement with First Mid Bank & Trust for a consent foreclosure on the three sites.

CRS Hospitality now works in collaboration with Green Street Realty to manage Carmon’s, which was previously run by another LLC also associated with Grotelueschen.

An LLC run by developer Hans Grotelueschen is facing foreclosure on multiple downtown properties, including the property at 804 N. Neil St. that houses Carmon's, with court filings indicating that the business's lease may be terminated soon.

""We are excited to officially announce that Green Street Realty is acquiring 802-804 N Neil, 106-108 S Neil and 111-113 N Walnut in Champaign. CRS Hospitality will be working in collaboration with Green Street Realty to manage and operate the Carmon's space.""

Chef Vincent Farro, owner of A Pinch of Love Catering, and New Bern businessman Dale Overbee partnered to bring a pop-up restaurant downtown, Craven Social.

Overbee owns several local businesses like Blackbeard’s Triple Play Restaurant and Bar, Pirate’s Cove Triple Play Seafood and Oyster Bar and Bootleggers and Barrels, which are all located on South Front Street.

Through the partnership, Overbee has allowed Farro to use Bootleggers and Barrels, at 417 B S. Front St., as a venue for dinner and cocktail parties. Bootleggers and Barrels is a bar, brewery and distillery that Overbee opened in 2022.

Farro met Overbee about five years ago when COVID-19 hit and bookings were low with A Pinch of Love Catering

“We do private in-home dinners and it really took off,” Farro said. “But when COVID hit, no one was calling me for in-home dinners.”

Farro said he approached Overbee about an open prep position at Bootleggers and Barrels. Overbee looked at Farro in confusion, wondering why a four star chef would apply for a prep position.

“I told him I would come in every morning and everything I do will be perfect because I can’t help it, that’s what I do,” he said. “He looked at me like, ‘What do you want?

“I said, let me use your kitchen for my catering so I don’t have to go rent or build a space. I’ll come in at 6 a.m., do all my catering, I’ll be out before your staff gets here and you get me as an employee.”

Recently, Farro proposed the idea of a pop-up restaurant to Overbee.

Farro and his wife, Ann, will host one Craven Social dinner each month with a different cuisine each time.

On March 4, they served a four course Italian dinner to 32 guests for the first Craven Social event.

The evening started with a welcome cocktail followed by tiger shrimp and crab cakes on a bed of arugala with a creamy shrimp scampi dressing.

The second course had Italian braised pork served over polenta with confit tomatoes. The third course included cannelloni stuffed with Vinnie’s meatballs and mozzarella cheese topped with a meatball, tomato basil sauce and a crispy prosciutto crumble.

The fourth course was a dessert plate with a cannoli puff pastry pinwheel topped with pistachio icing and pistachio nut crumble.

For the next Craven Social dinner, Farro, joined by a special guest chef, will serve Mexican cuisine.

The dinner will be sometime in April, although Farro hasn’t announced a date yet. He will post information about the Craven Social dinners on his personal Facebook page, Vincent Farro.

“The food is important to me and the way it looks it’s important to me,” Farro said “I’ve done three things in my life and the chef thing just gives me the most gratification of all.

“When I sit here and watch everybody it just makes me happy.”

Before Farro became a chef, he worked as a professional musician and a hairdresser.

In the late 1980s, Farro opened a hair salon in his home state of New Jersey, which he ran alongside a partner for 20 years.

“I owned the largest hair salon in New Jersey, I had 80 employees and 37 hairdressers in one salon,” he said. “Eventually, I was tired of doing hair. There was so much money involved but I didn’t want to just walk away.”

Farro said his business partner bought him out of the salon so he could open a restaurant.

Around this time, the Food Network was gaining popularity and his interest in cooking shows led Farro to explore his own culinary skills.

“I would watch Food Network every night and then run to the store to get ingredients,” he said.

Shortly after Farro sold his half of the salon, he opened a 300-seat restaurant in Princeton, N.J., with no prior experience in the restaurant industry.

Farro and his wife ran the restaurant, which served Italian and Mediterranean cuisine, for about 10 years.

“After 10 years, they raised our rent to $20,000 a month, which was crazy,” he said. “We moved down here 10 years ago, our friends moved and we followed them.”

Farro said that as a musician, he was especially drawn to New Bern due to its large live entertainment scene.

After Farro moved to New Bern, he created A Pinch of Love Catering and used Facebook to build the business.

“I was relentless, every time I made something, even if I made it for myself, I plated it nice and took a really nice picture,” he said.

Farro continues to operate his catering business while expanding into New Bern’s restaurant scene with Craven Social dinner pop-ups.

We are in an era of disruption. The geopolitical context is increasingly adversarial, power is more widely distributed, and relationships among leading powers have become more competitive.”

These are the opening lines of Science Diplomacy in an Era of Disruption, a report published last month by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, based in Washington DC, and the Royal Society in London. The organizations clearly leave no doubt as to why the report is needed, adding: “Scientific values once thought universal are now being re-examined. Trust in science and the use of evidence in policymaking is under renewed attack across the world.” 

US pulls back from gold-standard scientific climate panel

Science diplomacy is the use of science to improve international cooperation, according to one definition. The document updates a report that the two organizations published in 2010, a different, indeed more optimistic, time for international cooperation — talks on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, for example, involving nearly 200 countries, would begin the following year. Today, by contrast, the United States, Europe and China are restricting their areas of cooperation and ramping up competition. Also different is that industry is a more visible presence in science diplomacy than in the past, and firms have resources exceeding those of many governments to promote their interests. “We need a framework on the practice of science diplomacy that recognizes the world for what it is,” the updated report notes. 

The question it doesn’t fully answer, however, is how to do science diplomacy when the integrity of science itself is under attack from national actors, including the elected government of the United States, the world science superpower of recent decades. How, when the legitimacy of global scientific institutions is increasingly being challenged, can science be deployed in diplomacy — for example, to resolve disagreements on global challenges such as protecting the environment or public health? Events even since the report was published suggest more challenges that any new approach to science diplomacy must fully meet.

Drill, baby drill? Trump policies will hurt climate ― but US green transition is underway

Drill, baby drill? Trump policies will hurt climate ― but US green transition is underway

Take the situation with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). As Nature’s news team has been reporting, the United States, a significant supporter of the IPCC, looks to be on a path to pulling away from the underlying scientific infrastructure of world climate policy. For the first time in IPCC history, the United States did not send a delegation to attend a key meeting of the panel, in China, where the themes for the next global assessment report were being decided. This followed separate White House executive orders: one cancelled US funding for the UN climate convention; the other ordered a review of US membership of international organizations. 

Since the IPCC’s founding in 1988, governments representing all systems of political thought have invited scientists to review the literature on climate change. The results of that knowledge have fed into talks to achieve legally binding agreements, such as the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, or the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. IPCC meetings are frequently argumentative affairs for all sorts of reasons. However, and crucially, politicians do not instruct the researchers on which papers to read or what to write in their reviews. IPCC leaders past and present have been supported by their funders to follow the consensus of evidence when coming to a conclusion. The IPCC has experienced many stresses and strains over the years, but the system of governments protecting the integrity of the review process has held. Now, it seems, at least one of the panel’s sponsoring governments is no longer willing to play that part. 

Even if deprived of US input, the IPCC must continue publishing its authoritative reports. But a potential US withdrawal poses a direct challenge to science diplomacy, with a key member of the international community refusing to recognize that science has a role in resolving disagreements on climate action.

One approach to protecting science in diplomacy is outlined in a separate report by the European Union, also published last month. Entitled A European Framework for Science Diplomacy, it recommends that science move closer to the centre of EU policymaking. “There is hardly any (geo-)political development not affected by the output of research and innovation,” it says. Europe’s science, and therefore its scientists, must “become more visible and be at the core rather than at the fringe” of “foreign and security policy as well as research and innovation policy”, it says. 

Such a shift will not be straightforward for researchers. They lack incentives to participate in policy work, as a survey in Nature last year showed (Nature 636, 26–30; 2024). Researchers who do participate are more used to providing advisory evidence, while staying at arm’s length from actual policy decisions. This distance ensures that responsibility for decisions rests with politicians and not their expert advisers, and it has mostly served research well in ‘peacetime’. 

Science could solve some of the world’s biggest problems. Why aren’t governments using it?

Science could solve some of the world’s biggest problems. Why aren’t governments using it?

But now that science itself is being contested, there are persuasive arguments as to why researchers need to be in the room when big decisions are being made on subjects such as climate change, pandemic preparedness or the regulation of artificial intelligence.

If researchers accept the invitation to join the EU’s policymaking high table, their presence might also provide them with a way to protect the ‘science’ in science diplomacy should there be calls for budget cuts or attempts at the kind of interference now being seen in the United States.

One of the EU report’s weaknesses is that it assumes a shared understanding on the part of diplomats and policymakers that researchers must be able to operate without direct interference. The experience of the United States tells us that this cannot be assumed.

If the EU report’s recommendations are to be implemented, one necessary, although not sufficient, step, must be to write researchers’ ability to operate independently into law, as it already is in some countries, albeit imperfectly. 

Science diplomacy is needed more now than at any time in history, given the scale of challenges the world faces. Research is often described as a form of ‘soft power’ diplomacy, a way for nations to advance their national interests without using military means. The first step towards protecting science diplomacy must be to protect science itself.

Researchers from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea have introduced a new approach to reducing the energy demand for cooling buildings. They propose replacing conventional window glass with a specially designed layered structure that efficiently dissipates heat while reflecting incoming sunlight, significantly cutting down on air conditioning costs.

“Addressing global climate change and energy crises necessitate the development of zero-energy and emission-free technologies,” wrote the team in their paper published in Advanced Photonics Research. “Conventional cooling systems, accounting for 20% of global energy consumption, contribute to substantial environmental issues such as air pollution and depletion of fossil fuels.”

The problem with standard glass windows is their poor ability to block infrared radiation, which carries a significant amount of heat. They also fail to shield interiors from thermal radiation emitted by surrounding buildings and do not efficiently release heat to the outside environment. This leads to higher indoor temperatures and increased reliance on air conditioning, driving up energy consumption.

While ordinary glass does radiate some heat its efficiency is limited. They typically do not emit strongly across the entire transparency window, making them less effective for cooling the building interiors.

To address this, the researchers designed and simulated a more complex material called a dual-sided radiative cooling glass. This structure consists of a central layer of ordinary glass sandwiched between sub-micrometer layers of indium tin oxide (ITO), a material known for its ability to reflect infrared radiation, preventing it from entering a building and raising indoor temperatures. 

On the outer surface, they applied additional thin layers of aluminum oxide and silicon nitride, materials that efficiently radiate heat at wavelengths that pass through Earth’s atmosphere. Specifically, aluminum oxide emits thermal radiation at around 13 micrometers, while silicon nitride does so at 8 micrometers — corresponding to the upper and lower bounds of the atmospheric transparency window. By emitting radiation in this range, the heat escapes directly into space without being absorbed by the atmosphere, preventing further warming.

A key feature of this layered glass is its directional emissivity, meaning the angle at which it radiates heat depending on the thickness of the aluminum oxide and silicon nitride layers, as well as the angle of incoming sunlight. By precisely tuning the thicknesses of these layers the design ensures that most of the emitted heat escapes toward the open sky, rather than being absorbed and re-radiated by nearby objects, such as trees or buildings.

Despite its intricate layered structure, the newly developed glass remains highly transparent to visible light, allowing 72% of sunlight in this range to pass through. This means it can function effectively as a window, maintaining natural lighting inside buildings while providing cooling benefits.

The researchers also evaluated the potential energy savings from installing these windows in typical residential buildings. Their analysis showed that, on a hot summer day, the dual-sided radiative cooling glass could reduce air conditioning energy consumption by up to 40%. In practical terms, this equates to a reduction of 1,500 watts — roughly the same power consumption as an electric kettle or an iron running continuously.

While the findings highlight significant energy-saving potential, the researchers acknowledge that further development will be necessary before the technology can be widely adopted.

“Nonetheless, there is still potential to further improve the directional emission intensity,” they wrote. “One promising approach is adjusting the surface structure of the [aluminum oxide and silicon nitride layers]. Such as this approach, further studies are necessary to enhance the cooling performance and the applicability of vertical-oriented emitters.”

They also emphasize the need for real-world testing. “Moreover, further research that fabricates actual dual-sided radiative cooling glass and measures enclosure cooling performance is essential to validate the applicability of the dual-sided radiative cooling glass in a detailed manner.”

If successfully implemented, this technology could provide a practical and scalable solution to reducing building energy consumption, offering an efficient way to combat rising global temperatures while lowering reliance on conventional cooling systems.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=technology+news,VUMC to develop AI technology for therapeutic antibody discovery,https://news.vumc.org/2025/03/10/vumc-to-develop-ai-technology-for-therapeutic-antibody-discovery/,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 13:19:14 GMT","

The approach will address “bottlenecks” that slow the traditional antibody discovery process, and it aims to make it possible to generate monoclonal antibody therapies against any target of interest.

An ambitious project led by Vanderbilt University Medical Center investigators aims to use artificial intelligence technologies to generate antibody therapies against any antigen target of interest. 

VUMC has been awarded up to $30 million from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) to build a massive antibody-antigen atlas, develop AI-based algorithms to engineer antigen-specific antibodies, and apply the AI technology to identify and develop potential therapeutic antibodies. 

ARPA-H is an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that supports transformative high-risk, high-reward research to drive biomedical and health breakthroughs to benefit everyone. 

“Over the last few decades, monoclonal antibodies have started playing an important therapeutic role in a wide range of disease settings, but we’re just scratching the surface. Monoclonal antibody discovery has the potential to impact a lot of different diseases where currently there are no therapeutics,” said Ivelin Georgiev, PhD, professor of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, director of the Vanderbilt Center for Computational Microbiology and Immunology, and the project principal investigator. 

Traditional methods for antibody discovery are limited by inefficiency, high costs and fail rates, logistical hurdles, long turnaround times and limited scalability, Georgiev said. 

“What we’re proposing to do is going to address all of these big bottlenecks with the traditional antibody discovery process and make it a more democratized process — where you can figure out what your antigen target is and have a good chance of generating a monoclonal antibody therapeutic against that target in a very effective and efficient way,” said Georgiev, who is also professor of Biomedical Informatics, Computer Science, and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. 

Antibodies are part of our immune system. They are proteins produced by white blood cells (B cells) that bind to and inactivate antigens — targets on viruses, bacteria and even our own cells. Antibodies are effective as preventive and therapeutic treatments against viruses, cancers, autoimmune disorders and other diseases. 

To identify a candidate therapeutic antibody, researchers generally screen and test thousands of antibodies against an antigen target, looking for the “needle in the haystack” that binds to and neutralizes the target. The traditional discovery process requires specific types of biological samples. For example, to find antibodies against an infectious disease pathogen, blood samples from people or animal models exposed to the pathogen are required. And then, if the pathogen mutates, a therapeutic antibody may become ineffective. 

“With a computational approach, you’re no longer dependent on access to biological samples or multiple screening cycles,” Georgiev said. “You can simulate variants and generate antibodies ahead of time before the variants arise.” 

Georgiev and his colleagues are engaged in three tasks as they work toward developing computational approaches for antibody discovery: 

For the first task, the researchers are using a technology they developed called LIBRA seq (Linking B-cell Receptor to Antigen specificity through sequencing) that enables high-throughput mapping of antibody-antigen interactions for many antigens and B cells at the same time. 

“For computational methods to work, we need to have a lot of data,” Georgiev said. “The scale of data that’s available for antibodies and antigens is lower than in other fields, which has been one of the limiting factors when it comes to developing AI approaches. 

“If we train algorithms on the data that exists currently — much of it is for SARS-CoV-2, flu and HIV — the algorithms may be accurate for these targets, but they are less likely to be successful in extrapolating to a new target. We need to train them with a more diverse set of antigen targets, which is where LIBRA-seq comes into play.” 

The investigators aim for the atlas to include hundreds of thousands — and potentially over 1 million — antibody-antigen pairs, compared to approximately 15,000 pairs currently available from published data, providing an unparalleled resource for researchers worldwide. 

The team is already moving forward on the second task of building computational models, which they will improve as they populate the antibody-antigen atlas. For the third task, they will apply the AI technology to develop antibodies against cancer antigens and bacterial, viral and autoimmune targets. They will select one candidate antibody for preclinical development up to and including IND (investigational new drug) application. 

“Our project will be providing a platform that can be used for a variety of different diseases, not just the specific targets we’re interested in,” Georgiev said. “Our team has spent many years trying to discover antibodies against a variety of indications, and it’s such an inefficient process with a lot of failure. If we can help change that, that’s going to be huge — not just for us, but for the entire field and for people with diseases where antibody therapies can make a difference. 

“It’s going to be hard. It’s not an easy problem, but I think we have a good foundation for it, and we’ll do the best we can to make it work.” 

Collaborators on the project are: Ben Ho Park, MD, PhD, Sarah Croessmann, PhD, Eric Skaar, PhD, MPH, Maria Hadjifrangiskou, PhD, and Jeremy Goettel, PhD, at VUMC; Tedd Ross, PhD, and Giuseppe Sautto, PhD, at Cleveland Clinic; and Maria del Pilar Quintana Varon, PhD, and Lars Hviid, PhD, at the University of Copenhagen. The Brock Family Center for Applied Innovation, a catalyst for advancing translational research to market, has engaged with and supported the Georgiev team. 

Vanderbilt University and VUMC shared resources that are critical to the project are: VANTAGE (Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics), ACCRE (Advanced Computing Center for Research and Education), and FCSR (Flow Cytometry Shared Resource). Wheeler Bio will participate in IND-enabling studies, cell line development and manufacturing activities.

Optimization of a technique developed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center enables rapid and efficient identification of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19.

The discovery, reported in the journal PLOS Pathogens, could help open the door to the development of effective vaccines and antibody therapies with an “exceptional breadth of pathogen coverage.”

Reporting Nov. 6 in Cell Reports Medicine, Ivelin Georgiev, PhD, and colleagues demonstrated that antibodies isolated from children’s blood samples displayed high levels of neutralization and potency against variants of the COVID-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2, even when the children had not previously been exposed to or vaccinated against those variants.

Brazil’s state-owned postal service, Empresa Brasileira de Correios e Telégrafos, is seeking proposals for blockchain and AI solutions to improve its logistics and operational processes. 

The move comes as rising demand for faster and more reliable delivery services places pressure on postal services to modernise their infrastructure.

On Friday, the country’s official publication Diário Oficial da União published a tender notice inviting companies and specialists to submit solutions for digitally transforming Correios’ services. The initiative, Licitação Seleção Prévia e Diálogo nº 25000001/2025 CS, seeks sophisticated technological solutions to improve business operations, supply management, and internal procedures.

Correios is facing significant operational issues, including growing parcel volumes, pressure for faster delivery times, and the need to improve tracking accuracy. These concerns could be addressed using AI and blockchain solutions that automate key processes and improve supply chain transparency.

Correios stated that its goal is to create a collaborative approach to developing AI and blockchain-based solutions to commercial and operational difficulties.

While specific use cases were not detailed, blockchain technology is often used for improving supply chain tracking, securing transactions, and verifying documents. AI applications could enhance logistics by improving data analysis and streamlining operations. Potential AI applications for Correios could include predictive analytics for improving delivery efficiency, identifying bottlenecks in the supply chain, and automating customer service through chatbots. Blockchain technology could strengthen parcel tracking, provide tamper-proof shipment data, and automate customs clearance.

Correios’ interest in blockchain and AI reflects a growing trend among logistics companies to use digital solutions to enhance efficiency and transparency. Major logistics corporations such as DHL, FedEx, and UPS have already shown how AI and blockchain may improve operational efficiency:

AI can analyse massive databases to detect inefficiencies and forecast delivery patterns, lowering costs and improving service levels. Blockchain technology provides a secure, immutable record of transactions, which can help prevent fraud and improve supply chain accountability.

The pre-selection process signals Correios’ broader strategy to modernise its infrastructure and improve service delivery. Other postal services globally have introduced similar initiatives in response to increasing demand for faster, more secure, and efficient operations.

COLLETON COUNTY, S.C. (WCSC) - One man is facing charges and another person is expected to be arrested in connection to the theft of one of the new license plate readers in Colleton County.

A release from the Colleton County Sheriff’s Office states that Timothy McWilliams, 56, is charged with felony grand larceny. He was arrested Friday.

Deputies say they successfully recovered the stolen “Flock Safety” license plate reader camera that was originally stolen last week Tuesday.

The camera is a part of a newly launched “Colleton County Safe” initiative. The technology is expected to be used as a “critical tool for law enforcement” by helping reduce crime, solve cases, recover stolen cars and even locate missing or endangered people.

The charges against McWilliams stem from an incident in which witnesses saw two men wearing traffic safety vests who were removing the camera.

“These cameras are legally installed on private property throughout Colleton County under official agreements. Tampering with or stealing them is a serious offense, and offenders will be held accountable, including facing criminal charges and potential restitution,” the release states.

“These cameras are in place to protect our community, they help us solve violent crimes such as homicides and shootings and assist in finding missing persons. We will not tolerate interference with this vital public safety resource,” Colleton County Sheriff Buddy Hill said.

Deputies say efforts remain underway to identify and charge the remaining suspect.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — When artificial intelligence-backed tractors became available to vineyards, Tom Gamble wanted to be an early adopter. He knew there would be a learning curve, but Gamble decided the technology was worth figuring out.

The third-generation farmer bought one autonomous tractor. He plans on deploying its self-driving feature this spring and is currently using the tractor’s AI sensor to map his Napa Valley vineyard. As it learns each row, the tractor will know where to go once it is used autonomously. The AI within the machine will then process the data it collects and help Gamble make better-informed decisions about his crops — what he calls “precision farming.”

“It’s not going to completely replace the human element of putting your boot into the vineyard, and that’s one of my favorite things to do,” he said. “But it’s going to be able to allow you to work more smartly, more intelligently and in the end, make better decisions under less fatigue.”

Gamble said he anticipates using the tech as much as possible because of “economic, air quality and regulatory imperatives.” Autonomous tractors, he said, could help lower his fuel use and cut back on pollution.

As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce. New agricultural tech like AI can help farmers to cut back on waste, and to run more efficient and sustainable vineyards by monitoring water use and helping determine when and where to use products like fertilizers or pest control. AI-backed tractors and irrigation systems, farmer say, can minimize water use by analyzing soil or vines, while also helping farmers to manage acres of vineyards by providing more accurate data on the health of a crop or what a season’s yield will be.




Other facets of the wine industry have also started adopting the tech, from using generative AI to create custom wine labels to turning to ChatGPT to develop, label and price an entire bottle.

“I don’t see anybody losing their job, because I think that a tractor operator’s skills are going to increase and as a result, and maybe they’re overseeing a small fleet of these machines that are out there, and they’ll be compensated as a result of their increased skill level,” he said.

Farmers, Gamble said, are always evolving. There were fears when the tractor replaced horses and mules pulling plows, but that technology “proved itself” just like AI farming tech will, he said, adding that adopting any new tech always takes time.

Companies like John Deere have started using the AI that wine farmers are beginning to adopt. The agricultural giant uses “Smart Apply” technology on tractors, for example, helping growers apply material for crop retention by using sensors and algorithms to sense foliage on grape canopies, said Sean Sundberg, business integration manager at John Deere.

The tractors that use that tech then only spray “where there are grapes or leaves or whatnot so that it doesn’t spray material unnecessarily,” he said. Last year, the company announced a project with Sonoma County Winegrowers to use tech to help wine grape growers maximize their yield.

Tyler Klick, partner at Redwood Empire Vineyard Management, said his company has started automating irrigation valves at the vineyards it helps manage. The valves send an alert in the event of a leak and will automatically shut off if they notice an “excessive” water flow rate.

“That valve is actually starting to learn typical water use,” Klick said. “It’ll learn how much water is used before the production starts to fall off.”

Klick said each valve costs roughly $600, plus $150 per acre each year to subscribe to the service.

“Our job, viticulture, is to adjust our operations to the climatic conditions we’re dealt,” Klick said. “I can see AI helping us with finite conditions.”

Angelo A. Camillo, a professor of wine business at Sonoma State University, said that despite excitement over AI in the wine industry, some smaller vineyards are more skeptical about their ability to use the technology. Small, family-owned operations, which Camillo said account for about 80% of the wine business in America, are slowly disappearing — many don’t have the money to invest in AI, he said. A robotic arm that helps put together pallets of wine, for example, can cost as much as $150,000, he said.

“For small wineries, there’s a question mark, which is the investment. Then there’s the education. Who’s going to work with all of these AI applications? Where is the training?” he said.

There are also potential challenges with scalability, Camillo added. Drones, for example, could be useful for smaller vineyards that could use AI to target specific crops that have a bug problem, he said — it would be much harder to operate 100 drones in a 1,000 acre vineyard while also employing the IT workers who understand the tech.

“I don’t think a person can manage 40 drones as a swarm of drones,” he said. “So there’s a constraint for the operators to adopt certain things.”

However, AI is particularly good at tracking a crop’s health – including how the plant itself is doing and whether it’s growing enough leaves – while also monitoring grapes to aid in yield projections, said Mason Earles, an assistant professor who leads the Plant AI and Biophysics Lab at UC Davis.

Diseases or viruses can sneak up and destroy entire vineyards, Earles said, calling it an “elephant in the room” across the wine industry. The process of replanting a vineyard and getting it to produce well takes at least five years, he said. AI can help growers determine which virus is affecting their plants, he said, and whether they should rip out some crops immediately to avoid losing their entire vineyard. 

Earles, who is also cofounder of the AI-powered farm management platform Scout, said his company uses AI to process thousands of images in hours and extract data quickly — something that would be difficult by hand in large vineyards that span hundreds of acres. Scout’s AI platform then counts and measures the number of grape clusters as early as when a plant is beginning to flower in order to forecast what a yield will be.

The sooner vintners know how much yield to expect, the better they can “dial in” their wine making process, he added.

“Predicting what yields you’re going to have at the end of the season, no one is that good at it right now,” he said. “But it’s really important because it determines how much labor contract you’re going to need and the supplies you’ll need for making wine.”

Earles doesn’t think the budding use of AI in vineyards is “freaking farmers out.” Rather, he anticipates that AI will be used more frequently to help with difficult field labor and to discern problems in vineyards that farmers need help with.

“They’ve seen people trying to sell them tech for decades. It’s hard to farm; it’s unpredictable compared to most other jobs,” he said. “The walking and counting, I think people would have said a long time ago, ‘I would happily let a machine take over.’”

URBANA — In a world of police TV dramas and mystery movies, technology used in investigations can take on a mysterious feel.

Most of James Bond’s gadgets are pretty obviously fiction, but how much does your average “Law & Order” or “NCIS” embellish the capabilities of policing technology?

Deputy Chief of Police Dave Smysor presented the bulk of the Urbana Police Department’s “surveillance gear” to the Urbana City Council last month, making a point of how it all fit into a single cardboard box.

To outsiders, the technology might have looked advanced, but Smysor said that much of it is widely available … and much of it is outdated.

Smysor sat down with The News-Gazette to provide a rundown of what each piece of equipment is and how it might be used in an investigation.

Voice-activated radio-dispatch alarm (VARDA).

Technically a sentinel radio alarm, Smysor said officers call it by the acronym.

However, he said, he’d be surprised to learn anyone had actually used it in the last five years.

“The technology hasn’t really kept up with the times, so we still have it, but they don’t work the best any more,” Smysor said.

The device works a bit like motion-activated haunted-house props or Halloween decorations: A small laser beam points across from wherever the officers set it up, and if anything moves through to interrupt the beam, the VARDA activates.

Instead of setting off a scary noise, though, it sends an alert over the police radio system.

Smysor said this sort of device would have been used to monitor a location that was especially susceptible to trespassing, vandalism or theft, such as a construction site with no overnight workers.

Since the VARDA doesn’t work so well anymore, Smysor said the department doesn’t really have a solution for that type of monitoring.

Instead, the department might recommend whoever owns the site set up their own alarms or hire security, leaving officers to respond after an incident takes place.

“How old exactly, I’m not sure, but it’s been around,” Smysor said, turning the device around to show an old sticker the department no longer uses to mark its equipment.

In short, it’s a night-vision device that looks a bit like a short telescope and works by amplifying ambient light to help the operator see.

Starlight scopes were first used by the U.S. military in the Vietnam War, and while the technology is generally still considered usable, it’s been surpassed by different night-vision devices.

This one in particular sees no use, “because it doesn’t really work,” Smysor said.

A spy pen, still in its package.

While it looks similar to the Starlight scope, the Forward Looking Infrared Radar scope sees a lot more use, to the point Smysor decided not to bring it to that city council meeting in case someone needed it.

It’s also a night-vision device but with thermal night vision, detecting heat rather than amplifying light.

Most importantly, it works.

“It’s useful at night, if you’re looking for somebody like a missing person or someone hiding in the dark,” Smysor said. “It doesn’t record anything, it’s just a tool kind of like a flashlight to help them see in the dark a little better.”

A mini camera.

A device that is exactly what it sounds like, the mini camera is a very small, commercially available motion-activated camera.

Smysor isn’t aware of any situation in which the Criminal Investigations Division has used the camera, but it is available to them.

Investigations instead often rely on security cameras that have become more common in businesses and private residences, including those like Ring doorbells.

“It takes a lot of time, takes a lot of investigative effort, but it’s pretty frequent that in cases where we’re working a shooting or serious crime or something, we will canvass the neighborhood, looking for personally owned cameras that might be out and about, and then trying to gain the cooperation of whoever might be the owner of said camera to see if they could look at it for us or let us look at it,” Smysor said.

For the most part, he said, people are willing to share that footage.

This is another miniature camera, but it’s disguised as a key fob that someone might use to unlock a vehicle.

A close look will quickly reveal the camera, but it could pass as a key fob to anyone not looking for it.

Smysor said a pretty niche situation would have to arise to use the fob, especially since officers are all required to have body-worn cameras anyway.

This device is another commercially available product that’s fairly common in residential security. Similar devices can be found online for around $15.

If the sensor detects motion, it sets off an alarm.

It could serve a similar purpose as the VARDA, though it only sets off the alarm in a speaker and wouldn’t send a message over the radio system.

If you’ve ever set something up to check out the wildlife on your property or seen one of those internet videos of wild animals acting silly, you’re probably familiar with a trail cam.

Smysor literally blew dust off of the box in order to open it, saying he doubts it has ever been used.

In theory, he said, if officers identified a location that was subject to a high rate of graffiti or criminal damage, they could set the trail cam up to get some images of potential perpetrators.

It’s a straightforward, commercially available device that takes photos or videos when it senses movement. Typically, trail cams have night-vision capabilities since they’re designed to get images of animals that wander nearby.

Spy pen

Another device disguised as something else, this pair of pens are actually audio recording devices.

One appears to have never even been taken out of the box, and Smysor said neither have ever been used to surreptitiously record something.

Audio recording is highly regulated by state law; Illinois is considered a “two-party consent” state, which means that in many situations, everyone being recorded must consent to it.

Any situation which would call for a stealth recording device has the likelihood of being illegal.

That’s actually why the department purchased the “spy pens” in the first place.

In 2022, then-member of the Urbana school district Assistant Superintendent of Learning and Instruction Samuel Byndom left a spy pen in the room where a closed school board meeting was set to occur in regards to employment issues.

Another employee found an email confirmation for his order of the pen and notified police, so the school board was already aware of the situation and found it before the meeting began.

Police had ordered some pens of their own to get a better grasp on the situation.

Byndom was eventually found guilty of attempted eavesdropping; due to the regret he expressed during court proceedings, he was fined and given a light sentence of court supervision and community service, which he successfully completed and saw his criminal record dismissed.

The department still has the pens stocked in a closet with other surveillance gear, just in case a rare situation arises where they would be useful.

Really. They could be considered surveillance gear, so Smysor put them in the box.

These, of course, don’t fit in the box, but they earn a mention as surveillance gear.

In reality, Smysor said these devices have replaced a lot of the other gear that officers might need.

They record both video and audio and are automatically activated any time an officer so much as turns the lights on in his vehicle, so they’re convenient.

What they don’t do is provide eyes or ears on any location officers aren’t already in.

“In my estimation, not very much at all,” Smysor said.

But that depends on what you call “surveillance.”

In a general sense of the word, any time an officer sits in their car and watches an area, that’s surveillance.

Smysor said he isn’t claiming that anyone is trying to regulate the department to that level, but he is interested in a more specific definition of what “surveillance” is of concern.

“It becomes so broad that it just encompasses everything to the point where we’re not able to effectively do our jobs,” he said. “That’s the balancing act that we have to try and make between what is too much versus what is not enough.”

Motlow State Community College’s Automation and Robotics Training Center (ARTC) in McMinnville has helped many Motlow students find successful careers, but it has also become a way for Motlow to connect with the children of the Warren County Community. Grade school students have the opportunity to visit the facility and enjoy hands-on learning experiences with robots so they can see the world of possibilities that awaits them. The ARTC has played a particularly influential role in the life of Jenna Mullins, a student whose passion for learning has led her to promote the ARTC and its offerings to her community.

Jenna Mullins is a 10th grader at Warren County High School and has grown up in the ARTC. Her friendship with Director Larry Flatt began when she was a small child and led him to teach her about binary numbers and give her books about robotics. He allowed her to visit the ARTC and put her love of robots in action, fueling her love for the subject until she was able to spread it to others.

She stated, “Mr. Larry has become like family, always holding me to high expectations. His passion for his career has shown me the importance of education, and his success has inspired me to work hard toward my own goals.”

Flatt added, “Motlow’s mission of inspiring young students to obtain skills that will lead to a better quality of life while helping others is exemplified in Jenna’s story. Her innate abilities and interest in robotics were obvious as she attended some of the summer programs hosted by Motlow at the Automation and Robotics Training Center.  As we planned for the 2024 summer student events, we felt the presentation and training might be more engaging from someone who is closer to the students’ grade level.  Jenna was the obvious choice, given the abilities she has gained since first coming to the ARTC as a fourth grader. Our decision was validated by the enthusiasm and willingness to learn that we saw in the more than two hundred students with whom she engaged.  We encourage others to look for opportunities to grow their skills in areas that may not be comfortable at first.”

Mullins’s dedication has allowed her opportunities to help teach magnet school students, Warren County’s gifted students, Warren County eighth grade students at career day, and high school students touring the ARTC/TCAT about the subject of robotics. Her love of learning has led her to inspire others, and she is a perfect example of why Motlow State prioritizes student success at every age.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=technology+news,Single-Reading Mammography Study Confirms AI Boosts Cancer Detection,https://www.itnonline.com/content/single-reading-mammography-study-confirms-ai-boosts-cancer-detection,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 15:43:43 GMT","



Prospective study finds AI increases cancer detection by 13.8% in single-reader settings without raising recall rates, presenting a new tool for countries relying on single-reader mammography screening.

March 10, 2025 — Lunit, a provider of AI-powered solutions for cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, has published a prospective study in Nature Communications validating the real-world effectiveness of AI-powered mammography screening in South Korea’s national breast cancer screening program. Conducted as the world’s first large-scale, multicenter prospective study in a single-reading setting, the research underscores how AI-assisted mammography interpretation significantly improves breast cancer detection rates without increasing recall rates.

The study was led by Professor Yun-Woo Chang from Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital, in collaboration with both breast and general radiologists from six leading academic hospitals in South Korea. The study analyzed 24,543 women aged 40 and above who underwent routine biennial mammography (2D full-field digital mammogram) between February 2021 and December 2022 as part of Korea's national breast cancer screening program.

The study compared the performance of breast radiologists interpreting screening mammograms with and without Lunit's AI-based computer-aided detection, Lunit INSIGHT MMG. The results revealed that AI-assisted breast radiologists detected 13.8% more screen-detected breast cancers than those relying solely on conventional interpretation methods, or without AI assistance. The cancer detection rate (CDR) increased from 5.01 (per 1,000) to 5.70 with AI assistance, while recall rates (RRs) remained statistically unchanged, ensuring improved clinical effectiveness and minimizing unnecessary additional recalls. Moreover, AI assistance led to a significant improvement in detecting small-sized tumors and node-negative cancers, key indicators of improved early detection.

Additionally, the study evaluated Lunit INSIGHT MMG’s impact on general radiologists who do not specialize in breast imaging through a simulated retrospective study. The results demonstrated that AI assistance led to an even greater improvement in CDRs for general radiologists, with an increase of 26.4% (3.87 to 4.89 per 1,000), underscoring AI’s potential to support radiologists with varying levels of expertise.

“This prospective study offers compelling real-world evidence that AI can improve early cancer detection while maintaining effectiveness and reducing unnecessary patient anxiety caused by false positives in a single-reading setting,” said Professor Chang, the lead and corresponding author of the study.

A Solution for Single and Double-Reading Screening Systems

The publication further builds upon Lunit INSIGHT MMG’s track record in improving breast cancer detection. In Sweden, Capio St. Göran Hospital conducted a prospective clinical trial to assess Lunit AI’s effectiveness in breast cancer screening when replacing one reader within a double-reading setting. Following positive trial results, Capio St. Göran Hospital became the world’s first to replace one of two radiologists in its double-reading workflow with AI, marking a paradigm shift in breast cancer screening.

“This latest prospective study in South Korea further solidifies Lunit INSIGHT MMG’s potential as an indispensable tool in breast cancer screening,” said Brandon Suh, CEO of Lunit. “Whether in a single-reader or double-reader setting, AI can serve as a powerful force multiplier, assisting radiologists in detecting cancer earlier and more accurately.”

Shaping the Future 

With mounting evidence supporting AI’s role in breast cancer screening, Lunit is driving its global adoption. Lunit INSIGHT MMG has already been deployed in national breast screening programs in Australia, Sweden, Iceland, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, helping healthcare systems enhance efficiency and optimize diagnostic accuracy.

The study’s findings are expected to influence global breast cancer screening protocols, particularly in countries where single-reading mammography interpretation is widely practiced. By demonstrating AI’s ability to enhance radiologists’ accuracy without increasing RRs, the study provides critical data supporting AI’s role in optimizing cancer detection while reducing the workload burden on radiologists. This is particularly relevant as many countries face a shortage of specialized breast imaging professionals, making AI an important tool to improve efficiency and maintain high diagnostic standards.

“As AI adoption accelerates, we remain committed to driving innovation and making AI-powered cancer screening the new standard of care,” added Suh. “By working closely with healthcare providers worldwide, we aim to ensure that AI benefits as many patients as possible.”

Lloyd's Register (LR) and Fugro have signed a block fee agreement to streamline the in-service certification and maintenance of Fugro’s growing fleet of autonomous uncrewed surface vessels (USVs).

The strategic move is expected to simplify the certification process, enabling faster deployment and ensuring continued compliance with LR’s Code for Unmanned Marine Systems (UMS).

LR has been working with Fugro since 2021 when it certified its first Blue Essence vessel Fugro Maali.

This was the first uncrewed system to be certified by LR and the first to receive LR’s UMS Certificate. Since then, LR has played a key role in supporting Fugro’s USV operations, certifying another four Fugro vessels with more vessels in build.

The new agreement establishes a more efficient framework for certification, replacing the previous vessel-by-vessel approach with a streamlined process under a consolidated block fee structure.

This reduces administrative complexity and ensures that Fugro’s fleet remains compliant with international safety and operational standards. 

Fugro's fleet of LR-certified USVs operate in various locations, including the U.K., U.A.E., Australia, Denmark, and the Netherlands, performing tasks such as offshore energy inspections, subsea cable surveys and environmental monitoring.

“By implementing a block fee structure, we are enabling Fugro to maintain its fleet efficiently under LR’s UMS Code, ensuring operational availability and compliance. This is yet another industry first for Fugro, who achieved the first LR UMS Certificate and currently have the most vessels certified against LR’s UMS Code,” said Matthew Palmer, Global Nuclear and Naval Submarines Segment Director at LR.

""This block fee arrangement with LR is a crucial step in managing our expanding fleet. It allows us to efficiently maintain our growing fleet to the highest standards of safety and compliance, ensuring our clients receive reliable and high-quality data from our USV operations,” added Jeffrey Tuckerman, Regulatory Compliance Officer at SEA-KIT, a Fugro company.

In the blink of an eye, the internet has evolved from a groundbreaking tool of knowledge, connectivity, and progress to a hotbed of crime, scams, cyberbullying, theft, fake news, unregulated content and fraud.

  

Once a beacon of promise, the net now feels like a lawless, chaotic wild west where dangerous predators roam free, thriving in the dark corners of the web. What happened? Where did things go so wrong?

  

Let’s start with the obvious: crime. From hacking rings to identity theft, cybercrime has exploded. Every day, thousands of people fall victim to criminal activities online. Hackers are no longer the lone wolves in their basements—they’re highly organized syndicates with deep pockets, professional tools, and no conscience.

  

  

Personal data is sold on the black market like hotcakes, businesses are held ransom with ransomware attacks, and phishing schemes are more sophisticated than ever. These criminals know how to exploit every flaw, every weakness in the system, and they do so without fear of real consequence.

  

Then, there’s the growing plague of scams. Have you received an email recently offering you millions of dollars for helping a “rich billionaire” move money? How about a message from an overseas “prince” who just needs your bank details to transfer a fortune into your account?

  

Scams aren't just isolated incidents anymore. They’re an everyday occurrence. From fake job offers to fraudulent investment schemes promising ""too good to be true"" returns, the internet is flooded with schemes designed to separate people from their hard-earned cash.

  

And the worst part? These scammers don’t even bother to hide their malicious intent anymore. Their deception is blatant, and platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and even LinkedIn are rife with scam ads and fraudulent accounts.

  

But it doesn’t stop there—cyberbullying has become a pandemic of its own. Once a victim of bullying steps outside the walls of their home, they’re not safe anymore. In fact, they’re more vulnerable than ever.

  

Social media platforms, which should be spaces for self-expression and connection, have instead become breeding grounds for hate, cruelty, and harassment. Kids and adults alike are subjected to relentless online torment—often with no way to escape it.

  

The worst part? It’s hard to escape a situation that follows you everywhere. Cyberbullying doesn’t just stop at comments on a post. It’s personal attacks, death threats, stalking, and sometimes even the weaponization of personal information. It’s a toxic environment that’s turning people against each other, tearing apart communities, and ruining lives.

  

We also have theft—not the kind with masks and getaway cars, but the type that happens in broad daylight, digitally. Data breaches are a daily occurrence, affecting individuals and large corporations alike.

  

What’s more concerning is how these breaches are handled. It’s one thing to hear about the hack; it’s another to find out that your personal information—your passwords, your financial records, your private messages—have been stolen and are now in the hands of criminals.

  

And let’s not forget about the rise of digital theft through malware and ransomware attacks, where individuals, companies, and even governments are extorted for access to their own files. The sheer audacity of it is staggering. Theft, but with a 21st-century twist, where the victim may never even know what’s been taken until it’s too late.

  

And let’s not even get started on fake news. The internet has become a breeding ground for misinformation, conspiracy theories, and the deliberate distortion of truth. In an era where everyone can publish their “opinions” as fact, discerning what's true from what's false is harder than ever.

  

It doesn’t matter if it’s politics, health, science, or entertainment—the lines between fact and fiction are continuously blurred. Algorithms prioritize sensationalism over truth, ensuring that the loudest, most outrageous voices are heard the most. Meanwhile, responsible journalism gets buried under the noise, struggling to be seen.

  

The internet is now swarming with unregulated content fraud—you know, those shady articles and sites that have no real authority or credibility, but they somehow manage to climb to the top of search results. These are the websites selling counterfeit products, the ones offering misleading medical advice, or the ones convincing you that their miracle weight loss pills will change your life.

  

There are no rules anymore. Anyone can create anything and pass it off as truth. And because they’re so good at manipulating SEO algorithms and exploiting loopholes, these frauds go unchecked for far too long, costing unsuspecting victims their time, money, and sometimes even their health.

  

At this point, it's clear: the internet has spiraled out of control. Where’s the accountability?

  

Where are the consequences for these criminals who operate with impunity? Why aren’t platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter stepping up to stop the flood of scams, harassment, and fraud that’s poisoning their platforms? Why do we continue to let these digital marketplaces run wild, knowing full well the destruction they’re causing to individuals and businesses alike?

Combo ICeGaN® combines smart ICeGaN HEMT ICs and IGBTs (Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistors) in the same module or IPM, maximising efficiency and offering a cost-effective alternative to expensive silicon carbide (SiC) products. ICeGaN technology brings the benefits of GaN to DC-to-DC converters, on-board chargers and potentially traction inverters. Combo ICeGaN further extends the benefits of CGD’s GaN technology into the rich 100kW+ traction inverter market.

The proprietary Combo ICeGaN approach leverages the fact that ICeGaN and IGBT devices can be operated in a parallel architecture having similar drive voltage ranges, such as 0-20 V. The technology also offers excellent gate robustness. In operation, the ICeGaN switch is very efficient, with low conduction and low switching losses at relatively low currents (light load) while the IGBT is dominant at relatively high currents (towards full load or during surge conditions).

Combo ICeGaN also benefits from the high saturation currents and avalanche clamping capability of IGBTs as well as the efficient switching of ICeGaN. At higher temperatures, the bipolar component of the IGBT starts to conduct at lower on-state voltages, supplementing the current loss in the ICeGaN. Conversely, at lower temperatures, ICeGaN will take more current. Sensing and protection functions are intelligently managed to optimally drive the Combo ICeGaN and enhance the Safe Operating Area (SOA) of both ICeGaN and IGBT devices.

Dr Giorgia Longobardi, Founder and CEO of CGD, stated: “Today, inverters for EV powertrains either use IGBTs, which are low cost but inefficient at light load conditions, or SiC devices, which are very efficient but also expensive. Our new Combo ICeGaN solution will revolutionise the EV industry by intelligently combining the benefits of GaN and silicon technologies, keeping costs low and maintaining the highest levels of efficiency, which, of course, means faster charging and longer range. We are already working with Tier One automotive EV manufacturers and their supply chain partners to bring this technology advancement to the market.”

To summarise, Professor Florin Udrea, Founder and CTO of CGD, states: “Having worked for three decades in the field of power devices, this is the first time I have encountered such a beautifully complementary technology pairing. ICeGaN is extremely fast and a star performer at light load conditions while the IGBT brings great benefits during full load, surge conditions and at high temperatures. ICeGaN provides on-chip intelligence while the IGBT provides avalanche capability. They both embrace  silicon substrates which come with cost, infrastructure and manufacturability advantages.”

ICeGaN ICs have been proven to be very robust, while IGBTs have a proven track record in traction and EV applications. CGD has also proven similar, proprietary parallel combinations of ICeGaN devices with SiC MOSFETs, but Combo ICeGaN—which is now detailed in a published IEDM paper—is a far more economical solution. CGD expects to have working demos of Combo ICeGaN at the end of this year.

An artist’s concept shows LuGRE on Blue Ghost and its three key records

NASA, in collaboration with the Italian Space Agency, has successfully demonstrated the ability to acquire and track Earth-based navigation signals on the Moon. The breakthrough was achieved through the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE), which was delivered to the lunar surface by Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander on March 2. The achievement confirms that Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals can be detected at the Moon's distance, offering a potential advancement for future space missions, including NASA's Artemis programme. The ability to track these signals on the Moon could enhance autonomous navigation for spacecraft, reducing reliance on Earth-based tracking systems. The LuGRE payload, one of ten NASA payloads sent aboard the lander, is expected to continue gathering data for the duration of its 14-day mission.

According to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the LuGRE experiment successfully acquired and tracked signals from both GPS and Galileo constellations at 2 a.m. EST on March 3. This marked the first time that GNSS signals had been used for navigation at a distance of approximately 225,000 miles from Earth. The data collected will contribute to the development of navigation technology that could support future lunar and deep-space exploration.

Kevin Coggins, Deputy Associate Administrator for NASA's Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) programme, told NASA's official news source that the experiment demonstrated the feasibility of using GNSS signals for navigation beyond Earth. He highlighted that the same technology used in aviation and mobile devices on Earth could now be leveraged for lunar missions.

The LuGRE payload had already set records during its journey to the Moon. On January 21, it achieved the highest altitude GNSS signal acquisition at 209,900 miles from Earth, surpassing the previous record set by NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission. By February 20, as LuGRE entered lunar orbit, the altitude record had been extended to 243,000 miles. These milestones suggest that spacecraft operating in cislunar space could use GNSS signals for navigation, providing greater autonomy for missions beyond Earth's orbit.

Developed through a partnership between NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the Italian Space Agency, Qascom, and Politecnico di Torino, the LuGRE payload represents a significant step toward advanced space navigation systems. Data collected from the ongoing mission will inform future efforts to expand GNSS coverage for lunar and Martian exploration.

Apple ‘s much advertised updates for its Siri digital assistant are likely to get delayed, which were originally scheduled to be part of the iOS 18.4 software update set for April. As per reports, the company now anticipates that these features, first introduced in June, will be released sometime in the “coming year.” According to reports from Bloomberg News, Apple is encountering challenges in finalising these updates, which were intended to improve Siri's ability to access personal information for queries and deliver more precise controls for apps.

The anticipated release has been pushed back as Apple shifts its focus to resolving multiple bugs that have surfaced during development. Internally, concerns have been raised by software chief Craig Federighi and other executives regarding the functionality of these features during testing.

Some members of Apple’s AI division suggest that the current work may need to be scrapped, potentially requiring a complete rebuild of the functions. If this path is taken, the release might coincide with the next-generation Siri set to roll out in 2026. 

These features were first unveiled during the Worldwide Developers Conference last June as part of the introduction of the Apple Intelligence AI platform. At the upcoming annual event, Apple is not expected to showcase significant AI advancements, choosing instead to focus on integrating Apple Intelligence into various applications.

Meanwhile, Apple has recently launched two new iPads in India: the iPad Air (2025) and the iPad (2025). The iPad Air is equipped with the M3 chip, while the 11th generation iPad features the A16 Bionic chip. The entry-level iPad now has a storage capacity starting at 128GB. Additionally, Apple has updated the Magic Keyboard for the new iPad Air, which now includes a larger trackpad, a 14-key function row, and a USB Type-C port for charging.

The Trump administration is weighing a ban on Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek from US government devices over national-security concerns, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday.

US officials are worried about DeepSeek's handling of user data, which the company says it stores in servers located in China, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news.

Administration officials are also considering banning the chatbot from app stores and putting limits on how US-based cloud service providers could offer DeepSeek's AI models to their customers, the Journal said, adding that those discussions are still at an early stage.

DeepSeek's low-cost AI models triggered a major sell-off in global equity markets in January, as investors worried that its arrival could threaten current AI market leaders.

A group of 21 state attorneys general urged Congress on Thursday to pass a bill to bar government devices from downloading and using DeepSeek artificial intelligence software on government devices.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Microblogging platform X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday suffered a massive global outage for the third time today, leaving thousands of users unable to access the app or website. According to the outage-tracking platform Downdetector, the first disruption was recorded around 3:30 PM IST, followed by another at 7:00 PM IST and a third spike at 8:44 PM IST. X chief Elon Musk said a 'massive cyberattack' targeting the platform was the cause behind the disruption. 

The outage has impacted users across multiple countries, including the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. For the uninitiated, Downdetector monitors the operational status of internet services and has recorded a substantial spike in outage reports. 

 

Downdetector data shows that 52 per cent of users are facing issues with the app itself, 40 per cent are experiencing problems on the website, and 7 per cent have reported server connection failures. 

With X being the primary platform where users typically report disruptions on other social media services, many found themselves unable to voice their concerns about the ongoing outage.  

As the repeated service failures have led to frustration among users, X chief Elon Musk posted that the platform is facing a ""massive cyberattack"" and suspected the involvement of a ""large, coordinated group and/or a country"". 

""There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against 𝕏. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing,"" Elon Musk wrote.

While some regions have seen a partial restoration of services, many users continue to experience accessibility issues.  

According to Downdetector, the number of outage reports surged past 40,000 in the United States, while more than 10,800 users in the United Kingdom also reported issues earlier in the day.

More details about the global outage are awaited.

Southern Africa’s logistics sector is undergoing a rapid digital transformation, with transport operators moving beyond simply recognising the need for technology to actively testing and implementing digital solutions.

Some are already switching between providers as they seek the most effective tools to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.

“We are at the early stage of a technology boom within the transport sector, with the emergence of multiple solution providers locally, along with global suppliers making inroads,” said Renko Bergh, co-founder of CtrlFleet.

“The need for true digital impact and creating competitive advantages through technology is now.”

Bergh warns that sustaining the momentum is key.

“The challenge is for transport operators to maintain the utilisation of solutions,"" he said.

""They need to avoid the potential pitfall of leapfrogging their own expectations and keep on measuring improvements.

”Logistics remains a critical enabler of economic growth, especially as South Africa eyes a 3% growth target.

""However, the sector continues to grapple with high transport costs, ineffective port operations and failing infrastructure.

""Cost-effective transport solutions are more important than ever, and digital innovation is seen as a vital step forward.

""The National Logistics Crisis Committee has echoed the need for technology-driven transformation, but the real shift will come from operators embedding technology into their operations, rather than treating it as an add-on.""

, Senior Contributor. 

03/10 update below. This post was originally published on March 09

Bitcoin and crypto prices—including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, solana’s SOL and cardano’s ADA—have flat-lined over the last week after Donald Trump revealed the cryptocurrencies that the U.S. was betting on, sparking market mayhem.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has fallen back to around $85,000 per bitcoin, exactly where it was at the beginning of March (despite China quietly priming the bitcoin price for a major earthquake).

Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, Donald Trump’s crypto czar has said the U.S. Treasury will be working to “maximize the value” of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. in its reserve and crypto stockpile.

“We’re going to move the [cryptocurrency owned by the U.S. government] to the digital stockpile,” David Sacks, a technology investor and entrepreneur who has joined the Trump administration as artificial intelligence and crypto czar, said on the All In Podcast he cohosted before taking the job.

“The purpose of the stockpile is responsible stewardship, it’s a place for safekeeping, it’s a centralized account under the direction of the secretary of the Treasury and the secretary of the Treasury will figure out how to maximize the value of these holdings.”

03/10 update: The bitcoin price has dropped to $80,000 per bitcoin over night before rebounding slightly but fresh fears have emerged that bitcoin could be headed to around $70,000—at which point things ""will be violent,"" according to BitMex founder and crypto investor Arthur Hayes.

“With bitcoin dipping below $80,000, approximately 70% of all selling came from investors who bought within the last three months, highlighting the dominance of recent entrants panic-selling into the decline,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of market advisory company 10x Research, said in an emailed note.

The rest of the crypto top ten have followed bitcoin lower, with ethereum hitting $2,000 for the first time since late 2023. Ethereum rival solana and the meme-based dogecoin are leading the market lower, each down around 6%.

""In the short-term, expect bitcoin to drop as low as $72,000 and ethereum to hit $1,600 while the administration seeks to control inflation,"" Zach Burks, the chief executive of non-fungible token (NFT) service provider Mintology, said in emailed comments.

“Many investors are pulling out of bitcoin, viewing it as a risky asset class for the first time since Trump took the White House. It’s no longer playing its role as a store of value—gold prices have spiked as many go back to the original ‘doomsday asset,’ which is no surprise as tariffs and grenades continue to get thrown across the free world.”

This week, after Trump’s surprise announcement that Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano would form the basis of a U.S. crypto reserve, the White House has shuffled its plans to create a bitcoin-only strategic reserve alongside a crypto stockpile made up of smaller cryptocurrencies including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, cardano and solana.

""The crypto stockpile should be subject to good portfolio management and fortunately we have a secretary of the Treasury who is an extremely successful former hedge
 fund manager so he’s going to figure out the best way to manage these assets and
 we give him the flexibility to do portfolio management,"" Sacks said.

Speaking at the much-hyped White House crypto summit this week, alongside Sacks and Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, Trump confirmed his commitment to bitcoin—placing it in a unique position above other cryptocurrencies in a reserve described as a “digital Fort Knox” in a reference to the U.S. gold reserve.

“I promised to make America the bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet,” Trump said, it was reported by the New York Times. “We’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise.”

In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a ""strategic national bitcoin reserve"" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference.

During Friday’s White House summit, Trump also called it ""foolish"" of the government to have previously sold so much of its seized bitcoin, while Sacks, speaking on the podcast, claimed the U.S. might have lost as much as $16 billion by selling off its bitcoin.

""At one point in time, we had about 400,000 bitcoin on the federal balance sheet. We sold roughly half of that for something like $360 million total,"" Sacks said during the podcast. ""If we had held all of that, just that the portion we sold would be worth over $17 billion.""

Ahead of the summit, Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of the bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile using existing government holdings, disappointing traders with a lack of commitment to new bitcoin and crypto purchases though leaving the door open to acquiring more bitcoin though “budget neutral” methods that “do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers.""

Sacks added during a press conference that the Treasury and Commerce department, led by bitcoin price bull Howard Lutnick, are only “allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt.”

“The subpar strategic bitcoin reserve move triggered the uncertainty in the crypto market,” Agne Linge, head of growth at crypto platform WeFi, said in emailed comments.

“With the executive order directing agencies to consolidate seized bitcoin to form the reserve, crypto investors see the move as a trick, as no new bitcoin purchase was announced. Despite the knee-jerk reaction from investors, the fact is that the bitcoin reserve mandate authorizes the acquisition of bitcoin through means that will not cost taxpayers’ money. The available options in this regard include bitcoin bonds and the sales of its gold reserve to fund more purchases. In the long term, the bitcoin reserve shift might benefit the coin. This thesis hinges on a possible race it has triggered that may see other sovereign nations make similar moves.”

Some have speculated that China is weighing the creation of its own bitcoin reserve to rival the U.S. after Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund revealed last month it’s betting on bitcoin, kicking off a global adoption “race.""

“The U.S. bitcoin reserve raises the likelihood of other nations adopting similar reserves and accelerates their consideration of such initiatives,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note.

“With the U.S. planning to adopt bitcoin reserves, this is likely to drive broader global adoption, with more nations integrating bitcoin into their reserves—potentially shifting from gold to digital assets, much like how some economies have embraced the U.S. dollar alongside or instead of their own currencies.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}"

 Shares of Strategy (MSTR) and other companies tied to cryptocurrencies sank along with the price of digital coins on concerns about President Donald Trump's federal bitcoin strategic reserve plan and worries about the U.S. economy. 


 Trump on Friday signed an executive order establishing the new reserve, which he said was part of his effort to make America the ""cypto capital of the planet."" However, the proposal only calls for the reserve to include assets already seized by the government through legal action, and doesn't suggest additional purchases.


 Another factor weighing on the crypto market is the economic impact of Trump's tariffs, and the response by other countries to them, including the future of interest rates. Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech that policymakers will be taking a wait-and-see approach to rate cuts until the effect of the president's moves are better understood. 


 Strategy, the biggest corporate holder of bitcoin, saw its shares sink 13% Monday morning. Shares of crypto trading platform Coinbase Global (COIN) and bitcoin miner MARA Holdings (MARA) also tumbled by about 12% and 13%, respectively.

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

Many countries have strategic reserves in case of shortages or as a way to keep prices stable. The U.S. has its strategic oil reserves. China has tens of thousands of tons of frozen, raw pork. The newest reserve - bitcoin. Last week, President Trump signed an order to create a strategic reserve of cryptocurrency. To explain how this might work, we called up Zeke Faux. He’s an investigative reporter with Bloomberg and author of the book “Number Go Up, ” about the crypto industry. He joins us now. Good morning.

ZEKE FAUX: Morning.

RASCOE: Typically, these strategic reserves are commodities - oil, grain, pork. But cryptocurrencies exist in ledgers on computers. So how will a digital currency reserve work?

FAUX: What the administration officials have said the plan is, is that the U.S. already digitally holds quite a lot of bitcoin. There’s a lot of crime involving bitcoin, and it often results in the bitcoins being seized by the U.S. government. And in the past, these have been auctioned off by the U.S. Marshals Service for regular U.S. dollars, which can be used for whatever. Now the government is going to hold onto these bitcoins. The purpose of that is not entirely clear, but Donald Trump has hinted if the price goes up a lot, this could help pay off the national debt.

RASCOE: How much would - the amount of bitcoin they have now, how much is that in, like, U.S. dollars at this point?

FAUX: It’s about $20 billion. And even if you believe that the U.S. government should be gambling on the price of bitcoin, this is not nearly enough to have an impact on anything.

RASCOE: And what is the argument that this would be helpful?

FAUX: The crypto industry is really good at creating this impression that this is the future and that the U.S. government needs to get on this or will be left behind. I’ve spent years traveling the world, investigating this industry, and what I’ve found is there’s nothing there. Crypto has been around for 15 years. It’s as old as Uber. It’s as old as WhatsApp, but pretty much no one is using it for anything but financial speculation. The crypto industry is basically a giant offshore casino. Even if you believe that these are winning bets, the U.S. government has never been in the business of speculating on financial assets.

RASCOE: Just a few years ago, Trump called cryptocurrency a scam. So what changed?

FAUX: During his most recent campaign, a few dozen of the richest bitcoiners got together, and they engaged in this concerted lobbying effort to change his mind. And last July, they held a fundraiser that reportedly raised $25 million for Trump. And after that, Trump went onstage at this bitcoin conference and promised them he would deregulate the crypto industry. He’d make the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet. And that’s where he first floated this strategic reserve plan, which has been a pipe dream of bitcoin advocates for years.

RASCOE: President Trump and first lady Melania Trump, they both have their own coins. The family has its own crypto business called World Liberty Financial. Is that a conflict of interest?

FAUX: Yeah. When you’ve got the U.S. government spending its money on these assets, and you’ve got people who are in the administration investing in the assets, yeah, it’s a clear conflict of interest.

RASCOE: The Securities and Exchange Commission had been investigating the crypto industry, but under Trump, those investigations ended. What were they focused on?

FAUX: The SEC under the Biden administration - they’re basically saying that some of these cryptocurrencies count as securities, meaning things that we regulate, and that the industry had not been following the long-established rules around securities, which mandate that you have to file these detailed disclosures. There’s rules around trading. Industry has said cryptocurrencies are different. We need new rules. And right now, the Trump administration has said they agree with that position, and they’re in the process of working out these new rules, whatever they’re going to be.

RASCOE: That’s Zeke Faux. He’s an investigative reporter with Bloomberg, and his book about cryptocurrency is called “Number Go Up.” Thanks so much for joining us.

FAUX: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.","{'href': 'https://www.wgbh.org', 'title': 'GBH News'}"

Cryptocurrency prices fell further on Monday amid disappointment with the plans for a strategic bitcoin reserve.

Bitcoin was down about 4.2% at 12:30 ET to about $79,500, bringing the slide over the past week to 12%, per Coinbase.

Ether and XRP both fell about 3%. They are two cryptos that will go into a separate fund rather than be combined with the bitcoin reserve. Some commentators had criticised the decision to put lesser-known coins into the strategic reserve.

President Donald Trump posted earlier this month that the reserve would make the US the ""Crypto Capital of the World."" However, the executive order he signed on Thursday indicated that the reserve will only include bitcoin already held by the government — mostly from asset forfeitures in criminal and civil cases.

Many in the crypto world thought bitcoin would be purchased to add to the fund. That seems unlikely in the short term, but the door has been left open.

""The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce shall develop strategies for acquiring additional Government BTC [bitcoin] provided that such strategies are budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers,"" the order stated.

David Sacks, the Trump administration's ""crypto czar,"" wrote on X that using the government's bitcoin holdings meant the reserve ""will not cost taxpayers a dime.""

""The government will not acquire additional assets for the stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings.""

Sacks has also ordered an audit of the government's crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 bitcoin alone, BBC News reported. That holding would be worth about $16.5 billion.

10 March, 2025 – Tether, the largest company in the digital assets industry, has announced that Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission has granted acceptance of USD₮ as an approved cryptocurrency.

This approval enables USD₮ to be traded within the country, facilitating its listing on regulated exchanges and paving the way for USD₮ to be accepted for payments, which advances the region’s leadership in digital asset innovation.

The updated regulations aim to enhance flexibility in digital asset businesses and will take effect on March 16, 2025. The SEC had previously sought public feedback on these changes, which were finalized in February 2025 with widespread industry support.

The regulator’s recognition of USD₮ as an approved cryptocurrency marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital assets in the region and represents a major step toward clarifying and enhancing Thailand’s regulatory framework. This will provide investors with greater flexibility and choice while fostering a more dynamic and resilient industry. By enabling the seamless integration of USD₮, the decision supports the diversification and modernization of Thailand’s financial landscape.

Thailand has emerged as one of the friendliest jurisdictions for digital assets in recent years and ranks among the top 20 countries globally in terms of adoption, with USD₮ accounting for around 40% of volumes. Tether’s USD₮ with a market cap of $142 billion, is the world’s most widely used stablecoin, providing a trusted, efficient bridge between traditional fiat systems and digital economies.

“We highly value the Thai market and are continuously exploring ways to enhance our services and offerings. Our priority is to provide users in Thailand with a secure, transparent, and reliable stablecoin experience,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “We are committed to supporting the long-term success and adoption of stablecoins in Thailand and look forward to contributing to the growth of the country’s digital asset ecosystem by fostering a strong and sustainable stablecoin infrastructure.”

Thailand’s forward-thinking approach to digital asset regulation sets a global benchmark, and Tether is proud to see USD₮ play a pivotal role in driving economic progress and digital transformation in the region. This approval highlights Tether’s dedication to building bridges between traditional and decentralized economies while ensuring security, trust, and efficiency for users worldwide. Thailand’s forward-looking stance on stablecoins is reflected in its vibrant, Thai baht-backed digital asset market.

7 MARCH, 2025 – Tether, the largest company in the digital assets industry, announced today that it has assisted the United States Secret Service (USSS) in freezing $23 million in illicit funds linked to transactions on the Russian-sanctioned exchange, Garantex.  Over the past year, Tether has worked on multiple cases with law enforcement, including assisting […]

(Bloomberg) -- Cryptocurrency prices extended their slide as escalating tariff war tensions and diminishing prospects of further Federal Reserve rate cuts offset a wave of pro-crypto announcements from President Donald Trump last week.

Risk assets like crypto are under pressure amid anxiety that the Trump’s tariffs and government firings will torpedo growth in the world’s largest economy. US equities slumped and Treasuries rallied as investors sought a refuge.

“While Trump’s strategic crypto reserve announcement initially drove optimism, the rally quickly unraveled amid aggressive selling linked to worsening macro conditions,” wrote Nikolay Karpenko, director at B2C2.

Bitcoin slid 5.4% to $78,558 as of 1:44 p.m. New York time on Monday, the lowest level since Feb. 28. Solana, Cardano and XRP, all tokens that Trump had mentioned as possible candidates for a digital-asset stockpile but were not mentioned in Trump’s executive order, each slumped even more. Crypto-linked stocks slid, with Coinbase Global Inc. dropping 14% for its biggest decline since October and Michael Saylor’s levered Bitcoin proxy Strategy losing 16%.

Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, including an order to create a US Bitcoin reserve and a separate stockpile of other tokens, along with a high-profile summit with industry executives in Washington on Friday, has done little to lift market sentiment. While the administration pledged to capitalize the reserve with crypto seized in legal proceedings, the absence of fresh capital commitments disappointed investors.

“The market perceived the summit as underwhelming and top cryptocurrencies dropped after it was revealed that the widely anticipated crypto reserve would only hold existing government holdings,” said Jeff Mei, chief operating officer at crypto exchange BTSE.

The US currently owns about $17 billion worth of Bitcoin and about $400 million worth of several other tokens, largely attributable to asset forfeitures related to civil and criminal cases.

Investors are rationally more bullish on crypto given recent developments like the reduced US Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement, but other factors are more nuanced or even negative, said Ari Paul, co-founder of BlockTower Capital.

“The apparent capricious favoritism in the administration’s selection of assets for the strategic reserve — especially after the launching of Trump and Melania coins — is a strong deterrent to investors,” Paul said in a message. “It’s created the impression that the Trump administration is engaged in lobbying based selection and promotion of ‘insider’ assets, and that the cryptocurrency market today is largely a short-term trading casino,” he added.

Since February, investors have withdrawn a net $4.4 billion from the group of US Bitcoin ETFs, which played a key role in the token’s record run last year. The largest cryptoasset is currently down about 28% from its record high of $109,241 and the broader crypto market has lost over $1 trillion in market capitalization from its peak, according to CoinGecko.

“Bitcoin could very well drop to the $70,000-$80,000 range in the coming weeks. Only when this tariff war ends and the Fed resumes cutting rates will top cryptocurrencies resume trending towards previous all-time highs,” Mei added.

When Arthur Hayes speculated that Bitcoin could fall as low as $75,000 last month many investors probably rolled their eyes. 

The leading cryptocurrency, after all, was bound to get a bounce from the Trump administration’s support for a Bitcoin strategic reserve, plus an end to the crackdown on the industry. 

With Bitcoin dropping more than 5% in the last 24 hours and slipping below $79,000, Hayes’ prediction now looks prescient. 

On Monday, the BitMEX co-founder and crypto influencer reiterated his call for Bitcoin to slide to $75,000. Worse may be on the way.

He said the volume of open interests for options contracts at that price range was flashing red.

“An ugly start of the week,” Hayes, the chief investment officer at Maelstrom, posted online. “If we get into that range, it will be violent.” 

In a way, it already is. 

Investors across the capital markets are spooked by President Donald Trump’s flip-flopping tariff policies toward the US' two biggest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. 

Trump also deepened a trade war with China by ratcheting up import duties another 10%. China countered with tariffs of its own.

If that wasn’t enough, Trump’s much-hyped crypto summit at the White House underwhelmed investors by setting up a Bitcoin reserve stocked with coins seized by the government in criminal cases.

Investors had been hoping Trump would order the government to start buying Bitcoin.

Zach Burks, CEO of NFT marketplace Mintology, said he expects Bitcoin to “drop as low as $72,000” amid inflation concerns for investors and the fading allure of the asset as a so-called Trump trade.

“Many investors are pulling out of Bitcoin, viewing it as a risky asset class for the first time since Trump took the White House,” Burks told DL News.

‘It’s no longer playing its role as a store of value.'

The failure of crypto to decouple from the stock market is proving worrisome yet again during a market crisis. If anything, investors should be flocking to Bitcoin to safeguard their wealth the same way they use gold. 

But investors are shunning that idea. 

“It’s no longer playing its role as a store of value,” Burks said. “Gold prices have spiked as many go back to the original doomsday asset, which is no surprise as tariff grenades continue to get thrown across the free world.”

Most of the investors ditching Bitcoin are new buyers of the asset, crypto research outfit 10x Research said in a Monday report.

The report stated that these new buyers likely punted on Donald Trump’s presidency being a boon for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies ― that hasn’t materialised.

Despite the present market turmoil, analysts still hold bullish expectations for Bitcoin.

Hayes previously told DL News that Trump’s policies will devalue the dollar and send Bitcoin’s price to $250,000 this year as investors return to the asset to safeguard their money.

For Burks, a Bitcoin recovery to $110,000 this year is possible.

“But we must weather this MAGA-inflicted mini recession before we get to move up the layer cake,” Burks said.

The price of Bitcoin crashed below $80,000 on Monday morning as financial markets reacted to ongoing concerns over inflation and a possible U.S. recession, fueled by President Trump's comments over the weekend.

Asked by Fox News in a Sunday interview about whether he expects a recession this year, Trump declined to rule it out.

""I hate to predict things like that,"" he replied, adding that there will be a ""period of transition"" as the economy digests his sizable tariffs on neighbors Canada and Mexico, as well as China. Trump's moves around tariffs, including delays and shifts in the scale of them, have rocked markets for weeks.

Bitcoin dove as low as $79,553 on Monday morning, rebounding slightly to $79,785 as of this writing. The leading cryptocurrency is currently down almost 5% on the day, falling 14% on the week amid volatility fueled not only by tariff moves but also speculation over Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve plans.

Ethereum is also down 5% to a current price of $2,013 after coming within a dollar of the $2,000 mark late Sunday. ETH hasn't been below $2,000 since November 2023.

Other major coins have posted much sharper losses over the last 24 hours, with Cardano (ADA) falling 10% to $0.69, Solana (SOL) down 9% to $121, and Dogecoin (DOGE) diving 8% to $0.166.

Stock markets are similarly showing losses so far Monday, with the Nasdaq plunging by more than 3% and the S&P 500 down 1.8%. Traders are pulling back ahead of crucial economic reports expected later this week—including the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) updates—that will indicate whether inflation is being kept under control.

Thailand’s financial regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expanding its list of approved cryptocurrencies with the two largest stablecoins, Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC as trading pairs on digital asset exchanges.

Previously, only bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), XRP, stellar (XLM), and certain tokens used in the Bank of Thailand’s settlement system were approved by the regulator. 

The move comes after a public consultation in February, during which most respondents backed the proposal. The new rules from the  will take effect on March 16.

By recognizing USDT and USDC, Thailand is aligning itself with global trends where stablecoins play a key role in crypto trading and payments. Stablecoins are one of the fastest-growing sectors of crypto, driven by demand in developing regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America. USDT has a $142 billion market capitalization, followed by USDC with its $58 billion market cap.USDT issuer Tether said on Monday that the approval paves the way for broader acceptance of its token in Thailand’s financial sector.Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

In what's being touted as a first for the American casino industry, Choctaw Casinos & Resorts has partnered with Bitline and Everi to offer cryptocurrency as a source of liquidity for gaming patrons. The collaboration introduces a new financial option for casino visitors, marking the first time digital assets can be directly used for casino chip access in the U.S. regulated market.

Bitline, a Miami-based company, specializes in providing casino chip access directly from cryptocurrency, enabling transactions of up to $10 million in casino chips within minutes, depending on blockchain network demand. 

This new functionality is made possible through Bitline’s integration with Everi’s CashClub payment infrastructure, which offers a compliant process for boarding, screening, and verifying patrons who wish to leverage digital assets.

The partnership aims to meet the growing demand for cryptocurrency solutions in the gaming industry. It creates a replicable model that offers casinos and their patrons alternative ways to manage funds, access liquidity, and utilize digital assets.

The rollout of this technology at Choctaw Casinos & Resorts sets a new precedent for financial accessibility and convenience in the sector, according to the partners.

“This collaboration is just the beginning of our vision to modernize casino payment capabilities on a global scale,” said Richard Jones, CEO of Bitline. “We’re entering an era where digital assets can fundamentally enhance the gaming experience, providing casino operators with a future-ready financial framework.”

Everi’s SVP of Product Management, Payments Solutions, Victor Newsom, emphasized the compliance and security benefits of the integration. “Choctaw’s patrons are now no longer limited to the access, times, amount, and speed constraints of the legacy financial systems,” he said, highlighting how the solution reduces risks for casinos.

The Choctaw Casinos & Resorts integration is the first step in Bitline’s broader mission to bring cryptocurrency payment options to the global casino sector. As digital assets gain momentum in the gaming market, Bitline plans to expand its services to other major casinos and markets, aiming to establish cryptocurrency as a standard feature of the gaming experience.

The service officially launched on March 7, 2025, with the first transaction completed at Choctaw’s Durant, Oklahoma location. Patrons can use popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and Circle (USDC), as outlined in Choctaw Casinos’ cryptocurrency FAQ page.

Thomas McDonald, Senior Director of Cage and Credit at Choctaw Casinos & Resorts, expressed excitement about the new offering. “Through our long-term relationship with Everi, a leader in fintech solutions, we will continue to invest in innovative offerings that provide the discerning gaming VIP access to funds in a safe and secure manner,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.yogonet.com', 'title': 'Yogonet International'}"

Ethereum (ETH) is down 2% on Monday, trading near the $2,000 psychological level despite increased exchange net outflows. The sustained negative market sentiment is potentially coming from crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) investors who have continued to scale down their holdings.

Ethereum saw one of its highest exchange weekly net outflows last week following its decline to the $2,000 psychological level. Crypto exchanges witnessed an ETH net outflow of about $1.8 billion last week, the highest weekly amount since December 2022, according to IntoTheBlock's data.

""Despite ongoing pessimism around Ether prices, this trend suggests many holders see current levels as a strategic buying opportunity,"" wrote IntoTheBlock analysts in an X post on Monday.

An increase in exchange net outflows indicates high buying pressure, while vice versa for inflows.

The increased buy-the-dip attitude near $2,000 suggests ETH could be primed for a recovery, but institutional investors' selling pressure is weighing on the crypto market.

While crypto-native investors are buying the dip, institutional investors are depleting their holdings. This is visible in US spot ETH ETFs' flows, which show a net outflow of about $94 million last week, per Coinglass data. Unlike exchange net outflows, rising ETF outflows indicate higher selling pressure.

A potential reason for the selling activity is crypto's rising correlation to traditional stocks and macroeconomic conditions. The S&P 500 has declined by over 450 points since hitting an all-time high on February 19, showing increased risk-off sentiments amid President Donald Trump's tariff decisions on US international trading partners.

With the same traditional stock players also treading the crypto market via Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the prices of top cryptos may remain subdued by their investment sentiment. According to a CoinShares report on Monday, crypto ETFs have lost $4.75 billion in the past four weeks.

Ethereum experienced $117.96 million in futures liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of long and short liquidations accounted for $81.01 million and $36.94 million, respectively.

ETH is struggling to hold the $2,000 psychological level after sustaining a weekly candlestick close below the $2,200 critical level last week. If the bearish pressure extends throughout the new week, ETH could decline toward the next key support level at $1,500.



ETH/USDT daily chart

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators are below their neutral levels, indicating dominant bearish momentum.

However, the Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) is deep in the oversold region, signaling a potential reversal. As a result, ETH could flip the bearish pressure if it pulls a high volume move above $2,200 and smashes a key ascending trendline resistance.

A weekly candlestick close below $1,500 will invalidate the thesis and potentially send ETH below the $1,000 psychological level.

Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain with smart contracts functionality. Its native currency Ether (ETH), is the second-largest cryptocurrency and number one altcoin by market capitalization. The Ethereum network is tailored for building crypto solutions like decentralized finance (DeFi), GameFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), etc.

Ethereum is a public decentralized blockchain technology, where developers can build and deploy applications that function without the need for a central authority. To make this easier, the network leverages the Solidity programming language and Ethereum virtual machine which helps developers create and launch applications with smart contract functionality.

Smart contracts are publicly verifiable codes that automates agreements between two or more parties. Basically, these codes self-execute encoded actions when predetermined conditions are met.

Staking is a process of earning yield on your idle crypto assets by locking them in a crypto protocol for a specified duration as a means of contributing to its security. Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism on September 15, 2022, in an event christened “The Merge.” The Merge was a key part of Ethereum's roadmap to achieve high-level scalability, decentralization and security while remaining sustainable. Unlike PoW, which requires the use of expensive hardware, PoS reduces the barrier of entry for validators by leveraging the use of crypto tokens as the core foundation of its consensus process.

Gas is the unit for measuring transaction fees that users pay for conducting transactions on Ethereum. During periods of network congestion, gas can be extremely high, causing validators to prioritize transactions based on their fees.

The move reflects a trend of traditional exchanges entering the cryptocurrency derivatives market to provide a regulated platform for trading digital assets

Singapore Exchange (SGX) plans to list bitcoin perpetual futures as traditional exchanges push deeper into cryptocurrency derivative markets.

Singapore’s largest exchange group intends to launch the contracts in the second half of 2025, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The company will strictly target institutional clients and professional investors, with retail customers barred from trading the instruments.

The move was the latest sign that established exchange operators were branching out into bitcoin derivatives, as US President Donald Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency agenda boosts demand for digital assets’ exposure.

Bloomberg reported on March 4 that Japan’s Osaka Dojima Exchange Inc., which traced its roots to the 18th century, was planning to seek approval to list bitcoin futures.

SGX hoped to act as a bridge between regulated financial markets and the freewheeling world of cryptocurrency trading. The firm thinks its offering will “significantly expand institutional market access,” the spokesperson said.

The planned products were still awaiting approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

Perpetual futures – which do not have an expiry date – are a way for traders to bet on price changes in an underlying asset without needing to own the asset itself. SGX was not the only exchange looking to launch the contracts in Singapore: in January 2024, Hoboken, New Jersey-based EDX Markets LLC, a digital-asset firm backed by Citadel Securities, revealed plans to offer the instruments in the city state.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}"

Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, asserted on Sunday, March 9, that US President Donald Trump will hold off on further Bitcoin purchases until it reaches a price close to $60,000. Park’s remarks, shared via his official account on X, were made against the backdrop of growing speculation around so-called “budget-neutral” methods the administration might use to acquire additional BTC for the recently established US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

On March 6, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order creating the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, positioning the United States to maintain a leading role in the digital asset space. The administration confirmed that it already controls roughly 200,000 BTC—valued at around $17 billion at current prices—seized primarily through criminal and civil asset forfeiture proceedings – pending an audit. While the Executive Order prohibits selling Bitcoin within the reserve, it directs the Secretaries of the Treasury and Commerce to study “budget-neutral” ways of accumulating additional BTC in the future, ensuring no extra cost to taxpayers.

Jeff Park’s perspective cuts through the standard market commentary, focusing instead on the political realities that, he believes, heavily influence any presidential decision to buy BTC. In one of his posts, Park writes: “I’m going to let you in on a little secret from my primary field experience on how the BTC pitch works… I know one thing better about institutions than almost anyone else: public officials almost never buy bitcoin on trend/momentum and certainly not at the highs. The reason is simple – they don’t want to get fired when the inevitable drawdown hits or worse, ruin their reputation in the public domain.”

He goes on to argue that political figures, especially one as scrutinized as the US President, face an asymmetric risk profile. The fallout from buying at a higher price—only to see the market correct—can be devastating from a public-relations standpoint. Park surmises that the incentives for officials shift dramatically when BTC dips to more attractive levels.

He notes: “Can you imagine the headlines that will come for Trump if he buys bitcoin at $100k and it goes to $70k? On the positive side, if BTC gets to very cheap levels, the incentives for politicians and sovereigns to buy will increase… It is always +EV for the incentive calculation of an executive branch (which must win elections) to wait for BTC to get to $60k and buy and take credit.”

Park stresses that while a strategic reserve might be intended as a long-term store of value, public officials seek to avoid backlash in the event of immediate downside price volatility. This underlying political pressure, he contends, makes them less likely to make “high-risk” moves—especially ones that might expose them to questions about accountability.

The newly formed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, often branded by the administration as a “digital Fort Knox,” is explicitly designed to remain untouched over the long haul. White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks has likened it to “a 21st-century bulwark of national financial security,” underscoring the administration’s ambitions for American cryptocurrency leadership.

However, Park argues that certain conditions must be met for a reserve program to gain genuine traction. Among them are “programmatic buying vs discretionary ‘studies,’” shared decision-making (to distribute accountability), and an element of permanence—either through legislative safeguards or authoritative action undertaken behind closed doors.

Park’s admiration for public pension Chief Investment Officers who have proactively incorporated Bitcoin also highlights the contrast in decision-making timelines: “This is at the core why I give so much RESPECT to the public pension CIOs that have bought BTC or invested in crypto strategies. They are simply true patriots – committed to long-term thinking for the benefit of all against the potential privatized loss of one’s self. Heroes.”

His applause underscores how these executives, unlike politicians seeking reelection or mindful of wide public scrutiny, often have more leeway to invest for the long haul, provided they have fiduciary guardrails in place.

At press time, BTC traded at $82,389.

The prospect of wealthy individuals purchasing a path to U.S. residency through a “gold card” initiative has raised eyebrows in the world of cryptocurrency. But what if Bitcoin—one of the world’s most popular digital assets—could be used as a form of payment for this coveted card? This proposal, put forward by David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc., suggests that Bitcoin could help fuel the United States’ growing Bitcoin reserve, all while offering an innovative approach to the Trump administration’s gold card initiative.



The idea of a “gold card” was first brought into the public eye by former President Donald Trump in February 2025. His vision was to create a paid alternative to the traditional green card, offering the ultra-wealthy a fast track to U.S. residency and potential citizenship. The proposed cost of entry? A hefty $5 million.

Trump’s statement resonated with high-net-worth individuals, especially those from emerging markets, who might find it challenging to move significant amounts of money, such as $5 million, out of their home countries. The gold card would not only allow entry to the U.S. but would also offer green card privileges, which include the ability to live, work, and eventually gain citizenship in the country.

But the road to residency via this gold card isn’t as straightforward as it may seem. Many of the potential buyers—wealthy elites from places like Russia and China—face stiff regulations when it comes to transferring large sums of money across borders. This is where cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, comes into play.

David Bailey, who attended the Trump administration’s recent crypto summit, saw an opportunity to merge two of Trump’s policies: the proposed gold card and the strategic Bitcoin reserve (SBR) initiative. Bailey suggests that Bitcoin could offer a viable and practical way for these wealthy individuals to pay for their gold card without navigating the traditional banking system, thus sidestepping potential restrictions on international money transfers.

On social media, Bailey commented on the advantages of using Bitcoin as a payment method for the gold card:

“Many elites in emerging markets want to live in the U.S. but struggle to move $5M in USD out of their home countries. Bitcoin offers a simpler, safer, and more discreet solution.”

This proposal isn’t just a convenience for foreign investors—it could also serve a larger economic strategy. By allowing Bitcoin to be used for the purchase of gold cards, the U.S. could potentially add to its strategic Bitcoin reserve without the use of taxpayer funds. The reserve would be built from the influx of Bitcoin payments from wealthy individuals, contributing to the country’s growing stockpile of the digital currency, which could be valuable for both economic and geopolitical purposes.

The idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve has gained traction, especially with the ongoing efforts by the U.S. government to integrate more cryptocurrency-related policies into its financial infrastructure. This reserve would serve as a national stockpile of Bitcoin, which could be utilized for various purposes, including reinforcing the U.S.’s standing in global financial markets and providing an alternative store of value to traditional assets like gold.

Bailey’s proposal would align with the broader vision of the Trump administration, which has been keen on building the reserve to bolster the nation’s economic standing. By incorporating Bitcoin payments for the gold card program, the U.S. could further increase its strategic stockpile without needing to divert taxpayer resources, presenting a win-win scenario for both the government and foreign investors.

Bitcoin’s potential to revolutionize financial systems is no secret. As a decentralized, borderless digital asset, it offers a secure and efficient way to transfer wealth across borders. For the wealthy individuals seeking U.S. residency through the gold card initiative, Bitcoin provides a solution that avoids the cumbersome regulations typically involved in traditional currency transfers.

In addition, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge against inflation and economic instability, making it a desirable asset for those seeking to diversify their portfolios. By allowing Bitcoin to be used in this context, the U.S. would be positioning itself as a leader in the global cryptocurrency movement, attracting international investors and strengthening its own digital reserve.

The idea of using Bitcoin to purchase a path to U.S. residency could be the first step in a larger shift toward integrating cryptocurrency into official government programs. While the concept of a Bitcoin-based gold card is still in its early stages, the growing interest in cryptocurrency and its potential to reshape financial and immigration policies suggests that this idea could gain momentum in the coming years.

Furthermore, as more countries begin to adopt crypto-friendly policies, the U.S. might find itself competing for the attention of wealthy global citizens looking for more flexible and secure ways to move their money and assets. By embracing Bitcoin and integrating it into national programs, the U.S. could set a precedent for other nations to follow.

David Bailey’s suggestion to use Bitcoin for the proposed gold card offers a glimpse into the future of cryptocurrency integration with national policies. By allowing wealthy individuals to use Bitcoin to pay for residency privileges, the U.S. could both attract global elites and bolster its own Bitcoin reserves without relying on taxpayer funding. Whether or not this idea will become a reality remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the intersection of cryptocurrency and immigration policy could usher in a new era of global finance and residency programs.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reaffirmed that cryptocurrency activities are permissible in the federal banking system, namely crypto-asset custody, certain stablecoin activities, and participation in independent node verification networks such as DLTs.

More specifically, the OCC published Interpretive Letter 1183 which confirms that a number of key crypto activities are permissible for national banks and federal savings associations.

Specifically, Interpretive Letter 1183 states that OCC-supervised institutions may engage in crypto-asset custody, certain stablecoin activities, and participation in independent node verification networks such as DLT.

Also, critically, Interpretive Letter 1183 confirms the removal of the requirements to receive supervisory nonobjection and demonstrate that they have adequate controls in place before they can engage in these cryptocurrency activities.

Additionally, the OCC withdrew its participation in the joint statement on crypto-asset risks and liquidity risks to banking organizations resulting from crypto-asset market vulnerabilities.

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood said:



“The OCC expects banks to have the same strong risk management controls in place to support novel bank activities as they do for traditional ones. Today’s action will reduce the burden on banks to engage in crypto-related activities and ensure that these bank activities are treated consistently by the OCC, regardless of the underlying technology. I will continue to work diligently to ensure regulations are effective and not excessive, while maintaining a strong federal banking system.”



A very important announcement, which means that banking institutions and other OCC accountable entities have been given the green light to an unprecedentedly wide range of crypto activities, and the entire crypto sector that they had been totally blocked from.

We can probably expect a very large-scale integration of new players into the crypto industry in the near future, and the market will have a lot of liquidity to swallow. Stay tuned for updates and be aware of the rapidly evolving regulation and crypto landscape.

The price of Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, collapsed to an intraday low of $79,355 on the Bitstamp exchange at 14:19 UTC. 

This is the first time that the cryptocurrency has plunged below the aforementioned level since Feb. 28. Back then, the leading coin reached an intraday low of $78,197 before soaring by nearly 22% within the span of just three days to reach a local peak of $95,192 on March 2. 

The cryptocurrency hit the aforementioned local peak when it was announced that Bitcoin would be ""at the heart"" of the strategic crypto reserve in the U.S. 

However, the enthusiasm surrounding the reserve quickly faded, with Bitcoin collapsing to an intraday low of $81,463 in just two days since the official confirmation. 

The leading cryptocurrency company has suffered from global economic headwinds along with other risk assets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index is now down by more than 7% since the start of the year.

Since President Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, bitcoin (BTC) has dropped from $109,000 to $80,000, making it a classic ""sell the news"" event. The correction has continued since the digital assets summit on Friday. 

While the price action may dictate short-term bearishness, bitcoin bulls could view it as a long-term positive catalyst, as the U.S. administration has shifted from a hostile stance under the previous administration to a more favorable one. However, the lack of immediate buying pressure suggests short-term weakness.

A similar price action occurred during the much-anticipated launch of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. From October 2023 to January 2024, bitcoin surged from $25,000 to $49,000—over a 40% rally. However, the launch marked a local top, as the price subsequently declined by 20% over the following weeks before eventually reaching new all-time highs above $73,000 in March.

This time, after President Trump won the U.S. election in November, bitcoin rallied 60%, hitting an all-time high of $109,000 in January before undergoing a nearly 30% correction.

The common pattern in both instances is that bullish news triggered a local top in bitcoin’s price, followed by a significant correction. The next variable is will bitcoin start to move higher after this correction has finished, with a lot depending on the macro landscape.

Digital asset market faces $4.75 billion monthly outflow, hitting lowest AUM since 2024.

Digital asset investment products continued their losing streak for the fourth consecutive week, with outflows reaching $876 million, according to CoinShares‘ latest report.

James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, noted that while the rate of capital flight has slowed, investors remain cautious amid the bearish market situation.

He said the outflow brought the total outflows for the past month to $4.75 billion, while year-to-date inflows slipped to $2.6 billion.

At the same time, total assets under management (AUM) also fell by $39 billion, settling at $142 billion—the lowest level since mid-November 2024.

The US accounted for the largest share of outflows, with investors withdrawing approximately $922 million.

This came despite President Donald Trump’s announcement of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, making the top crypto a major financial asset for the global financial system.

During the period, institutional investment vehicles were among the hardest hit. Fidelity’s FBTC, BlackRock’s IBIT, and Ark21Shares all saw outflows exceeding $133 million each.

Meanwhile, investors in Switzerland, Canada, and Germany took advantage of the dip, contributing inflows of $23 million, $47 million, and $13.3 million, respectively.

Across digital assets, Bitcoin experienced the heaviest outflows, with $756 million exiting the top crypto.

The downturn coincided with a sharp price drop, as BTC fell nearly 15% last week, sliding from around $94,318 to as low as $80,085, according to CryptoSlate data. This decline triggered a wave of liquidations across the crypto market, further dampening sentiment.

Meanwhile, short-Bitcoin products saw outflows of $19.8 million—their largest since December 2024.

Ethereum, Tron, and Aave suffered outflows of $89 million, $32 million, and $2.4 million, respectively. On the other hand, Solana, XRP, and Sui attracted inflows of $16.4 million, $5.6 million, and $2.7 million.

Additionally, blockchain-related equity exchange-traded products (ETPs) were not spared from the broader market decline, recording $48 million in outflows last week.

Bitcoin (BTC) hovers around $82,000 on Monday after falling nearly 15% last week. This price correction triggered a series of liquidations across the crypto market, totaling $687.73 million in the past 24 hours. A QCP Capital report highlights that momentum was derailed by the Bybit hackers cashing out at least $300 million of their record-breaking $1.5 billion crypto heist on Sunday, causing BTC to decline again.

Bitcoin price recovers slightly, trading at around $82,800, during the European session on Monday after falling nearly 15% last week. Only on Sunday, BTC dipped more than 6%, reaching a low of $80,000. 

This price correction triggered a series of liquidations across the crypto market, totaling $687.73 million in the past 24 hours. The largest single liquidation order happened on Binance- BTCUSDT, valued at $32.09 million, according to Coinglass data.

In an exclusive interview, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told FXStreet, “Bitcoin is expected to face a critical week of price movement with support levels between $70,000 and $75,000 and a pivotal resistance zone around $85,000-$87,000.”

Lee explained that a failure to maintain the $77,000 level could lead BTC to test the lower range of $70,000-$72,000. However, if the market sees a recovery, a potential bounce from $75,000 could push the price back into the $80,000-$85,000 range.

In the interview, Lee further explained that the most likely scenario for this week suggests a mid-week test of $72,000-$75,000, with Bitcoin stabilizing near $83,000 by March 18-19, depending on broader market sentiment and external factors like regulatory news and upcoming FOMC meeting.

Moreover, QCP Capital’s report highlights that risk assets, such as US equities and BTC, are currently trading near their recent lows, and with tariff risks still looming, volatility could pick up, heading into key US macro data releases — Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday and Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday.

The report continued that Friday’s Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) data last week provided some relief for equities and crypto, reinforcing expectations of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in May.

The report further explained that the stage seemed set for a steady recovery this week. However, this momentum was derailed by the Bybit hackers cashing out at least $300 million of their record-breaking $1.5 billion crypto heist during thin liquidity hours on Sunday, causing BTC to decline again.

“Today’s price selloff may also be exacerbated by holders preemptively front-running further hacker-driven supply, now that the hackers have shown a willingness to cash out rather than risk further losses — having already seen their stolen assets depreciate by 25%. In response, risk reversals have become even more bid for Puts over the past 24 hours, reflecting growing concerns over additional selling pressure,” says QCP’s analyst.

Bitcoin price broke and closed below its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,754 on Sunday, declining by 6.37%. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers at around $81,800.

If BTC continues its downward trend, it could extend the decline to test the February 28 low of $78,258. A successful close below this level would extend an additional decline to retest its next support level at $73,072.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 36, after being rejected from its neutral level of 50 last week, indicating a bearish momentum. Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator also showed a bearish crossover on Sunday, giving a sell signal and suggesting a downward trend.

On the contrary, if BTC recovers, it could extend the recovery to $85,000.

(This story was corrected on March 10 at 12:12 GMT to say that liquidations totaled $687.73 million in the past 24 hours, not $687.73 in the past 24 hours.)

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Cryptocurrencies market capitalization decreased to $2.7 trillion on Monday, shedding another 3% in the last 24 hours. DeFi protocols market capitalization grew by $3.5 billion, with Hyper Liquid, Mantle and Ethena posting significant gains.

Bitcoin (BTC) hovers around $82,000 on Monday after falling nearly 15% last week. This price correction triggered a series of liquidations across the crypto market, totaling $687.73 million in the past 24 hours.

Dogecoin (DOGE) hovers around $0.173 on Monday after crashing nearly 30% last week. The recent correction in DOGE has triggered a wave of over $22 million in liquidations in the last 24 hours and more than $78 million last week. 

The overall crypto market capitalization lost over $440 million last week; on Monday, it reads $2.66 trillion. The reaction to Trump’s announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve wasn’t what many expected as the market continued to correct. 

Bitcoin price extends its decline on Friday, falling over 5% so far this week. BTC uncertainty and volatility spikes liquidated $1.67 billion as the first-ever White House Crypto Summit takes place on Friday.

Blockchain firm Movement's public mainnet is set to launch in beta, continuing the progress toward deploying Movement Virtual Machine (MoveVM) on Ethereum.

The mainnet will roll out Monday with over $233 million worth of BTC, ETH, and native assets, MOVE, in liquidity raised through Movement's Cornucopia program.

Movement's mainnet will allow smart contract deployment and allows anyone to build on and use the network for the first time, the Movement Network Foundation announced via email on Monday.

Move was developed by Facebook as part of its plans to develop its own digital currency, which was abandoned in early 2022. 

The technology was subsequently used to create layer-1 networks Sui and Aptos, as well as Movement Labs extending the programming language to develop an Ethereum layer 2.

A whale, likely armed with insider info, made another $2.15M profit in just 50 minutes. The trader sold 947 ETH for $1.95M USDC and then deposited it into Hyperliquid to open a long position on ETH with 50x leverage. The position ballooned to 25,095 ETH (worth $53.7M) before the whale closed out as ETH surged, locking in the impressive profit. This is the same trader who previously netted $6.8M on BTC and ETH before Trump’s executive order.

Investor sentiment has reached levels not seen since 2022, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropping to a near three-year low of 20. This steep decline reflects heightened fear among investors, driven by regulatory uncertainty and recent price volatility. Historically, such low sentiment levels have preceded market bottoms, suggesting that this downturn may present a potential buying opportunity for contrarian investors looking to capitalize on future recovery. However, on-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that the average monthly Fear & Greed Index has declined to a more acceptable level, suggesting that selling pressure might be easing.

Bloomberg’s senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone warned that Bitcoin might plunge to $70,000 amid renewed market fear. Despite excitement over the U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve, Bitcoin-to-gold ratio has dropped to 28X and may fall to 21X, signaling underperformance. McGlone noted that if the U.S. stock market reverses some of last year’s $12 trillion advance, Bitcoin could continue to struggle. Anti-crypto commentator Peter Schiff believes the current correction is overdue and may persist through the decade.

March 10, 2025 08:51:06 UTC

The total crypto market cap fell by $148 billion in the past 24 hours as investor sentiment turned sharply negative. Concerns over US President Donald Trump’s ambiguous stance on a potential recession fueled uncertainty in financial markets. This lack of clear direction triggered widespread sell-offs, forcing major digital assets into decline, with Bitcoin dropping to $80,000 and Ether slipping below $2,000. Combined with broader macroeconomic worries, these factors have led to today’s steep downturn in the crypto market indeed.

March 10, 2025 08:51:06 UTC

The crypto market kicked off the week with a sharp downturn, wiping out $620.5 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin dropped as low as $80,000 over the weekend, triggering widespread margin calls and forcing many leveraged traders out of positions. Long positions suffered the most, with Bitcoin alone losing nearly $240 million. Analysts warn that if Bitcoin fails to hold around $78,000, it could fall further to about $75,000, adding to the market’s volatility. Altcoins, including Ethereum, also saw significant declines amid rising risk-off sentiment.

March 10, 2025 08:47:38 UTC

Ethereum is under strong selling pressure, dropping below $2,000 earlier today and risking a fall to around $1,250 if support fails. Over the past week, ETH has lost more than 16%, pushing its year-to-date losses over 37%. ETF outflows and significant liquidations add to the bearish outlook. However, major whales are accumulating ETH, and 600,000 tokens were withdrawn from exchanges, suggesting long-term holding. Bulls must reclaim the $2,460 resistance to spark a recovery.

March 10, 2025 08:44:41 UTC

US stock market futures fell sharply at the open, with the Dow down over 300 points and the Nasdaq 100 down 1%. This steep decline in traditional markets has been mirrored in the crypto space, where falling prices signal a growing risk-off sentiment among investors. The downturn reflects heightened caution amid current uncertainties, as market participants brace for further volatility and closely watch economic and geopolitical developments.

March 10, 2025 07:50:57 UTC

Another Sunday selloff in crypto saw Bitcoin drop to $80,000 at 7 pm ET, marking a 7% decline over 24 hours. Despite a brief bounce to $80,700, BTC is headed toward its 2025 low of about $78,000. Other major coins, including Ether, Solana, and XRP, fell similarly, while Cardano and Dogecoin dropped around 12%. On Fox News, President Trump warned his tariff and budget-cutting policies might cause disruptions. US stock index futures also declined by roughly 0.85% overall.

March 10, 2025 07:50:57 UTC

Pi Coin price fell to as low as $1.26 before rebounding to $1.41, representing a 12% daily drop and 16% weekly. This downturn reflects the broader crypto market correction, as Bitcoin briefly plunged to $80,000 and many altcoins are in the red. Additionally, Binance’s inaction on PI trading—despite an 86% community vote in favor of listing—may be dampening liquidity, while other exchanges like Bitget, OKX, and MEXC have already enabled trading.

The North Texas Mean Green have made some big moves in just their second season in the American Athletic Conference.

UNT is seeking its first NCAA Tournament appearance in four seasons, but will likely need to win the conference tournament to get a bid.

Legal tampering — or the ""negotiation period"" as the NFL calls it — is officially here.

From now through the start of the new league year at 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday, teams are allowed to negotiate with representatives of free agents and work out new contracts.

Sam Darnold, who is No. 1 on Frank Schwab's top 25 overall free agents list, is reportedly signing a three-year, $100.5 million deal with the Seattle Seahawks, per ESPN and NFL Network.

That's not all for high-profile QB movement: The New York Jets are reportedly signing Justin Fields to a two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million guaranteed.

Earlier in the day, Tampa Bay opened the negotiation period with a bang, reportedly agreeing to re-sign wide receiver Chris Godwin to a three-year, $66 million deal and adding pass rusher Haason Reddick on a one-year, $14 million deal.

Defensive tackle Milton Williams, who's No. 2 on Schwab's top 25 list, is reportedly headed to the New England Patriots after helping the Philadelphia Eagles and their dominant defense win the Super Bowl.

Also from Monday:

Jimmy Garoppolo is reportedly staying with the Los Angeles Rams on a one-year deal

The Panthers made Jaycee Horn the new highest-paid defensive back in NFL history with a four-year, $100 million extension

The Chargers are bringing Khalil Mack back on a one-year, $18 million deal

And here's a rundown of an eventful Sunday:

DK Metcalf reportedly traded from the Seattle Seahawks to the Pittsburgh Steelers and will sign a $150 million contract

Davante Adams signing with the Los Angeles Rams on a two-year, $46 million deal

Josh Allen reportedly agrees to six-year, $330 million extension with the Buffalo Bills including a record $250 million guaranteed

Myles Garrett agrees to an extension with the Cleveland Browns for a reported $123.5 million guaranteed and $40 million a year, a record for a non-quarterback

Aaron Jones is re-signing with the Minnesota Vikings for a reported two years and $20 million

Von Miller cut by the Buffalo Bills in a reported cost-cutting move

Listen: Defensive free agency preview

The Seattle Seahawks have their new quarterback. After trading Geno Smith to the Raiders, the Seahawks have agreed to a 3-year contract with former Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold valued at $100.5M with $55 million guaranteed, NFL Network reports.

A former first-round pick of the Jets who flamed out in New York, Darnold revived his career in Minnesota with a career campaign last season that resulted in his first Pro Bowl berth. Darnold led the Vikings to a 14-3 record, but raised concerns with poor performances in Minnesota's season finale loss to the Lions and a wild-card loss to the Rams.

The Vikings ultimately let Darnold walk and will presumably move forward with second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who missed his rookie season with a knee injury. The Seahawks, meanwhile, will retool around Darnold.

The Chicago Bears are shoring up their defensive line, signing former Indianapolis Colts defensive end Dayo Odeyingbo to a three-year deal, per multiple reports. Odeyingbo's deal is worth $48 million, with $32 million guaranteed.

Odeyingbo was drafted by the Colts in 2021, and spent the past four years in Indianapolis. He started in 14 games last year, recording 13 solo tackles, three sacks and two forced fumbles.

As a flurry of other NFL news hits, the Indianapolis Colts are locking a defensive back for the long term. Safety Camryn Bynum has agreed to a four-year, $60 million deal to join the Colts, per NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.

Drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in 2021, Bynum has spent the past four seasons with the Vikings. Last season, he recorded 54 solo tackles and three interceptions while starting all 17 games.

The Jets are set to sign quarterback Justin Fields on a 2-year, $40 million deal with $30 million guaranteed, according to multiple reports. Fields spent the 2024 season with the Steelers, starting six games and throwing for 1,106 yards and five touchdowns.

The Jets moved on from Aaron Rodgers after two seasons with him at the helm.

Read more on the Jets' big move here.

After reports earlier that former Eagles DT Milton Williams was finalizing a deal with the Panthers, now comes news that he's signing with the Patriots, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo.

He's reportedly getting $26 million a year as New England revamps its defense under new head coach Mike Vrabel.

Stay frosty!

The Carolina Panthers and former Raiders safety Tre'von Moehrig have agreed to a three-year, $51 million contract, Fox Sports reports. Moehrig, 25, was a four-year starter with the Raiders since they selected him in the second round of the 2021 draft and one of the top safeties available in free agency.

The Detroit Lions have reached a deal with former Jets starting cornerback D.J. Reed.

Reed, 28, announced the deal on social media before deleting his post. Per Fox Sports, the deal is for three years and $48 million with $32 million guaranteed. Reed joins the Lions to play opposite Terrion Arnold after cornerback Carlton Davis left to sign with the Patriots.

The Minnesota Vikings have reached a two-year, $15 million deal with former Eagles cornerback Isaiah Rodgers, ESPN reports. The contract includes $8 million in guaranteed money. Rodgers played in 15 games primarily as a backup Philadelphia last season.

The New England Patriots and offensive tackle Morgan Moses have agreed to a three-year, $24 million contract with escalators that can increase its value to $28.5 million, NFL Network reports. Moses, 34, played right tackle for the Jets last season and will now protect second-year quarterback Drake Maye.

The Texans are signing special teamer/defensive back Tremon Smith to a two-year deal worth up to $7.5 million, NFL Network reports. The deal is the richest in the NFL for a core special teamer, according to the report.

Defensive end Derek Barnett is returning to the Houston Texans on a one-year, $5 million deal, NFL Network reports. Barnett, 28, recorded five sacks, seven quarterback hits and 26 combined tackles for the Texans last season.

Former Steelers left tackle Dan Moore is getting paid.

Moore and the Tennessee Titans reportedly agreed to a four-year, $82 million deal with $50 million guaranteed and $30 million this upcoming season, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

Moore started 66 games the past four years for Pittsburgh, though Broderick Jones has been expected to slide over to left tackle full-time, which helped usher Moore onto the open market.

Carlton Davis is reportedly signing a three-year, $60 million deal with the New England Patriots, per NFL Network's Tom Pelissero. Davis is also getting a reported $34.5 million guaranteed.

After spending the first six years of his career in Tampa Bay, which included a Super Bowl title, Davis was traded to the Detroit Lions last spring. Now he cashes in as part of the Patriots' defensive revamp and will team with Christian Gonzalez to instantly form one of the NFL's better cornerback duos.

Former Eagles DT Milton Williams, who was instrumental on their dominant defense en route to a Super Bowl title this past postseason, is close to signing with the Carolina Panthers, per The Athletic's Dianna Russini. NFL Media reports that the Cardinals and one other team are also trying to make a late play at the start defender.

Williams is ranked No. 2 on Frank Schwab's top 25 overall free agents list, and should help bolster Carolina's defense. The Panthers signed cornerback Jaycee Horn to a blockbuster extension earlier Monday.

No terms disclosed yet on the deal, but New York is strengthening its secondary with the former Saints cornerback, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo.

New head coach Mike Vrabel is adding a linebacker — he should know a thing or two about them — to his defense in the form of Robert Spillane, the former Steeler and Raider.

The deal was reported by NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, but terms were not disclosed.

After spending his entire eight-year career with the Dallas Cowboys, cornerback Jourdan Lewis is signing with the Jacksonville Jaguars, per NFL Network and Peter Schrager.

He will reportedly be the NFL's highest-paid nickel defensive back, with a deal for three years and $30 million with $20 million guaranteed, as well as $12.5 million this year.

Jimmy Garoppolo will remain Matthew Stafford's backup with the Los Angeles Rams, per NFL Network's Mike Garafolo. It's reportedly a one-year deal.

Kansas City is adding Elijah Mitchell to its backfield, per NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.

The Washington Commanders made a surprise run to the NFC championship game on the back of their offense. Now they're setting about improving their defense.

The Commanders are signing defensive tackle Javon Kinlaw to a three-year, $45 million deal with $30 million guaranteed, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

Kinlaw cashes in after signing a one-year deal with the New York Jets last season following a four-year stint with the San Francisco 49ers, who drafted him in the first round in 2020 out of South Carolina.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"
https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,Manchester City: Gareth Taylor sacked by Women's Super League side,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cevx13kj0z9o,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 17:23:04 GMT","

Gareth Taylor led Manchester City to two major trophies

Manchester City have sacked head coach Gareth Taylor just five days before the Women's League Cup final.

The 52-year-old succeeded Nick Cushing in May 2020 and led City to two major honours - but Cushing has now returned as interim boss.

City missed out on last season's Women's Super League title on goal difference and are currently fourth, 12 points adrift of defending champions Chelsea.

Taylor won his final game in charge on Sunday, as City beat Aston Villa 2-0 to reach the Women's FA Cup semi-finals.

""Manchester City prides itself on competing at the top of the WSL and on its outstanding record of qualifying for European competition,"" said managing director Charlotte O'Neill. 

""Unfortunately, results this season have so far not reached this high standard.""

City have lost four of their 16 league games and are one point outside the qualification places for the Women's Champions League, with Arsenal having a game in hand.

Cushing will be in charge for the remainder of the season, with City facing Chelsea in the League Cup final on Saturday (12:15 GMT kick-off).

City lifted the FA Cup in Taylor's first year in charge, before winning the League Cup in 2022.

In four full seasons under Taylor they did not finish outside the top four, but a late fightback by Arsenal in the penultimate game of last season cost City their first WSL title since 2016.

O'Neill added: ""With six games of the WSL campaign remaining, we believe that a change of management will breathe fresh life into our bid to ensure qualification for the 2025-26 Women's Champions League.

""We would like to place on record our thanks to Gareth for all of his efforts during his many years at City.

""Our FA Cup and League Cup triumphs will remain special moments in the history of this football club. We wish him all the best for the future.""

Cushing previously helped City win the WSL and the FA Cup, plus the League Cup twice, before leaving in January 2020 to join New York City.

He was initially assistant coach and then spent two years as head coach before being sacked by the MLS side in November.

Gareth Taylor has been a controversial figure with several players speaking out publicly about their experiences at the club during his time in charge.

England goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck described her relationship with Taylor as ""fractured"", while the dramatic circumstances surrounding forward Chloe Kelly's exit in January raised eyebrows further.

That led to divisions within the fanbase over Taylor but it is City's underwhelming performances this season that ultimately proved to be his downfall.

Despite strong runs in the domestic cups, their WSL form has fallen way below expectation and they have not made a mark in European competition during Taylor's tenure.

Injuries to key players have not helped Taylor in recent seasons but the club have largely backed him in the transfer market and given him enough resources off the pitch.

It is a bold move to make just days before their League Cup final showdown with Chelsea but, in Nick Cushing, City have an interim manager who knows a number of the players, understands the club organisation and is familiar with WSL opposition.

Hello! The trade in counterfeit football shirts is illegal. It’s also booming. We’re going inside the production line.

On the way:

Football is one of those industries that knows the price of everything but the value of nothing, or the value of fewer things than it should.

Case in point one: Manchester United charging £66 ($85) for tickets to watch their zombie-fied season (more on this to come shortly). Case in point two: replica match shirts retailing at up to £125 before any customised touches. Has the game crossed paths with the global cost-of-living crisis?

Shirt sales are a billion-dollar business within a multi-billion-dollar business. Only this morning, Liverpool announced a major new partnership with Adidas and wherever there’s a market so lucrative, counterfeit goods are sure to spring up. The Athletic’s Adam Leventhal discovered this when he stepped into the world of fake kits. In the Premier League alone, genuine tops generate revenue of close to £500m each year. Last season, almost £200m was spent on fakes.

Why? An easy answer can be found in a quote given to Adam by a social media influencer by the name of Peasy. “Myself and a lot of my friends do it because we can’t justify £80 to £120 on a football shirt,” he said. “(You) have to push what you know is probably wrong to one side because of how inaccessible football shirts can be. It’s extortionate.” Fakes cost as little as £8 — roughly the price of manufacturing real versions.

There are problems with these forgeries, though. For a start, counterfeit products are illegal and police in different parts of the world are fighting to stem the supply of them. Second, there’s no guarantee that the materials used are chemically safe, fire resistant or produced in line with any regulations. For this reason, fake tops that are seized cannot even be donated to charity.

They are also prone to scamming and the authorities say links exist between the production of illicit kits and organised crime. But no doubt because of the price of legitimate shirts, the demand for fakes is rapidly increasing.

A huge number of counterfeit shirts come out of China. One TikTok reviewer told Adam he received a commission from a Chinese e-commerce site for pushing links to its site online. A raid in the city of Hangzhou recovered a stack of tops that, according to law-enforcement officials there, was big enough to fill “20 football stadiums”.

Over time, the tiny island of Malta has become an access point to the European market, with a deep-sea port that allows boats stacked with shipping containers to dock there. An inspector in Malta, Randolph Mizzi, said the illicit production line “might be supporting terrorism, child labour, weapons of mass destruction, human trafficking or drugs”. They shred all the fake tops they can find.

In the UK, while it is not illegal to buy a fake shirt for personal use, a trademark infringement can result in a prison sentence of up to 10 years if you are involved elsewhere in the supply chain. In the United States, it can lead to five years in jail. The authorities have no choice but to tackle the supply of fake kit as a growing number of people feel they are being priced out of football. In a sport that only gets more expensive, the running battle with counterfeit copies has no end in sight.

🎙️ Adam also produced a podcast version of his super article. It’s available on Apple and Spotify.

The ticket prices at Old Trafford we mentioned? Those, along with a whole stack of grievances, were behind coordinated protests staged yesterday against Manchester United’s majority shareholder, the Glazer family. Thousands of fans took part.

Dissent towards the Glazers has been surging for well over a decade, although there’s nothing to say they’re listening or bothered. Operational control of United is now in the hands of minority partner INEOS. Only one Glazer member, the lesser-known Ed, was in town for yesterday’s 1-1 draw with Arsenal. Water, meet the duck’s back.

I saw United described as a ‘meat grinder’ over the weekend and they do have a talent for mashing whatever passes through Old Trafford. The exception to the rule is the tireless Bruno Fernandes, whose deft free kick (above) ended any pretence of Arsenal plucking the Premier League title from thin air. Stranger things have happened, certainly, but Liverpool stroll on and they aren’t letting a 15-point lead slide.

More compelling is Nottingham Forest’s pursuit of Champions League qualification, which looks like it’s coming up roses. They beat Manchester City 1-0 on Saturday, consolidating third place.

In giving up 69 per cent of possession (as per), they once again did what City used to be so good at doing in reverse: sticking to the plan, trusting the process and bending the opposition to their will. Pep Guardiola was Nuno’d — and not for the first time either.



Friday’s question was: which 10 managers, alongside Mikel Arteta, won 100 or more of their first 200 Premier League games?

They are: Guardiola (146), Jose Mourinho (137), Jurgen Klopp (127), Alex Ferguson (122), Rafa Benitez (114), Arsene Wenger (110), Claudio Ranieri (103), Pochettino (103), Gerard Houllier (101) and Kenny Dalglish (101).

Premier League: West Ham United vs Newcastle United, 4pm/8pm — USA Network, Fubo/Sky Sports.

For brazen celebrations, Graeme Souness planting a Galatasaray flag in the middle of Fenerbahce’s pitch is in a league of its own. That was his way of marking a Turkish Cup final win in 1996. It’s a miracle he made it out of the stadium alive.

Yesterday, we witnessed a watered-down version as Ardon Jashari stuck a Club Brugge flag in the centre circle at the end of their Belgian derby victory away at Cercle Brugge. The image isn’t as iconic as Souness’ trolling, but it went down with Jashari’s hosts as well as you’d expect.

Eddie George

Eddie George will leave Tennessee State University to become Bowling Green State University’s head coach, his new school announced Sunday.

George, 51, has agreed to a five-year deal with the Ohio-based Falcons of the Mid-American Conference, per ESPN.

""I am truly excited to be the head coach at Bowling Green State University,"" says George in a release.

""Bowling Green is a wonderful community that has embraced the school and the athletics department,"" he continues. ""We are eager to immerse ourselves in the community and help build this program to the greatness it deserves. I am overwhelmed with excitement and joy for the possibilities this opportunity holds.""

A former star at Ohio State, George will head back to the state where he won a Heisman Trophy in 1995. George played eight of his nine NFL seasons with the Titans, running for 10,009 yards and 64 touchdowns in 128 games.

Amid the historic local university’s financial turmoil, we examine the school’s past and future

""I'm also thrilled to be back in the great state of Ohio, where I played my college football,"" George said. ""I look forward to meeting the team, the coaches, everyone in the athletics department and everyone in the BGSU and Bowling Green community.""

George spent four seasons at Tennessee State's head coach, guiding the Tigers of the FCS to a 24-22 record.

In 2024, George led TSU to a 9-4 season that included the school’s first trip to the postseason since 2013. The Tigers lost 41-27 to No. 14 seed Montana in the first round of the FCS playoffs and finished the season ranked No. 19.

Tennessee State had earned a share of the Big South-OVC title in 2024, the Tigers’ first conference crown since winning back-to-back OVC championships in 1998 and 1999. TSU was chosen for one of 14 at-large spots to the FCS playoffs.

George was named the Big South-Ohio Valley Conference Coach of the Year in 2024, and he also finished second in the voting for the FCS' Eddie Robinson National Coach of the Year award.

In George’s first three seasons at TSU, the Tigers went 5-6 in 2021, 4-7 in 2022 and 6-5 in 2023.

At Bowling Green, George replaces Scot Loeffler, who took a job as the Philadelphia Eagles’ quarterbacks coach after guiding the Falcons to a 27-41 record over six seasons. Bowling Green has gone to bowl games in three straight seasons, and the Falcons posted 7-6 marks in each of the past two years.

A first-round pick of the former Houston Oilers in 1996, George spent eight of his nine NFL seasons with the Oilers/Titans. He was named NFL rookie of the year in 1996 and earned Pro Bowl honors four times. George was an integral part of the Titans in 1999, when the team made its only Super Bowl appearance, losing 23-16 to St. Louis.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,Why the SEC's potential record number of NCAA tourney bids is a headache for the selection committee,https://sports.yahoo.com/college-basketball/article/why-the-secs-potential-record-number-of-ncaa-tourney-bids-is-a-headache-for-the-selection-committee-123025311.html,"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 17:22:44 GMT","

Conference tournament brackets, schedules: ACC | Big 12 | Big East | Big Ten | SEC

The toughest challenge facing this year’s NCAA tournament selection committee may not be choosing between bubble teams or seeding the field from 1 to 68.

An unprecedented number of bids from a single conference could make the bracketing process more difficult than ever before.

Only six days before Selection Sunday, the SEC remains likely to eclipse the record 11 NCAA tournament bids that the 2011 Big East secured. Nine of 16 SEC men’s basketball programs are locks to make the field. Vanderbilt, Georgia and Arkansas also should sneak in. Oklahoma and Texas project as bubble teams who can bolster their cases by winning a game or two at this week’s SEC tournament.

The more NCAA tournament bids that the SEC receives, the tougher it will be for the selection committee to adhere to its bracketing principles. Opening-round matchups between teams from the same conference are flatly forbidden. Those matchups are also avoided whenever possible in the round of 32 and the Sweet 16.

As recently as last year, NCAA bracketing principles mandated that conference foes who played each other twice or more before Selection Sunday could not meet before the Sweet 16 and conference foes who faced each other three times could not meet before the Elite Eight. Teams from the same conference could only play each other as early as the round of 32 if they met no more than once during the regular season and conference tournament.

With the other power conferences absorbing former Pac-12 schools and ballooning to as many as 18 teams this year, selection committee members recognized that those bracketing principles would become more difficult to uphold. They got out ahead of the issue last July by relaxing the rules governing when conference foes can meet if one league puts nine or more teams into the NCAA tournament.

“They’ll still try to avoid having teams from the same conference meet as much as possible, but the first priority is keeping everyone on their true seed line,” said David Worlock, the NCAA’s media coordinator for March Madness, to Yahoo Sports.

In other words, if Ole Miss were to receive a No. 7 seed, the committee’s goal would be to avoid the Rebels drawing a potential second-round matchup against an SEC No. 2 seed, especially one they had already faced two or more times. But if that was the only option, the committee would rather do that than bump Ole Miss to a No. 6 or 8 seed to avoid the threat of an SEC vs. SEC matchup in the round of 32.

If history is any guide, some SEC-on-SEC crime is inevitable. Two sets of Big East teams squared off in the second round of the 2011 NCAA tournament. Third-seeded UConn dispatched sixth-seeded Cincinnati on its way to the national title and 11th-seeded Marquette upset third-seeded Syracuse.

The SEC is on pace to put as many as 13 or 14 teams in this year’s NCAA tournament because of its non-conference dominance this past November and December. The league won 88.9% of its games against other conferences, amassed a 32-16 record against the current KenPom top 50 and notched victories over the likes of Duke, Houston, Iowa State and St. John’s.

ESPN’s Joe Lunardi and other bracketologists project the SEC to receive six top-four seeds on Selection Sunday: Auburn (1), Florida (1), Tennessee (2), Alabama (2), Texas A&M (3) and Kentucky (3). By rule, the committee must place the top four SEC teams into different regions. Then it will figure out how to bracket the rest.

Though the SEC is likely to receive the most NCAA tournament bids on Sunday, it may not be the only conference that causes headaches for the committee. The Big Ten could land as many as 10 or 11 teams in the NCAA tournament field depending on how bubble teams Ohio State, Indiana and Nebraska finish. The Big 12 is likely to secure eight bids.

“Frankly, we don't think this issue is a one-off,” Warlock said. “It may not always be the SEC. It could be the Big Ten or another league that has double-digit bids. The committee is going to try to be prepared for that.”","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

DAVIDSON, N.C. (AP) — Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry will serve as an assistant general manager for Davidson College’s basketball teams.

The four-time NBA champion and two-time league MVP will be the first active player in U.S. major professional sports to take an administrative job with a college team. He will continue to play with the Warriors while serving in this newly created role.

Curry and his wife, Ayesha, and longtime Davidson supporters Don, Matt and Erica Berman, are creating an eight-figure fund to support the college’s men’s and women’s basketball teams. The college asked them to serve in these advisory roles, investing their time and sharing their experience with both men’s and women’s basketball, according to a news release on Monday.

Curry will draw resources and support from the Under Armour global sports marketing team, one of his major sponsors.

He said he wants Davidson’s scholar-athletes to be able to compete in the top ranks of college athletics in an ever-changing landscape where athletes are now allowed to profit from their name, image and likeness — something that wasn’t available when he played there for three seasons from 2006-09.

“The Davidson experience is top notch,” said Curry said, a three-time Southern Conference first-team selection at Davidson. “My journey from when I got to Davidson in 2006 to now demonstrated that I had the opportunity to play basketball at the highest level, got a great education, an amazing network through the Davidson alumni and continue to wave the Davidson flag. I want very talented, high character student-athletes to have that same experience.”

Vice president and director of athletics Chris Clunie said basketball remains Davidson’s flagship sport, but the benefits of focusing on that game extend further.

“When our basketball programs are successful,” Clunie said, “they provide much-needed revenue and exposure to support all our athletics programs and raise the overall visibility of the college.”

Davidson is 16-15 this season in men's basketball.

Curry said the goal is to invest in the next student-athlete that’s coming into Davidson.

“They don’t have to take cuts on what the market says they deserve to be part of the brand of what it means to be a Davidson scholar-athlete with integrity in your academic experience,” Curry said. ""The commitment to a four-year graduation process provides countless opportunities professionally in sports or as a game changer in life.""

Matt Berman will also serve as assistant GM alongside Curry.

“Our ability to be a resource and a sounding board for the program, but also support each student athlete, to develop personal relationships with each of them to help guide them every step of the way through their Davidson experience,” Curry said. ___

By                   Matt McDonald


National Catholic Register, Mar 10, 2025 /
            11:15 am

Males who identify as transgender women shouldn’t be allowed to play female sports and the Democratic Party should make room for pro-lifers, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on a podcast Thursday.

Newsom, 57, governor of one of the most Democratic states in America and often lampooned by conservatives as an unhinged left-winger, made the comments during an 82-minute interview with an unlikely guest: conservative Christian activist Charlie Kirk.

Newsom, widely considered a likely presidential candidate in 2028, is a strong supporter of legal and publicly funded abortion, despite being a baptized Catholic. As mayor of San Francisco in 2004, he ordered the clerk’s office to issue same-sex civil marriage licenses, which was against state law at the time.

But his comments during his “This Is Gavin Newsom” podcast have drawn widespread attention.

Newsom’s newsmaking statements came in response to Kirk’s prodding, which was spurred on by Newsom’s repeated pumping of Kirk for political advice.

“But what do you do? Seriously, Charlie Kirk, give us some advice,” Newsom said at one point.

“Get better ideas, Governor,” Kirk said. “… Like for example — you have an opportunity to, like, run to the middle and seize this mantle. Obviously you’re talking to me about people. 

“You right now should come out and be like, ‘You know what? The young man who’s about to win the state championship in the long jump in female sports, that shouldn’t happen.’ You as the governor should stay up and say, ‘No.’ Would you do something like that? Would you say, ‘No men in female sports’?”

“Well, I think it’s an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It’s deeply unfair,” Newsom said.

Kirk, the co-founder of the politically conservative advocacy organization Turning Point USA, noted that a recent poll found that 80% of Americans oppose males playing female sports. He said he could see Newsom wrestling with the issue.

“No, I’m not wrestling with it, the fairness issue. I totally agree with you,” Newsom said.

Newsom also seemed to downplay the value of using alternative pronouns for people who identify as other than male or female, saying he has only seen it happen once during a meeting during his time as governor. He also said no one in his office has ever used the purportedly gender-neutral term “Latinx.”

Again under Kirk’s prodding, Newsom praised as “brilliant” a Trump campaign spot before the presidential election last fall saying that “Kamala is for they-them. President Trump is for you.”

“Devastating. Devastating. Devastating. And she didn’t even react to it, which was more devastating,” Newsom said.

Kirk also raised the issue of abortion. He said the Democratic Party has what he called “an unhealthy purification process” that leaves the party “a bunch of people who are talking to each other.”

“For example, if there’s a pro-life Democrat, is there a place for a pro-life Democrat in the party?” Kirk asked.

(Story continues below)

“There should be,” Newsom said. “That’s principle. There should be. That’s a deeply held personal point of view. God bless.”

“And I say this as one of the biggest champions for reproductive freedom on the planet,” Newsom said.

Newsom, who still identifies as a Catholic, praised Kirk “as a man of faith, and I deeply admire that about you.”

Kirk occasionally chided Newsom for taking the Lord’s name in vain, which he did several times during the interview.

At times, Newsom sounded as if he were doing what is known in politics as opposition research — but with the goal not of discrediting his opponent but rather learning from him.

“These things are important — and by the way, it’s the reason we’re having this conversation,” Newsom said. “This is very illuminating and helpful to me, to understand sort of the animus. What is it about, you know, that animus?”

Newsom said his own 13-year-old son wanted to skip school on Thursday so he could meet Kirk, 31, who makes popular online videos based on his frequent visits to college campuses. Kirk often debates liberal students outside while inviting them to ask him anything.

Asked by Newsom how often he talks to President Donald Trump, Kirk said: “Once or twice a week.”

The conversation between Newsom and Kirk was cordial, bordering on friendly, but the two clashed on certain issues, including whether what Kirk called “pornographic” books should be eliminated from elementary schools, which Newsom called “book banning.”

On another matter, Kirk said teachers should be fired if they withhold a student’s gender transitioning at school from the child’s parents. Newsom responded: “There’s so much extreme rhetoric in this space.”

Kirk said Democrats will lose on that issue.

“Sometimes you lose on principle. It’s one of those things; everything’s not political, is the point,” Newsom said.

Newsom said Kirk and Republicans are on the unpopular side on abortion and same-sex civil marriage, which Kirk acknowledged.

But Newsom said he agreed with Kirk that Democrats are hurt by their stance on gender-identity issues.

“I deeply am mindful of the politics of this, which are very unhelpful personally,” Newsom said. “It’s unhelpful more broadly, professionally [to] the Democratic Party and our brand and one of the reasons — to your point — the Democratic Party brand has just been crushed.”

The executive order rescinds federal funds for health care providers that perform surgeries or prescribe drugs to facilitate gender transitions for anyone under age 19.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued a memorandum outlining the new policy on Friday, Feb. 7, which was made public on Monday, Feb. 10.

Crossover Day casualties include sports betting, DEI





ATLANTA - Sports betting struck out again this year in the General Assembly.

The state House of Representatives passed 75 bills Thursday in the daylong flurry of activity known as Crossover Day, the annual deadline for legislation to clear either the House or Senate to remain alive for the year. But sports betting wasn't among them.

Also left by the wayside when lawmakers gaveled out Crossover Day shortly before 11 p.m. was a Senate bid to deny state funding to Georgia K-12 public schools, colleges and universities that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), legislation in the House overhauling the process the state uses to compensate the wrongfully convicted, and a Senate bill exposing banking institutions to lawsuits if they deny services to customers because of the way they exercised their rights under the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

Legislation to ban mining adjacent to the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge and require Georgia Power to pass along the costs of power-hungry data centers to operators of those facilities rather than residential and small business customers never made it out of House committees to reach the floor of the chamber.

This year's push for online sports betting came in the form of a proposed constitutional amendment placing the issue on the statewide ballot next year and a separate ""enabling"" bill containing details on how the industry would operate in Georgia. Both made it through the House Rules Committee Thursday night, but Speaker Jon Burns, R-Newington, did not put them on the floor for a vote before Crossover Day came to an end.

""I'm disappointed,"" Rep. Marcus Wiedower, R-Watkinsville, chief sponsor of both measures, said after the gavel fell. ""A lot of work went into this. I thought it was a good measure.""

Supporters of legalizing sports betting have tried to get a statewide referendum through the General Assembly every year since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2018 legalized gambling on sports in states other than New Jersey and Nevada. Opponents - spearheaded by religious groups - have argued sports betting would lead to an increase in crime and problem gambling.

The Senate spent much of the winter focused on controversial topics, including guns and race. DEI policies -- a hot button for President Donald Trump -- were also a vehicle for Republican outrage in Georgia, where the Senate's Republican leadership had been pushing for a ban in schools and colleges.

Senate Bill 120, which was the subject of bitter hearings and press conferences in recent weeks, would have punished public educational institutions that had implemented DEI policies by withholding state funding.

The bill's chief sponsor, Sen. Marty Harbin, R- Tyrone, called such policies an ""erosion of meritocracy."" But the measure's critics said DEI helps Black students and other historically marginalized people integrate and succeed.

""People died, people were lynched, all kinds of things happened in this country that caused people that were descendants of slaves to not have an equal opportunity,"" said Roger Bruce, a former Democratic state representative who came to the Capitol for a protest.

SB 120 was scheduled as the final bill for debate in the Senate Thursday night, but the leadership ended the legislative day just before calling it up.

Another controversial culture war bill also failed to pass the Senate, although it did get a hearing and a vote on the floor.

Senate Bill 57 would have punished banks that decide not to do business with companies due to disagreement about social issues, a custom that critics call ""debanking.""

An example offered in a legislative hearing last month was Daniel Defense. The Georgia-based firearms manufacturer became a target of criticism after one of its rifles was used in the 2022 mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. The founder and chairman, Marty Daniel, testified that two banks dropped his company in quick succession, costing him $1 million each on lawyers and fees.

The bill triggered a heated debate on the Senate floor Thursday. Democrats were opposed and so were a critical mass of Republicans who worried about the potential impact on local banks. The bill got just 13 votes in favor, all Republicans, with a bipartisan opposition of 43 votes.

The House passed resolutions Thursday night to compensate five Georgians who spent years behind bars after being wrongfully convicted of crimes. However, the House did not take up a separate bill to remove the General Assembly from the process of compensating wrongfully convicted Georgians. Instead, claims for compensation would be heard by administrative law judges, who would make a recommendation to the chief justice of the state Supreme Court.

Sports betting wasn't the only cause supporters have pushed for years in the General Assembly that fizzled again in 2025. Two bills that called for either placing a five-year moratorium on mining near the Okefenokee Swamp or banning mining altogether didn't get out of the House Natural Resources & Environment Committee.

Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals is seeking state permits to open a titanium dioxide mine along Trail Ridge on the southeastern edge of the Okefenokee. Supporters say mining would draw down water levels in the swamp, threatening the largest blackwater swamp in North America and the tourist dollars it brings to the region.

""When you lose the peat from the dried-up ground, we're going to have terrible fires like they did in Southern California,"" Rep. Darlene Taylor, R-Thomasville, the bills' chief sponsor, said during a hearing last week.

Opponents said the mine would bring much-needed jobs and boost the local tax digest in an economically distressed part of the state.

Like sports betting and protecting the Okefenokee, the fight over the data centers bill also was left over from last year.

While the rapid growth of data centers in Georgia unquestionably represents a boost to the state's economy, environmental and consumer advocacy groups have warned the vast amounts of electricity they consume threaten to further drive up electric rates. They cited a series of Georgia Power rate increases during the last couple of years to cover rising fuel costs and the completion of two additional nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed a bill the General Assembly passed last year that would have temporarily suspended a state sales tax exemption aimed at attracting data centers to Georgia after business interests objected to the measure. Opponents to this year's version of the bill in the Senate Regulated Industries Committee argued that the state Public Service Commission (PSC) should oversee data centers rather than the legislature.

The PSC voted in January to prohibit the Atlanta-based utility from passing on the costs of serving new large-load customers including data centers to residential customers. But supporters of the data center bill called the commission's new rule worthless because it's full of loopholes.

While the data centers bill never got out of the committee, the Regulated Industries Committee did approve a second energy measure bringing back the Georgia Consumer Utility Counsel, a watchdog agency that was disbanded in 2008 amid budget cuts brought on by the Great Recession. However, the full Senate didn't take up the measure on Crossover Day.

The Jets currently have the No. 7 pick in the 2025 draft. Below is a compilation of mock drafts. The views expressed are not representative of any Jets personnel.

ESPN – Jordan Reid

No. 7: Edge Shemar Stewart – Texas A&M
""New Jets coach Aaron Glenn and GM Darren Mougey are in position to add an impact defender alongside Pro Bowler Quinnen Williams and star cornerback Sauce Gardner. Stewart was the talk of the combine, as he ran a 4.59-second 40-yard dash, posted a 40-inch vertical leap and had a 10-foot-11 broad jump. He is the quintessential ""potential over production"" prospect, as Stewart had only 4.5 sacks in three college seasons. But his time to first pressure (2.43 seconds) topped the FBS, suggesting there's production to be unlocked. ""He has similar size and skill set to Jadeveon Clowney because he can fit in any scheme,"" said one scout following his combine workout.""

The Athletic – Dane Brugler

No. 7: DT Mason Graham – Michigan
""Graham isn't going to blow anybody away with his length or testing (he sat out everything but the bench press at the combine), but teams are ready to trust his tape. His attitude and play style fit what Aaron Glenn wants to build in New York.""

Yahoo Sports – Nate Tice & Charles McDonald

No. 7: OT Armand Membou – Missouri
""Membou has a unique build for a tackle, but he has the length, strength and athleticism to stay out there. He is another starter on a Jets line that needs long-term solutions.""

NFL.com – Lance Zierlein

No. 7: OT Will Campbell – LSU
""Give the Jets credit: They keep trying to build the fronts. But that undertaking has produced mixed results. They swing again, and I think this one is a hit. Campbell's a player who can add toughness and football character to this lineup at right tackle.""

CBS Sports – Ryan Wilson

No. 7: WR Tetairoa McMillan – Arizona
""Tetairoa McMillan is 6-foot-4 but moves like a shifty slot receiver with the benefit of an enormous catch radius and the ability to make contested catches look easy. Think Drake London but a better athlete.""

The Athletic – Mike Sando

No. 7: QB Jaxson Dart – Ole Miss

""Former Jets GM Mike Tannenbaum, who led the team's search for its new coach and GM, recently called Dart the ""clear"" third QB in this draft. Was he priming expectations for the Jets to select Dart this early?

""They gotta get a quarterback, and this might be where Jaxson Dart goes,"" the exec projecting Dart to the Jets said. ""They are sitting there with Tyrod Taylor as their starter right now.""

Mike Vrabel's first real opportunity to improve the New England Patriots has arrived.

Monday marks the unofficial start of NFL free agency, as the league's ""legal tampering"" window opens at 12 p.m. ET, allowing teams to begin negotiating with pending free agents. While no deal can become official until the ""real"" start of free agency on Wednesday, March 12, we should see plenty of agreements reached Monday beginning at 12 p.m. ET.

The Patriots should be heavily involved on the free agent market, as they boast the most cap space in the NFL ($121.8 million, per Over The Cap) and have several critical roster needs, headlined by offensive tackle, wide receiver and edge rusher.

🏈 NFL offseason: Bills QB Josh Allen (six years, $330M) and Browns DE Myles Garrett ($40M annually) signed record-breaking extensions; Davante Adams is a Ram; the Seahawks sent Geno Smith to the Raiders and DK Metcalf to the Steelers. See all the latest moves here.

⚾️ Rays for sale? After 17 years of trying to find a new stadium, Rays owner Stu Sternberg is reportedly being pressured to sell the team by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred and other owners as potential buyers eye the franchise.

🏁 Back-to-back-to-back: The NASCAR Cup Series season is four races old and Christopher Bell has already accomplished something no Cup driver has done since 2021: win three consecutive races. His latest victory came Sunday at Phoenix Raceway.

⛳️ Henley surges to victory: Russell Henley overtook Collin Morikawa late on Sunday to win the Arnold Palmer Invitational and earn a $4 million payday. The former Georgia Bulldog was due: his 10 top-10 finishes since the start of 2024 were the most without a win.

🏒 100 points: Colorado's Nathan MacKinnon became the first NHL player to reach 100 points this season (27 goals, 73 assists) and joined Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and Alex Ovechkin as the only active players with three straight 100-point campaigns.

Drake's magical season continued on Sunday when the Bulldogs won the Missouri Valley Conference title game to clinch an NCAA tournament berth and become the first 30-win team in Division I men's basketball. Not bad for a bunch of D-II guys.

From Yahoo Sports' Dan Wetzel:

For 15 seasons, Ben McCollum ran the best D-II basketball program in the country at Northwest Missouri State. He had an 81.3% winning percentage, including a seven-year stretch of 224-16 (.933), and four national titles, with COVID stopping a potential fifth for a 31-1 squad in 2020.

The teams were good. So were the players. And so there were times McCollum would do what everyone who has ever coached or played in a lower division does: He wondered how he and his guys would fare if they ever got the chance to compete at the highest level.

""You always wonder,"" McCollum said. ""We would sit around and discuss it."" The D-II titles were glorious. But still… ""Playing in the Division I NCAA tournament is more of a personal thing, a chance to challenge yourself to a certain level,"" he said.

Starting from scratch: Drake won 28 games last season under Darian DeVries, but the roster was immediately gutted when he was hired by West Virginia. 12 players transferred, two graduated and one quit basketball, leaving redshirt senior Nate Ferguson and walk-on Matt Alia as the only remaining players.

McCollum, 46, needed an entirely new team, and although he didn't set out to prove as much, what has resulted is a chance to answer that age-old question of what happens when the small-time get a shot at the big-time.

Of the nine Drake players who regularly see action, seven were not in D-I last year. Their top three scorers all came from Northwest Missouri State, including leading scorer Bennett Stirtz, who was named the Larry Bird Missouri Valley Player of the Year.

When rival fans took a look at their roster last offseason, they were dubbed ""D-II Drake."" No one is laughing at the 30-3 Bulldogs now. ""I knew these kids. I knew their character. I knew their toughness,"" said McCollum.

Bigger than basketball: McCollum's roster of believers will enter the NCAA tournament as a popular Cinderella pick, and above all else, an inspiration for all those players and coaches and everyday people who dream of being more than just a label.

🎟️ Tickets punched: High Point* (Big South), Lipscomb (ASUN), SIU Edwardsville* (Ohio Valley) and Omaha* (Summit) joined Drake in the men's field; South Carolina (SEC), Duke (ACC), UCLA (Big Ten), TCU (Big 12), George Mason* (A-10), UNC Greensboro (SoCon), Tennessee Tech (Ohio Valley), High Point (Big South) and South Dakota State (Summit) clinched spots in the women's field.

*First NCAA tournament bid in program history

The Panthers and Stars are the new favorites to win the Stanley Cup (+600 at BetMGM) after both teams made big splashes at the NHL trade deadline.

Making moves: Dallas acquired right winger Mikko Rantanen* from the Hurricanes (then signed him to an eight-year, $96 million extension), while Florida landed longtime Bruins star Brad Marchand in a trade that marks the end of an era in Boston.**

Rantanen had a goal and an assist in his Stars debut on Saturday, then followed that up with another goal in Sunday's win over the Canucks.

Marchand (upper body injury) won't be on the ice when the Panthers face the Bruins tomorrow night in Boston, but he'll be in the building.

What they're saying: ""With Rantanen on the Stars' top line and fellow midseason acquisition Mikael Granlund on the second line, Dallas has no discernable holes,"" writes The Hockey News' Adam Proteau. As for the defending champion Panthers? ""With Marchand, Matthew Tkachuk, Sam Bennett and Sam Reinhart, Florida's snot factor is off the charts.""

*Rantanen was traded twice in six weeks, with Colorado shipping him to Carolina (Jan. 24) before they flipped him to Dallas (March 7). This almost never happens, especially to a star player who ranks 10th in the NHL with 73 points (29 goals, 44 assists).

**For the first time since 2002, the Bruins roster does not feature one of Zdeno Chára, Patrice Bergeron or Marchand, who collectively served as team captains for the past 19 seasons (2006-2025).

Boston — Jayson Tatum (40-12-8) and the Celtics beat Luka Dončić (34 points) and the Lakers, 111-101, in Saturday night's marquee matchup* to take a 167-133 lead in their all-time series. LeBron James exited with a groin strain and is expected to miss 1-2 weeks.

Auburn, Alabama — Mark Sears' floater at the buzzer lifted No. 7 Alabama to a 93-91 (OT) victory over top-ranked Auburn in a wildly entertaining contest. The Tigers remain a lock for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, and the Tide are now firmly in the mix for one.

Las Vegas — The headline from UFC 313 was Magomed Ankalaev dethroning Alex Pereira to become the new light heavyweight champion. But the highlight was Mauricio Ruffy's spinning kick for the ages. Knockout of the year?

Orlando — Washington beat Orlando on penalties after a 1-1 draw on Friday to win the NWSL Challenge Cup. It was redemption for the Spirit, who finished as runners-up to the Pride in the 2024 standings before losing to them in November's title game.

*Hot ticket: Saturday's matchup between the No. 2 teams in each conference was the most expensive regular season home game in Celtics history. Courtside tickets went for as much as $23,112, the average ticket was $731 and the cheapest was $485.

Hong Kong, China — What year is it? A pair of past-their-prime stars turned back the clock at Hong Kong Golf Club, where Sergio García got the win and Phil Mickelson finished a LIV career-best third. Both former Masters champs are feeling confident a month out from Augusta.

Munich, Germany — Bayern's stadium looked immaculate on Saturday as the club celebrated its 125th anniversary, but the day ended on a low note after the Bundesliga leaders wasted a 2-0 lead in a 3-2 loss to cellar-dwelling VfL Bochum.

Dubai, U.A.E. — India defeated New Zealand in the Champions Trophy final to win yet another global cricket tournament. This was their 23rd win in 24 games across the last three ICC events, with their only loss coming against Australia in the 2023 Cricket World Cup final.

Dublin, Ireland — France beat two-time defending champion Ireland* on Saturday to take a one-point lead atop the Six Nations standings. England and Ireland remain in contention, but Les Bleus can all but clinch the title with a win over Scotland in next weekend's finale.

*Three-peat on the brink: Ireland is vying to become the first team in Six Nations history to win three consecutive outright titles. They still have a chance to do so, but the pre-tournament favorites no longer control their own destiny.

🏀 ACC dominance: No. 2 Duke beat UNC, 82-69, on Saturday to complete one of the best ACC campaigns in the program’s storied history. The Blue Devils finished conference play with a 19-1 record and a ridiculous +434 point differential, which is the largest by a power conference team since 1953-54 Kentucky.

🇨🇦 ""Most Wanted"" Olympian: Former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding has been added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list with a $10 million reward for his arrest. The 43-year-old Canadian is wanted for allegedly running a drug trafficking ring and orchestrating multiple murders.

🏀 Injury-ravaged roster: The Mavericks' miserable 2025 hit a new low on Sunday when they closed out a loss to the Suns with only seven available players. ""Never been in a game where we couldn't take someone out to rest them because we had no one to put in,"" said head coach Jason Kidd. ""If not in [street] clothes, they were in the back getting stitches or could not move or walk.""

💔 Death at the Iditarod: A four-year-old female dog named Ventana died on Friday after collapsing during the Iditarod. Over 100 dogs have now died during the famous Alaskan sled dog race, which would never be held again if it were up to me. Enough.

🏈 Ohio homecoming: After four seasons at FCS Tennessee State, Eddie George has agreed to become the head coach at Bowling Green, returning to the state where he once starred for the Buckeyes and won the 1995 Heisman Trophy.

The NBA MVP favorites faced off on Sunday in Oklahoma City, where Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (40-8-5) and the Thunder beat Nikola Jokić (24-13-9) and the Nuggets, 127-103. Tonight, they'll go head-to-head again (8pm ET, NBA).

Two-man race: SGA remains the MVP favorite following his third straight 40-point game (and 58th straight game with 20+ points), but Jokić is hot on his heels and helped his case on Friday when he recorded the first 30-20-20 game in NBA history.*

More to watch:

🏀 NCAAM: Wofford vs. Furman (7pm, ESPN); Arkansas State vs. Troy (7pm, ESPN+) … SoCon and Sun Belt title games.

🏀 NCAAW: Arkansas State vs. James Madison (2pm, ESPN2); No. 3 UConn vs. No. 23 Creighton (7pm, FS1) … Sun Belt and Big East title games.

🎾 Tennis: Indian Wells, Round 3 (1pm, Tennis) … No. 3 Coco Gauff and No. 3 Taylor Fritz, the world's top-ranked Americans, are both in action.

🏀 Unrivaled: Lunar Owls vs. Mist (7:30pm, TNT); Vinyl vs. Rose (8:30pm, TNT) … Playoff spots are on the line in the regular-season finale.

*Dime dropper: Jokić's 22 assists on Friday broke Wilt Chamberlain's single-game record for most by a center (21) and were just eight shy of the NBA record (30) set by point guard Scott Skiles in 1990.

The Celtics and Lakers are the two winningest franchises in NBA history, with 3,680 and 3,590 wins, respectively.

As the Longhorns attempt to flip Oregon commit Kodi Greene, they got encouraging news earlier this week. The talented offensive tackle announced that he would make a trip to Austin for an official visit from June 13-15. Longhorns head coach Steve Sarkisian will try to convince Greene that being a Longhorn is best for his college career.

Over the last few months, the Longhorns have been working hard to get Greene to Austin. He is among the top offensive tackles and players in the 2026 class. His potential has also drawn the interest of USC, which Greene will visit at the end of June.

At the moment, Greene is ranked as the No. 4 offensive tackle in the 2026 class by On3 Industry Rankings. They also have him ranked as the No. 5 player from California and No. 24 prospect nationally. If he were to join the Longhorns, their 2026 class would get a major boost.

NEWS: Elite 2026 Oregon OT commit Kodi Greene has locked in an Official Visit to USC, he tells me for @on3recruitsHis schedule is as follows:•Oregon: June 6-8•Texas: June 13-15•USC: June 20-22No. 9 Recruit in the ‘26 Class (per On3)https://t.co/OiIv7MFNUd pic.twitter.com/IQwRlPZf68

When Greene arrives in Austin, it will be the first time he sets foot on campus during the recruiting process. He has taken unofficial visits to Oregon, Washington, and USC. The California native holds offers from Penn State, Texas A&M, Auburn, Alabama, and Tennessee.

While Green has committed to Oregon, his scheduled visits make it appear that there could be some wiggle room. That is an encouraging sign for the Longhorns as they look to improve their offensive line. With his decision still weeks away, the Longhorns will have to be patient as they hope to add one of the best offensive line prospects in the 2026 class to the mix.

Karl-Anthony Towns took the high road when asked to respond to Draymond Green's comments that the New York Knicks center missed last week's game against the Golden State Warriors because of Jimmy Butler's presence.

“I choose to approach that with love and not hate. That’s all I really care about,” Towns said Sunday via Stefan Bondy of the New York Post. “I hope no one has to go through what I went through, and those kids — and what those kids had to go through. Losing a parent is tough.”

Towns' absence from the Warriors game was due to the death of family friend Sarah Holtzman from breast cancer.

— New York Basketball (@NBA_NewYork) March 6, 2025

On his podcast after the game, Green said that ""some would say [Towns] didn’t play because Jimmy [Butler] was in the building"" and ""they say KAT didn’t play because Jimmy came into town. ... I don’t know what was hurt. I didn’t look that deep into it to figure out what his injury was or nothing like that.”

When told by a reporter the true reason why Towns missed the game, Green wasn't exactly repentant.

""That's unfortunate, I'm sorry to hear that. That sucks,"" Green said. ""But my comments that I made were, you know, 'People, what I heard was this.' That's what I heard. So I do send my well wishes to him and his family.

""It's inevitable, we all experience death in one way or another, and we'll all experience it in the same way one day. So it's unfortunate, you never wish that on anybody, but 'The Draymond Green Show with Baron Davis' must go on.""

Towns returned to the Knicks' lineup on Thursday.

After the Knicks' shootaround on Thursday, Towns said he had to leave the team to be there for his family and ""the kids that lost somebody really special to them,"" adding that the losses he's experienced over the past few years — several family members, including his mother, to COVID-19 complications — taught him to appreciate life.

“And the problems that have arisen in my life and stuff, I know that if people were in my shoes, they’d be extremely joyful to have the problems that I have,"" Towns said.

DK Metcalf is joining the Pittsburgh Steelers and signing a lucrative new contract.

Per NFL Network, the Seattle Seahawks are trading Metcalf to the Steelers for a 2025 second-round draft pick.

Metcalf will sign a five-year, $150 million contract extension with the Steelers upon joining them. The extension will include four new years and $132 million in new money and run through the 2029 season, per the report. Metcalf had one year and $18 million remaining on his previous contract.

The deal was agreed upon days after Metcalf reportedly told the Seahawks that he wanted to be traded.

Metcalf has played his entire NFL career with the Seahawks after they selected him in the second round of the 2019 draft. He has made two Pro Bowls and was named second-team All-Pro in 2020. At 27 years old, he remains one of the league's better receivers in his prime and will provide a significant upgrade to Pittsburgh's offense.

Metcalf requested a trade after taking a backseat to second-year receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who emerged as Seattle's No. 1 receiving option last season. After consecutive seasons with 1,000-plus yards including his 2023 Pro Bowl campaign (66 catches, 1,114 yards, eight touchdowns), Metcalf tallied 66 catches for 992 yards and five touchdowns in 2024.

Smith-Njigba, a first-round pick in 2023, led Seattle last season with 100 catches for 1,130 yards and six touchdowns. He was targeted 137 times, compared to 108 for Metcalf. It's unclear if his reduced role played an impact in his trade request.

Metcalf joins a Steelers team with uncertainty at quarterback. Russell Wilson and Justin Fields split time at quarterback in Pittsburgh last season, and both are scheduled to become free agents.

Either could return on a new deal, but neither inspired much confidence while helming the league's 27th-ranked passing attack in 2024. Metcalf has familiarity with Wilson, whom he played with for three seasons in Seattle.

The Steelers are expected to explore a field of free-agent quarterbacks that features Sam Darnold and Aaron Rodgers. Metcalf's former team will also be on the market for a quarterback after the Seahawks traded Geno Smith to the Raiders on Friday night.

Whoever plays quarterback in Pittsburgh next season will have the luxury of playing with a talented receiving corps. Metcalf joins a Pittsburgh roster that already features three-year veteran George Pickens, who led the NFL with 18.1 yards per reception in 2023 and tallied 59 catches for 900 yards and three touchdowns in 2024.

Finding a quarterback to maximize that talent remains the top priority in Pittsburgh.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

To celebrate 100 years of service, the Tulsa Area United Way is giving back to the community. TAUW partnered with the Tulsa Sports Commission to collect nearly 1,000 pieces of sporting equipment to donate to nonprofits to make sure kids and families have the gear they need to play.

The Tulsa Area United Way, in partnership with the Tulsa Sports Commission, organized a city-wide sports equipment drive to collect both new and gently used sports gear.

Nearly 1,000 pieces of equipment were donated to local nonprofits to help young athletes access the gear they need to participate in sports.

The drive collected a wide variety of sporting goods, including baseball bats, soccer balls, safety equipment, and more.

These donations were aimed at helping young athletes have the proper equipment to enjoy different sports.

The donations were distributed to three local nonprofits: KIPP Public Charter Schools, Palmer, and the YMCA of Greater Tulsa.

Joel Koester from the Tulsa Sports Commission explained that athletics can be expensive, and not every family can afford the necessary gear.

This drive, even with some used items, provides high-quality equipment that helps build students’ confidence and allows them to play sports without the financial burden.

The football, track, and soccer coach at KIPP Tulsa, Terence Carr, shared that the donations are opening doors for students to try new sports they may not have played before.

Carr says some families at KIPP Tulsa are unable to afford expensive sporting gear, so this donation allows students to become more involved in athletics.

The new gear will help KIPP Tulsa to also start new sports programs, and having access to the proper equipment gives the school a ""jump start"" to develop these programs.

With the donation, students now have the opportunity to enjoy an activity outside of their regular studies, and many are now able to become “student-athletes,” as Coach Carr put it.

Yes, people interested in donating sporting equipment can reach out to the Tulsa Area United Way and the Tulsa Sports Commission to find out how they can donate.

Long Beach State had the last word on Hawaii in the first Big West series of 2025.

The Beach swept a Saturday doubleheader from the Rainbow Wahine, 8-3 and 9-1, to take the three-game series 2-1 after UH surprised the preseason Big West favorites at Rainbow Wahine Softball Stadium on Friday night.

UH (15-10, 1-2 BWC) next takes on Cal State Northridge in Northridge, Calif., Friday and Saturday at 10 a.m. Hawaii time both days. The Matadors (10-12, 3-0) swept Cal Poly over the weekend.

Bob Coolen’s No. 2 starter Macy Brandl (6-4) lasted six innings in the first game Saturday but yielded seven runs (six earned) on eight hits in the process.

Wahine ace Addison Kostrencich (8-5), who was victorious against her former program on Friday, was unable to replicate it and exited after just 1 2/3 innings thrown in the final game of the series.

Millie Fidge made two relief appearances on the day.

First baseman Jamie McGaughey went 3-for-3 in Saturday’s first game, including her team-best sixth home run of the season in the first inning to tie the game at 2-2. Kiyara-Leigh Tuiloma added an RBI single in the second and UH claimed a temporary 3-2 lead.

Makayla Medellin got to Brandl with a two-run shot in the fifth and the Beach poured it on with four runs in the top of the seventh.

LBSU (11-9, 2-1) four-hit the Wahine behind a complete game from Kate Barnett in the series finale. Selena Perez hit home runs in the second and fourth innings and Medellin’s bases-clearing double in the sixth pushed the game to mercy rule territory.

UH’s only score was on Milan Ah Yat’s bases-loaded walk in the fifth.

Big Ten champion UCLA has jumped back to No. 1 in The Associated Press women's basketball poll

UCLA and South Carolina Are 1-2 in Women's AP Top 25; No. 6 TCU Has Highest Ranking in Its History

UCLA vaulted back up to No. 1 in The Associated Press women's basketball Top 25 on Monday after beating USC for the Big Ten title over the weekend.

The Bruins, who spent 12 weeks atop the poll before losing to the rival Trojans in early February, received 16 first-place votes from a national panel to jump from fourth to first. It was the second time this season that the Bruins leaped over a few teams to move up to No. 1. UCLA topped then-No. 1 South Carolina before Thanksgiving to move up four places to claim the top ranking.

South Carolina knocked off previous No. 1 Texas in the Southeastern Conference Tournament championship game and moved up to second from fifth in the poll. The Gamecocks garnered nine first-place ballots.

UConn remained third going into Monday night's game against No. 22 Creighton for the Big East title. The Huskies received the other seven first-place votes.

USC, which beat UCLA twice in the regular season, fell two spots to fourth and Texas dropped to fifth.

TCU climbed up two spots to sixth for the highest ranking in school history after topping Baylor for the Big Ten championship Sunday. The Horned Frogs last won a tournament title in 2005 when they were a member of Conference USA.

Duke moved up four places to seventh after it beat N.C. State for the ACC championship. It was the Blue Devils' first tournament title in 12 years. It's also the team's best ranking since it was also seventh on Nov. 17, 2014.

Notre Dame fell to eighth, with N.C. State and LSU rounding out the top 10.



  Ins and outs
 

Mississippi joined the poll at No. 25 after reaching the quarterfinals of the SEC Tournament. Ole Miss was ranked for the first nine weeks of the season. Michigan State fell out of the poll.



  Getting recognition
 

UTSA received a vote in the poll for the first time in school history. The Roadrunners finished off the regular season with a school record 26 wins, including a 17-1 mark in the American Athletic Conference. The 17 conference victories match the school mark set in 2002-03 when the team was in the Southland Conference.

The team is led by conference player of the year Jordyn Jenkins and is coached by Karen Aston.



  Conference breakdown
 

The Southeastern Conference has eight ranked teams. The ACC and Big 12 each have five while the Big Ten has four. The Big East has two and the Summit League one.



  Games of the week
 

With the power conference tournaments finished, attention turns to the mid-major showdowns. The MAAC, NEC and Ivy League all have their championships this weekend.

Gerrit Cole might need Tommy John surgery.

The New York Yankees ace and 2023 AL Cy Young winner has received a medical recommendation to undergo the procedure, The Athletic reported on Monday. Yankees manager Aaron Boone later told YES Network that Cole was in Los Angeles on Monday to see Dr. Neal ElAttrache.

Cole experienced elbow discomfort during a spring training outing on Thursday. He underwent an MRI on Friday and told reporters on Saturday that he was ""concerned"" about the pending results of his diagnostics.

If Cole indeed needs Tommy John surgery, it would be a devastating blow to the Yankees and Cole, who's approaching what would be his 13th MLB season at 34 years old. Pitchers who undergo the procedure to reconstruct the ulnar collateral ligament generally face a 12 to 18 month timetable to return. That would obviously rule Cole out for the entire 2025 season while placing his long-term future as an MLB ace in doubt.

The news is the second and most significant blow to a Yankees rotation that entered spring training with an excess of starting options. The Yankees announced last week that second-year pitcher and reigning AL Rookie of the Year Luis Gil will be sidelined for at least three months with a high-grade lat strain. Now the Yankees may be down another starter from the top of their rotation in Cole.

That means that Marcus Stroman, who appeared to be the sixth man out of the five-man rotation, will almost certainly reclaim a spot as a starter, with the Yankees still in search of a fifth. Carlos Rodón, Max Fried and Clarke Schmidt are also expected to be in their rotation.

The Yankees are also dealing with injuries in their lineup. Designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton has tendinitis in both elbows and isn't taking swings in spring training. He underwent platelet-rich plasma treatment in both elbows for a second time last week. He doesn't have a timeline to return.

Infielder DJ LeMahieu has a left calf strain and has also been sidelined from baseball activities. He said on March 6 that it will be at least a ""couple of weeks"" before he returns to baseball activities.

Unfortunately for the Hawaii baseball team, its surplus of runs from Friday night were non-transferable to the rest of its weekend road series against UC Riverside.

The Rainbow Warriors lost on a walk-off in the 13th inning on Saturday, 4-3, and fell short to the Highlanders in the rubber match Sunday, 7-4, undoing a roaring 17-5 start to the series for UH.

It was the first series loss of the year and first Big West series loss in the last seven conference sets for UH (11-4, 1-2 BWC) dating to last season.

UCR (10-6, 2-1), which went 6-24 in league play last year and was picked to finish last this year, won its first Big West series of the season for the first time since 2018. UCR lost its first 11 Big West games last year.

The ‘Bows have little time to worry about it as they host Division II neighbor Chaminade on Tuesday night at Les Murakami Stadium.

No. 16 UC Santa Barbara (13-2, 3-0), the preseason Big West favorite, comes to town for a challenging series this weekend. The Gauchos swept CSUN in three close games.

Catcher David Whittle drove in six runs on a bases-clearing double in the sixth and a three-run shot to left off of Isaiah Magdaleno in the seventh.

UH starter Liam O’Brien kept alive his streak of no earned runs to start the year at 21 1/3 innings as he went four frames with three hits and five walks allowed, striking out six. He has a scoreless innings streak of 11 spanning his last two starts.

Matthew Flores (2-0) picked up the win for the Highlanders, going six innings with five hits, no walks and one run allowed. Itsuki Takemoto knocked a pinch-hit RBI single in the fifth to get the ‘Bows on the board first.

But Cory Ronan (1-1), who took the loss, loaded the bases in the sixth and absorbed all three runs when he was lifted and Danny Veloz gave up the double to Whittle. UH’s top two relievers, Magdaleno and Freddy Gonzalez, were both charged with two earned runs.

UCR’s leadoff man, center fielder Robert Pitts, was a killer all series as he went 10-for-16 for the series, including the walk-off winner in the 13th on Saturday and a solo homer in the eighth inning Sunday. He has an on-base streak of 16 games.

Ben Zeigler-Namoa led UH at the plate with a 3-for-5 day and scored on a wild pitch in the eighth. Pinch hitter Jack Salmon picked up his first extra-base hit of the year with an RBI double in the ninth, scoring Shunsuke Sakaino.

The New York Jets moved on from Aaron Rodgers after two seasons, leaving the quarterback in search of a new stadium to call home. As there always is during the offseason, as we approach the start of free agency and the league new year, rumors are swirling about all the top players and where they may land in 2025.

Rodgers has been linked to a few teams, including the New York Giants, Minnesota Vikings and Pittsburgh Steelers. Rodgers and the Steelers are expected to engage in talks, per ESPN. The 41-year-old is set to become a free agent after his official release from the Jets.

From an outside perspective, the Steelers are an attractive team, with an established head coach in Mike Tomlin and a history of winning. 

Pittsburgh has multiple options in front of them, including Rodgers. They are also continuing to talk with quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Justin Fields, who were both starters at some point last season. 

Previous reports said Fields was the team's first choice going forward, but with no moves made, anything could happen.

Rodgers only played four naps of the 2023 season, his first with the Jets, with an Achilles injury causing him to miss the remainder of the year. Last year, he finished with 3,897 passing yards, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.

While his numbers weren't terrible, with the eighth-most passing yards in the league, the Jets struggled to build a solid offensive unit and win games. New York finished the season 5-12 and missed the playoffs for the 14th straight year.

Free agency's legal tampering period begins Monday at 12 p.m. ET and the league new year begins on Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET.

Another week, another No. 1 team in the Associated Press Top 25 poll.

South Carolina and UCLA bounced back from their regular-season losses to win conference championships on Sunday, and in the process, downed former No. 1 team Texas and No. 2 ranked USC, respectively. The rankings are fresh heading into the NCAA tournament, where the only numbers that matter are seed lines and final scores.

South Carolina’s Dawn Staley, USC’s Lindsay Gottlieb and UCLA’s Cori Close all made their claims for the tournament’s overall No. 1 seed with the order and top spot unclear.

The chaos among the top teams was strong this season, with many of them facing each other in the non-conference schedule and even more in the conference slate. As a look back, South Carolina, UConn, USC, Texas and UCLA, in order, filled out the preseason top five. South Carolina (three weeks), UCLA (12), Notre Dame (one) and Texas (two) have all held the top spot.

The major conference chaos of March will take a week off ahead of Selection Sunday (8 p.m. ET, ESPN). More berths will be clinched this week in conference tournaments. Here’s who is rising and falling ahead of the NCAA women’s basketball committee’s decision.

Atlantic-10 conference: Bid-stealers

The major upset of the semifinals came outside of the power conferences when A-10 No. 4 seed Saint Joseph’s downed reigning champion and top-seeded Richmond, 50-49, on a buzzer-beater. Richmond, an AP vote earner for five weeks, should still secure a spot in the NCAA tournament with a NET ranking of 33, signature wins over Oklahoma State and Columbia, and a competitive loss to Texas. That creates a two-bid A-10 with George Mason winning the automatic bid. It’s the program’s first NCAA berth. Saint Joseph’s is on the bubble.

Duke: Defensive masterclass

Duke’s defense is locked in. Within the past 11 days, the Blue Devils kept every opponent below its average. The damage: North Carolina (17 points below its average), Florida State (20), Louisville (24), Notre Dame (29) and NC State (15). They held the nation's leading scorer, FSU's Ta'Niya Latson, to just 12 points.

The Blue Devils could move up a seed line with their run as a No. 3 seed to the ACC tournament title. They responded to four conference losses by defeating those same teams in their second meetings.

UCLA: Revenge is sweet

Give the Bruins credit. They asked for the rematch and delivered, lifting their chances at a higher No. 1 seed and gloating over a rival in the process. They bounced back in-game to shut down JuJu Watkins, worked through Lauren Betts and found a way to win a messy game, which they hadn't done prior.

“As good as we’ve been, we’re not as confident as you would think,” Close said. “And I think they’ve earned some more confidence tonight.”

South Carolina: Still SEC champions

Gamecocks of destruction, welcome back.

Hailey Van Lith: MVP-worthy

Van Lith scored 20 points, including a pivotal final-minute bucket, and earned tournament MVP honors in leading TCU to its first Big 12 championship. It was the program’s first appearance since joining ahead of the 2012-13 season and its first conference title since 2005 in Conference USA.

The fifth-year guard rebounded from a rough 2024 NCAA tournament in her single year at LSU and leads a Horned Frog squad with the potential to reach the Final Four. Van Lith reached the Final Four as a sophomore with Louisville in 2022.

Notre Dame: Out of No. 1 seed contention

The backloaded conference schedule of Duke, NC State, Florida State and Louisville in a five-game stretch to end the season did the Fighting Irish no favors. The former (and brief) No. 1 team is slipping at the wrong time. A season-low offensive output in the semifinal isn’t instilling confidence heading into the NCAA tournament, and the Irish are almost guaranteed to miss out on a No. 1 seed.

Tennessee: Stumbling at the wrong time

Tennessee lost three of four, including an inexcusable one to Georgia in the regular season finale. The SEC tournament loss to Vanderbilt would be palatable — they were deadlocked at 8-8 in the SEC standings — if the Lady Vols remained competitive. Instead, they fell behind by 20 at the start of the fourth and fell short in yet another comeback rally.

The week-long rest ahead of the NCAA tournament will be helpful. Head coach Kim Caldwell said the length and physicality of the SEC schedule, combined with her high-octane system, took a toll on her team.

Texas: Nowhere else to climb

The No. 1 overall seed in the tournament is a revolving door. Texas likely became the latest one to fall out of the running with its offensively challenged 64-45 loss to South Carolina in the SEC title game. The Longhorns drew the wrong end of the coin flip, playing a tough semifinal that ended around 9 p.m. local time and then turning around and playing the title game at 3 p.m. the next day. The Gamecocks proved that daring Texas to shoot 3-pointers gets the job done.

Maryland: Lost its hosting grasp

The Terps, which began the season 14-0, bowed out of the Big Ten tournament early in an odd game of lopsided runs. Michigan’s young group left nothing to be doubted with their second-half surge, and with it sunk Maryland’s chances of hosting in the NCAA tournament. What was once a national title contender might not make it out of the first weekend.

Dan Cohen, president of Adhere+

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has proposed draft guidance to establish a framework for prescribing controlled substances via telemedicine.

The proposal introduces three types of special registrations. Telemedicine prescribing registration allows qualified practitioners to prescribe Schedule III-V controlled substances via telemedicine. Advanced telemedicine prescribing registration permits specialized practitioners, such as psychiatrists and hospice care physicians, to prescribe Schedule II-V controlled substances via telemedicine. And telemedicine platform registration enables online telemedicine platforms to dispense Schedule II-V controlled substances through registered practitioners.

The guidance proposes allowing patients to receive a six-month supply of buprenorphine, used to treat opioid use disorder, through a telephone consultation with a provider. Subsequent prescriptions would require an in-person visit.

Practitioners would be required to conduct Prescription Drug Monitoring Program checks for the states where both the patient and the practitioner are located, as well as any other relevant states with PDMP reciprocity.

Detailed records must be maintained for in-person evaluations, telehealth prescriptions and referrals. The proposal also includes safeguards for prescribing high-risk medications, such as Schedule II substances.

These measures aim to expand patient access to controlled substances via telemedicine while implementing safeguards to prevent misuse and diversion.

Dan Cohen, president of Adhere+, a vendor of remote therapeutic monitoring technology and services, says the DEA's draft language needs to be clarified that healthcare practitioners make treatment decisions – the DEA needs to limit its role to ensure patient safety and prevent misuse, not to dictate clinical decision making for practitioners.

""The concern here is about ensuring the role of the DEA is clearly defined when it comes to overseeing healthcare practitioners' treatment decisions, particularly in the context of prescribing Scheduled medications,"" Cohen explained. ""The primary responsibility of healthcare practitioners – doctors, nurses, pharmacists, etc. – is to make clinical decisions based on their professional judgment, patient needs and medical guidelines.

""If the DEA's role is not properly limited, there could be an overreach where the agency influences or even dictates how healthcare practitioners make these decisions, which could undermine the autonomy of medical professionals and potentially impact patient care,"" he continued. ""The DEA's main mission should be to prevent drug misuse, addiction and illegal distribution while safeguarding patient safety. However, it should not be in the position of making clinical decisions or prescribing protocols for legitimate medical treatments.""

The language in any proposed regulation or legislation should therefore make it clear that while the DEA can enforce laws related to drug control and ensure that medications are prescribed and distributed safely and appropriately, healthcare practitioners remain the ones who make decisions about what treatment is appropriate for their patients, based on medical evidence, their expertise and individual patient needs, he said.

Cohen contended that Congress make permanent COVID Public Health Emergency concessions, rather than renewing the concessions biannually.

""Making the COVID-19 PHE concessions permanent, rather than renewing them biannually, could provide several advantages,"" he explained. ""Doing so would provide stability and certainty, avoid legislative bottlenecks, enable continued access to healthcare, encourage long-term innovation, enable efficient use of resources, and continue lessons learned from the pandemic.""

On another note, telehealth encounters via electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) should have clear, clinical content that develops over the treatment period for several key reasons, Cohen said.

""This is because it tracks patient progress, improves clinical decision making, enhances patient-clinician communication, enables personalized treatment, improves outcome measurement, aids regulatory and reimbursement purposes, enables early identification of complications,"" he explained.

""The lack of ePROs in a telehealth 'visit' compromises patient care,"" he continued. ""Conversely, ePROs with clear, evolving clinical content are essential for monitoring patient progress, making informed clinical decisions, personalizing care, and improving overall treatment outcomes. They provide a comprehensive and accurate picture of the patient's health, which is critical for effective, evidence-based care.""

Cohen also offered views on how regulatory policies should be adapted and updated to allow for clinical decision making based in part on an artificial intelligence analysis of patients' ePROs data.

""For AI/ML analysis of ePROs data to be a valuable part of clinical decision making, regulatory policies need to ensure these tools are accurate, transparent, equitable, and integrated into a system that prioritizes patient safety and clinician oversight,"" Cohen said. ""Establishing strong standards for validation, data security and bias mitigation, while fostering innovation and patient engagement, will be key to maximizing the benefits of AI/ML in healthcare.""

The president’s deregulatory bent means more responsibility rests on the shoulders of healthcare stakeholders to get artificial intelligence right.

Healthcare companies struggling to adopt artificial intelligence amid a lack of federal standards are unlikely to get any help from the Trump administration, placing the burden of responsible implementation squarely on the industry’s shoulders.

That mandate is becoming increasingly difficult as the technology grows more complex, experts said during the HIMSS healthcare conference in Las Vegas.

“One thing that’s clear is that this administration is not going to regulate AI. Good or bad, take that for what it is,” Tanay Tandon, the CEO of provider automation company Commure, said during a panel.

President Donald Trump’s hands-off approach to AI governance means hospitals turning to the tools to save money and give overworked clinicians some relief will likely be operating in a regulatory gray area for at least the next four years.

The president says his goal is to free up U.S. developers to innovate. But that comes with downsides for tech developers and healthcare companies desperate for guardrails given AI’s proclivity to make mistakes, degrade over time and exacerbate existing bias.

Not to mention, a lack of national standards might actually hamper AI development and adoption, according to some experts.

“When there isn’t a federal framework, it can just absolutely cause all kinds of problems,” said Leigh Burchell, the chair of the Electronic Health Records Association. “We all just want to know what our rules are. And then we can comply.”

To date, a handful of federal agencies, including the HHS’ technology office, the CMS and the Food and Drug Administration, have published targeted rules around the use and quality of AI in healthcare. But neither Congress nor the executive branch have zeroed in on a comprehensive framework to regulate the models — despite some progress during the Biden administration, when an HHS task force was working to build a unified regulatory structure.

That task force unveiled a strategic plan in January — just 10 days before Trump’s inauguration. However, Trump nixed the blueprint in one of his first executive orders.

Meanwhile, federal employees working on AI oversight, including at the FDA, have been caught up in the Trump administration’s purge of the government’s workforce. Amid the turmoil, the future of the HHS office that oversees AI policy remains unclear.

As a result, what little momentum there was in Washington to create a concrete strategy for overseeing health AI appears to have stalled out, at least for now. In its place, Trump has announced the Stargate Project, a $500 billion investment deal with private companies to prioritize AI development and maintain U.S. supremacy in the space — a high-stakes bet that was immediately complicated by the release of DeepSeek, a high-performing and inexpensive open source model from China.

""The current administration — the brakes have come off and the accelerator has come down.""

Brian Spisak

Program director of AI and leadership, Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative

The Trump administration did issue a request for information in early February to get public input on a potential national AI action plan. However, the plan’s wording makes clear the administration’s priorities: to “sustain and enhance America’s AI dominance, and to ensure that unnecessarily burdensome requirements do not hamper private sector AI innovation.”

The revocation of the Biden-era AI plan was largely symbolic, as agencies hadn’t yet gotten around to imposing any requirements on developers or users.

But in “the current administration — the brakes have come off and the accelerator has come down,” said Brian Spisak, program director of AI and leadership at Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative, at HIMSS. “There’s a lot of responsibility to leadership of health systems to find the optimal balance between innovation and speed and safety and tradition.”

That responsibility — which also rests on AI developers creating the models, software vendors weaving them into health records and the clinicians using them — is not negligible.

Currently, even the most futuristic AI at healthcare institutions is being used to automate administration, and only peripherally touches patient care. But that appears to be changing: There’s growing interest among medical organizations in more clinical use cases for AI, like tailoring treatment plans or helping clinicians arrive at a diagnosis, according to a survey from HIMSS conducted in the fall.

Many of those use cases involve generative AI, which can create original text and images. But such models are known to hallucinate, or provide answers that are factually incorrect or irrelevant. AI can leave important information out, an error known as omission. Models can also drift, a term for when an AI’s performance changes or degrades over time.

Given the increasing prevalence of AI in pulling data from EHR systems, transcribing doctor-patient visits and more, errors like these could interfere with clinicians’ ability to care for patients, experts say.

Meanwhile, the technology is advancing at a stunning rate. Last year, the healthcare industry was just beginning to come to terms with governance for generative AI. But now, the conversation has already moved onto AI agents, which can complete complex tasks largely unsupervised by humans.

Commure’s Tanay equated the current moment to when America moved from kerosene to electricity at the end of the 19th century.

“The way that we did things six months ago is completely irrelevant,” he said.

Because of the breakneck speed of development, federal standards from any administration would likely need to be flexible, experts say. 

The Biden administration’s HHS task force suggested the government could create guidelines around testing and piloting tools, along with some support for adoption. However, it shied away from a prescriptive approach.

That’s in line with the wish list from many stakeholders. Numerous executives at tech companies and hospital systems said any federal standards should be stratified by the level of risk an AI model imposes — for example, stricter oversight for algorithms that help doctors diagnose diseases, and looser restrictions for algorithms that help hospital staff allocate patients to beds.

“We have to weigh the balance between underregulation, which can potentially increase risk, and overregulation, which will stunt innovation,” said Anthony Chang, the chief intelligence and innovation officer at the Children’s Hospital of Orange County in California, during a panel.

“The current administration is more likely to be on the underregulation side. So we have to be careful as a profession that we don’t allow that to happen,” Chang said.

The lack of a playbook from Washington has left hospitals and medical groups scrambling to build their own internal controls amid a patchwork of state laws and voluntary standards released by industry groups.

States including Colorado, Utah and California have already enacted legislation establishing disclaimer requirements for AI systems. More states are considering similar laws: The Electronic Health Records Association is tracking 150 different state bills related to health AI, according to Burchell.

“There is a massive explosion of bills,” Burchell said.

But differing standards could stop health AI developers and software companies from rolling out products in specific states, potentially disadvantaging patients depending on where they live. More risk-averse software companies may avoid AI, or certain states, altogether, she added.

“Legislation of a lot of sizes and shapes at the state level is a risk to us, because it means we have to do all kinds of different development. We would rather develop one system that can be used broadly and accepted across the country,” Burchell said.

Health AI standards groups are also stepping into the gap left by the federal government. The groups — often made up of leading hospitals, digital health companies and tech giants — include the Health AI Partnership, an AI learning network for the industry, and the Coalition for Health AI, which recently launched an AI registry for hospitals.

”I think we’ll probably see more of these non-government organizations like Health AI Partnership and some of those emerge as maybe our north stars today, as here’s some leadership in the space,” said Rachel Wilkes, the corporate lead for generative AI initiatives at EHR vendor Meditech.

But standards from industry consortia hold little weight without the heft of the federal government behind them, experts say. Historically, voluntary standards aren’t particularly effective.

“There’s room for people to act in their own best interest, whatever that may be, without any sort of federal framework,” Wilkes said.

EHR vendors and hospital operators say they’re building up rigorous internal standards for AI tools, including validation and frequent auditing.

“Government oversight has its place, but I do think the way that clinical practice evolves tends to be more driven by what’s happening at a health system,” said Seth Howard, the executive vice president of research and development for Epic, the largest EHR company in the U.S.

In interviews, executives with Epic, Oracle, Meditech and eClinicalWorks said they’re making AI available to doctors with rigorous oversight, including back-end accuracy checks and ongoing monitoring.

However, tech leaders stressed that it’s also the hospital and the clinicians’ responsibility to make sure everything is working as planned.

“We are working in an industry that deals with human life. It cannot be trivial. It cannot be under-exaggerated on what guardrails and checks and balances and what discussions need to happen,” said Girish Navani, the CEO of eClinicalWorks.

Technology behemoths betting heavily on AI feel similarly. Google, for example, has worked with for-profit hospital giant HCA on an evaluation framework to catch any errors generated by its AI models and ensure their reliability, according to Aashima Gupta, the head of healthcare for Google Cloud.

“We provide those tools for an evaluation framework, and for all of this there’s a human in the loop capturing the feedback, and that feedback loop then makes the model more effective,” Gupta said. “That’s what gives me comfort.”

""We are working in an industry that deals with human life. It cannot be trivial. It cannot be under-exaggerated on what guardrails and checks and balances and what discussions need to happen.""

Though some in the private sector say they’ve got governance handled, modern AI is incredibly hard to oversee, according to AI engineers. The main advantage of generative AI — its creativity — also introduces subjectivity, making grading its outputs complicated.

For example, if two clinicians are tasked to summarize a patient’s medical history based on clinical notes, their results could be incredibly different, albeit still accurate. It’s the same with generative AI, experts say: How do you measure quality in a standardized way when there’s that degree of variability?

“AI governance is still very much a maturing process,” said Harvard’s Spisak.

Hospital executives say they’re tackling oversight carefully. But some research suggests governance systems for simpler predictive AI models already aren’t rigorous enough. Hospitals with explicit procedures for the use and assessment of AI tools are still struggling to identify and mitigate problems, according to a study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Even some of the most well-resourced and tech-savvy systems are struggling.

The Cleveland Clinic has an AI governing body that includes stakeholders from across the academic medical center, according to Rohit Chandra, the Cleveland Clinic’s chief digital officer. The task force oversees AI’s impact on the organization’s patients and workers while ensuring clinical safety and discussing thorny questions of privacy, legality and bias.

But “I don’t think we’ve figured it all out,” Chandra said during a panel. “The term hallucination, for one, has just shown up in the last two, three years. And we still don’t quite know how to deal with it.”

Hospitals should try to make specific people accountable for the performance of the tools, as part of a larger governing body that includes executives, lawyers, doctors and nurses, according to Brenton Hill, the head of operations at standards group CHAI.

Hospitals need to decide how to monitor AI effectively and report that information, which can depend on the products they have in place. They also need to consider what resources the AI will use and develop appropriate data use agreements with AI vendors, Hill said during a panel.

But “there’s not one silver bullet governance structure that you can put out there that will solve all your problems,” Hill said.

Though a road map from federal regulators would be helpful, stakeholders working to integrate AI tools into healthcare said they’re not holding their breath.

“While self-regulation is good, we don’t believe that’s sufficient. We believe AI is too important not to be regulated,” said Google’s Gupta.

But when asked what she expects from the Trump administration, Gupta was noncommittal. “It’s hard to say at this point. We are trying to figure out how we best work with them, share our best practices with them ... Too early to say. I think the entire healthcare community is waiting for that,” Gupta said.

Other experts said the Trump administration is a wake-up call for hospital executives who believed Washington could assume responsibility for overseeing AI.

Instead, the mandate should be on everyone touching the technology to ensure AI algorithms — given their shifting nature and innate opacity — perform as they’re designed, especially in an industry where any mistakes could impact patient health.

“The easy answer is, if this regulatory body says it’s safe, then I can trust it. I think people were hoping that might happen for AI,” said Aaron Neinstein, the chief medical officer of agentic AI company Notable. “I think that was a pipe dream.”

What does America want out of its health care system in 2025?

It’s a question that’s been on Emory University professor Dr. Stephen Patrick’s mind, and now over 2,000 U.S. adults have answered back.

Patrick, chair of the Rollins School of Public Health’s Department of Health Policy, and his team recently published their findings from the Rollins-Gallup Public Health Priorities Survey, offering a look at what’s on the nation’s mind.

Emory University partnered with Gallup to conduct self-administered web interviews to U.S. adults from Dec. 2 to Dec. 15 last year. The 2,121 respondents were asked to rank public health issues — ranging from affordability to social isolation — based on what government and public health leaders should consider the highest priorities for 2025.

According to Patrick, timing was everything.

“When we started the process, we didn’t know who was going to be in office and we intentionally fielded it after the election with results to come out just shortly after we had somebody sworn in,” Patrick told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “So the goal of this was to not have our voices, but have Americans’ voices on where they wanted public health to be in the new administration.”



Over half (52%) of respondents ranked “improving health care access and affordability” as one of their top three public health concerns, making it the most unanimously agreed upon issue. Precisely a quarter of respondents ranked it as their first concern.



“They’re big problems, when we look at the top four priorities: improving health care access and affordability, reducing chronic disease, safe food and water and then protecting the safety net (Medicare, Medicaid, and free clinics),” Patrick said. “Those are things where Americans said, across party lines, there needs to be a substantial federal role.”

The survey also asked respondents if federal or state government was more effective at addressing their top public health priorities. For all three highest ranked public health issues, respondents sided with the federal government.

“But each one of those also involves state and local government,” Patrick added. “Each one of them involves an element of what we do locally. Like, we can’t improve chronic disease without being really local and doing the things that we do to help each other be healthy.”

Respondents were also asked if the U.S. made progress, lost ground or not changed over the last decade concerning eight key areas of public health.

“One of the things that struck me is, for every item we tested, there was not a single issue where more than half the country thought we had made progress,” he said. “But there were three areas in particular where they think we had lost ground.”

A majority of respondents said the nation has lost ground in the opioid epidemic. Half said the same about mental health nationwide. And nearly half (47%) believed the U.S. has lost ground with healthy dieting and lifestyles. However, 36% of people said the U.S. has made progress at improving the health outcomes of those with chronic diseases.

Lastly, respondents were asked to select their three most trusted sources of public health information. Out of 15 options, three topped the rankings: doctor, nurse or health care providers (54%), scientific research and studies (42%) and the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (37%).

While social media only earned a comparatively slender 9% of the overall votes, 16% of adults 18 to 29 placed it within their top three most trusted sources.

“Non-Hispanic Black Americans and Republican men (including Republican leaners) were also among the groups most likely to pick social media as a top trusted source for public health information — at 16% and 12%, respectively,” according to the survey report.



When asked what government leaders should take from the survey results, the Emory University professor explained that it offers direction for what the American people want this year.

“I think what Americans are telling us is that there’s a clear road map for where they want us to go,” Patrick said. “As we think about the next couple of years, we should be thinking about bolstering systems that ensure access to care, reduce costs and that are focused on the other priorities that Americans have.

“Making sure that our food and water are safe, reducing chronic disease — Americans have given us a blueprint. What they want us to do is more, not less. They want us to make sure that we are bolstering the systems that are there. And they also told us that there’s a strong federal role for that, across party lines. Whether they were Republicans or Democrats, most — by a wide margin — told us that their top priorities should have the federal government play a leading role.”

Jersey's Health Minister, Deputy Tom Binet, has said he wants the island to invest tens of millions of pounds in preventative healthcare measures. 

Speaking at a scrutiny hearing, Binet emphasised the need for the health service to shift from a reactive to a proactive approach to reduce illness and treatment needs.

The health service needs to stop people from getting ill, rather than reacting when they do, Binet said.

He described the initiative as a long-term investment that would ultimately save money.

""Every health service everywhere is trying to do it,"" he said.

""We've got to make a decision here as to whether we want to stay on the back foot doing reactive health, or whether we want to make this fundamental change to try and tackle the problem.""

Acknowledging the challenges ahead, Binet added: ""It's a big one and that's going to be tricky. 

""We're doing the preparatory work, and we're going to come up with a number and a programme.""

Power of the Herd



KEARNEY – More than 60 high school seniors will begin their studies at the University of Nebraska at Kearney this fall as members of a prestigious health science program.

Representing communities across the state, the students selected for the Kearney Health Opportunities Program (KHOP) demonstrate both academic excellence and a commitment to serving rural areas as future health care professionals.

“Improving access to health care in rural Nebraska starts with investing in the next generation of providers. Through the KHOP program, we are equipping passionate and dedicated students with the education and support they need to make an impact in the communities that need them the most,” said Peggy Abels, director of UNK Health Sciences.

According to a report from the University of Nebraska Medical Center, more than 80% of the state’s health diagnosing and treating practitioners are based in metropolitan areas, creating an accessibility issue for many rural residents.

The KHOP program was created to help even the playing field.

Launched in 2010, it’s designed to grow the state’s health care workforce by recruiting and training students from rural Nebraska who are committed to practicing in these communities as professionals. The program offers financial assistance, academic support and professional development opportunities, with many participants receiving full-tuition scholarships to attend UNK and guaranteed admission to UNMC.

KHOP members can study in the fields of dental hygiene, dentistry, medical laboratory science, medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, pharmacy, physical therapy, physician assistant and radiography.

Participants also receive a $3,000 room waiver through the KHOP Learning Community. A requirement for freshmen, the one-year residential learning community gives students a chance to explore various health care careers while receiving support and guidance as they transition to college. KHOP members meet with health care providers and tour medical facilities throughout the region, better preparing them for professional school and beyond.

More than 160 students are currently part of KHOP, and the 62 high school seniors accepted for fall 2025 represent the second-largest class in program history. A record-breaking 72 students were admitted last year.

“By growing our own health care workforce, we’re taking an important step toward addressing the provider shortage and strengthening rural health care for years to come,” Abels said. “It’s very encouraging to see such an outstanding group of students who are committed to rural health and making a real difference in their hometowns.”

For more information on the KHOP program, visit unk.edu/khop, call 308-865-8260 or email abelsp@unk.edu.

On March 7, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that its Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is investigating four medical schools and hospitals under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (Section 1557).

The investigations are in response to allegations OCR received that certain medical schools and hospitals that receive HHS funding may operate medical education, training, or scholarship programs that discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex. 

HHS stated that the investigations align with President Trump’s Executive Order 14173, Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity. 

“Today’s actions restore merit-based opportunities in medicine and signify that hard-working health care professionals and high-achieving students in the pipeline for medical and nursing fields should not be demeaned at work, or excluded from professional or scholarship opportunities, because of their race or sex,” said Anthony Archeval, Acting Director of the OCR at HHS, in a statement.","{'href': 'https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com', 'title': 'Healthcare Innovation'}"

LAS VEGAS – Artificial Intelligence in healthcare comes with a lot of hype, but there's also a lot of concern – about how it can be used to attack, and how it can be abused. 

Etay Maor, chief security strategist at Cato Networks, said at HIMSS25 in Las Vegas on Wednesday that hospital leaders and clinicians should be aware of the potential risks and pitfalls of artificial intelligence, particularly as it pertains to potential hacking and fraud.

""I believe AI is not very close to replacing us completely,"" said Maor. ""However, those who know how to use AI are going to replace those who don't know how to use AI.""

One of the main problems, in healthcare or any other industry, is that the bar has been lowered for potential threat actors. At one time, someone had to have deep knowledge of coding and hacking to attack computer systems. Then, it became possible to purchase malicious software from threat actors on the dark web. And then criminal services became popular on the dark web, and companies began offering to conduct attacks for hire.

With each of these stages, the bar got lowered. But now, the bar is at its lowest level yet, because malicious actors can now have artificial intelligence do their dirty work for them.

The key for hospital leaders and clinicians is to employ personnel with a deep knowledge of how current AI models can be manipulated. Hackers, said Maor, look for vulnerabilities to attack.

One common method they employ is called feedback poisoning, when they purposefully misdirect generative AI models like ChatGPT. At its core, it's a simple tactic: When a model generates a response to a question or request, the threat actor simply tells the model it's wrong, or makes suggestions or corrections to the response that ""confuses"" the AI. Since users of these models basically ""train"" them, a malicious actor can mistrain it.

This can come in the form of text or images. Maor shared a story of the time he uploaded a picture of London to ChatGPT and asked it to describe the image. It gave a nonsensical response because extremely small text embedded in the image, naked to the human eye but readable by AI, told it to.

Many healthcare leaders have been keen to adopt AI because of the perceived benefits – according to Medical Economics, one of the most significant of those benefits is improved diagnostic speed and accuracy, which can make it easier for providers to diagnose and treat diseases. AI can be used to analyze X-rays, MRI scans and other medical images, for example, to identify patterns and anomalies that a human might miss.

However, Medical Economics pointed out that there can be potential risks, particularly when it comes to security and privacy. One of the biggest risks is the potential for data breaches, since large quantities of patient data are often targets for cybercriminals. Other types of unique AI attacks include feedback poisoning and model extraction, in which an adversary might extract enough information about the algorithm to create a substitute model.

Meor advised hospital leaders and AI teams to be vigilant and to stay one step ahead of the technology. 

""If you don't know how to use AI, the ones who do are going to take advantage,"" he said.

Addressing social determinants of health (SDoH) is becoming increasingly important due to new regulations from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the shift toward value-based care payment models. With ongoing staffing shortages and a growing demand for home-based care services, social workers are taking on greater responsibilities to support the health care system.

In its final home health payment rule for 2025, CMS introduced four new items and modified one existing item related to SDoH in the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) assessment framework. These changes will occur in the 2027 Home Health Quality Reporting Program (HHQRP). 

Individuals requiring home health care often need complex support that addresses both their medical and psychosocial needs, especially if they are isolated from typical social interactions and services. Some home care teams are now integrating home health social workers (HHCSWs) to provide a comprehensive approach to care that considers these SDoHs. 

“Social workers are essential to the services provided by CenterWell Home Health,” CCO at CenterWell Home Health, Sherri Rains told Home Health Care News. “They offer holistic emotional, mental and physical support to patients and families, addressing social determinants of health to enhance the care team’s efforts.” 

CenterWell Home Health delivers skilled care, education and tools to individuals managing chronic conditions across 37 states, with more than 350 locations. 

“CenterWell’s social workers collaborate with our physicians, nurse practitioners and other clinicians to tackle all the challenges faced by home health patients,” Rains added. “They are integral to the interdisciplinary communication process through advocacy, relationship-building, teamwork and trust.” 

HHCSWs help patients navigate the health care system and access necessary resources while remaining at home to manage their health and well-being. Their support includes managing illness-related emotional challenges, coordinating community services and advising family caregivers. 

“Social workers often serve as the bridge between medical professionals and the realities of a client’s social circumstances,” said Catherine Briggs, care integration manager at Bayada Home Health and Hospice, told HHCN. “Our assessments can pinpoint areas of struggle and advocate for improved support. Within the home health care team, the social worker concentrates on current obstacles and assists clients in creating a plan for their future. Addressing needs such as lack of medical transportation, food insecurity or limited access to affordable health services and medications can make the difference between successful home recovery and hospital readmission.”

Bayada provides home health, home care and hospice services in 23 states, as well as in Canada, Germany, India, Ireland, New Zealand, South Korea and the U.K.

To fully support patients, care must go beyond attention to physical symptoms, according to Rachel Witt, chief clinical officer for Aveanna Healthcare (Nasdaq: AVAH).

“Understanding and addressing the psychosocial needs of home health care patients is crucial for achieving positive outcomes,” Witt told HHCN. “Medical social workers play a key role in the home health care team by providing education, resources and support to assist patients and their families in coping with conditions, diseases or injuries.” 

Aveanna Healthcare, based in Atlanta, offers pediatric and adult health services, including nursing, rehabilitation, therapy, day treatment centers and home health and hospice services. 

Social workers also can help patients adjust to the ways their life will change following a serious illness diagnosis.

“Including social workers is vital when addressing psychosocial needs,” Barbara Andazola, vice president of clinical practice, strategy, and programs for home health at Amedysis told HHCN. “Patients often find it difficult to adjust to lifestyle changes brought on by a new or worsening diagnosis, which can adversely affect their physical health. A patient’s emotional and psychosocial well-being greatly influences how they handle their illness and make health-related decisions.” 

Amedisys (Nasdaq: AMED), headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, provides home health care, hospice, palliative care and high-acuity care services in 38 states. 

Andazola explained that including HHCSWs in a patient’s care plan to counsel and address SDoH can greatly influence clinical outcomes. According to the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), HHCSWs work closely with the health care team to ensure that the needs of individuals and their families are met and the care plan is effectively followed. 

“Social workers must be part of the health care team,” Mirean Coleman, Senior Practice Associate for Clinical Social Work at NASW in Washington, D.C. said “They ensure that caregivers and patients receive the support and resources necessary to achieve the best possible care.”

Briggs offered the example of Bayada’s Care Integration program to empower home health clinicians in identifying high-risk patients and providing education regarding additional in-home care that supports the client’s changing needs. Care Integration aims to help clients find the right level of care at the right time, she explained. 

“Our Care Integration managers work closely with the home health teams to identify clients at high risk for rehospitalization and [those who] may require a higher level of care,” Briggs said. “They then partner with the home health team to educate clients and families on the hospice benefit and ensure a seamless transition between Bayada service lines. Care Integration managers meet clients and families where they are, emotionally, and ensure they can remain in their homes with comfort, dignity and respect.” 

HHCSWs provide a holistic review of the client’s physical, emotional, social and spiritual needs and what areas of assistance will enhance their ability to care for themselves in the community. This is done by listening to client needs, providing education and resources and advocating for the client and family. 

“With this process, challenges arise that can impact both the HHCSW and the client’s goals for care,” Susan Owens, a medical social worker at Elara Caring, told HHCN. “One of these challenges includes lack of or limited funding for programs that hinder a patient’s access to services that could ideally meet their needs. Age and income restrictions, state or federal budget constraints, or cutbacks create these limits. In a values-based care system, in which quality is emphasized over quantity, the role of the HHCSW will be of continued importance in providing the support, advocacy and linkage to resources that will enhance satisfaction and foster safety and sufficiency in the community.” 

Dallas-based Elara Caring is a home-based care provider with about 200 locations across 17 states. The company serves more than 60,000 patients.

HHCSWs provide essential support and assistance to patients and their families during their most vulnerable times. They offer counseling services to help individuals cope with various diagnoses, including acute, chronic or terminal illnesses. Additionally, social workers provide caregiver support through education and connections to resource groups.

One of their key roles is educating patients and families about medical conditions, treatment options, advance care planning and available community resources. By empowering patients to make informed decisions, HHCSWs help them navigate the health care system and access supportive services that enhance their quality of life. They also facilitate discussions about end-of-life care preferences, advance directives and hospice care, ensuring patients’ wishes are honored and respected.

Additionally, HHCSWs advocate for patients and their families, ensuring their voices are heard, their preferences respected, and their rights upheld. They also collaborate with other interdisciplinary care team members to coordinate services, address barriers to care and facilitate smooth transitions between health care settings.

“Social workers understand the health care environment and the options available for patients and families,” Witt said. “Incorporating a social worker early in the process is an important step toward setting goals and creating a holistic care plan for the patient. Unfortunately, in many cases, a social worker is not involved until a crisis occurs. Engaging a social worker early can help mitigate issues and prevent a crisis from arising.”

With their extensive knowledge of community resources, support services and financial aid programs, HHCSWs assist patients in connecting with resources for housing assistance, transportation, home-delivered meals, caregiver support, financial aid and other social services that address practical needs and promote independence. They work alongside community agencies, nonprofit organizations and government bodies to ensure patients receive comprehensive, coordinated care that addresses their social and environmental needs.

Andazola provided an example of a typical situation where social workers assist patients in accessing financial resources for necessary prescription medications. 

“If a patient cannot afford to buy medications, they may skip doses or cut them in half, which can lead to hospitalizations,” she explained. “By addressing these financial challenges, social workers promote patient engagement in self-care, improve medication management and help reduce avoidable hospitalizations.”

Around 21,350 social workers are employed in the home health care services industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While this number represents a significant portion of HHCSWs in the U.S., Coleman believes the industry needs more.

“I think there is an employment gap,” she said. “There should be a social worker on every team. Social workers should be involved in the assessment and treatment processes from the moment the physician formulates a care plan—from the initial visit to the time the patient is discharged from the medical facility to home care.”

Andazola notes that recruiting and retaining social workers can be difficult due to coverage limitations under the Medicare home health benefit and certain private payers. Consequently, social work services are frequently offered on a short-term basis, complicating efforts to establish a caseload that justifies full-time employment with benefits.

“There is a gap in the number of social workers in home care to meet the growing demand,” Margot Lambright, division director of psychosocial support at Bayada Hospice, said. “The need for social workers in home care has been increasing due to the aging population and risk in chronic health conditions. Many agencies face challenges in hiring and retaining social workers due to a shortage of workers, financial constraints, and in some cases, a lack of awareness about the influence and opportunities for social workers in home care.” 

Like other health care roles, HHCSWs can work in various environments, such as hospitals and clinics, which generally provide higher salaries. This competition makes the home health care field less attractive. Furthermore, rigorous degree requirements and challenging caseloads may discourage individuals from pursuing home health social work.

“Most home health agencies require social workers to hold a master’s degree in social work, which limits the pool of available candidates,” Witt explained. “Many social workers manage large caseloads due to these degree requirements. Each patient presents unique family dynamics and community resource needs, which can easily lead to job fatigue and burnout. Depending on the agency’s location and service territory, a social worker may have to cover a large geographic area, necessitating regular travel that many find unappealing.”

The average pay for HHCSWs in the U.S. is about $37 per hour, which translates to an annual salary of roughly $77,970, with variations depending on location and experience level, based on recent data from Indeed. Top earners can make around $110,000 annually, but agencies often need to offer more than just competitive compensation to attract qualified applicants due to the factors mentioned by Witt.

“Certainly, recruitment and retention of social workers are challenging,” Rains said. “Probably the biggest issue is the availability of this workforce. We often find that social workers work multiple jobs per diem—essentially, as needed, part-time. While we don’t require social workers in every case, they are critical to better outcomes when their expertise is needed.”

Home health agencies can attract social workers by highlighting the unique aspects of their roles, emphasizing a strong collaborative culture with other health care professionals, offering competitive benefits, actively engaging with social work organizations and schools, and sharing success stories that demonstrate the positive impact of their services, according to NASW.

However, agencies must ensure job postings clearly outline the responsibilities and qualifications required. The NASW suggests that agencies foster a collaborative environment and offer opportunities for continuing education, training and mentorship programs to support HHCSWs’ growth. They should also highlight any specialization in patient populations or unique services provided, as these factors can attract social workers looking to concentrate on a specific practice area.

By prioritising flexibility, collaboration and emotional comfort, modern designs foster better interactions between patients and providers, ultimately transforming the healthcare experience.

March 10, 2025

Significant advancements have recently been made in healthcare design, particularly in the UAE. This aligns with the country’s National Strategy for Wellbeing 2031, which aims to ensure that all aspects of design in healthcare contribute to overall well-being. Today, the focus on thoughtful, patient-centred healthcare design is more pertinent than ever.

Historically, outpatient departments were structured with doctors’ offices, where physicians faced patients from behind desks. This traditional setup created a physical barrier between doctor and patient, generally leading to more formal and less engaging interactions. Additionally, patients frequently experienced longer wait times due to inefficiently designed offices and isolated workflows.

Recent innovations in healthcare design have led to a reimagining of outpatient spaces. Instead of confining physicians to individual offices as in conventional office-based models, new designs prioritise flexibility and mobility, allowing physicians to move among patients rather than the reverse.



This modernised layout offers several significant benefits:

Reduced wait times: With modernised healthcare space layouts, multiple patient rooms can be prepared in advance, enabling physicians to see patients efficiently and minimising wait times.

Enhanced patient-provider interactions: Removing physical barriers like desks from outpatient spaces fosters a more personal and interactive relationship between the patient and healthcare provider.

Improved workflow efficiency: Centralised multidisciplinary staff areas, or ‘pods’, allow healthcare professionals to collaborate and document notes outside patient rooms. This setup facilitates quicker decision-making and enhances the overall care experience.

Aesthetic effects: Designing inpatient spaces to incorporate natural light and provide unobstructed views can improve aesthetic quality. Studies indicate that exposure to natural light can reduce patient stress, shorten recovery times, and improve overall satisfaction during hospital visits.

Another area where healthcare design plays a pivotal role is in specialised clinics, such as those for in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). The design of these spaces must carefully balance the need for privacy with the demand for clinical efficiency, creating an environment that supports both emotional well-being and optimal medical outcomes. Traditional setups often emphasise clinical efficiency at the expense of patient comfort, but modern designs now incorporate elements that cater to the emotional needs of patients undergoing fertility treatments – a critical factor in what can be a stressful and sensitive process.

Private and calming spaces: The interiors of clinics should be designed to provide warm, calming environments, with private areas for confidential conversations between couples or individuals and their healthcare providers. This approach contrasts with the sterile and clinical appearance of the embryology labs, operating rooms, and cryostorage areas, ensuring a clear distinction between care spaces and technical areas.

Streamlining operations: To minimise errors and optimise efficiency, introducing windows between operating rooms and the IVF lab can be considered. This allows for seamless sample transfer. Additionally, outpatient areas should be organised to allow healthcare professionals easy access to patient rooms from a centralised station. This design ensures patient privacy while maximising the time doctors can dedicate to patient care.

Transparency in treatment: A large viewing window to the embryology lab can allow patients to observe the process, promoting transparency and reducing anxiety. This design element helps demystify the IVF procedure, fostering trust between patients and healthcare providers.

The impact of these design innovations extends beyond aesthetics and convenience; they have a measurable influence on patient outcomes. In outpatient settings, more efficient layouts reduce stress for both patients and providers, leading to better diagnoses and treatment plans. In specialised clinics like IVF centres, thoughtful design enhances patient comfort, reduces the potential for errors, and fosters a positive patient experience – crucial factors in high-stakes treatments.

The design of healthcare spaces is integral to improving patient outcomes. Whether through reimagined outpatient departments or thoughtfully designed IVF clinics, the impact of well-considered architecture and interior design is profound. As the healthcare industry moves forward, continued innovation and adaptation in healthcare design will ensure that every element of these spaces contributes to enhancing the patient experience and care quality.

Excluding large health insurance programs, spending under the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s purview falls far short of the budget blueprint’s $880 billion goal for cuts.

The budget resolution passed by House Republicans last month aims to cut government spending by at least $1.5 trillion over 10 years, offsetting President Donald Trump’s promised tax cuts as well as increases in defense funding and border security. 

The blueprint doesn’t specifically mention Medicaid, but Trump has previously vowed not to cut Medicare — leaving the safety-net insurance program, which alongside CHIP provides coverage for 80 million Americans, as a large target for cuts.

Lawmakers must cut Medicaid in order to meet Republicans’ budget goals, said Reps. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., and Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., who requested the analysis. 

“This letter from CBO confirms what we’ve been saying all along: the math doesn’t work without devastating Medicaid cuts,” Pallone said in a statement. “The reality is the only way Republicans can cut at least $880 billion within the Energy and Commerce Committee’s jurisdiction is by making deep, harmful cuts to Americans’ health care.”

Shrinking Medicaid could be a politically tricky decision for Republicans, given the popularity of the program among constituents as well as financial worries from states and hospitals. 

Some Republicans have raised concerns about cutting Medicaid spending. Last month, a group of House Republicans in districts with large Hispanic populations sent a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., arguing Medicaid cuts would hurt their constituents. Trump himself has given conflicting statements on whether the budget will target Medicaid cuts. 

Johnson said on CNN last month that lawmakers plan to find savings by rooting out “fraud, waste and abuse” and adding work requirements, which could limit eligibility in the safety-net insurance program. 

But Republicans are also considering reducing the amount paid for enrollees who receive coverage under the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, Axios reported this week. That could serve as a significant financial hit to states, according to a report by the Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

57% of counties in Iowa don’t have an obstetric facility. That is why University of Iowa Health Care is focused on improving maternity care in the state.

Mar 7, 2025

The U.S. has the highest maternal death rate among high-income countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And with a surge of labor-and-delivery unit closures across the country, it is getting even harder for women to access high-quality maternity care—particularly in rural areas where these closures are most prevalent.

Providing enterprise solutions to equip your leadership, physicians and care teams with resources to advance your programs while being recognized as a leader. 

In Iowa, for instance, there are 3.3 ob-gyns per 10,000 women of reproductive age. This is compared to 4.5 ob-gyns for the same number of women in the U.S. The states with the highest number of ob-gyns per women of reproductive age are the District of Columbia, Connecticut and Minnesota.

“A collision of many trends­­—including fewer places to give birth, fewer ob-gyns, a rural state and increasing complexity of the birthing population—has created challenges for patients who are already overly burdened with accessing care,” said Stephanie Radke, MD, MPH, an ob-gyn at University of Iowa Health Care and a clinical associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Iowa Carver College of Medicine. 

University of Iowa Health Care is a member of the AMA Health System Program, which provides enterprise solutions to equip leadership, physicians and care teams with resources to help drive the future of medicine.

These trends have resulted in maternity care deserts, which are counties across Iowa that don’t have labor-and-delivery services or doctors who provide prenatal care. In fact, 57% of counties in the state do not have an obstetric facility. And yet, 22.3% of babies are born to women living in rural counties in Iowa. This means a significant population of women in Iowa do not have appropriate access to the care they need for a safe and healthy pregnancy.

To tackle the growing challenge of maternity-care deserts, University of Iowa Health Care’s department of obstetrics and gynecology is taking bold steps to train physicians and other health professionals and support the remaining birthing centers across the state. 

Through partnerships and training initiatives, the department’s vision is to build a coordinated regional health care collective focused on one common goal: providing the highest quality maternity care to women in Iowa, when and where they need it.

Over the past 20-plus years, there have been more than 40 birthing-unit closures across Iowa due to low birth volumes, staff shortages and operational and financial challenges facing health systems today.

And when these facilities close, there’s a ripple effect that permeates across the state. 

Most notably, pregnant women are now facing unprecedented barriers to accessing quality pregnancy care. Currently, 14% of women in Iowa do not have a hospital where they can give birth within 30 minutes of their home, compared to 9.7% nationwide. In rural areas in particular, women often have to travel up to an hour or more to give birth. 

As the only academic health system with an ob-gyn department in the state, University of Iowa Health Care treats many of these women. In fact, 61% of its deliveries and obstetric visits are for patients living outside of Johnson County, where University of Iowa Health Care is located.

By not having specialty services nearby, pregnant patients in Iowa are at risk for missed diagnoses and complications, resulting in poorer outcomes overall. For example, if a patient must drive over an hour to see a specialist, they may ignore a seemingly vague symptom such as a bad headache during pregnancy. However, ob-gyns know that a bad headache during pregnancy can indicate more serious issues, such as high blood pressure, which can put the lives of both the mother and baby at risk.

“When hospitals are farther away or harder to get to, people don't access them as easily. And if patients are not near convenient care, it can be catastrophic in acute care scenarios,” said Christian Pettker, MD, chair and department executive officer of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Iowa Health Care. 

Another challenge arises when pregnant patients do seek care for symptoms, but the facility closest to their home is no longer equipped or staffed to care for them appropriately. 

“Typically, if you’re over 20 weeks pregnant and have an obstetrical problem, you’re going to be evaluated in the labor-and-delivery unit. But if the facility doesn’t have a labor-and-delivery unit, emergency medicine providers will have to care for obstetrical problems, which may be outside their scope and comfort zone,” said Dr. Radke. “This can pose concerns about the quality of care a patient receives.”

Of course, hospitals are still able to transfer patients who need a higher level of care. But even these transfers require resources that many smaller facilities don’t have. For instance, the facility may not have an ambulance service, or they may not have enough staff to help safely transfer a patient. 

“These are very small hospitals and sending two nurses in an ambulance several hours away is a huge drain on the facility’s resources for that day,” said Dr. Pettker. 

Meanwhile, the remaining 54 birthing centers in Iowa have absorbed more patients—despite frequently lacking the resources and staff needed to handle the spike in volume. 

“When a facility is overwhelmed with volume and can't safely take care of patients because they don't have enough rooms or nurses for the volume that they're now seeing, that poses a new set of challenges,” said Dr. Radke. 

As part of its advocacy to improve maternal health, the AMA has outlined concrete actions that should be taken to reduce and prevent rising rates of maternal mortality and serious or near-fatal maternal morbidity in the U.S.

University of Iowa Health Care has stepped up to address this ripple effect that is challenging, physicians and health systems. The academic health system is focused on training physicians and other health professionals, advising small health systems on capacity management and providing support to patients and doctors. 

“We take our role as being the academic health system for Iowa very seriously,” said Dr. Pettker. “A lot of the work we are doing right now is to help Iowa take care of Iowans.”

Through a federal grant and a partnership with the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, the health system has launched projects and programs that leverage their physicians’ expertise in clinical care and program development to support maternal health care. 

This starts with playing a proactive role in addressing gaps with education programs and opportunities that allow physicians and other health professionals to expand their clinical skills to include obstetric care. The goal for these programs is to grow the pool for delivering high-quality maternity services. 

These education and training programs include:

Another effective approach for addressing maternity care deserts is by playing a leadership role in the Iowa Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, which was launched about five years ago. The goal of the collaborative is to identify opportunities and implement programs to help all birthing facilities in Iowa to ensure they are providing the highest quality of care to their patients. 

“We want to help them be able to do their jobs better, more efficiently and more effectively, [which] will hopefully help improve the quality and safety of their care,” said Dr. Radke, who directs the collaborative. 

The collaborative is focused on helping birth centers in rural areas in the state gain more experience in treating the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. These include hemorrhage, hypertension and preeclampsia, as well as reducing the inappropriate use of cesarean section. 

“When you work in a really high-volume center, you manage complications all the time because they happen more frequently with more births,” said Dr. Radke. “But facilities that are only delivering 200 babies a year often only see a handful of these emergencies like hemorrhages or preeclampsia.”

To give lower-volume centers more exposure to obstetric emergencies and complications, the collaborative launched a simulation program that guides smaller facilities through simulated emergencies. 

For example, a simulation team recently worked with a rural facility on a simulated obstetric hemorrhage. The simulation team expertly guided the facility staff through clinical care and communication best practices to successfully treat a patient in such an emergency. 

This training exercise ultimately led to a real-life success story. Shortly after the simulation training, a patient at the facility experienced a major obstetric hemorrhage.  

“When the team [at this facility] discussed and debriefed afterward, they all felt like the simulation and best practices review made a very big difference in the outcome,” said Dr. Radke, noting that the patient’s life and baby were saved. “While there's no way to know what the outcome would've been had they not had this training, they were not certain the patient would have lived had they not had the training.”

Overall, Dr. Radke has heard this type of positive feedback time and again: “Staff feel more confident in what to do in these rare situations,” she said. “This can have a trickle-down effect on staff retention and recruitment because we're really offering them professional development.”

“I’m hopeful that this work will create a level of trust and coordination that helps us [build] a regionalized care system in Iowa,” says Dr. Pettker. “These programs have really set the groundwork for that.”

Cardinal Health recently appointed Robert Musslewhite and Sudhakar Ramakrishna to its Board of Directors, which may have reinforced investor confidence, culminating in a 5% share price increase over the last quarter. These appointments enhance the company's governance with expertise from healthcare and cybersecurity sectors. Despite the Dow Jones and other major indices facing declines due to economic concerns and tariff-related uncertainty, Cardinal Health sustained positive momentum. The company's Q2 2025 earnings demonstrated an increase in net income to $400 million from $368 million YoY, and diluted EPS rose to $1.65. Additionally, the firm's affirmation of a quarterly dividend of $0.51 and their active share buyback program of $75 million indicate a commitment to returning value to shareholders, potentially contributing to the stock's upward trajectory amid a backdrop of broader market challenges.

See the full analysis report here for a deeper understanding of Cardinal Health.

The past five years have been rewarding for Cardinal Health's shareholders, with the company achieving a 231.41% total return, including share price appreciation and dividends. While accounting for its performance, several key developments have emerged. In 2024, Cardinal Health successfully expanded its operational footprint, opening a 350,000 sq. ft. facility in South Carolina. The earnings growth over the past year was impressive at a sensational pace compared to the healthcare industry average, contributing to a favorable outlook. Notably, the company maintained attractive valuations, trading at good value relative to both its peers and the estimated fair value, further enhancing its long-term appeal. Additionally, the successful execution of share buyback programs, with over 3.4 million shares repurchased by the end of 2024, signaled management's focus on enhancing shareholder value.

Despite reporting a 4% decline in sales in early 2025, net income for the quarter increased, underscoring the company's ability to boost profitability even in challenging circumstances. Furthermore, Cardinal Health's earnings per share guidance for 2025 was raised, reflecting successful acquisitions that positively impacted revenue. Alongside strategic client partnerships, such as the agreement with T2 Biosystems for selling rapid sepsis diagnostics, these efforts have fortified the company's market position. While Cardinal Health's one-year return lagged behind the overall US market by a small margin, it markedly outpaced the US healthcare industry, which bore a 4.4% decrease over the same period. This performance underscores Cardinal Health's resilience and adaptability in a rapidly evolving landscape.

Walgreens Boots Alliance has announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity affiliated with Sycamore Partners in a deal valued at $23.7 billion.

Sycamore Partners is a private equity firm specializing in retail, consumer and distribution-related investments. 

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by WBA shareholders and after a ""go-shop"" period.

During the go-shop period, WBA will actively solicit and, depending on interest, potentially receive, evaluate and enter into negotiations with parties that offer alternative proposals. The initial go-shop period is 35 days. 

Upon completion of the transaction with Sycamore, WBA's common stock will no longer be listed on the Nasdaq stock market, and WBA will become a private company.

WHY THIS MATTERS

Leveraging WBA's healthcare expertise and Sycamore's established leadership in retail and consumer services, WBA will be better positioned to become the first choice for pharmacy, retail and health services, Walgreens said. 

The company will continue to operate under the Walgreens, Boots Duane Reade, No7 Beauty Company and Benavides names. WBA will maintain its headquarters in the Chicago area.

Tim Wentworth, CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, said: ""While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company. Sycamore will provide us with the expertise and experience of a partner with a strong track record of successful retail turnarounds. The WBA Board considered all these factors in evaluating this transaction, and we believe this agreement provides shareholders premium cash value, with the ability to benefit from additional value creation going forward from monetization of the VillageMD businesses.""

WBA shareholders will receive total consideration consisting of $11.45 per share in cash at closing of the Sycamore transaction and one non-transferable right to receive up to $3 in cash per WBA share from the future monetization of WBA's debt and equity interests in VillageMD, which includes Village Medical, Summit Health and CityMD. 

WBA is currently evaluating a variety of options with respect to its significant debt. The debt owed to WBA by VillageMD as of Feb. 28 is $3.4 billion, Walgreens said.

""For nearly 125 years, Walgreens, and for 175 years, Boots, along with their portfolio of trusted brands, have been integral to the lives of patients and customers. Sycamore has deep respect for WBA's talented and dedicated team members, and we are committed to stewarding the company's iconic brands,"" said Stefan Kaluzny, managing director of Sycamore Partners.

WBA is expected to release its fiscal year 2025 second-quarter financial results and file its quarterly report on April 8.

THE LARGER TREND

The Wall Street Journal first reported in December that Sycamore was in talks to take Walgreens private. The deal was then considered dead.

In February, the sale was considered on again after CNBC's David Faber said on air that the pharmacy chain may be sold to New York-based private equity firm Sycamore Partners.

Walgreens has suffered losses due in large part to VillageMD. Plans for expansion of the primary care network were scrapped as in late 2023, Walgreens announced a $1 billion cost-cutting initiative. This included the closure of more than 60 VillageMD clinics, a number that grew to 160. 

CVS Health has also suffered profit setbacks from operating losses but has been cushioned by its pharmacy benefit manager Caremark, according to Seeking Alpha.

Walgreens has approximately 12,500 locations across the U.S., Europe and Latin America and employs approximately 311,000 people globally.

TDM subsidiary Kumpulan Medic Iman (KMI Healthcare) has entered into a build-and-lease agreement with Bertam Specialist Hospital for constructing a new facility with 100 beds in Bertam, Penang, Malaysia.

The hospital will be situated on a 0.85ha site and is expected to fill a significant healthcare gap in the region, reported Bernama.

With a value estimated at MYR146m ($33m), it will be an approximately ten-minute drive from the Kepala Batas toll exit.

The company would lease the hospital from Bertam Specialist Hospital for an initial 18-year period, with the possibility of a 12 year extension.

The agreement also includes a clause that prevents Bertam Specialist Hospital from leasing nearby land to other hospital operators without the consent of KMI Bertam, which also holds an opportunity to purchase the hospital building and adjacent land under pre-agreed conditions, reported TMR.

KMI Healthcare CEO Dr Rayney Azmi Ali said: ""Bertam is a strategic choice, with a population of 117,043, to be exact. Currently, the only healthcare establishment in this area is the government hospital, leaving a gap that KMI Healthcare is uniquely positioned to fill.

""With Penang Island becoming increasingly congested, we are providing patients with a new option to access medical services on the mainland.

""With advanced healthcare infrastructure, affordability, and cultural amenities, we are well-positioned to tap into this growing market and offer world-class medical services to international patients.”

The upcoming hospital is set to offer surgical and medical facilities, encompassing diagnostic services, centres of excellence, and patient-focused care units.

The construction is scheduled to commence this year, with the hospital's opening anticipated for 2028.

""KMI Healthcare to build new 100-bed hospital in Malaysia"" was originally created and published by Hospital Management, a GlobalData owned brand.

This study, which analysed self-reported data from 1,335 Norwegian nurses, found that shift work – particularly night shifts – was associated with a higher risk of several infections, including the common cold. 

Published in Chronobiology International, the peer-reviewed findings emphasise the importance of adequate sleep and shift management in reducing susceptibility to infection. “These findings highlight the need for tailored interventions to reduce infection risks among healthcare workers,” says Siri Waage, senior author of the study, who is the coordinator at the Norwegian Competence Center for Sleep Disorders, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen. “Sleep debt and irregular shift patterns, including night work, not only compromise nurses’ immune health but could also impact their ability to provide high-quality patient care.” 

The researchers analysed data from the Survey of Shift work, Sleep and Health (SUSSH) study, collected in 2018. The participants – mostly female nurses (90.4%), with an average age of 41.9 years – reported their sleep duration, sleep needs, shift work patterns, and how often they had experienced specific infections over the past three months. Statistical analyses, adjusted for factors such as age, gender, marital status, and childcare responsibilities, revealed a clear link between slept debt, night work and infection risk. 

The study found that sleep debt, defined as the gap between sleep need and actual sleep duration, increased infection risk in a dose-dependent manner: 

The analysis also revealed that night work was linked with an increased risk of the common cold, but was not associated with any of the other infections examined. In contrast, sleep duration and ‘quick returns’ (short intervals between consecutive shifts) were not associated with infection risk. 

Nurses could benefit from optimised shift patterns, such as limiting consecutive night shifts and allowing adequate recovery time between shifts

These findings suggest that ensuring sufficient sleep may help prevent infections, although further research is needed to determine cause-and-effect relationships. 

The authors propose several strategies that might help reduce sleep debt and potentially lower infection risks among nurses in the future. “Nurses could benefit from optimised shift patterns, such as limiting consecutive night shifts and allowing adequate recovery time between shifts,” adds co-author Professor Ståle Pallesen, whose research specialisms blend psychology and insomnia, at the Department of Psychosocial Science at University of Bergen. “Raising awareness about the importance of sleep for immune health and encouraging regular health screening and vaccinations for healthcare workers may also be helpful.” 

A key strength of this study is its large sample size and focus on predominantly female nurses over 30, making it well-suited to analysing associations between sleep patterns and infection risk in this group. However, the findings may not be generalisable to men, younger nurses, other professions, or those with different shift work schedules. Additionally, since data collection took place in the spring, outside the typical flu season, infection rates may have been lower than if the survey had been conducted in winter.

New research reveals a promising approach to developing a universal influenza vaccine that confers lifetime immunity against an evolving virus considered most likely to trigger the next pandemic.

Scientists discover how the production of antibodies is regulated in allergy and infections. This opens the door to new therapies, without affecting the beneficial response of the immune system.

New research provides cause for optimism that long Covid can resolve over time. Following people from the first wave of Covid-19, it monitored the longevity of immune abnormalities after an infection.

On February 25, 2025, President Trump signed “Making America Healthy Again with Clear, Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare Pricing Information,” an Executive Order with the stated purpose of making group health plans and health insurance issuers accountable for compliance with price transparency rules implemented during the first Trump administration.

Specifically, during his first administration, President Trump signed Executive Order 13877 – “Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First,” seeking to address what the new Executive Order describes as “opaque healthcare pricing arrangements” and insufficient accountability concerning healthcare pricing practices. Under Executive Order 13877, regulations were created requiring group health plans to:

The new Executive Order referenced an unidentified 2023 economic analysis that estimated full implementation of the regulations might result in as much as $80 million in healthcare savings by 2025 for consumers, employers, and insurers. An unidentified 2024 report was also referenced for the proposition that price transparency could help employers reduce healthcare costs across 500 common healthcare services.

To address what was described as “stalled” progress on price transparency during the intervening administration, the new Executive Order gave the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services 90 days to act to:

Klaim secures $26M to expand AI-driven healthcare payment solutions, accelerating insurance claims and easing cash flow for medical providers in MENA.

Klaim, a pioneer of healthcare payment acceleration solutions, has successfully secured USD 10 million in Series A equity funding and additional USD 16 million financing fund to drive its regional expansion and transform how medical providers access cash flow. This investment will help propel Klaim’s mission to reshape the healthcare financial landscape by speeding up medical insurance claim payments and improving cash flow for healthcare providers in the MENA region.

Since its founding in 2019, Klaim has positioned itself as an innovative and out-of-the-box force in fintech, providing a cutting-edge payment platform specializing in healthcare. Leveraging artificial intelligence and a vast data repository, Klaim predicts insurance payment behaviors through advanced data analytics and AI models. This enables faster and more efficient healthcare claims processing. With the new funds, Klaim aims to expand its footprint in the UAE, deploy capital in Saudi Arabia, Oman, and other regions, and continuously refine its technology to better serve healthcare providers.

Last year, Klaim announced a strategic milestone in its expansion into Saudi Arabia through a collaboration with Tharawat Tuwaiq Financial Company, an asset manager and financial advisor licensed by the Saudi Capital Market Authority (CMA). As part of this collaboration, Tharawat Tuwaiq has successfully obtained approval and launched a healthcare private closed-ended financing fund. The fund, valued at SAR60 million (approximately USD16 million), aims to enhance access to working capital solutions tailored to the healthcare sector’s unique needs.

The first transaction under this initiative is set to take place in March 2025, further strengthening Klaim’s commitment to empowering healthcare providers with innovative solutions. Additional funds within this program are expected to be introduced in the second half of 2025, reinforcing long-term support for Saudi Arabia’s healthcare ecosystem.

We’re excited to achieve this milestone in our journey. Securing Series A funding is not only a major validation of our vision and business model but also the critical inflection point that enables us to scale rapidly.

The healthcare industry often struggles with prolonged payment cycles, creating significant financial strain for providers. With this fresh funding, we are well-positioned to accelerate our efforts in delivering seamless, efficient payment solutions that allow healthcare providers to focus on patient care without financial uncertainty.

– Karim Dakki, Co-Founder and CEO, Klaim

Klaim is now expanding its focus to enterprise healthcare systems, enabling larger providers and hospital networks to access payments within 24 hours. As we scale, our solutions will empower not only small and mid-sized providers but also large healthcare groups that need seamless, reliable financial solutions to support operational growth. This marks a key milestone in our evolution toward serving the entire healthcare ecosystem at scale.

– Ghafoor Ahmad, Co-Founder & Global Chief Revenue Officer, Klaim

”Klaim’s Series A round was led by Mad’a and with a notable participation of CDG Invest (the investment arm to the Moroccan Deposit and Management Fund – CDG ). This funding marks a significant turning point for Klaim as it pushes closer to its vision of becoming the regional leader in healthcare payments.

Through its 212 Founders program (by CDG Invest), Managing Director Nawfal Fassi Fihri is stating

Karim Dakki and Ahmad Ghafoor are visionary founders who demonstrated a forward-thinking approach, combining their industry expertise with technological innovation to build an innovative Solution for Healthcare, thus addressing a critical gap by solving cash flow problems for medical practitioners. We believe that Klaim’s solution will scale across different healthcare systems, both locally and regionally, including Morocco.

–  Nawfal Fassi Fihri, Managing Director

We recognize the transformative impact of Klaim’s technology in revolutionizing the healthcare and fintech sectors. By optimizing healthcare payment processes and providing expedited access to cash flow, Klaim is addressing a critical industry challenge that has long impeded operational efficiency. We are proud to support Klaim’s expansion across the GCC, including its strategic entry into Saudi Arabia, reinforcing its role as a key driver of digital transformation.

– Abdullah Al Othaim, CEO, Mad’a Investment

With this investment, Klaim aims to scale up its operations, boost its technological capabilities, and continue forming partnerships with leading financial institutions, insurers, and healthcare providers to push for digital transformation within the industry.

CANTON — Area high schoolers had the chance to experience SUNY Canton’s career-focused health care majors firsthand during the Northern Area Health Education Center (NAHEC) Medical Academy of Science and Health (MASH) camp.

“MASH Camp is a collaborative program that provides hands-on opportunities for high school students to explore health careers,” said NAHEC Program Manager Bryn Donovan. “It is an immersive program for high school students, encouraging exploration through hands-on learning.”

At SUNY Canton, MASH campers explored the Nursing, Veterinary Technology, Health and Fitness Promotion, Applied Psychology, Health Care Management, and Physical Therapist Assistant programs. They also earned CPR certifications and attended other training sessions with the college’s EMS Squad.

The 10 high school students toured various departments to explore the tasks and skills required in each career area. They participated in hands-on workshops that highlighted the equipment, technology, and resources used by health professionals.

They also learned about the educational requirements, job duties, essential skills, and key strengths needed for success in healthcare careers in each of the related college programs.

“By working with high school students, NAHEC and SUNY Canton help reinforce the pathway to healthcare professions, which is essential for strengthening the future workforce,” said Elizabeth Brown, SUNY Canton Exec. Director of Workforce Community and Industry Partnerships, who helped facilitate the camp.

MASH Camp was offered during most area schools’ winter break and attracted high school students from across the North Country.

In addition to educators and SUNY Canton Professionals, the students were visited by Assemblymember Scott Gray, who was keenly interested in the program and what the students learned.

“This incredible program brings together students from across the county who are exploring careers in healthcare, providing them with hands-on experiences and the chance to engage with professionals in the field,” Gray said. “Opportunities like this are vital for strengthening our local workforce and ensuring a strong, skilled generation of healthcare professionals.”

In a new plan, CVS is cutting its traditional stores in half and sweeping out the skincare, pretzels, and stationery you would expect at a standard location.

The drugstore giant is preparing to open 12 new mini-stores in cities and towns across the U.S. by this time next year focusing on a full-service pharmacy with healthcare products, including over-the-counter pain medications and first-aid supplies, per a Saturday report from The Wall Street Journal.

The mini-stores will not offer other consumer goods usually expected in a CVS like shampoo and greeting cards.

At around 5,000 square feet, the new stores will be less than half the size of a typical CVS, which ranges from 11,000 to 15,000 square feet. CVS is in the early phase of developing the new stores and plans to have the first few locations operating by the end of 2025.

Related: CVS Is Testing an App That Lets Shoppers Unlock Store Cases Themselves.

Julie Utterback, senior equity analyst for Morningstar, told WSJ that 80% of CVS's sales last year came from its pharmacy department — so focusing mini-stores on that division made sense.

""That is where most of the value is generated,"" Utterback told the outlet. ""The front of the store operations has been in question for a while.""

In 2023, 78.9% of CVS's revenue came from prescription drugs while 21.1% came from front store and other products. CVS's latest earnings report, released last month for the final quarter of 2024, showed that the drugstore chain saw sales growth of 4.2% from the same time a year ago, partly due to growth in its pharmacy business. CVS sales hit $97.71 billion in Q4 2024.

CVS and other drugstore chains like Walgreens have struggled recently to contend with foot traffic and heightened competition from retailers like Walmart.

According to CNN Business, the front end of drugstores, with snacks and toiletries, have seen fewer sales as shoppers turn to Amazon, Walmart, and Target to fill those needs. In response to these challenges, CVS has closed stores and undertaken cost-cutting measures.

CVS laid off nearly 3,000 workers in October 2024 and closed 900 stores (while opening 100 new locations) over the past three years as part of a plan announced in November 2021. It plans to close another 270 stores, and open 30, in 2025.

Rival Walgreens has also been closing stores. In October 2024, the company said that it would shut 1,200 locations over the next three years, with 500 stores slated to close in 2025.

Walgreens also agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners last week in a $10 billion deal as part of its turnaround plan.

CVS had more than 9,000 locations as of December 31 making it the biggest pharmacy in the U.S.

— Top-tier institution —

Cleveland Clinic has been ranked the No. 2 hospital globally for the seventh consecutive year, according to Newsweek’s World’s Best Hospitals 2025.

Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital also earned a place among the best hospitals in the United States, ranking 48th overall and holding the title of the highest-ranked hospital in South Florida and second in Florida.

“This recognition reflects the exceptional dedication of our caregivers, who consistently go above and beyond to deliver world-class care to our patients every single day,” said F. Scott Ross, M.D., vice president and Chief Medical Officer for Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital, which was also named a top hospital in the nation in 2024. “It reaffirms our unwavering commitment to excellence in patient care, groundbreaking research and innovation and improving lives.”

Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital also received recognition in Newsweek’s 2025 rankings of World’s Best Smart Hospitals and World’s Best Specialized Hospitals, with accolades in key areas including cardiac surgery, cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, obstetrics and gynecology and urology. The hospital was also honored on the inaugural list of America’s Best Weight Loss Clinics & Centers.

The World’s Best Hospitals rankings are based on surveys and data from hospitals in 30 countries. Newsweek partners with Statista to compile the annual rankings. Data sources include opinions from more than 85,000 medical experts globally, publicly available data on patient experience and hospital quality metrics and patient-reported outcomes measures.

Nursing students at the University of West Florida (UWF) receive a unique education and perform uniquely compared to other schools.

The UWF School of Nursing graduates outperformed other nursing schools in Florida and similar institutions nationwide. Some 97.67% of UWF School of Nursing graduates passed the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses on their first attempt. That’s the second highest percentage of passing rate in Florida’s university system.

UWF nursing graduates who earned a Bachelor of Science degree also surpassed the national average for those who took the exam. For the first two quarters of 2024, all UWF nursing grads passed the exam. UWF nursing majors passed it with 100%. There was a total of 129 UWF nursing graduates who earned their license to practice by passing that exam. “The success of our students is a testament to their dedication, the tireless efforts of our faculty, community support from local partnerships, and the strong leadership within the college,” said Renee Davis, who was recently hired as the new director of UWF’s School of Nursing. “Our faculty take pride in providing a rigorous and supportive learning environment that allows our students’ hard work and determination to shine. It’s their commitment that ultimately drives their success.”



— Grand Opening —

BayCare recently opened the state’s first behavioral health urgent care center in New Port Richey. This outpatient facility, funded by a $3.6 million grant from the Pasco County Commission, offers walk-in and same-day appointments for adults facing urgent mental health and substance use issues.

The center aims to bridge a critical gap in mental health services by providing timely access to trained professionals and helping individuals avoid crises that might otherwise lead them to emergency rooms or law enforcement. BayCare’s Director of Clinical Operations, Tracey Kaly, emphasized the importance of this facility as a safe space for urgent care and ongoing support.

“When we evaluated how we could better deliver mental health services to the community, we recognized that there was a piece of the puzzle missing,” Kaly said.

“Often, people do not seek help until they are in crisis and feel their only options are to call law enforcement or visit the ER. This center is a bridge — a safe space where people in urgent need of mental health or addiction care can be seen in a timely manner by a trained professional who can evaluate their needs and connect them with ongoing services in their area, hopefully mitigating the need for hospitalization.”

BayCare Behavioral Health Urgent Care patients undergo screenings and clinical evaluations to determine their immediate needs. They can also connect with recovery support specialists, who provide guidance based on personal experiences.

The project received significant backing from the Pasco County Commission, which allocated a large portion of the county’s opioid settlement funds to support it. BayCare leadership and County Commissioners, including Jack Mariano, attended a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Feb. 26. Mariano highlighted the center’s potential to save lives and reduce costs for taxpayers by keeping individuals out of jail.

Since its opening three weeks ago, the center has successfully provided comprehensive care to all patients, including safety plans and follow-up appointments, effectively mitigating the need for hospitalization. The BayCare Behavioral Health Urgent Care operates Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Same-day appointments can be made by calling (727) 281-3350.

“‘Forced medication’: Ron DeSantis wants fluoride out of water” via A.G. Gancarski of Florida Politics — DeSantis isn’t holding back on fluoride in water supplies, believing it’s “forced medication.” “When you’re forcing it into the water supply, that’s not really giving people the choice. If people want to be able to purchase fluoridated water or do more, then they already have the ability to do it,” DeSantis said. Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo had previously said putting fluoride in water was “insane,” given the compound’s “caustic” nature and the fact that toothpaste and other consumer products contain it and give people the option to self-administer. He recommended against community water fluoridation last year. DeSantis said Tuesday that he expects the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to “lean in the direction of Ladapo under Bobby Kennedy,” presumably offering similar guidance.

“Families praise Clay Yarborough’s proposed ‘free kill’ repeal, but health care pros say it’s inoperable” via Jesse Scheckner of Florida Politics — Legislation that would upend Florida’s unique law barring many medical malpractice lawsuits is again advancing in the Senate. Families who had little recourse after losing loved ones say change is needed to bring overdue justice to the state’s health care market. Opponents, most of them in the medical or insurance fields, warn it will make an already expensive industry unaffordable for patients and practitioners. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 9-2 to advance SB 734, which would repeal a 35-year-old state statute — 768.21(8) — prohibiting adult children and their parents from collecting negligence and noneconomic damages for medical malpractice. The law, which detractors have dubbed “free kill,” applies to anyone over 25 seeking medical care in the state, including residents and visitors.

“House passes Vern Buchanan-backed expansion of chronic disease coverage” via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics — The House has passed legislation championed by U.S. Rep. Buchanan that could expand chronic disease coverage nationwide. The Chronic Disease Flexible Coverage Act (HR 919) cleared the House chamber. If the bill becomes law, it will allow employers to offer high-deductible health plan coverage for employees, including pre-deductible coverage for certain health care services that treat common chronic illnesses. “With six in 10 Americans living with at least one chronic disease, it is clear that we must expand options for people to manage their chronic health conditions,” said Buchanan, Chair of the House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee. In remarks on the floor, Buchanan said the cost of chronic diseases accounts for $1 trillion in spending in the American economy. It also accounts for a high percentage of preventable deaths, he said.

“Measles confirmed in Miami teenager, the first in Florida this year” via Christopher O’Donnell of the Orlando Sentinel — A teenager in Miami-Dade has a confirmed case of measles, the first such infection in Florida since a small outbreak of the disease in South Florida in 2024. The infection was reported in the Florida Department of Health database for Florida’s infectious and reportable diseases. A Miami-Dade County Public Schools spokesperson confirmed that a Miami Palmetto Senior High School student was infected. The school district has notified the parents of other students at the school. Florida Department of Health officials are working to trace anyone the student may have come into contact with, according to a letter sent to school parents by Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo. “Due to the high immunity rate in the school, as well as the burden on families and the educational cost of healthy children missing school, DOH is deferring to parents or guardians to make decisions about school attendance,” the letter states.

“New bill aims to end Florida contract with controversial pregnancy centers” via Cindy Krischer Goodman of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel — Democrat Rep. Kelly Skidmore has introduced a bill to end the state’s $29.5 million contract with a controversial pregnancy care provider. While Skidmore of Boca Raton has targeted the Florida Pregnancy Care Network and its lucrative contract in the past, this time is different. That’s because DeSantis also wants to end this same state contract. The Florida Pregnancy Care Network is a private nonprofit with over 95 locations statewide. Critics say centers in the network can be mistaken for reproductive health clinics that provide pregnancy care but are actually nonmedical facilities.

BOLIGEE, Ala. — Green lights flickered on the wireless router in Barbara Williams’ kitchen. Just one bar lit up — a weak signal connecting her to the world beyond her home in the Alabama Black Belt.


		This story also ran on InvestigateTV. It can be republished for free.	

Next to the router sat medications, vitamin D pills, and Williams’ blood glucose monitor kit.

“I haven’t used that thing in a month or so,” said Williams, 72, waving toward the kit. Diagnosed with diabetes more than six years ago, she has developed nerve pain from neuropathy in both legs.

Williams is one of nearly 3 million Americans who live in mostly rural counties that lack both health care and reliable high-speed internet, according to an analysis by KFF Health News, which showed that these people tend to live sicker and die younger than others in America.

Compared with those in other regions, patients across the rural South, Appalachia, and remote West are most often unable to make a video call to their doctor or log into their patient portals. Both are essential ways to participate in the U.S. medical system. And Williams is among those who can do neither.

This year, more than $42 billion allocated in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is expected to begin flowing to states as part of a national “Internet for All” initiative launched by the Biden administration. But the program faces uncertainty after Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick last week announced a “rigorous review” asserting that the previous administration’s approach was full of “woke mandates.”

High rates of chronic illness and historical inequities are hallmarks of many of the more than 200 U.S. counties with poor services that KFF Health News identified. Dozens of doctors, academics, and advocates interviewed for this article unanimously agreed that limited internet service hinders medical care and access.

Without fast, reliable broadband, “all we’re going to do is widen health care disparities within telemedicine,” said Rashmi Mullur, an endocrinologist and chief of telehealth at VA Greater Los Angeles. Patients with diabetes who also use telemedicine are more likely to get care and control their blood sugar, Mullur found.

Diabetes requires constant management. Left untreated, uncontrolled blood sugar can cause blindness, kidney failure, nerve damage, and eventually death.

Williams, who sees a nurse practitioner at the county hospital in the next town, said she is not interested in using remote patient monitoring or video calls.

“I know how my sugar affects me,” Williams said. “I get a headache if it’s too high.” She gets weaker when it’s down, she said, and always carries snacks like crackers or peppermints.

Williams said she could even drink a soda pop — orange, grape — when her sugar is low but would not drink one when she felt it was high because she would get “kind of goozie-woozy.”

‘This Is America’

Connectivity dead zones persist in American life despite at least $115 billion lawmakers have thrown toward fixing the inequities. Federal broadband efforts are fragmented and overlapping, with more than 133 funding programs administered by 15 agencies, according to a 2023 federal report.

“This is America. It’s not supposed to be this way,” said Karthik Ganesh, chief executive of Tampa, Florida-based OnMed, a telehealth company that in September installed a walk-in booth at the Boligee Community Center about 10 minutes from Williams’ home. Residents can call up free life-size video consultations with an OnMed health care provider and use equipment to check their weight and blood pressure.

OnMed, which partnered with local universities and the Alabama Cooperative Extension System, relies on SpaceX’s Starlink to provide a high-speed connection in lieu of other options.

A short drive from the community center, beyond Boligee’s Main Street with its deserted buildings and an empty railroad depot and down a long gravel drive, is the 22-acre property where Williams lives.

Last fall, Williams washed a dish in her kitchen, with its unforgiving linoleum-topped concrete floors. A few months earlier, she said, a man at the community center signed her up for “diabetic shoes” to help with her sore feet. They never arrived.

As Williams spoke, steam rose from a pot of boiling potatoes on the stove. Another pan sizzled with hamburger steak. And on a back burner simmered a mix of Velveeta cheese, diced tomatoes, and peppers.

She spent years on her feet as head cook at a diner in Cleveland, Ohio. The oldest of nine, Williams returned to her family home in Greene County more than 20 years ago to care for her mother and a sister, who both died from cancer in the back bedroom where she now sleeps.

Williams looked out a window and recalled when the landscape was covered in cotton that she once helped pick. Now three houses stand in a carefully tended clearing surrounded by tall trees. One belongs to a brother and the other to a sister who drives with her daily to the community center for exercise, prayers, and friendship with other seniors.

All the surviving siblings, Williams said, have diabetes. “I don’t know how we became diabetic,” she said. Neither of their parents had been diagnosed with the illness.

In Greene County, an estimated quarter of adults have diabetes — twice the national average. The county, which has about 7,600 residents, also has among the nation’s highest rates for several chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, stroke, and obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows.

The county’s population is predominately Black. The federal CDC reports that Black Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and are 40% more likely than their white counterparts to die from the condition. And in the South, rural Black residents are more likely to lack home internet access, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank.

To identify counties most lacking in reliable broadband and health care providers, KFF Health News used data from the Federal Communications Commission and George Washington University’s Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity. Reporters also analyzed U.S. Census Bureau, CDC, and other data to understand the health status and demographics of those counties.

The analysis confirms that internet and care gaps are “hitting areas of extreme poverty and high social vulnerability,” said Clese Erikson, deputy director of the health workforce research center at the Mullan Institute.

Digital Haves vs. Have-Nots

Just over half of homes in Greene County have access to reliable high-speed internet — among the lowest rates in the nation. Greene County also has some of the country’s poorest residents, with a median household income of about $31,500. Average life expectancy is less than 72 years, below the national average.

By contrast, the KFF Health News analysis found that counties with the highest rates of internet access and health care providers correlated with higher life expectancy, less chronic disease, and key lifestyle factors such as higher incomes and education levels.

One of those is Howard County, Maryland, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., where nearly all homes can connect to fast, reliable internet. The median household income is about $147,000 and average life expectancy is more than 82 years — a decade longer than in Greene County. A much smaller share of residents live with chronic conditions such as diabetes.

One is 78-year-old Sam Wilderson, a retired electrical engineer who has managed his Type 2 diabetes for more than a decade. He has fiber-optic internet at his home, which is a few miles from a cafe he dines at every week after Bible study. On a recent day, the cafe had a guest Wi-Fi download speed of 104 megabits per second and a 148 Mbps upload speed. The speeds are fast enough for remote workers to reliably take video calls.

Americans are demanding more speed than ever before. Most households have multiple devices — televisions, computers, gaming systems, doorbells — in addition to phones that can take up bandwidth. The more devices connected, the higher minimum speeds are needed to keep everything running smoothly.

To meet increasing needs, federal regulators updated the definition of broadband last year, establishing standard speeds of 100/20 Mbps. Those speeds are typically enough for several users to stream, browse, download, and play games at the same time.

Christopher Ali, professor of telecommunications at Penn State, recommends minimum standard speeds of 100/100 Mbps. While download speeds enable consumption, such as streaming or shopping, fast upload speeds are necessary to participate in video calls, say, for work or telehealth.

At the cafe in Howard County, on a chilly morning last fall, Wilderson ordered a glass of white wine and his usual: three-seeded bread with spinach, goat cheese, smoked salmon, and over-easy eggs. After eating, Wilderson held up his wrist: “This watch allows me to track my diabetes without pricking my finger.”

Wilderson said he works with his doctors, feels young, and expects to live well into his 90s, just as his father and grandfather did.

Telehealth is crucial for people in areas with few or no medical providers, said Ry Marcattilio, an associate director of research at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. The national research and advocacy group works with communities on broadband access and reviewed KFF Health News’ findings.

High-speed internet makes it easier to use video visits for medical checkups, which most patients with diabetes need every three months.

Being connected “can make a huge difference in diabetes outcomes,” said Nestoras Mathioudakis, an endocrinologist and co-medical director of Johns Hopkins Medicine Diabetes & Education Program, who treats patients in Howard County.

Paying More for Less

At Williams’ home in Alabama, pictures of her siblings and their kids cover the walls of the hallway and living room. A large, wood-framed image of Jesus at the Last Supper with his disciples hangs over her kitchen table.

Williams sat down as her pots simmered and sizzled. She wasn’t feeling quite right. “I had a glass of orange juice and a bag of potato chips, and I knew that wasn’t enough for breakfast, but I was cooking,” Williams said.

Every night Williams takes a pill to control her diabetes. In the morning, if she feels as if her sugar is dropping, she knows she needs to eat. So, that morning, she left the room to grab a peppermint, walking by the flickering wireless router.

The router’s download and upload speeds were 0.03/0.05 Mbps, nearly unusable by modern standards. Williams’ connection on her house phone can sound scratchy, and when she connects her cellphone to the router, it does not always work. Most days it’s just good enough for her to read a daily devotional website and check Facebook, though the stories don’t always load.

Rural residents like Williams paid nearly $13 more a month on average in late 2020 for slow internet connections than those in urban areas, according to Brian Whitacre, an agricultural economics professor at Oklahoma State University.

“You’re more likely to have competition in an urban area,” Whitacre said.

In rural Alabama, cellphone and internet options are limited. Williams pays $51.28 a month to her wireless provider, Ring Planet, which did not respond to calls and emails.

In Howard County, Maryland, national fiber-optic broadband provider Verizon Communications faces competition from Comcast, a hybrid fiber-optic and cable provider. Verizon advertises a home internet plan promising speeds of 300/300 Mbps starting at $35 a month for its existing mobile customers. The company also offers a discounted price as low as $20 a month for customers who participate in certain federal assistance programs.

“Internet service providers look at the economics of going into some of these communities and there just isn’t enough purchasing power in their minds to warrant the investment,” said Ross DeVol, chief executive of Heartland Forward, a nonpartisan think tank based in Bentonville, Arkansas, that specializes in state and local economic development.

Conexon, a fiber-optic cable construction company, estimates it costs $25,000 per mile to build above-ground fiber lines on poles and $60,000 to $70,000 per mile to build underground.

Former President Joe Biden’s 2021 infrastructure law earmarked $65 billion with a goal of connecting all Americans to high-speed internet. Money was designated to establish digital equity programs and to help low-income customers pay their internet bills. The law also set aside tens of billions through the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, to connect homes and businesses.

That effort prioritizes fiber-optic connections, but federal regulators recently outlined guidance for alternative technologies, including low Earth orbit satellites like SpaceX’s Starlink service.

Funding the use of satellites in federal broadband programs has been controversial inside federal agencies. It has also been a sore point for Elon Musk, who is chief executive of SpaceX, which runs Starlink, and is a lead adviser to President Donald Trump.

After preliminary approval, a federal commission ruled that Starlink’s satellite system was “not reasonably capable” of offering reliable high speeds. Musk tweeted last year that the commission had “illegally revoked” money awarded under the agency’s Trump-era Rural Digital Opportunity Fund.

In February, Trump nominated Arielle Roth to lead the federal agency overseeing the infrastructure act’s BEAD program. Roth is telecommunications policy director for the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Last year, she criticized the program’s emphasis on fiber and said it was beleaguered by a “woke social agenda” with too many regulations.

Commerce Secretary Lutnick last week said he will get rid of “burdensome regulations” and revamp the program to “take a tech-neutral approach.” Republicans echoed his positions during a U.S. House subcommittee hearing the same day.

When asked about potentially weakening the program’s required low-cost internet option, former National Telecommunications and Information Administration official Sarah Morris said such a change would build internet connections that people can’t afford. Essentially, she said, they would be “building bridges to nowhere, building networks to no one.”

'That Hurt’

Over a lunch of tortilla chips with the savory sauce that had been simmering on the stove, Williams said she hadn’t been getting regular checkups before her diabetes diagnosis.

“To tell you the truth, if I can get up and move and nothing is bothering me, I don’t go to the doctor,” Williams said. “I’m just being honest.”

Years ago, Williams recalled, “my head was hurting me so bad I had to just lay down. I couldn’t stand up, walk, or nothing. I’d get so dizzy.”

Williams thought it was her blood pressure, but the doctor checked for diabetes. “How did they know? I don’t know,” Williams said.

As lunch ended, she pulled out her glucose monitor. Williams connected the needle and wiped her finger with an alcohol pad. Then she pricked her finger.

“Oh,” Williams said, sucking air through her teeth. “That hurt.”

She placed the sample in the machine, and it quickly displayed a reading of 145 — a number, Williams said, that meant she needed to stop eating.

Here’s how KFF Health News did its analysis for the “Dead Zone” series, which pinpointed counties that lag behind the rest of the United States in access to broadband service and health care providers.

To identify “dead zones,” KFF Health News consulted two main data sources.

GWU’s data for behavioral health providers reflects psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, therapists, and addiction medicine specialists, regardless of whether their patients receive Medicaid. We used data from 2021, the most recent year available.

We classified counties as “dead zones” if they met these criteria:

A total of 210 counties met those criteria. At the other extreme, we defined 203 counties as “most served” if they had the most residences with broadband access (at least 96.7%) and ranked in the top third of Medicaid primary care and behavioral health provider ratios.

We also compared the health outcomes and demographics of dead zone counties relative to others using several data sources:

BOLIGEE, Ala. — Green lights flickered on the wireless router in Barbara Williams’ kitchen. Just one bar lit up — a weak signal connecting her to the world beyond her home in the Alabama Black Belt.

Next to the router sat medications, vitamin D pills, and Williams’ blood glucose monitor kit.

“I haven’t used that thing in a month or so,” said Williams, 72, waving toward the kit. Diagnosed with diabetes more than six years ago, she has developed nerve pain from neuropathy in both legs.

Williams is one of nearly 3 million Americans who live in mostly rural counties that lack both health care and reliable high-speed internet, according to an analysis by KFF Health News, which showed that these people tend to live sicker and die younger than others in America.

Compared with those in other regions, patients across the rural South, Appalachia, and remote West are most often unable to make a video call to their doctor or log into their patient portals. Both are essential ways to participate in the U.S. medical system. And Williams is among those who can do neither.

This year, more than $42 billion allocated in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is expected to begin flowing to states as part of a national “Internet for All” initiative launched by the Biden administration. But the program faces uncertainty after Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick last week announced a “rigorous review” asserting that the previous administration’s approach was full of “woke mandates.”

High rates of chronic illness and historical inequities are hallmarks of many of the more than 200 U.S. counties with poor services that KFF Health News identified. Dozens of doctors, academics, and advocates interviewed for this article unanimously agreed that limited internet service hinders medical care and access.

Without fast, reliable broadband, “all we’re going to do is widen health care disparities within telemedicine,” said Rashmi Mullur, an endocrinologist and chief of telehealth at VA Greater Los Angeles. Patients with diabetes who also use telemedicine are more likely to get care and control their blood sugar, Mullur found.

Diabetes requires constant management. Left untreated, uncontrolled blood sugar can cause blindness, kidney failure, nerve damage, and eventually death.

Williams, who sees a nurse practitioner at the county hospital in the next town, said she is not interested in using remote patient monitoring or video calls.

“I know how my sugar affects me,” Williams said. “I get a headache if it’s too high.” She gets weaker when it’s down, she said, and always carries snacks like crackers or peppermints.

Williams said she could even drink a soda pop — orange, grape — when her sugar is low but would not drink one when she felt it was high because she would get “kind of goozie-woozy.”

‘This Is America’

Connectivity dead zones persist in American life despite at least $115 billion lawmakers have thrown toward fixing the inequities. Federal broadband efforts are fragmented and overlapping, with more than 133 funding programs administered by 15 agencies, according to a 2023 federal report.

“This is America. It’s not supposed to be this way,” said Karthik Ganesh, chief executive of Tampa, Florida-based OnMed, a telehealth company that in September installed a walk-in booth at the Boligee Community Center about 10 minutes from Williams’ home. Residents can call up free life-size video consultations with an OnMed health care provider and use equipment to check their weight and blood pressure.

OnMed, which partnered with local universities and the Alabama Cooperative Extension System, relies on SpaceX’s Starlink to provide a high-speed connection in lieu of other options.

A short drive from the community center, beyond Boligee’s Main Street with its deserted buildings and an empty railroad depot and down a long gravel drive, is the 22-acre property where Williams lives.

Last fall, Williams washed a dish in her kitchen, with its unforgiving linoleum-topped concrete floors. A few months earlier, she said, a man at the community center signed her up for “diabetic shoes” to help with her sore feet. They never arrived.

As Williams spoke, steam rose from a pot of boiling potatoes on the stove. Another pan sizzled with hamburger steak. And on a back burner simmered a mix of Velveeta cheese, diced tomatoes, and peppers.

She spent years on her feet as head cook at a diner in Cleveland, Ohio. The oldest of nine, Williams returned to her family home in Greene County more than 20 years ago to care for her mother and a sister, who both died from cancer in the back bedroom where she now sleeps.

Williams looked out a window and recalled when the landscape was covered in cotton that she once helped pick. Now three houses stand in a carefully tended clearing surrounded by tall trees. One belongs to a brother and the other to a sister who drives with her daily to the community center for exercise, prayers, and friendship with other seniors.

All the surviving siblings, Williams said, have diabetes. “I don’t know how we became diabetic,” she said. Neither of their parents had been diagnosed with the illness.

In Greene County, an estimated quarter of adults have diabetes — twice the national average. The county, which has about 7,600 residents, also has among the nation’s highest rates for several chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, stroke, and obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows.

The county’s population is predominately Black. The federal CDC reports that Black Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and are 40% more likely than their white counterparts to die from the condition. And in the South, rural Black residents are more likely to lack home internet access, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank.

To identify counties most lacking in reliable broadband and health care providers, KFF Health News used data from the Federal Communications Commission and George Washington University’s Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity. Reporters also analyzed U.S. Census Bureau, CDC, and other data to understand the health status and demographics of those counties.

The analysis confirms that internet and care gaps are “hitting areas of extreme poverty and high social vulnerability,” said Clese Erikson, deputy director of the health workforce research center at the Mullan Institute.

Digital Haves vs. Have-Nots

Just over half of homes in Greene County have access to reliable high-speed internet — among the lowest rates in the nation. Greene County also has some of the country’s poorest residents, with a median household income of about $31,500. Average life expectancy is less than 72 years, below the national average.

By contrast, the KFF Health News analysis found that counties with the highest rates of internet access and health care providers correlated with higher life expectancy, less chronic disease, and key lifestyle factors such as higher incomes and education levels.

One of those is Howard County, Maryland, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., where nearly all homes can connect to fast, reliable internet. The median household income is about $147,000 and average life expectancy is more than 82 years — a decade longer than in Greene County. A much smaller share of residents live with chronic conditions such as diabetes.

One is 78-year-old Sam Wilderson, a retired electrical engineer who has managed his Type 2 diabetes for more than a decade. He has fiber-optic internet at his home, which is a few miles from a cafe he dines at every week after Bible study. On a recent day, the cafe had a guest Wi-Fi download speed of 104 megabits per second and a 148 Mbps upload speed. The speeds are fast enough for remote workers to reliably take video calls.

India's healthcare sector is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by rising demand for quality medical services, increasing cases of chronic diseases, and rapid technological advancements. The industry has emerged as a key pillar of the country's economy, attracting strong investor interest and undergoing structural reforms to enhance efficiency, accessibility, and patient care. As healthcare delivery models evolve, funding and financing play a crucial role in sustaining the sector's growth and expansion.

From 2022 to 2024, India witnessed a surge in healthcare-related investments, with mergers, acquisitions, and private equity transactions surpassing USD 30 billion. Hospitals have been at the forefront of these investments, accounting for nearly 40% of the total deal value. In 2024 alone, the hospital segment dominated deal values with a 44% share, amounting to approximately USD 6.1 billion—marking an impressive year-on-year growth of nearly 24%.

Grant Thornton Bharat, in collaboration with the Association of Healthcare Providers India (AHPI), has released the report titled Vitals for Growth: Decoding Healthcare Financing and Funding in India. The report delves into the evolving financing landscape and investment trends shaping India's healthcare ecosystem.

It highlights how multispecialty hospitals continue to lead healthcare delivery, with recent consolidations focused on achieving operational efficiencies and expanding regional footprints. Meanwhile, single-specialty hospitals have garnered USD 1.4 billion in private equity investments over two years, signaling strong investor confidence in their scalability and cost efficiency.

According to the report, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has played a vital role in healthcare infrastructure expansion, with USD 3.2 billion flowing into the sector between 2022 and 2024. Since April 2000, cumulative FDI inflows into healthcare and diagnostics have reached USD 11.19 billion, predominantly directed toward hospital chains, diagnostic centers, and specialised care facilities. However, sustaining this momentum requires a diverse mix of funding solutions, including equity financing, debt financing, and public-private partnerships (PPPs).

Bhanu Prakash Kalmath S J, Partner and Healthcare Industry Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, underscores the importance of value-based care models, operational efficiency, and digital transformation in driving sectoral growth. ""India's healthcare landscape is being reshaped by shifting demographics and rising preventive care demand. Investor interest in efficiently run hospitals continues to grow, supported by strong market fundamentals and a favorable investment climate,"" he noted.

""To strengthen India's healthcare infrastructure, it is crucial to address the shortage of healthcare professionals, with a deficit of 1.54 million doctors and 2.4 million nurses. The urban-rural disparity remains a challenge, as 60% of hospital beds are concentrated in metro cities while 70% of the population resides in non-metro regions. The increasing cost of medical treatments and high out-of-pocket expenditures further necessitate innovative financing models. Addressing these concerns through enhanced medical training programs, incentives for rural healthcare expansion, and digital health adoption will be pivotal in ensuring equitable access to care across all regions of India,"" shared Dr Girdhar Gyani, Director General, AHPI.

As the sector evolves, hospitals remain the primary investment focus, benefiting from high valuation multiples ranging between 20x and 30x EBITDA in high-demand specialties like oncology, cardiology, and mother-and-child care. Expanding bed capacity, optimising operational efficiency, and leveraging digital health solutions will be key to sustaining growth.

""Hospitals that demonstrate long-term growth potential through digital adoption and strategic acquisitions will strengthen their market positioning and command premium valuations, reflecting investor confidence in scalable and high-performing healthcare models,"" added Darshana Kadakia, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat.

The Vitals for Growth report provides a roadmap for stakeholders, offering insights to navigate India's dynamic healthcare financing landscape and drive long-term, sustainable development.

5 On Your Side at Noon

MISSOURI, USA — A growing crisis has swallowed numerous nursing homes around Missouri. Growing threats of Medicaid cuts nationwide threaten to plunge that crisis into catastrophe.

Five major nursing homes throughout the state shut down over the past year, including Festus Manor and Northview Village near St. Louis. Both closed due to reported financial issues.

Around 67% of Missouri's nursing homes are largely funded by Medicaid, including over 95% of nursing homes in St. Louis, according to Lenny Jones, the Missouri state director of Service Employees International Union Healthcare, which represents workers in health care, child care, home care and nursing homes throughout the Midwest.

The state's nursing homes are now bracing for Republicans' proposed billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, which could end health care for millions of adults and children. The Medicaid cuts would fund tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, while leaving the poorest Americans without access to life-saving medical care. 

""They're trying to make these $800 billion worth of cuts in Medicaid programs to fund tax cuts for the wealthy,"" Jones told 5 On Your Side. ""This is a very perverse demand that says that wealthy people need even more money. How are they going to get more money? They're going to take it from hardworking Missourians.""

The state's nursing homes already suffer from staffing shortages, poor care standards and lack of federal compliance. 

Missouri has the smallest number of hours of care per day per resident of any other state in the nation, and a 2024 St. Louis Board of Alders report said all of the city's nursing homes are run by for-profit enterprises, which have severely cut costs to boost profits.

Proposed Medicaid cuts would only worsen the already present problems, according to Jones.

""If lawmakers go into a setting where nursing homes already have problems that are a direct result of poor staffing and cut funding, nursing homes will have to cut staffing,"" Jones said. ""When you cut back on staffing, the care gets worse. When you cut back on staffing, it puts more burden on nursing home workers who have to take care of more residents, and then they feel the brunt of the pain from family members when their loved one isn't getting the care they deserve because the staff is stretched so thin.""

Shunda Whitfield works for the Estates of Spanish Lake Nursing and Rehabilitation Facility and is also a member of SEIU. While she does worry about what Medicaid cuts mean for nursing home care's future, she worries more about the hundreds of thousands of children and people with disabilities who would no longer have health care if the cuts are approved.

""There would be 1.3 million Missourians affected if Medicaid is cut, with over 600,000 children in Missouri alone who rely on Medicaid,"" Whitfield said. ""It would affect my job, but it's not just about my job. It's about what the people who are disabled, children, seniors, people with in-home health care ... where would these cuts leave them? That's my biggest worry.""","{'href': 'https://www.ksdk.com', 'title': 'KSDK.com'}"

As part of the visit, he will engage with senior US government officials and congressional representatives at key Northern Ireland Bureau and White House St Patrick’s Day events.

The Minister’s programme includes high-level meetings with leading US healthcare leaders, universities, and global organisations. Central to the visit is engagement with a world-renowned national cancer institute, Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Centre where he will deliver a keynote speech on improving cancer outcomes through advanced diagnostics, innovative technology and equitable healthcare access.

Engagement with Queen’s University Belfast, Ulster University and University College Dublin is also part of his schedule for the week. 

Speaking ahead of the visit, Minister Nesbitt said: 

“Cancer remains one of the most pressing global health challenges and international collaboration is key to advancing diagnostics, research and treatment. This visit is an opportunity to engage with international experts and leading institutions to ensure that Northern Ireland remains at the forefront of healthcare innovations and equitable access to high quality care.  “Northern Ireland has always had a strong and valued partnership with the United States and I hope this visit will help reinforce those ties. Ensuring health equity and achieving better health outcomes across all communities is a key priority for me as Health Minister. This visit will be a key step in furthering Northern Ireland’s commitment to global cooperation, healthcare excellence and improved health outcomes as well as opening new opportunities for groundbreaking research and technological advancements.”

KKR stock is sliding after making an improved bid for U.K. healthcare group Assura

Shares in private equity group KKR & Co were off over 7% today after it sweetened a multi-billion dollar deal for British healthcare property developer Assura.

KKR has followed the old Scottish adage of “if you don’t succeed once, then try, try again,” by making a fifth attempt to buy Assura since last September. All four previous bids have been turned down.

In a statement today Assura said it is now considering an indicative, non-binding proposal from KKR and Stonepeak Partners of 49.4p per share. That is a premium of about a third to Assura’s closing share price on February 13th and values the company at around $2.08billion. It is also higher than the last offer KKR made at 48p per share. The Assura board said it is likely to recommend the offer to shareholders and will engage in discussions with KKR and Stonepeak.

Assura, running more than 600 properties with an investment value of about £3.2 billion as of last September, counts the UK’s state-backed and under-pressure National Health Service as a customer. Analysts said that the higher price means that KKR is very keen to get the deal over the line. Significantly it did not include involvement from pension fund USS Investment Management which joined KKR in making the February bid.

Despite the uncertainty over the deal shown by KKR investors today, a successful conclusion might see more moves from private equity firms on the downtrodden U.K. real estate sector.

On TipRanks, KKR has a Strong Buy consensus based on 11 Buy and 3 Hold ratings. Its highest target price is $214. KKR stock’s consensus price target is $173.77 implying an 63.06% upside.

KKR has partnered with Stonepeak Partners to make a £1.6bn (€1.9bn) bid for UK healthcare property investor Assura, after KKR’s previous offer with UK’s Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), which was 2.9% lower, was rejected last month.

The board of Assura said the latest possible cash offer of 49.4p per share, which consists of a declared 0.84p quarterly dividend and 48.56p cash at closing, would likely receive their recommendation to shareholders, subject to the agreement of the other terms of the offer.

Assura also disclosed receiving a non-binding all-share merger proposal from Primary Health Properties (PHP), valued at 43p per Assura share but said the KKR consortium’s 49.4p cash offer was more attractive and therefore rejected the PHP proposal.

Last month, Assura rejected a £1.56bn possible offer from KKR and USS. Following the rejection, USS said it did not intend to make an offer for Assura, as part of the consortium or otherwise.

At the time, KKR said it was considering whether to continue engaging with the board, but there is no guarantee that a firm offer will be made.

London-listed Assura, designs, builds, invests in and manages general practitioner and primary care buildings in the UK. As of the third quarter of last year, the company owned 625 healthcare buildings across the UK and Ireland, valued at  £3.2bn.

George Clooney recently said goodbye to his silver fox locks and hello to a new hair chapter. 

The Ocean's Eleven star, known for his striking salt-and-pepper hair, has officially gone brunette. That's right. Gone are the days of grays as Clooney prepares for his Broadway role as journalist Edward R. Murrow in ""Good Night, And Good Luck,"" per Page Six. 

The standout was seen enjoying lunch at Raoul’s in New York City with wife Amal and attorney Kevin Johnson on Sunday (March 9) afternoon, and fans were quick to point out his new hair color. 

Photos obtained by the outlet show Clooney throwing a backpack into a vehicle and giving the world a first look at his brunette era. The silver screen king is no stranger to ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" as he starred in the film in 2005. But this time around, instead of playing a supporting role as he did two decades ago, Clooney is taking the lead. 

The 63-year-old actor was not eager to dye his hair and recently told the New York Times that he knew his wife and kids would hate it long before he got it done.

""My wife is going to hate it because nothing makes you look older than when an older guy dyes his hair. My kids are going to just laugh at me nonstop.""

Alabama Barker has a new boyfriend amid her ongoing feud with Bhad Bhabie.

On Sunday, March 9, the influencer uploaded a couple of videos to TikTok debuting her new relationship. In one video, the daughter of Travis Barker and Shanna Moakler wore a red silk button down and danced with her new man, who has been identified as Scooter Jackson.

Jackson, who hails from Compton, California, is on the football team at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). His freshman and part of his sophomore year, he played defensive back for Utah Tech. He has since joined the UCLA squad, transferring to the school in the middle of his sophomore year. Jackson announced his decision to transfer back in December 2024.

""I'm home,"" he captioned a post on X (formerly Twitter).

Now, he's linked up with Alabama, though it's unclear how long the two have been an item. In another TikTok uploaded on Sunday, March 9, Alabama, 19, sat on Jackson's lap as he caressed her legs. The two were sitting in a chair with an unmade bed seen in the background. Alabama turned the comments off on both of the videos, which have since gone viral.

Alabama's decision to go public with her new boyfriend comes amid her ongoing feud with rapper Bhad Bhabie (real name: Danielle Bregoli). Things between the two really soured when Bhad Bhabie, 21, accused Alabama of trying to steal her boyfriend, Le Vaughn, 26, in late 2024.

""@alabamaluellabarker took my man,"" Bhad Bhabie wrote on her Instagram Stories in December. ""I told Lv next time I catch you. You gon b with them!"" she wrote in a follow-up post.



Alabama released a statement of sorts, denying any involvement with Le Vaughn, whom she accused of being ""physically abusive towards women.""

""I want to be clear: I have no interest in this man, nor would I ever lower myself to be with someone who has been physically abusive towards women,"" she wrote on her Instagram Stories, per the Daily Mail.

Bregoli claimed on another track that Alabama had hooked up with Tyga and Soulja Boy, and claimed that the ""Rack City"" rapper, 35, got her pregnant. Alabama vehemently denied all three claims.

Jennifer Garner's boyfriend, John Miller, was spotted at her house for the first time since news of Ben Affleck wanting to rekindle a relationship with the 13 Going on 30 actress surfaced. 

The CaliBurger CEO showed up to the standout's Brentwood residence in a New York Yankees T-shirt, boots, and a baseball cap, as seen in photos obtained by Daily Mail, on Sunday (March 9). The outlet referred to the sighting as Miller sending a ""clear message"" to Affleck that he's not going anywhere. 

Romance rumors between Garner and Affleck, who were together for 10 years before finalizing their divorce in 2018, began to swirl last week after a photo of the former pair embracing was taken during a paintball outing with their 13-year-old son Samuel. In the photo, the Argo star held Garner by her waist, and she did not seem to pull away. A rep for Affleck, who finalized his divorce from Jennifer Lopez in February, revealed that the actor would be interested in reigniting a spark with the Alias alum but respects Miller and realizes that it's not the right time. 

As for Garner, she is happy to maintain a strict co-parenting relationship with her ex and is enjoying her current relationship with Miller. 

""Jen has a great co-parenting relationship with Ben, and that’s where things stand on her end at the moment,"" a source recently shared. 

Just last month, an insider told Daily Mail how Miller really felt about his girlfriend's connection with her ex.

Brian Litterell's son is following in his dad's footsteps as he has embarked on a music career — and fans are weighing in.

On Sunday, March 9, the Backstreet Boys member's 22-year-old son Baylee appeared as a contestant on American Idol.

When Baylee stood before the three judges — Carrie Underwood, Lionel Richie, and Luke Bryan — he revealed who his dad was after Underwood quipped, ""There's something about you that looks familiar.""

Baylee chose to perform an original song that was met with positive feedback from the judges. The musical powerhouses then invited the ""Shape of My Heart"" musician, 50, into the room to sing with his son.

Most fans seemed to be wowed by Baylee's audition, gushing about his talent in the comment section of American Idol's Instagram post showcasing photos of the viral audition.

""Incredible!!!! And so good to see a little harmonizing with his dad!!🤩🤩,"" an individual commented.

""Congratulations Baylee 👏 you sounded amazing! Musical talent definitely runs in the family 🔥,"" someone else wrote.

A third person commented, ""OMG! I enjoyed watching this❤️like father like son😍🙌.""

A post shared by Ryan Seacrest (@ryanseacrest)

However, a few people stated they felt Baylee made it through just based on who his father is.

One person wrote, ""✨nepotism✨ 😂😂😂😂.""

""The only thing is, how is it fair? His father is in a very popular band,"" a separate person noted. ""Well, these other people are coming on to come on and they're from a waitress background or there another kid just starting to sing when this one has his father in the business and he's already released albums.""

Baylee admitted it was daunting to pursue music because of his dad's remarkable success in the business.

""I believe I get my voice from Dad, and hopefully, I can do him justice today. I guess you could say music runs in our family,"" he told the camera before going in for his audition. ""Following in my dad's footsteps is scary because his career, to me, is one of the most extraordinary in music history. No one can ever compare.""

Brian spoke about his son before he went in for the audition, saying that while people think it's easier to be born into this industry, it still comes with challenges.

""Obviously, growing up in the industry, a lot of people would look at that as a perk, but it's not easy,"" he remarked. ""I've always told everybody that he's 10 times more talented than I ever was.""

Baylee received a ""yes"" from all three judges so is headed to the next round.

Catch American Idol on ABC on Sundays at 8 p.m. ET.

Hailey Bieber isn't letting drama get her down as she shared some new pictures with her son, Jack Blues Bieber.

On Sunday, March 9, the 28-year-old model — who wed Justin Bieber in 2018 — posted an Instagram carousel with two photos of her and the 31-year-old singer's 7-month-old son.

The Rhode beauty founder shared two snaps with her little one soaking up the sun but made sure not to show his face. She donned a wide-brimmed straw sun hat and held her baby in her arms. Jack, for his part, was dressed in a knitted red hat and a long-sleeved white top.

Hailey captioned her post with the heart on fire emoji.

Fans took to the comment section to gush about baby Bieber and support the mother-and-son duo.

""Little jackie exploring the nature and its beauty with mama 🥹🤏🏻♥️,"" one fan commented.

Someone else wrote, ""i'm crying, how cute is this 🥹🫶🏻.""

""Go hailey don't mind the haters they are just jealous of you! Keep on doing your thing! 🫶🫶🫶,"" a third person commented.

A post shared by Hailey Rhode Bieber (@haileybieber)

The influencer's post comes after she got caught up in social media drama last week. TikTok user @courtneypresto alleged Hailey liked a video she made on the platform last month laughing at Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco's Interview Magazine photoshoot. (Gomez, 32, and Justin were in an on-again, off-again relationship from 2010 to 2018 — the former Disney Star is now engaged to Blanco, 37.)

Despite the user's claims, Hailey's rep told Page Six, ""This never happened,"" and ""This entire story has been fabricated by a content creator looking to capitalize off of an old, tired narrative.""

Additionally, the ""Never Say Never"" hitmaker has been caught up in scandal himself.

Last month, many people expressed concern about Justin's well-being due to how he was presenting himself in public — some people even speculated drug use.

However, the Grammy Award winner's rep spoke to TMZ, vehemently shutting down these rumors, calling them ""exhausting and pitiful"" and saying they show ""people are committed to keeping negative, salacious, harmful narratives alive"" despite the ""obvious truth.""

Harrison Ford thinks Dame Helen Mirren is a ""real cool lady"".

The 82-year-old actor stars with the Oscar-winning actress as couple Jacob and Cara Dutton in 'Yellowstone' prequel '1923' and when the cameras aren't rolling, the pair had a ""good time"" together.

Hailing her co-star ""such a bloke"", the 79-year-old actress told People magazine: ""He's what in England we call a bloke. He is a guy, and because he's a bloke, all the other blokes absolutely love him, and quite rightfully.

""And he's always so lovely to all the other actors.

""The other guys just gather around Harrison because they just want to be in his company, I think. And I tag along.""

Harrison added: ""If I'm a bloke, she's what we used to call a broad — and there's no disparagement in calling a Dame a broad.

""It means that she's a woman that has the bandwidth to hang with men — not just to be a lady with them, but to actually hang with them. She's a real cool lady.""

Helen praised the 'Star Wars' actor for always being present amongst his co-stars even when he wasn't filming.

She said: ""We would sit around together and shoot the s*** off-set.

""Harrison is not like an, 'I'm going to my trailer' person. I don't think I ever knew him [or] remember him going ever to his trailer. We hang around on the set and we do our thing.""

Harrison agreed: ""We had a good time. A good time hanging out together as well as working together.""

The couple think it is ""rare"" to see such a story as that of Jacob and Cara on screen these days.

Harrison said: ""These two are partners as much as lovers, and [they're] depending on each other for things that they are not part of their quiver of arrows.

""And it's an extraordinary relationship that Taylor [Sheridan] has written for us to inhabit.""

Helen agreed: ""It's rare to see. In movies, people get married or they meet-cute and they fall in love and they have hot sex or whatever, and then it's all over, happily ever after.

""Well, this is the ever after. Now we're seeing what happens at the end of that story, and you very rarely see that on screen.""

Michael Sheen was in ""massive debt"" and had ""nothing left"" after funding the 2019 Homeless World Cup.

The 'Good Omens' actor had led Cardiff's bid to host the tournament but when the money for the event fell through, he sold his houses in Los Angeles and Wales to personally finance the competition, which proved to be a big risk.

He told the Guardian newspaper: “At first, I thought it was the end of everything. I mean, I had nothing left. Not just that, I was in massive debt – I’m still paying it off.”

It was a particularly frightening time for the 56-year-old star because his partner Anna Lundberg was pregnant with their first child, but she was supportive of the move.

He said: “Anyone would have been in their rights to go, ‘Sorry, I didn’t sign up for this.’ It could have gone either way, but I’m very glad that it went the way it did. I just couldn’t have got through that without her.”

And while Michael - who has Lily, 26, with former partner Kate Beckinsale, and Lyra, five, and two-year-old Mabli with Anna - had lost his assets, he found it ""very liberating"" and doesn't regret the decision.

He said: ""There was something very liberating about that as well, but only because I realized that I had a support, a safety net.

""[I'd look at other actors] and I look at what they’ve got, and I haven’t got that. But I made a choice, and I’m very happy with the choice I made.

“I learned a lot from it – about myself and about what matters to me – and I learned that that’s not the end of the story. For me, it was sort of the beginning of the story.”

In 2021, the 'Damned United' star declared himself a ""not-for-profit"" actor because he is keen to use his earnings for good, and he believes hearing stories of poverty in his home town of Port Talbot in Wales has made him a ""better actor"".

He explained: ""It has given me a different kind of emotional connection to what I do. I find myself more emotionally available in my work than I was maybe when I was younger.

""So, completely selfishly, it’s made me a better actor as well – but that wasn’t something that was conscious.”

And Michael also feels less powerless by using his wealth to help others.

He said: “I think one of the most destructive things about the way we live now is that we’re constantly surrounded by injustice or a sense of things that are not right, and yet feeling like we can’t do anything about it.

""I’ve learned that by engaging in whatever way it is, it at least allows you to feel like you’re doing something.”

Leonardo DiCaprio was ""starstruck"" by Luke Perry.

The Oscar-winning actor had admired the 'Beverly Hills 90210' actor - who died at the age of 52 in in March 2019 of complications from a stroke - from a young age and recalled the ""excitement"" of him being part of the cast of Quentin Tarantino's 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'.

Appearing alongside the director and co-star Margot Robbie, Leonardo said in new documentary 'I Am Luke Perry': ""I was immediately struck by his kindness.

""Having been born and raised in Los Angeles, and worked in this industry my entire life, it has, in many ways, greatly shaped who I am.

""There was an immediate sense of excitement in seeing Luke Perry on set. It was incredible.

""I remember being in my teens, and he was the manifestation of the new [James] Dean on television, and everyone was crazy about him.

""I felt this overwhelming feeling of being starstruck.""

The 50-year-old actor quickly hit it off with Luke and remembered the 'Riverdale' star as being an ""incredible generous"" person.

He continued: ""But then he and I got to sit down and talk about Los Angeles, the '90s, his life, where his career had gone, where my career had gone, where his life [had gone], my life [had gone].

""I was so, struck, how do I say this, by the kindness of his character. [He was] just an incredibly generous human being.""

Luke died just four months before 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' premiered, and that summer, Leonardo praised his late co-star as the ""coolest dude on Earth"".

He told reporters at the premiere: ""I grew up with him on '90210', looking up to him as literally the coolest dude on Earth, and honestly, when I was on set, I was starstruck.

""We got to sit down and chat. He couldn’t have been a more amazing human being. It’s a real tragic loss.”

At the time of Luke's shock death, the 'Titanic' actor paid tribute to him on his social media accounts.

He wrote on X, which was then known as Twitter: “Luke Perry was a kindhearted and incredibly talented artist.

“It was an honor to be able to work with him. My thoughts and prayers go out to him and his loved ones.”

Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has been branded ""inauthentic"" by her estranged father.

The 43-year-old former actress' new Netflix lifestyle series, 'With Love, Meghan', premiered last week and while Thomas Markle - who has had no contact with his daughter since before she married Prince Harry in 2018 - hasn't seen the show in full, he hasn't been impressed by the clips he's seen so far.

He told the Mail on Sunday newspaper: ""I haven't seen the show but I've seen a ton of clips and I've read many stories. I might sit down and watch it one day but I'm not sure.

""Cooking show are horrendously boring unless the presenter has a passion for it.

""You have to be authentic to hold people's attention. When you are stuffing the turkey's a*** it has to look like you're having fun doing it.

""Unfortunately Meghan has never been authentic. She has to think about everything. She's not spontaneous. Everything she says is pre-planned and rehearsed. It makes me laugh because I know all her looks and expressions.

""I know when she's faking it for the cameras. She's trying so hard to be perfect that she tenses up every time the camera is on her.""

And the retired lighting director branded his daughter's attempts to be in the spotlight ""sad"".

He added: ""The best cooks are funny, they mess up, they are human. She just wants to be perfect. It's sad because she's trying so hard to stay in the limelight.""

Thomas accused Meghan - who has Prince Archie, five, and three-year-old Princess Lilibet with Harry - of being ""out of touch with the real world"".

He said: ""Meghan should make affordable food and show people how to stretch their food budget.

""I grew up in Pennsylvania and my mum was a great cook – lots of meat and potatoes and cabbage. Apple butter is a sandwich spread and very tasty and inexpensive.

""The women who watch Meghan's show are not all rich and privileged. I think people would love it if she focused on more economical dishes.

""I don't think most people these days can afford to go out and spend $90 on fruit. She's out of touch with normal people.

""She puts edible flowers on everything. No one has edible flowers handy. Sending kids off to school with edible flowers on their food is silly. Kids don't like them and if you put edible flowers in a kid's lunchbox they would probably get teased at school.""

In the show, the former 'Suits' star claimed she was a ""latchkey kid"" who grew up eating fast food and TV dinners, but Thomas insisted that wasn't the case.

He said: ""We occasionally ate TV dinners, which family doesn't? But I was working two jobs so money was never an issue. We would eat out at least three times a week and order in the rest of the time.

""Like any single father who did a long day's work, I'd occasionally put a TV dinner in the microwave. But most of the time we'd go out.

""After school I would either pick her up myself and we'd go out to eat or I'd send a car to bring her to the set. She grew up on the sets I worked on. She was never a latchkey kid.

""We lived in a great area, which was packed with restaurants. We ate out all the time. At weekends when I wasn't working I'd take her to a dance class and then invite her and all her friends out for a meal.""

Was “Moana” based on a boy named Bucky?

Lawyers for a New Mexico writer and animator will say at closing arguments at his federal trial in Los Angeles on Monday that his work was stolen to create the Walt Disney Co.'s 2016 hit about a questing Polynesian princess, whose sequel was among the biggest hits of last year.

Buck Woodall wrote a script, whose various titles have included “Bucky the Surfer Boy,"" about a teenager vacationing in Hawaii with his parents who befriends a group of Native Hawaiian youth and goes on a quest that involves time travel to the ancient islands and interactions with demigods to save a sacred part of the islands from a developer.

Woodall said he first gave the script to a distant relative by marriage who worked for another company on the Disney lot in about 2004, and a dozen years later was stunned when he saw so many of his ideas in “Moana.”

Here are some of the many similarities his lawsuit alleges:

Both “tell the story about a teenager who defies parental warnings and embarks on a dangerous voyage across Polynesian waters to save the endangered land of a Polynesian island.”

Both “involve a main character who encounters a demigod with a giant hook and tattoos.”

Both “involve protagonists who learn about ancient Polynesian culture during a sea voyage” and “a recurring theme of the Polynesian belief in spiritual ancestors” who “manifested as animals which guide and guard the living.”

Defense lawyers and witnesses — including the woman Woodall gave the script to — said no one at Disney saw his work, and that “Moana” was developed through the same cultural research and internal collaboration as its other films.

A judge ruled that Woodall filed the 2020 lawsuit too late to have a claim on the nearly $700 global box office of “Moana."" What remains are the film's DVD and Blu-ray sales — worth $31.4 million gross with a net profit of $10.4 million. The only remaining defendant is Disney subsidiary Buena Vista Home Entertainment.

“Moana” was co-directed, along with two others, by John Musker and Ron Clements, a duo that was essential to the 1990s Disney animation renaissance that made the company a global powerhouse.

At times with other collaborators, Musker and Clements co-wrote and co-directed 1989's “The Little Mermaid,” 1992's “Aladdin,” 1997's “Hercules” and 2009's “The Princess and the Frog.""

Musker testified that they had never plagiarized, and he was angered by the accusation.

The relatively young jury of six women and two men watched “Moana” in its entirety while sitting in the courtroom and were also shown scenes from “The Little Mermaid” and other Musker and Clements films.

Musker testified that Moana's relationship with her chief father was much like the mermaid Ariel's with her father, King Triton.

A defense expert said that the relationship between Moana and the shapeshifting demigod Maui, voiced by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, reflects Aladdin and his shapeshifting Genie, voiced by Robin Williams.

“So many of the extrinsic elements of ‘Moana’ have been in previous Musker and Clements films, indeed in Disney films going back a century,” the expert, Jeffrey Rovin testified at trial.

Woodall's attorneys must prove the works had substantial similarity and that the defendants had access to the copyrighted work.

Both judge and jury will decide on substantial similarity, with the judge using the so-called “extrinsic test"" of comparing individual elements and the jury using the “intrinsic test” of the “total concept and feel” of the two works.

Woodall in January filed a second lawsuit over “Moana 2,” which was an even bigger hit that brought in more than $1 billion globally. But the judge declined to combine the lawsuits, and the newer one, seeking as much as $10 billion, will be dealt with separately.

""It's a weird thing to think like, 'Oh, no. I'm done having kids,' when you love having kids.

""It gets a little scarier when you start to watch them, [and] when you start to have to let them go because you want them to love themselves and then you want them to make good decisions out in the world. So, you get a little bit of that, 'Oh, man. I just hope they are good.'""

Actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease a full week after his wife died from hantavirus in their New Mexico hillside home, and he may not have been aware she was dead because he showed severe signs of Alzheimer’s disease, authorities revealed Friday.

Both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes, chief medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell said alongside state fire and health officials at a news conference.

“Mr. Hackman showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer’s disease,” Jarrell said. “He was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that’s what resulted in his death.”

Authorities ruled out foul play after the bodies of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were discovered Feb 26. Immediate tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.

Investigators found that the last known communication and activity from Arakawa was Feb. 11 when she visited a pharmacy, a pet store and a farm market, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday.

Hackman's pacemaker last showed signs of activity a week later and that he had an abnormal heart rhythm Feb. 18., the day he likely died, Jarrell said.

“It’s quite possible he was not aware she was deceased,” Jarrell said.

Their bodies were found a little over a week later. Hackman was found in the home’s entryway. His death was tied to heart disease with Alzheimer’s disease contributing.

Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Authorities linked her death to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Thyroid medication pills prescribed to Arakawa were found nearby and weren’t listed as contributing to her death, Jarrell said.

Hantavirus is typically is reported in spring and summer, often due to exposures that occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in New Mexico this year.

Jarrell said it was not known how quickly Arakawa died.

Investigators earlier retrieved personal items from the couple’s home, including a monthly planner and two cellphones.

One of the couple’s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed.

Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, said Erin Phipps, a veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department. A necropsy will be done on the dog. The sheriff considers this an open investigation until they finish checking into cellphone data and receive results of the dog’s necropsy.

When Hackman and Arakawa were found, the bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe’s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).

Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including “The French Connection,” “Hoosiers” and “Superman” from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.

Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.

The couple’s stucco, Pueblo-revival style home sits on a hill in a gated community at the southern tip of the Rocky Mountains. Santa Fe is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.

Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood’s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses.

Tom Cruise's latest film has halted production after a star was injured on set.

The 62-year-old actor plays a megalomaniac in the new movie - which currently has the working title of 'Judy' - and will appear alongside John Goodman, Jesse Plemons, and Riz Ahmed on screen but production was reportedly stopped after an unnamed star was hospitalised following an injury at Pinewood Studios .

A source told The Sun: ""The actor is renowned for loving spectacular stunts which obviously involve some element of danger and the risk of injury - though they always strive to keep any risk to an absolute minimum.""

The actor sustained injuries to his pelvis and leg and the insider claimed that because the individual is ""very famous"", it will cost the production company ""millions"" while he is away.

The source added: ""This incident won’t just be alarming in terms of having someone so famous suffer such a major injury, it will also prove costly on a project which has cost millions and is on a very tight schedule.""

Academy Award-winner Alejandro González Iñárritu is at the helm of the film - which is due to be released in October 2026 - and it will mark his first foray back into English language movies since 'The Revenant' in 2015.

The moviemaker co-wrote the script in 2023 with Nicolas Giacobone and Alexander Dinelaris - the team he worked with on 2014's 'Birdman' - as well as Sabina Berman.

Inarritu's 2014 film 'Birdman' won four Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director while its star Michael Keaton was nominated for the Best Actor gong.

His follow-up 'The Revenant' was also a huge success at the Oscars, winning Inarritu his second Best Director accolade as well as a Best Actor gong for DiCaprio and another prize for cinematography.

Lady Gaga fears feeling alone.

The 38-year-old pop star is one of the best-selling artists of all time, but Gaga has admitted that she felt isolated in the early years of her music career.

The 'Alejandro' hitmaker - who is engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky - told the BBC: ""I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own. And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.""

In recent years, Gaga has realised that she doesn't need to have a ""dividing line"" between her personal and professional lives.

The chart-topping singer - who released her debut album, 'The Fame', back in 2008 - explained: ""I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being.

""The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.

""I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.

""That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.""

Gaga considers her new album, 'Mayhem', to be another landmark moment in her career, with the singer believing that she's reclaimed ownership of her music.

She shared: ""When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.

""So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.""

George Lowe, the voice behind the irreverent animated superhero on Adult Swim's “Space Ghost Coast to Coast,” has died. He was 67.

He died Sunday in Lakeland, Florida, two of his business representatives said. Lowe had been struggling to recover from elective heart surgery in November, his family said in a statement. “Over the past few months, his family and friends have been by his side in support and care for him,” the statement said.

Lowe's booming voice and off-the-wall humor turned “Space Ghost Coast to Coast” into a cult classic among young adults and teens.

The show debuted in 1994 and aired for more than a decade on Cartoon Network as part of its Adult Swim nighttime programming block. It was Cartoon Network's first original production and set the foundation for several other original series including “The Powerpuff Girls,” “Courage the Cowardly Dog” and “Johnny Bravo.”

On “Space Ghost Coast to Coast,” Lowe played the role of cartoon superhero Space Ghost, who hosted a talk show and interviewed real celebrities. While the interviews with the likes of William Shatner, Conan O'Brien and Donny Osmond were pre-recorded, Lowe would later add wacky and rambling digressions, such as asking guests if they were getting enough oxygen.

“Insanity became en vogue, thanks to us,” Lowe told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2004.

Adult Swim President Michael Ouweleen said the show proved the network could find success with its own productions.

“You all knew him as Space Ghost (and all his other characters), but we knew him as himself, a true character in his own right, one that left an indelible mark on all of us at Adult Swim,” he said.

The show's producers would begin recording Lowe as soon as he stepped into the booth, Ouweleen said, creating some of the best material “when he didn’t realize he was being recorded.”

Lowe voiced several other characters on Adult Swim shows, including “Robot Chicken,” “Aqua Teen Hunger Force” and “The Brak Show.”

Until this past year, he continued to make regular appearances at comic book and sci-fi conventions.

Lowe, who was born in Dunedin, Florida, began his career as a disc jockey and television personality in Florida and Georgia. He continued to do voice work for radio stations after Adult Swim.

He was an avid folk and pop art collector and a self-taught artist whose intricate pen and ink drawings were displayed in several museums, including The High Museum of Art in Atlanta where his work is part of its permanent collection.

There were no details available on his survivors. His family said there will be a private service.

There's going to be more “With Love, Meghan,” the Duchess of Sussex's Netflix lifestyles series.

The streaming service announced Friday that a second season of the show, which debuted this week, has already been shot. Meghan has said the show, which includes her chatting with celebrity pals, is not about a quest for perfection but more about finding joy in the little things.

Netflix said the second season would air this fall.

“With Love, Meghan” was supposed to premiere in January, but the duchess delayed the release due to the devastating wildfires in and around Los Angeles.

Meghan announced last month that she was rebranding her fledging lifestyles company to As Ever, after initially calling it American Riviera.

The Duchess was born and raised in Los Angeles and now lives in Montecito, California, with Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and their two children.

A painting that has gone on public display Friday could be the only portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen, Lady Jane Grey, painted during her lifetime, according to the conservation group English Heritage.

It said there is “compelling” evidence to suggest that the portrait, on loan from a private collection, shows Jane, who was no older than 17 when she became queen for just nine days in the summer of 1553.

One of England's most tragic regal figures, she was executed at the Tower of London in 1554. Jane was a devout Protestant at a time of religious upheaval, the ultimate innocent victim of the chicanery of the Tudor court in the chaotic aftermath of Henry VIII’s reign.

She is perhaps best-known from Paul Delaroche’s painting, “The Execution of Lady Jane Grey,” which hangs in the National Gallery in central London. Jane, who may have been as young as 16, is shown blindfolded as an executioner with an axe waits to behead her.

But that painting, like the few others that purport to show Jane, all date from after her death.

Now, English Heritage says a Tudor-era work could be a “live” painting of Jane. The portrait, along with six others, will hang at Wrest Park, a country estate west of London managed by English Heritage, and which incidentally is the location of many scenes of Netflix's steamy period drama ""Bridgerton.""

The charity worked with the Courtauld Institute of Art and scientist Ian Tyers, who specializes in dendrochronology, or the dating of tree rings. It said there is enough evidence to raise the question: ""Could this mysterious portrait be Lady Jane Grey?""

Among the evidence presented, English Heritage said the tree-dating points to the wooden panel having been constructed between 1539 and around 1571 — Jane is believed to have been born in 1536 or 1537 and was executed in early 1554. It also said the back of the panel displays a merchant or cargo mark, identical to one used on a royal portrait of King Edward VI, who, in an ultimately tragic turn, anointed his first cousin once removed as his successor.

It also noted a “striking change"" in the eyes of the sitter to the left rather than the right and that at some point, the eyes, mouth and ears were deliberately scratched out. In addition, it said the sitter was likely wearing a more elaborate costume.

Rachel Turnbull, English Heritage’s Senior Collections Conservator, said the evidence points to the possibility that “we are looking at the shadows of a once more royal portrait of Lady Jane Grey, toned down into subdued, Protestant martyrdom after her death.”

Jane was bright, reportedly spoke multiple languages and a big fan of Plato. But it was her commitment to Protestantism that interested Edward VI.

Edward VI, the only surviving son of Henry VIII, was the first monarch to be raised a Protestant after his father split from Rome in order to divorce his first wife Catherine of Aragon. His mother was Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour, who Lady Jane was named after.

On being informed in 1553 that he was terminally ill, the 15-year-old Edward wanted to bypass his older sisters Mary and Elizabeth, and named Lady Jane his heir to prevent the realm reverting to Catholicism.

On July 10, Jane became queen but was deposed nine days later after her support melted away in the wake of an uprising by Mary's supporters. Jane was subsequently convicted of treason and sentenced to death.

Ben Affleck struggled with the action sequences in The Accountant 2.

The 52-year-old actor has reprised his role as Christian Wolff in the sequel to the 2016 blockbuster which will see him team up with his estranged but highly lethal brother (Jon Bernthal) to track down mysterious assassins but admitted that the shooting the stunt scenes ""did not come easy"" to him.

He told AccessHollywood: ""It did not come easy for me, especially with a guy like Jon [Bernthal] who's so spectacular at it. Cynthia [Addai-Robinson] did an incredible job, Daniella [Pineda] is super bada** in the movie, so I was just trying to keep up.

""Gavin [O'Connor, director] does a great thing with action sequences — which is really, they're not just action for its own sake.

""I don't think it's interesting just to see people shooting or a car flipping over or something blowing up just by itself.""

The Academy Award-winning star feels as if ""anybody could go to enjoy"" the film and is ""very proud"" of how it has turned out.

He said: ""This is a movie where you really care about the people that are involved, and it's got an intelligence and a bit of humour and pathos to it. It's just a whole complete package. I really feel like this is a movie that anybody could go to enjoy.

""I'm really proud of it. It's a really interesting set of characters. There are great performances in it, and I feel very confident saying, go see this movie. You won't be disappointed. See it in theatres — I really think you'll love it.""

Director Gavin O'Connor recently revealed how the movie almost didn't happen because of ""musical chairs"" behind the scenes.

He told ScreenRant: ""I think there was a bit of a revolving door and musical chairs going on at Warner Brothers. We made the deal to write the next movie in 2018, and it was just, I don't know, whatever dysfunction goes on in studios these days.

""I don't know if there were complications with Warner Brothers and Artists Equity doing a co-studio kind of deal-I'm not really sure exactly what happened with all that-but we just could never get it going over there.

""Once Ben had his studio, we were like, 'If you're not going to make it, don't hijack it and not allow us to go pursue this film we've been trying to make now for eight years'.""

The Accountant 2 is in cinemas from April 25.

Vicky Kaushal's film Chhaava is running in theatres and has earned a lot since its release. However, on Sunday, the film did not perform as expected from the film on the weekend. Seems like the film was affected by the final match of the Champions Trophy, which is being played today between India and New Zealand. The match started at 2:30 and ended at around 10:20, with India lifting the ICC trophy. The film based on Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was seemingly affected by the cricket match with evening and afternoon shows. 


Chhaava box office collection

The earnings of films running in theatres usually increase on weekends. It is obvious that on Saturday and Sunday holidays, people go to theatres with their families. On top of that, when it comes to 'Chhaava', the expectations are higher because this film is performing so well on weekdays. But this Sunday, the film earned less than expected. 

Business was this low compared to Saturday

The film Chhaava, starring stars like Vicky Kaushal, Rashmika Mandanna and Akshaye Khanna, collected Rs 16.75 crore yesterday on the 23rd day, Saturday. On Sunday, the 24th day, the film collected only Rs 8.38 crore. The total net collection of the film Chhaava at the domestic box office has now become Rs 517.43 crore and the film has achieved the title of a blockbuster. 

Chhaava budget and crew

Vicky Kaushal's film was reportedly made with a budget of Rs 130–140 crore. It has already entered the 500 crore club and with no big release till Salman Khan's Sikandar release (March 28), the period drama is expected to rule the box office. 

For the unversed, Chhaava is produced by Dinesh Vijan's Maddock Films and is directed by Lakshman Utekar. This was Vicky Kaushal's second film with the director after 2023's Zara Hatke Zara Bachke. Apart from the lead actors, supporting cast like Vineet Kumar Singh and Ashutosh Rana have also played important roles in the Bollywood film.

Blackpink star Jennie feels inspired by Rihanna.

The 29-year-old singer — who is best known for starring in the chart-topping girl group — has admitted to feeling nervous around Rihanna.

Asked if she's ever felt starstruck, Jennie said on Chicken Shop Date: ""For me, it was Rihanna.

""I... Yeah, I… yeah. See me mumbling? I can't even talk about her.""

Jennie — who made her acting debut in the HBO series The Idol — also joked that she doesn't give out compliments easily.

Asked what's the best compliment she can give, Jennie quipped: ""That I like them. I don't like anyone, so...""

Jennie has already enjoyed huge success as a member of Blackpink, and she previously admitted that she suffered from burnout after working ""non-stop"" for three years.

The group are now one of the best-known bands in the world, but Jennie admitted that they worked relentlessly in order to achieve their ambitions in the music business.

She told Rolling Stone magazine: ""For three years after debuting, we worked non-stop without resting.

""Our sleep systems were breaking down; we weren't eating properly; I wasn't hydrating myself — we did that for three to four years, and then started our tour. We were on tour for a year and a half. For a year and a half I didn't have a home.""

The group's relentless schedule ultimately took a toll on Jennie's health and wellbeing.

The singer also confessed to being a ""very delicate person"".

She said: ""If I touched something I'd have an allergic reaction. I had no immune system at all, but we needed to keep touring.

""When the tour was done, we got some time off to be at home. Back then, I didn't have time to learn how to take care of myself. I'm a very delicate person.""

Love was in the air at the BNP Paribas Open on Sunday, and we're not just talking about the score.

Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner were spotted in the audience of the tennis tournament in Indian Wells, California.

Photos and videos showed the Oscar-nominated ""Dune"" actor, 29, and the ""Kardashians"" star, 27, kissing and holding hands while watching the game. Jenner's sister, Kendall Jenner, was also in attendance.

Kylie Jenner wore a red crop top and sunglasses, while Chalamet sported an Adidas jacket with a white and blue collared shirt underneath. The two were previously spotted together at the US Open in 2023, which helped fuel relationship rumors.

It was the latest public outing for the couple, who attended the Academy Awards together earlier this month. Jenner skipped the red carpet but could be seen in the audience seated next to the actor, who was nominated for his portrayal of Bob Dylan in ""A Complete Unknown,"" and sharing kisses with him.

The Oscars broadcast also showed Jenner laughing along during an opening bit where Adam Sandler approached Chalamet and said his name in a comedic voice, a callback to the Golden Globe Awards.

Chalamet and Jenner, who sparked dating rumors in 2023, previously attended the Golden Globes together in January, again sitting together. The Kylie Cosmetics founder was seen applauding after host Nikki Glaser said the actor was ""so good"" in ""A Complete Unknown."" She also smiled and laughed when Glaser joked that Tilda Swinton was nominated ""for her role as Timothée Chalamet"" and told the actor he has the ""most gorgeous eyelashes on your upper lip.""

Jenner did not, however, attend February's Screen Actors Guild Awards, where Chalamet won best actor. That ceremony took place shortly after the death of Jenner's friend and hairstylist, Jesus Guerrero.

Chalamet generally avoids discussing his relationship with Jenner in interviews and on red carpets. During his SAG speech, he thanked his mother and shared his ambition to ""be one of the greats,"" saying the best actor award offered him ""a little more ammo to keep going.""

Welcome back to the Monday Tennis Briefing, where The Athletic will explain the stories behind the stories from the past week on court.

This week, the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, Calif. took center stage. Joao Fonseca’s amazing pull ended in disappointment for his fans, the Orange County kids did their region proud and the men’s seeds tumbled while the women’s held strong.

If you’d like to follow our fantastic tennis coverage, click here.

It has been a tournament of upsets so far on the men’s side at Indian Wells, with Novak Djokovic, Alexander Zverev and Casper Ruud all losing their first matches. On the women’s side, it’s been much calmer.

Thirteen of the top 16 WTA seeds remain as the tournament heads for the fourth round, and where the ATP No. 1 seed, Zverev, made an early exit against Tallon Griekspoor, his women’s counterpart Aryna Sabalenka was a straight-sets winner against American McCartney Kessler on Saturday. The No. 2 seed and defending champion, Iga Swiatek, has dropped just four games in her two matches so far.

The women play best-of-three sets at every event, but for the men perhaps some of the variance in a tournament that has seen 15 of the 32 seeds exit in either their first or second matches comes with the shorter format compared to the Grand Slams. Zverev had come close to defeat against Griekspoor in several of their previous meetings, most recently outlasting him across five sets at least year’s French Open. Djokovic, who said the high bounce on the main court at Indian Wells caught him off guard, would have felt more confident surviving a marathon as opposed to a shootout against Botic van de Zandschulp.

Is a format more conducive to upsets better or worse? It depends on perspective, but it makes sense that the Grand Slams would rather keep the longer format and increase their chances of keeping the big names in.

GO DEEPER

One serve? New scoring? How changing tennis might actually go down

Charlie Eccleshare

A recurring debate during tennis’ various officiating controversies in the last year has been the extent to which the sport should expect players to fess up to things that umpires miss.

At January’s Australian Open for instance, some felt that Swiatek should have admitted to not reaching an Emma Navarro drop shot before the ball bounced twice. Others felt she couldn’t have known for sure, and it’s not her responsibility to officiate the match.

On Sunday night, albeit in a different incident where there was less uncertainty, Japanese qualifier Yosuke Watanuki offered the kind of sportsmanship against Frances Tiafoe that many fans have said they would like to see.

Tiafoe was serving at deuce, down 2-3, when he was given a time violation for taking too long before serving. Watanuki walked towards umpire Mohamed Lahyani and told him that he hadn’t been ready to receive. Lahyani accepted this and canceled the time violation, two of which lead to the server being docked their first serve. That’s what happened to Tiafoe at a crucial moment of a match against Roman Safiullin in Shanghai last year, when he swore repeatedly at umpire Jeremy Pinoargote and was fined $120,000 (£92,800) as a result.

Respect 🤝@FTiafoe received a time violation, but it was cancelled after Watanuki told the referee he wasn't ready to return Tiafoe's serve.#TennisParadise pic.twitter.com/CT3kAdFktF

Watanuki went on to win an action-packed match 6-4, 7-6(6) despite Tiafoe twice serving for the second set. One of those breaks for Watanuki came immediately after he had asked for a Pepsi when struggling for energy down 5-4. The win means that Watanuki, ranked No. 349 after missing most of last year with injury, is the lowest-ranked player in the Indian Wells last 16 since 2004. He is coached by Tiafoe’s former coach, one-time world No. 6 Wayne Ferreira.

For Tiafoe, the defeat extends his difficult start to 2025, a year in which he is yet to win more than one match at a single event. His most memorable contribution to this year’s Indian Wells came at the start of the Watanuki match when, after forgetting his rackets for his previous match against Damir Dzumhur, Tiafoe pretended he had done so again, and successfully fooled an initially stunned Lahyani, who then collapsed into laughter.

Tournament organizers are going to have to adjust to the Joao Fonseca phenomenon, maybe by paying a little less attention to his ranking.

Fonseca, the 18-year-old rising star from Brazil, is the world No. 80, but he’s also one of the biggest attractions in the sport. That could get a little awkward, since the world’s 80th-best player generally doesn’t get the most prestigious court assignments, and won’t directly qualify for about half the tournaments on the tour. But if he’s the player that thousands of fans buy tickets to see, one argument goes, then there needs to be room for them to see him.

Witness Fonseca’s second-round match against Jack Draper Saturday. Organizers put the match on Stadium 4, which seats 3,500. Lines to get in stretched into the main plaza of the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. They didn’t move, but practically no one left. Fans watched from the high bleachers of surrounding courts. They clawed the fences in the corners of the court trying to get a glimpse.

“I have to get used to this,” Fonseca said of the fanfare.

He had played his first match against Jacob Fearnley on the main stadium court, but no seeds were playing that day. That was an easy call. Fonseca’s next tournament, the Miami Open, might present some even more difficult ones, because Florida has a big Brazilian population. Itau, a Brazilian finance company is the main sponsor of the tournament.

Should Fonseca get big stadium assignments? At the moment, he is more famous than his ranking or accomplishments might suggest. If he’s the player people want to see, then he probably should. Making fans wait on lines that don’t move and leave disappointed does no one any good.

GO DEEPER

Tennis stardom is a roulette wheel. Joao Fonseca is ready to bet on himself

Matt Futterman

There were high hopes for California boys coming into the tournament, especially the newcomers. Ethan Quinn, Jenson Brooksby, Learner Tien, Tristan Boyer and Alex Michelsen all grew up within driving distance from Indian Wells and came here as children.

Taylor Fritz is still alive, of course. That’s expected: he’s the world No. 4. The others are out. But Marcos Giron, another California player from Thousand Oaks who went to UCLA is still in, achieving his best run at Indian Wells at 31 years old.

Giron notched his first top-five win over Casper Ruud on Friday and beat No. 26 seed, Alexei Popyrin, on Sunday to get into the round of 16.

“This place holds a lot of memories and a lot of emotion,” he said.

It was the first tournament he attended and had his first ATP breakthrough here in 2019, winning two matches.

“The last couple years I came here maybe with expectations, maybe yes, maybe no, some pressure, and I didn’t play well,” he said. “Of course there’s a lot of family, there’s a lot of friends, trying to organize tickets and all that, give everybody the time they deserve.

“This is not something I can do forever. So I know each moment, I’ve got to make the most of it.”

Michelsen had perhaps the worst luck of his California gang. Things looked troubling early for his opponent, two-time beaten finalist Daniil Medvedev. The Russian called for a medical timeout after just one game in his second match of the tournament. Michelsen, a hometown favorite from nearby Orange County, was going to have the crowd on his side. Medvedev has had trouble putting away players who meet him with energy and without fear.

After his time out, Medvedev headed back to the court. They played another game. He had a 2-0 lead. Then they were shaking hands at the net. A retirement. Surely Medvedev was done, he’d had the medic on.

But it was Michelsen grabbing his bag and walking off the court. He’d taken the court unwell with a stomach issue, having considered not playing at all. A duel against a human backboard like Medvedev in the desert sun was much too much for him to manage.

Weird things can happen in tennis matches. That was about as weird as it gets.

The kingdom’s move to fund a year’s paid maternity leave for pregnant professional tennis players had led to accusations of sports washing.

Saudi Arabia’s move to fund a year’s paid maternity leave for pregnant professional tennis players led to accusations of sports washing. The program is the first in women’s sports, the Women’s Tennis Association said. 

Riyadh has funneled billions into the world’s biggest sports leagues to diversify its economy away from oil, though critics say the true aim is to launder its reputation: The kingdom ranks 126th out of 146 nations for gender inequality, according to a widely used index. 

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has dismissed such allegations, saying in a 2023 interview: “If sports washing [is] going to increase my GDP by way of one percent, then I will continue doing sport washing.”

Kylie Jenner couldn’t keep her hands off Timothée Chalamet while taking in some tennis over the weekend.

Per photos obtained by Page Six, the couple put their romance on full display at the BNP Paribas Indian Wells Open in Indian Wells, Calif., on Sunday.

Throughout the match, Jenner made sure to pack on the PDA with the “Complete Unknown” star while posing for photos in the stands.

At one point, the 27-year-old “Kardashians” star sat with her hands in Chalamet’s lap before a friend pulled out their phone to take a few loved-up snaps.

Jenner was all smiles as she cradled Chalamet’s face and pulled him in for a kiss. However, the actor never took his eyes off the match.

The two seemed to be having a great time as they sipped on cocktails and laughed with their pals, including the makeup mogul’s sister Kendall Jenner.

Later on in the set, the Khy founder reached over to rub Chalamet’s chest as she tucked a hand in his shirt. 

The Oscar nominee seemed engrossed in the action, shouting and standing up as they watched French player Ugo Humbert take on Holger Rune from Denmark. 

Despite the 75-degree day, Chalamet wore leather pants and a white track jacket, which he took off to reveal a striped button-down.

Kylie, for her part, wore a low-cut cropped blouse and tan trousers. She added a pair of black sunglasses and opted for a black Chanel purse. 

While the reality TV star shared a few snaps from the day on her Instagram Stories, she did not include any pictures of Chalamet. 

Up until recently, the couple has kept their two-year relationship private.

While the two rarely talk about their romance, they have seemingly become more comfortable attending public events together.

Kylie has accompanied Chalamet throughout this season’s awards circuit — attending the Golden Globes, Academy Awards, the BAFTAs and other promotional events. 

Although the two have yet to make their red carpet debut, they were often photographed getting cozy inside the star-studded venues.

An insider previously told Page Six that Kylie “feels like Timothée is so different from all her other exes” and believes he may be “the one.”

“[She] has never felt like this about anybody else before and definitely sees a future with him,” the source told us in January.

Kylie Jenner and Timothee Chalamet‘s new video from a tennis match in Indian Wells, California, is as cute as it gets. In the clip, the two celebrities could be seen enjoying the tennis match together with bright smiles on their faces. They appeared to be in great spirits while taking sips out of their drinks. Moreover, fans can see them rocking comfy and stylish fits at the match.

Kylie Jenner and Timothee Chalamet were recently spotted watching a tennis match in Indian Wells, California. A video of them enjoying their time at the match caught the eyes of the fans. The clip showed Kylie Jenner donning a shirt-style cropped top in bright red that she left unbuttoned. It featured a plunging neckline, and the shirt was tied in a front knot.

Jenner styled her effortlessly chic look by rocking a pair of classic black sunglasses. As for jewelry, she wore a pair of sparkly and dainty earrings. “The Kardashians” star also showed off her gorgeous dark cherry red manicure in the video. Minimalistic nude makeup and open dark hair finished off the beauty mogul’s look.

In the meantime, Timothee Chalamet wore a plain white T-shirt. The “A Complete Unknown” star elevated his look by wearing a striped shirt in navy blue and white. He also added a dainty gold neckpiece and a bracelet to complete the tennis match look.

Kylie Jenner and Timothee Chalamet were also joined by her sister, Kendall, at the match. She was seen flaunting a chic look. It included a simple black top, which the model paired wit crisp white loose-fit pants. Kendall Jenner accessorized her look by adding a black belt, a hat, and a pair of sunglasses.

She silenced online theories about a 'Kardashians curse' by sharing a passionate kiss with Timothée Chalamet during a date at the tennis on Sunday.

And Kylie Jenner was clearly in a confident mood after her busy day out, taking to Instagram to post a racy mirror selfie just hours after the smooch.

The cosmetics mogul, 27, put on a busty display in a cropped red shirt, unbuttoned and tied at the midriff, pairing the item with some white trousers.

She held a navy Miu Miu buttoned sweater in one hand and toted a vintage black corduroy Chanel shoulder bag worth more than £1,200, which she showed off in detail in a separate social media update. 

Kylie's vibrant top had short sleeves and was decorated with vertical white dotted lines. 

Earlier, she had completed her look with a pair of slim black sunglasses covering her impeccably made-up face, and she styled her raven tresses in thick waves cascading down her shoulders. 

Kylie joined boyfriend Timothée, 29, at the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in Indian Wells, California, earlier in the day.

She kept her cool as the Complete Unknown star shouted with excitement while they watched Holger Rune of Denmark taken on France's Ugo Humbert, with 12th-ranked Holger emerging victorious over the 18th-ranked player. 

Following Timothée's Oscars loss last week to The Brutalist star Adrien Brody, fans have claimed that her boyfriend missed out on his second chance at the prestigious award due to her surprise appearance at the ceremony.

Kylie shushed those conspiracists with plenty of PDA during the match one week on from her beau's Academy Awards snub.

In one sweet but humorous exchange caught on video, she held Timothée's face and pulled him towards her for several loving kisses, even as he tried to keep his eyes turned toward the court.

Her sister Kendall Jenner was also seen taking a seat in the row in front of the loved-up couple.

The model looked sleek and casual in a black crop top with casual white pants and a midnight blue baseball cap.

Timothée, meanwhile, was dressed casually in a preppy white shirt with vertical navy stripes, which he wore open to reveal his white undershirt.

He added a cool touch with a pair of black leather pants, after he previously caused a sensation at the Oscars by wearing a pale yellow leather suit.

Later in the day, he changed into a white Adidas windbreaker sporting the logo of French side Saint Etienne, who Timothée is believed to be a big fan of, as it appeared to get chillier.

In one cute but silly exchange caught on video, Timothée sat back with his shirt open as Kylie rubbed her hand over his stomach as if he was a baby with a tummy ache.

The couple have lately been beset by parasocial fans on social media who have revived talk of the so-called 'Kardashians curse'.

According to the invented supernatural force, any man who dates one of the Kardashian–Jenner sisters will have some kind of fall from grace during the relationship.

Kim and Khloe Kardashian previously slammed the theory as 'super sexist'.

Although Timothée did end up losing to Adrien Brody in the Best Actor category at last week's Oscars, he was not deemed the frontrunner in the category. 

The steamy trip to the tennis comes after the Dune actor watched his beloved New York Knicks play in Los Angeles on Thursday, while Kylie was mourning the death of her hairstylist Jesus Guerrero.

Timothée was spotted courtside at the Crypto.com Arena for the Knicks versus Los Angeles Lakers game, hanging out with another famous Knicks fan: Spike Lee.

The star sported a white t-shirt under a zip-up white jacket with blue jogging pants for the game in downtown LA.

His fellow Knicks fan Spike donned a blue-and-orange Knicks hat, orange glasses, an orange necklace with a grey Knicks sweatshirt and white pants.

The pair were seen engaging in conversation and shaking hands courtside, and it turned out they picked a thrilling game to attend.

The fixture ended up going to overtime, with the Lakers pulling out a dramatic 113-109 win at the death.

Indoors or outdoors, the Blue Devils delivered. 

After transitioning from indoor courts at snowy Notre Dame to a cold outdoor setting at Louisville, it was the 11th-ranked Blue Devils that iced out both ACC foes, 4-1 and 4-2, respectively.

“I think overall, it's a very tricky ACC road weekend,” Duke head coach Smith said. “We're playing at Notre Dame, which is indoors and very fast … Then we drove five hours and we played outdoors in cold conditions on very slow courts today. So I thought our guys did a tremendous job adapting.” 

The Blue Devils (11-3, 4-0 in the ACC) started the road trip to No. 52 Notre Dame, featuring a new doubles and singles lineup due to junior Pedro Rodenas’ injury. Duke’s nearly season-long doubles partnership of sophomore Cooper Williams and graduate Andreja Petrovic delivered with a quick 6-2 victory, and new duo Theo Winegar and Connor Krug delivered the clinching doubles point victory 7-6 (7-4). 

“I think our biggest strength as a team is depth, and we have so many good players,” Smith said. “We were down some players this weekend, and so we had to juggle a little bit, but we also wanted to try some new things in doubles.”

Not only did Petrovic impress on the doubles court, but also the singles, delivering a spirited effort after being moved up to court two in place of Rodenas. Taking care of Fighting Irish opponent Yu Zhang, Petrovic moved the Blue Devils to a 2-0 lead with a quick 6-2, 6-1 domination. 

“I think it was Andreja's most complete match,” Smith said. “He lost a couple matches, and hasn’t played quite as sharp recently. He just had a really good week and a half of training.”

Following Petrovic’s victory, graduate Remy Dugardin also made quick work of Notre Dame’s Jameson Corsillo 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 to stretch Duke’s lead to 3-0. Then, Williams fell on court one 4-6, 5-7, and all eyes turned to senior Jake Krug on court six.

Krug, last seeing singles match action Feb. 2 against Coastal Carolina, delivered for Duke, clinching the victory for the Blue Devils after a 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) match triumph. 

To Smith, the result was a testament of Duke’s depth. 

“Jake stepped in, [he] hasn’t played many matches at all for us, and he clinches for us,” Smith said. “Just a week ago, he wasn’t even one of the 12 guys warming up for the Virginia match.”

“I just think the biggest takeaway from this weekend was flexibility, being able to get both double points and our depth and the next guys stepping up and being ready to go,” Smith said.

Moving to Sunday, Smith was forced to make a lineup change as an injury in doubles forced Williams to not play his singles match. As a result, freshman Saahith Jayaraman stepped into singles play on court six, and he delivered. The El Dorado Hills, Calif., native captured Duke’s clinching singles point via a 6-4, 7-5 takedown of Piet Steveker. 

The match was just Jayaraman’s fifth of the season, and it brings his win total to three with two undecided finishes. 

“Historically, it's been very challenging to not play early on and then get thrown in at big moments,” Smith said. “[Jayaraman] was just ready when his name was called. It's weird, he didn't seem to have many nerves.” 

Other than Jayaraman, Dugardin and sophomore Alexander Visser contributed points on courts four and five, respectively, to move Duke to an undefeated 4-0 in ACC play. 

This weekend’s victories were extra special for Smith, bringing his win total as Duke head coach to 300 and 301 over his 17 seasons as the program’s lead. Currently, Smith sits as the second-winningest head coach in Duke men’s tennis history, trailing current assistant coach Jay Lapidus with 371 victories.  

“It’s a nice recognition,” Smith said. “It really is all about the players. I’m really proud of all the great players that we have had, how much they’ve invested in the program. The wins are really, really hard.”

“I'm doing what I love to do, and I'm doing it where I love to be,” Smith added.

The Blue Devils continue on the road for their next two matches, setting up faceoffs with No. 42 Georgia Tech Friday and No. 23 Clemson Sunday.

Virginia has dropped three of its first four conference matchups.

Facing the top team in both the ACC and the nation, No. 1 Wake Forest, Virginia struggled to gain momentum in a 4-1 loss, dropping to 1-3 in conference play. The Cavaliers (9-5, 1-3 ACC) continued to play its new doubles pairings — freshman Rafael Jodar with graduate student James Hopper and junior Ty Switzer with freshman Jangjun Kim — in an effort to shake things up. But despite a strong effort, the Cavaliers could not overcome the Demon Deacons’ (21-0, 4-0 ACC) depth in singles, with Jodar securing Virginia’s only point. 

Virginia’s new doubles pairing of Jodar and Hopper found itself locked in a grueling battle on Court 2, ultimately falling short in a tiebreak as Wake Forest secured the doubles point.

From the beginning, the Demon Deacons applied pressure with Court 2’s lefty serve causing troubles for the Cavaliers. Struggling to find their rhythm, Jodar and Hopper quickly fell behind 1-4 as their attempts to rush the net and end points quickly proved unsuccessful. They had a chance to shift the momentum at 2-4, pushing a return game to deuce at 3-4, but Wake Forest held strong to maintain its advantage.

On the other courts, though, the Cavaliers were battling. On Court 1, sophomore Dylan Dietrich and junior Mans Dahlberg dropped their set 3-6, while Switzer and Kim on Court 3 managed to recover from a late break at 5-2 to close out a 6-3 win. 

With the doubles point on the line, Jodar and Hopper remained resilient. Down 3-4 and facing a deuce point, Jodar delivered a crucial serve to hold, leveling the score at 4-4. Wake Forest responded with a routine hold, setting up a tense finish. At 5-6, 30-40, Jodar and Hopper faced a do-or-die moment on Jodar’s second serve. Under pressure, they came in clutch, forcing deuce before Jodar delivered a big serve and Hopper put away three overheads to send the match to a deciding seven-point tiebreak.

Wake Forest jumped out to an early lead, winning the first three points, then extending its advantage to 4-1. Jodar and Hopper fought back, with Jodar crushing a massive inside-in forehand return to tie it 4-4. The Cavaliers then won two straight points to take a 6-4 lead, inching closer to the doubles point. However, Hopper lost a serve-and-volley exchange at 6-5, allowing Wake Forest back into the tiebreak. 

The Demon Deacons took advantage of this, taking a 7-6 lead before Jodar responded with two huge serves to put the Cavaliers ahead 8-7. A missed return at 8-8 gave Wake Forest another opportunity, and on the final point, Hopper’s short pickup shot at the net led to a firing of forehands from Wake Forest to finish the match. With the win, Wake Forest secured the doubles point, giving it the early edge in the matchup. 

Moving onto the singles courts, Virginia struggled to gain traction, with Jodar the lone standout in an otherwise difficult match. Even after a close doubles match where every point mattered, Jodar delivered an impressive straight-sets victory over the No. 5 singles player in the country, Suresh Ekambaram, controlling the match from start to finish with a 6-2, 6-4 win. His aggressive baseline play and consistency under pressure helped him secure the Cavaliers’ only singles victory of the day, providing a much-needed point in this very challenging matchup. 

Outside of Jodar’s win, the rest of the Cavaliers found little success. On Court 2, No. 22 Dietrich started strong, taking the first set 6-3, but his match remained unfinished after he lost the second set 3-6. Hopper also pushed his opponent to the limit, winning a tight first set in a tiebreak before his match was halted at 7-6 (7-5), 2-2. 

Virginia struggled in the lower lineup as well. Kim and freshman Stiles Brockett were quickly overpowered, with Kim falling 6-1, 6-0 on Court 4 and Brockett suffering a 6-1, 6-2 defeat on Court 6. On Court 5, Dahlberg found his footing late in the second set but ultimately fell 6-0, 7-5, while Wake Forest secured dominant victories to seal the match. 

Despite this tough loss, Virginia will look to regroup as it continues through ACC play. The Cavaliers showed flashes of promise and the competitiveness of their new doubles pairings. However, against a dominant Wake Forest team, the depth and consistency across the lineup proved to be a deciding factor. Moving forward, Virginia will need to find ways to close out tight matches as it prepares for the matches ahead. 

Virginia will hope to bounce back and secure a much-needed ACC win Friday when it faces Boston College at 3 p.m.


                        Virginia rallied to climb up the leaderboard of 14 teams.

The Carbon boys’ tennis team made their way to Monroe for a match against the South Sevier Rams for their first match of the season. The Dinos had some good matches, but were unsuccessful at bringing home a match win. 

In Singles 2, Memphis Howell and his opponent would go the distance. Howell lost in the first set (6-3), followed by getting the win in the second set (4-6). Going down to set three, where Howell would fall after a tough battle (6-2). 

In Singles 3, Zander Carillo fell in the first set (3-6), but would comeback in the second set, getting the win to tie things up (7-5), bringing on the third and final set. The match would end with a very close score of 6-6 (7-5).

South Sevier would get the sweep, winning 5-0 in the match. Next up for Carbon will be on Mar. 12, as the Dinos will travel to Manti for a match against the Templars. Followed by the Carbon Invitational, which will be held on the court in Price on Mar. 14-15. The two-day tournament will host many teams for their first tennis tournament of the season.

Sara Ziodato coils for a forehand.

The No. 2 Virginia women’s tennis team suffered its first loss in ACC play this season, falling 4-2 to No. 12 NC State on the road Sunday in Raleigh, N.C. The Cavaliers (12-3, 4-1 ACC) secured the doubles point but were unable to hold off the Wolfpack (9-3, 4-0 ACC) in singles, breaking a seven-match ACC regular-season win streak dating back to last season.

Virginia started the match strong in doubles, with junior Annabelle Xu and freshman Martina Genis Salas delivering a commanding 6-2 victory on Court 2 after NC State took a 6-1 win on the top court. 

Graduate student Sara Ziodato and freshman Isabelle Lacy, playing together for the first time, clinched the doubles point for the Cavaliers with a 6-4 win on Court 3, giving Virginia the early 1-0 lead. Despite missing senior Melodie Collard, the Cavaliers played strong doubles.

However, NC State quickly responded in singles. The Wolfpack tied the match with a dominant straight-set win on Court 5 before adding victories on Courts 1 and 4 to take a 3-1 advantage. 

Xu kept the Cavaliers in the fight, bouncing back from a second-set loss to defeat No. 106 Maddy Zampardo 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 on Court 3. She regained her footing in the second set with deeper balls and more aggression.

Virginia had chances to force a decisive final match. Chervinsky was locked in a tight third-set tiebreak on Court 2, but NC State ultimately clinched the win on Court 6 with a hard-fought 7-5, 4-6, 6-2 victory.

The Cavaliers were without Collard, likely due to injury. This key absence high in the lineup certainly impacted the team’s depth in singles play, as well as its doubles combinations. Despite the loss, Virginia remains in a strong position in the ACC and will have time to regroup. The Cavaliers are off next week before returning home to host California March 21 and Stanford March 23.


                        The Cavaliers' conference-play struggles continued.

No. 2 Georgia women’s tennis swept Florida on Sunday, March 2, marking the Bulldogs’ 10th win against the Gators in the last 10 matches.

Doubles play began strong for the Bulldogs, with No. 25 Dasha Vidmanova and Mell Reasco quickly defeating Alicia Dudeney and Bente Spee 6-1 on court one. Florida defaulted its doubles match due to injury on court three, giving Georgia the doubles point after Vidmanova and Reasco’s win.

At the time of Vidmanova and Reasco’s win, No. 65 Guillermina Grant and Anastasiia Lopata were up 5-1 against Nikola Daubnerova and Talia Neilson-Gatenby on court two.

Florida additionally defaulted its singles match on court six, quickly putting Georgia up 2-0. Reasco secured her match on court three against Neilson-Gatenby 6-3, 6-0, making the score 3-0.

No. 66 Grant closed out the match with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Noemie Oliveras on court five. At the time of Grant’s win, No. 1 Vidmanova had won her first set against Dudeney 6-4 and was up 3-2 in the second set.

Following the match, Georgia headed back on the road for the start of four away matches. The Bulldogs faced Kentucky that Friday and swept the Wildcats 4-0.

The Georgia women's basketball team saw its 2025 SEC Tournament run come to an end on Thursday with a 70-52 loss to No. 10 Oklahoma in the second round.

For the first time since 2017, Georgia gymnastics is 4-0 at home after its 197.200-197.150 win over No. 10 Kentucky on March 2 at Stegeman Coliseum.

The Georgia women’s basketball team fought back from an 11-point deficit to defeat Arkansas, 79-74 in a thrilling SEC Tournament first-round matchup at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina.

Every week, countless stories and news emerge in the tennis world that don’t always make headlines but are too intriguing to overlook. These can be on-court or off-court developments that go under the radar due to bigger storylines from the past week. There were many interesting stories and news this week, and we have covered them all in this edition.

World No.31, Linda Noskova has received terrifying NSFW death threat after her early exit in Indian Wells.

The 20-year-old Czech player has endured a lot in the last one year, with her mother passing due to cancer in June of last year. This must have been terrifying for her, but she demonstrated incredible courage by sharing it and exposing the rageholic. The sad part about this is that these pathetic acts have become very common now. Most of the time, these come from gamblers who bet on the player and then lose huge sums, and take it out on the players.

This shouldn’t be dismissed as “another day in the life of a tennis player” because this shouldn’t be happening and honestly should be prosecuted as a threat against someone’s life, because that’s what it is. A sample of these types of comments should be investigated and the culprits should be charged. It would at least scare some of them enough to think twìce about threatening someone.

Marketa Vondrousova, the former Wimbledon champion, has announced via Instagram that she will be taking a break from tennis to recover from her shoulder injury. She said:

“Stepping out of the court again. I am still struggling with shoulder injury. Although it’s not easy, I now have a few months of intensive training and rehabilitation to get my arm back together. Patience and time are my priorities right now, but I believe it will all be worth it. so hopefully back on the court soon.”

Vondrousova has been plagued by injuries throughout her career, including the injury she sustained in Adelaide earlier this year which forced her to miss the Australian Open. She was playing well too in the last few tournaments and only lost to top players. Hopefully, this break would help her recover fully and play without any pain when she comes back.

The WTA will offer paid maternity leave to female players on the Tour for the first time. This is a groundbreaking step from the governing body and will help many tennis players in the future. More than 320 players will be eligible for up to 12 months paid leave through a new maternity fund. Grants will also be made available for fertility treatment. The maternity programme will be fully funded by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is a global partner of the WTA Tour.

This program empowers women tennis players, by providing the support and flexibility to pursue professional careers and build families. It’s awesome, especially for lower ranked players who can barely make it during their pregnancy.

22-time Grand Slam champion and recently retired tennis legend, Rafael Nadal will appear on former world No.1, Andy Roddick’s “Served With Andy Roddick” tennis podcast. The episode is set to go down on Tuesday, March 11th. The podcast account shared a glimpse from the podcast on X.

Coming this Tuesday… pic.twitter.com/UQcjbQg0gP

— Served with Andy Roddick (@Served_Podcast) March 7, 2025

 

Nadal has brought so much joy to tennis and fans all over the world over the last 20 years, and it would be fantastic to watch him discuss many things in depth for the first time since retiring from the Davis Cup last year. Andy Roddick is as good of a podcaster as he was a tennis player. and brings humor, and a candid, unfiltered style to his discussions. He asks smart questions but also knows when to let the conversation flow naturally. One can be assured that the conversation between these two would be engaging.

Coming off two straight Big 12 victories, Kansas tennis lost to No. 31 Arizona at the Jayhawk Tennis Center on Sunday 4-2.

Arizona got things started, taking the first of the three doubles matches. Arizona junior Danielle Tuhten and sophomore Josie Usereau defeated the pair of Kansas juniors, Heike Janse van Vuuren and Gracie Mulville, 6-2. 

Kansas senior Jasmine Adams and sophomore Yerkezhan Arystanbekova matched the score of one double, defeating Arizona sophomore Martyna Ostrzygalo and freshman Zoya Chulak 6-2.

Kansas was able to take the doubles point and the momentum going into singles matches when the young duo of sophomore Kyoka Kubo and freshman Anna Putilina, edged out a tie-breaking victory against Arizona seniors Belen Nevenhoven and Midori Castillo-Meza, 7-6 [9-7]. 

Though Kansas had the lead going into singles matches, Arizona proved to be too much for the Jayhawks. 

The first match to finish gave Arizona momentum back when Tuhten defeated Janse van Vuuren with a matching score 6-3, 6-3.

Only one Jayhawk was able to get a singles victory. Adams took down Arizona freshman Stephanie Shogreen, 6-4, 6-4, in straight sets. 

Usereau took down Mulville, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2, after winning a first-set tie breaker. Usereau left no question marks, taking the second set in dominating fashion. 

Arizona then started to run away with it. 

Ostrzygalo reversed swept Kubo after dropping the first set, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. Arizona junior Tanvi Narendran put the final remarks on the match, taking down Kansas freshman Meriem Ben Ezzedine, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, and giving Arizona the road victory, 4-2. 

Kansas will look to bounce back after falling to 8-6 on the season when the Jayhawks travel down to Texas to take on Houston on Friday, Mar. 14, at 2 p.m.

INDIAN WELLS, CA — The third round of the BNP Paribas Open is set to wrap up Monday, with eight spots each in the men's and women's singles tournaments up for grabs.

Second-seeded Carlos Alcaraz, the two-time defending tennis champion from Spain, will face Canadian challenger Denis Shapovalov at 6 p.m. Monday on Court 1. Both players are set to face each other for the second time in their careers, with the Spaniard having prevailed in straight sets at the 2023 French Open.

Taylor Fritz, the No. 3 seed and 2022 champion, will share the court with No. 30 Alejandro Tabilo of Chile. Fritz is one of four Americans looking to join fellow countrymen Marcos Giron and No. 10 Tommy Paul in the next round.

Alcaraz and Fritz are among the favorites remaining on the men's side, with top-seeded Alexander Zverev having lost his first match Friday to unseeded Dutch player Tallon Griekspoor, who has already advanced to the Round of 16. No. 5 Daniil Medvedev, who lost to Alcaraz in the finals each of the last two years, is also in the running.

In the women's draw, No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka has a showdown with Italian Lucia Bronzetti. The defending U.S. Open Champion has found success on hard courts, winning WTA 1000 titles last year in Cincinnati and Wuhan, but has only managed one finals appearance at Indian Wells -- a 2023 loss to Kazakhstani rival Elena Rybakina.

No. 3 Coco Gauff has shown improvement in each of her last three Indian Wells campaigns, reaching the semifinals in 2024. At 1 p.m., she faces the player who eliminated her during that run, two-time runner-up Maria Sakkari of Greece. Despite being the 29th seed, Sakkari owns a 5-3 head-to-head record against the American.

Madison Keys, the fifth-seeded American who captured her first career Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January, will play the day's first match at 11 a.m. Sixth-seeded Jasmine Paolini of Italy is scheduled to end the day's slate of matches with an 8 p.m. contest against Jaqueline Cristian.

Other players who have already reached the fourth round include No. 4 Jessica Pegula and No. 7 Rybakina.

World No. 11 Mirra Andreeva advanced to the fourth round at the BNP Paribas Open after defeating No. 21 Clara Tauson 6-3, 6-0 on Sunday night. The third-round encounter was a rematch of last month's final at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, which the 17-year-old won 7-6(1), 6-1 to capture her first WTA 1000 title. 

Indian Wells: Draws | Scores | Order of play

With her two wins this week at Indian Wells, Andreeva extended her active win streak to eight matches. She is the youngest player to win eight consecutive WTA 1000 matches since the format was introduced in 2009. Indian Wells is Andreeva's seventh Round of 16 showing at a WTA 1000, the most any player has made before turning 18. 

""I have been playing good recently,"" Andreeva said. ""It just feels that I know exactly what to do on the court. For example, I would say that before on some tournaments, it depends on the match, but now I just know that I go out there, doesn't matter who I play, the ball is coming to me and I know what to do.

""I just feel like everything is clear in my head, and I know exactly what to do with the ball. It's kind of a good feeling, I can say. I hope that I can maintain this for as long as I can.""

Andreeva will face 2023 champion and World No. 7 Elena Rybakina in the Round of 16 on Tuesday. Andreeva defeated Rybakina last month en route to the Dubai title. 

With Oscar-nominated Timothee Chalamet and Kylie Jenner in the crowd, Andreeva controlled the baseline from the start to improve to 2-0 over Tauson. The Dane was under pressure from the jump, digging out of a 0-40 deficit in her opening service game to hold to 1-0, but the tour's ace leader struggled to win points behind her vaunted first serve. Tauson won just 55.6 percent of her first serve points and was broken five times. In contrast, Andreeva faced zero break points and won over 70 percent of her service points to seal a tidy 63-minute win.

The victory is Andreeva's 15th of the season, putting her behind only Tauson and Iga Swiatek's tour-leading mark of 16 wins. She is tied with Australian Open champion Madison Keys, No. 4 Jessica Pegula, and her next opponent, Rybakina. 

World No. 9 Zheng Qinwen closed out the night session on Day 5 with a 6-4, 7-5 win over Lulu Sun to make her first Indian Wells Round of 16. Coupled with her straight-set win in the second round over Victoria Azarenka, Indian Wells marks the first time Zheng has secured back-to-back wins this season. She will face 18th seed Marta Kostyuk next.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}"

So far, 2025 has been a whirlwind of high-profile red carpet appearances for Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet — but even when they’re off-duty on more low-key dates, the couple are all about the PDA.

On Sunday, March 9, at the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells Tennis Garden in California, the couple — along with Jenner’s sister Kendall — sat back to take in some tennis, but Jenner appeared more focused on her actor boyfriend. Let’s face it, he’s Timothée Chalamet — who can blame her?

While Chalamet, 29, mostly had his eyes glued to the game, he seemed happy for his model and beauty mogul girlfriend, 27, to show her affection for him as they relaxed in the sunshine together. While Jenner wore her cute red top unbuttoned and tied at the midriff, sharing a bathroom selfie of her look via her Instagram Stories, Chalamet covered up in black leather pants, and later pulled a windbreaker on over his striped shirt.



The couple held hands, kissed, sipped drinks and chatted animatedly during the match between France’s Ugo Humbert and his Danish opponent Holger Rune, with Chalamet also leaving his seat to cheer the players on. Jenner even rubbed her boyfriend’s belly at one point.



A post shared by BNP Paribas Open (@bnpparibasopen)



The BNP Paribas Open official Instagram account shared footage of Jenner and Chalamet, and took the opportunity to use a tennis pun, captioning their video with the words, “A different kind of love.”

The last time the couple, who have been dating since 2023, were PDA-ing in public was at the Vanity Fair Oscars party, and they have spent the past few months looking seriously photogenic together at awards ceremonies and events across the world, thanks to Chalamet picking up multiple awards nominations (and one big win at the SAG Awards) for his starring role as Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.

Jenner has supported Chalamet throughout his awards season run, flying to London with him for the 2025 BAFTAs as well as being his date for multiple events in the U.S.

“Timothée is very focused on his career and Kylie loves being on the sidelines cheering him on,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly last month. “She loves that she’s in the spotlight more than her. It’s been a breath of fresh air.”

Now, with awards season drawing to a close, fresh air is something they finally have time for.

Aryna Sabalenka has had a go at building her perfect women’s tennis players and several of the current top players make the list while former world No 1 Ashleigh Barty gets the nod in two categories.

Five-time Grand Slam winner and Sabalenka’s main rival Iga Swiatek, 2023 US Open winner Coco Gauff – who beat the Belarusian in that Flushing Meadows final – current Australian Open champion Madison Keys and 2022 Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina also make the cut.

When asked who are the best when it comes to forehand, backhand, serve and return of serve, reigning world No 1 Sabalenka – who had major hiccups on her serve before roping in the a biomechanics coach to fix her problems – started off with: “Serve, I mean, on a good day, I’d say me. Forehand, [ATP No 1 Jannik] Sinner. Can I go like that?”

She was then told it was limited to WTA players and replied: “WTA? Forehand? Backhand? I just so much in love with myself on the good days. I cannot think about any players (laughter). Can you believe me?

“Wait. Serve, Elena when she’s in her good days.

“Forehand… [hitting partner] Andrei [Vasilevski], can you help me right now? Oh, yeah, Madison [Keys].

“What else? Volley?”

As for the backhand and return of serve, the three-time Grand Slam winner said: “Guys, you’re just killing me right now.

“Coco [Gauff] is good. Thank you, guys, for helping me. Anyone help? Just skip this question. I’m so bad.

“Return? Oh, my god. Iga. Iga is good. Serve I said Elena Rybakina. Volley, [Ashleigh] Barty. Slice, Barty.”

Before the Indian Wells Open got underway, the three-time Grand Slam winner also revealed the funniest players in tennis.

“I think Ons is really funny. I have to say Dimitrov is also pretty fun,” she said. “I don’t know. All of us, like, we’ve got that kind of like funny personalities, so it’s really tough to pick one person.

And that fun aspect, both on the court and away from their place of work, is important if you want to survive at top-level tennis.

She added: “I think it’s all about balance in life, and you have to balance this, like, really tough tennis life with, like, little fun, just so you’re not losing your mind on court, you know.

So I think I’ve been always talking about, like, balancing things out. So I think it’s very important to have some fun outside of court.”


                Swiatek could become the first woman in history to win three Indian Wells.
