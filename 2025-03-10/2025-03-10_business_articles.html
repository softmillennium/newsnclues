The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) continues falling despite efforts by President Trump to give the crypto world more of what it wants, including a strategic bitcoin reserve that the administration touted at the end of last week while hosting crypto executives at the White House.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell near $78,000 on Monday, hitting its lowest level since the days following Trump's election victory last November. It is now down 28% from its all-time high above $109,000 the day of Trump's inauguration in January.

Other digital assets beyond bitcoin also fell Monday, including ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP).

Trump’s pro-crypto stance was enough to lift digital assets higher in the period after his November election due to widespread optimism about a more favorable approach to the industry in Washington, D.C.

But that pro-crypto stance is no longer enough to overcome a variety of other economic worries, including growing concerns about the US economy and Trump’s unpredictable trade policy.

"While the early parts of the crypto sell-off in January and early February had nothing to do with the global macro picture, the last two weeks have 100% been driven by the equity market tantrum," Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer for crypto asset manager Arca, said in a Monday note.

There was also some disappointment within the crypto industry about Trump’s bitcoin reserve announcement last week. Some were hoping the government would make it clear that it would be buying more digital assets, as opposed to simply seeding the stockpile with crypto already seized in legal proceedings.

"The market reaction reflects a reset in expectations," Haider Rafique, chief marketing officer for crypto exchange OKX, said via email.

While Rafique said he considers the reserve a "milestone" that “cements bitcoin’s legitimacy on the global stage," he pointed out that the order won’t immediately drive more demand for the world’s largest cryptocurrency — thus "disappointing those expecting aggressive accumulation" by the US government.

Monday’s move down was the latest example of how bitcoin’s price has whipsawed in recent weeks as it experienced its worst correction since a 2022 meltdown.

"Crypto is still a risk asset, and also it needs more liquidity," MarketVector’s Martin Leinweber told Yahoo Finance last week.

The bitcoin strategic reserve announced last week was one of Trump's biggest promises to the crypto world, something he touted while on the campaign trail last year while pledging to make the US the "crypto capital of the planet."

Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks said on X that the US government owns an estimated 200,000 bitcoins worth over $17 billion after selling off about half of what it acquired through criminal seizures, although he said there has never been a complete audit.

Had the government not sold that sum for roughly $360 million over the last decade, according to White House officials, its bitcoin holdings would potentially be worth $17 billion more.

Sacks said the US will not sell any bitcoin once it is in the reserve and that it will be kept as a store of value.

The reserve, he added, "is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called 'digital gold.'"

One unknown question about the reserve announced last week by Sacks and Trump is whether it will be used to buy more bitcoin beyond the assets already held by the US government.

Sacks said that the secretaries of Treasury and Commerce have the authorization “to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC Friday that seized crypto assets would go into the reserve first and "then we'll see what the way forward is for more acquisitions for the reserve. And we're starting with bitcoin, but it's an overall crypto reserve."

But Sacks made it clear the government would not acquire additional assets for that stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings.

Coinbase Global (COIN) CEO Brain Armstrong told Yahoo Finance that because "the United States government is now a holder of bitcoin, maybe a buyer," he thinks "the rest of the G20 [countries] are going to see that as a signal that bitcoin is really the successor to the gold standard."

Trump, he added, “really breathed life back into this industry."

            The rout on Wall Street steepened Monday afternoon as US stocks plunged and the Dow fell 1,000 points — its largest single-day decline since December.
    


            The widespread selloff was mostly driven by concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on economic growth. In an interview that aired Sunday, Trump said the US economy would see “a period of transition” and refused to rule out a recession.
    


            When asked on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo” if he was expecting a recession this year, Trump said “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big.”
    


            The Dow’s losses equal 2.5%. The broader S&P 500 also plunged, dropping by 3.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite plummeted 4.6%.
    


            Tech stocks were leading the selloff Monday, weighing on the S&P 500 and dragging the Nasdaq into correction territory. As of the afternoon, the S&P 500 was down 9% from its record high on February 19, and the Nasdaq was on track for its worst day since September 2022.
    


            The “Magnificent Seven” of tech stocks — Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) — were all in the red on Monday, driving the broad selloff.
    


            “President Trump’s comments not necessarily taking a recession off the table unnerved investors who were already unnerved,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise.
    


            Tesla was down 14.8% on Monday. After the US presidential election in November, shares of Tesla surged. However, Tesla stock is down more than 44% this year, wiping out its gains since November.
    


            The company’s shares have taken a massive hit in recent weeks amid protests against CEO Elon Musk for his oversized role in the Trump administration, as well as slumping sales in Europe.

            Nvidia fell 5% and Palantir (PLTR), another star of the artificial intelligence trade, slid 10%.
    


            “When stocks overextend on the upside, they overextend on the downside,” said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email.
    


            The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged to its highest level this year. “Extreme fear” has been the sentiment driving markets for the past two weeks, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index.
    


            “This uncertainty has been swirling in the market,” Saglimbene said.
    


            Stocks have been hammered so far this month amid uncertainty around Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff policy. The S&P 500 slid 3.1% last week, posting its worst week since September.
    


            Trump threatened a massive tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico but then announced a reprieve until April 2. He doubled the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20% from 10%, and a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports is set to take effect March 12. In addition, Trump threatened last week to enact a 250% tariff on Canadian dairy products and a “tremendously high” tariff on its lumber. On Sunday he told Fox that tariffs may still “go up as time goes by.”



            “The talk of tariffs is, in a lot of ways, worse than the implementation of them,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group. “The tariff talk, reversal, speculation, and chaos only fosters uncertainty.”
    


            “I do not believe the administration knows how the tariff situation will play out, but if I were a betting man I would say that it will persist long enough to do damage to economic activity for at least a quarter or two, and ultimately result in a deal with different countries that make everyone wonder why we went through all the fuss,” he said in a note Monday.

            And cracks are forming elsewhere: Layoffs are mounting, hiring is slowing, consumer confidence is eroding and inflation is picking up.
    


            The yield on the 10-year US Treasury slid to 4.215% as investors snapped up government bonds, signaling concerns about uncertainty and economic growth.
    


            Looking ahead this week, investors will be attuned to monthly inflation data expected on Wednesday and Thursday to gauge whether inflation remained stubborn in February.
    


            A recession is commonly defined by two consecutive negative quarters of gross domestic product growth. The National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee, the official arbiters, says a recession “involves a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.”
    


            “How long this period of investor caution persists depends on how quickly it will take the global trade clouds, and the resulting threat of recession, to dissipate,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, in a note Monday.

Not every sector is getting pummeled by the Trump tariff rout that is currently enveloping the broader markets.

Consumer staples — from companies that sell soda to those offering healthcare services and energy — continue to attract their fair share of inflows as traders seek out businesses less tied to economic cyclicality. Case in point in Monday's highly volatile trading session.

Shares of Coca-Cola (KO) are up 2% on the session, while rival PepsiCo (PEP) is up 3%. Procter & Gamble (PG) shares are up 1.2%. The iShares US Healthcare ETF (IYH) is up slightly, powered by gains in top holdings Merck (MRK) and Amgen (AMGN).

The IYH has tacked on 1.2% in March. The three aforementioned stocks have all notched gains so far in March, compared to a 3.1% drop for the S&P 500.

Watch: Gap CEO is monitoring tariffs every hour

The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) — comprised of key US utilities like Duke Energy (DUK) and Constellation Energy (CEG) — is up about 1%. It's relatively unchanged in March, outperforming the S&P 500.

Health Care (XLV), Utilities (XLU), and Consumer Staples (XLP) are some of the best-performing sectors of the S&P 500 this year.

The shift to staples has been dramatic enough to push the ratio of consumer staples stocks to consumer discretionary stock from a multiyear low to a multi-month high, according to new data from Sundial Capital Research.

"On a relative basis, staples are more defensive, and portfolio managers live in a relative world. And as much as tariff concerns are dominating, the market is growing increasingly concerned about an economic slowdown. So traders are going back to the traditional playbook, irrespective of tariffs, toward staples, in which products will still need to be bought even if the economy slows," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told me.

Meantime, the broader market continues to take it on the chin.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) plunged more than 600 points in afternoon trading Monday as traders grew antsy on the economic growth outlook with Trump tariffs lurking. Trump not ruling out a recession in a Sunday Fox News interview hasn't helped the increasingly bearish sentiment.

The Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) finished below its closely watched 200-day moving average last week for the first time in nearly two years, per data from Creative Planning chief market strategist Charlie Bilello. The 200-day moving average is a technical measure of longer-term sentiment on an index or stock.

It represented the end of the second-longest uptrend in history for the Nasdaq 100 at 497 days. During this stretch, the Nasdaq 100 notched a 73% return.

The Dow, Nasdaq Composite, and S&P 500 (^GSPC) are all lower on the year. The Nasdaq has been the worst performer with a nearly 10% drop.

"Anything is possible in Trump World. We can't rule out the possibility that a bear market started on Feb. 20, the day after the S&P 500 rose to a record high. It could be like the 'flash crashes' that occurred during 1962 and 1987. It could happen quickly and reverse just as quickly. So the sell-off could provide buying opportunities, especially in overvalued names that are now less so," said longtime market watcher Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research.

Listen: Why this toy CEO is worried about tariffs

BCA Research's veteran strategist Peter Berezin said in a new piece of research that he sees a 75% chance of a recession within the next three months. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius has raised his US recession probability to 20% from 15%.

"In this administration, there's a different focus, I think, on the tariff discussion where the administration is looking at trade imbalances and trying to use tariffs against many different companies in a more universal fashion. And so that has created, at least in the short term, a lot more uncertainty," Newell Brands (NWL) CEO Chris Peterson told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.

Deribit-listed bitcoin (BTC) futures set to expire this Friday now trade marginally below the exchange’s index price, flashing a discount in a sign of weak demand for the cryptocurrency.

“What we have seen is that near-tenor (7d and shorter) yields have dipped to the negative for the first time in over a year,” Andrew Melville, a research analyst at Block Scholes told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “This means that futures prices are trading below spot, which we take as a significantly bearish indicator.”

Deribit is the world’s leading crypto options exchange and a preferred venue for sophisticated traders looking to employ synthetic strategies involving futures, options and spot markets.

Three separate outages appeared to hit Elon Musk's X social media site Monday, as the tech titan claimed it was suffering a "massive cyberattack." 

Thousands of reports of trouble accessing or using the site were first registered by Downdetector.com around 5:30 a.m. ET Monday. It took about an hour before those issues subsided.

Then, around 9:30 a.m., the issues appeared to flare up again, with as many as 40,000 outage reports detected. It again took about an hour for that incident to dissipate. 

Finally, around 11:10 a.m., the issues cropped up again, according to Downdetector. 

A representative for X could not immediately be reached for comment.

On Monday afternoon, Musk posted to X that there had been a "massive cyberattack" against the site. 

"We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources," Musk said. "Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved." 

Though he didn’t post any evidence of a cyberattack, experts said that the outage was consistent with a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, a rudimentary but sometimes effective hacker tactic to overwhelm a website with traffic, effectively knocking it offline.

Isik Mater, the director of research at NetBlocks, a company that tracks global internet connectivity, told NBC News that X had suffered intermittent outages since Monday morning. While establishing a DDoS attack with certainty can be difficult, Mater said Musk’s claim was plausible.

“It’s difficult to be certain, but given the pattern of three observed outages, a denial service attack targeting X’s infrastructure can’t be ruled out,” she said. “It’s certainly one of the longest X/Twitter outages in our records.”

If you receive more Social Security benefits than you are owed, you may face a 100% default withholding rate from your monthly checks once a new policy goes into effect.

The change announced last week by the Social Security Administration marks a reversal from a 10% default withholding rate that was put in place last year after some beneficiaries received letters demanding immediate repayments for sums that were sometimes tens of thousands of dollars.

The discrepancy — called overpayments — happens when Social Security beneficiaries receive more money than they are owed.

The erroneous payment amounts may occur when beneficiaries fail to report to the Social Security Administration changes in their circumstances that may affect their benefits, according to a 2024 Congressional Research Service report. Overpayments can also happen if the agency does not process the information promptly or due to errors in the way data was entered, how a policy was applied or in the administrative process, according to the report.

The Social Security Administration paid about $6.5 billion in retirement and disability benefit overpayments in fiscal year 2022, which represents 0.5% of total benefits paid, the Congressional Research Service said in its 2024 report. The agency also paid about $4.6 billion in overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, benefits in that year, or about 8% of total benefits paid.

The Social Security Administration recovered about $4.9 billion in Social Security and SSI overpayments in fiscal year 2023. However, the agency had about $23 billion in uncollected overpayments at the end of the 2023 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Research Service.

By defaulting to a 100% withholding rate for overpayments, the Social Security Administration said it may recover about $7 billion in the next decade.  

"We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people," Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, said in a statement. "It is our duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding, as it was during the Obama administration and first Trump administration, to properly safeguard taxpayer funds."

The new 100% withholding rate will apply to new overpayments of Social Security benefits, according to the agency. The withholding rate for SSI overpayments will remain at 10%.

Social Security beneficiaries who are overpaid benefits after March 27 will automatically be subject to the new 100% withholding rate.

Individuals affected will have the right to appeal both the overpayment decision and the amount, according to the agency. They may also ask for a waiver of the overpayment, if either they cannot afford to pay the money back or if they believe they are not at fault. While an initial appeal or waiver is pending, the agency will not require repayment.

Beneficiaries who cannot afford to fully repay the Social Security Administration may also request a lower recovery rate either by calling the agency or visiting their local office.

For beneficiaries who had an overpayment before March 27, the withholding rate will stay the same and no action is required, the agency said.

The new overpayment policy goes into effect about one year after former Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley implemented a 10% default withholding rate.

The change was prompted by financial struggles some beneficiaries faced in repaying large sums to the Social Security Administration.

At a March 2024 Senate committee hearing, O'Malley called the policy of intercepting 100% of a benefit check "clawback cruelty."

At the same hearing, Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Georgia, recalled how one constituent who was overpaid $58,000 could not afford to pay her rent after the Social Security Administration reduced her monthly checks.

Following the Social Security Administration's announcement that it will return to 100% as the default withholding rate, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare said it is concerned the agency may be more susceptible to overpayment errors as it cuts staff.

"This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices — usually through no fault of their own," the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy organization, said in a statement.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Genmab A/S (Nasdaq: GMAB) announced today that Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has decided that it will not exercise its option to receive a worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize HexaBody-CD38 (GEN3014). While the initial HexaBody-CD38 clinical data is promising and showed robust clinical efficacy, following a thorough evaluation of the data, the market landscape, and Genmab’s rigorous portfolio prioritization, Genmab will not pursue further clinical development of HexaBody-CD38.





“While we are disappointed that J&J has decided not to advance HexaBody-CD38, the data confirms the clinical potential of the HexaBody platform, reinforcing its value for future applications,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab. “With EPKINLY® (epcoritamab) moving from strength to strength and two wholly owned assets, rinatabart sesutecan (Rina-S™) and acasunlimab in Phase 3 development, we are confident in the potential of our existing pipeline of innovative antibody therapeutics. Genmab intends to maintain its laser sharp focus on and disciplined investments in our promising late-stage proprietary clinical pipeline and continues to execute against our capital allocation framework ensuring future growth.”



As stipulated by the development and option agreement between Genmab and J&J for HexaBody-CD38, Genmab provided J&J with data from a clinical proof-of-concept study in multiple myeloma, including a head-to-head comparison with DARZALEX FASPRO® (daratumumab and hyaluronidase fihj).



The Phase 2 expansion Part B of the study assessed the objective response rate (primary endpoint) of intravenous HexaBody-CD38 versus subcutaneous daratumumab in patients with anti-CD38 antibody- naïve relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.



Preliminary data submitted by Genmab to J&J, inclusive of 88 patients who received a study treatment and 84 patients who were response evaluable (42 in each arm), demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 55% (95% CI: 39%, 70%) in the HexaBoby-CD38 IV arm vs. 52% in the daratumumab SC arm (95% CI: 36%, 68%); very good partial response (VGPR) or better rate was 29% vs. 17%; and complete response (CR) or better rate was 7% vs. 2%.



Due to the relatively short follow-up time, secondary efficacy endpoints including duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were not mature yet. Treatment emergent Adverse events (TEAEs) above 20% in the Hexabody-CD38 arm were neutropenia, infusion related reactions, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. No new safety findings were observed in the daratumumab arm of the study. TEAEs leading to death included one patient in the HexaBody-CD38 IV arm and two patients in the daratumumab SC arm; none of these deaths was related to the study treatment. Follow-up is ongoing and more mature data will be presented at a future medical conference.



This news does not impact Genmab’s 2025 Financial Guidance.

About the 3014-01 Trial



3014-01 is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center trial to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of HexaBody-CD38 as a monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and other blood cancers. The trial consists of three parts: a dose-escalation phase (Phase 1) and an expansion phase (Part A and Part B). The primary objective of Phase 1 is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose and the maximum tolerated dose as well as establish the safety profile of HexaBody-CD38 monotherapy. The purpose of Phase 2 Expansion Part A is to assess the objective response rate of HexaBody-CD38 for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and other blood cancers. The purpose of Phase 2 Expansion Part B is to assess the objective response rate of HexaBody-CD38 versus subcutaneous daratumumab in patients with CD38 antibody naïve relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. More information on this trial can be found at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04824794).

PHILADELPHIA & PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Comcast Business today announced the launch of a new multichannel brand campaign, titled “Powering the Engine of Modern Business,” highlighting its capabilities as a global enterprise technology partner. Debuting today, the campaign includes three TV spots depicting real-world scenarios the company has deployed for its customers. The TV spots feature cameos from Billy Horschel, golf legend Tom Watson and Golf Channel’s Rich Lerner, with narration from Josh Brolin. Comcast Business also announced a new two-year agreement with eight-time PGA TOUR event winner Billy Horschel as brand ambassador ahead of the return to his hometown tournament, THE PLAYERS® Championship.





"This new campaign reflects the evolution of the Comcast Business brand as a global technology solutions partner, demonstrating not just what could be possible, but what we’re actively doing for customers across industries today,” said Eileen Diskin, Chief Marketing Officer, Comcast Business. “And as our new Comcast Business brand ambassador, the confidence, swagger and roll-up-your-sleeves mentality Billy brings to the golf course aligns perfectly with how we approach our customers’ needs every day, and our partnership with THE PLAYERS Championship and the PGA TOUR couldn’t be a better launch platform.”



The campaign’s three playfully scripted spots bring Comcast Business’ capabilities to life through a series of vignettes depicting experiences the company is making possible for customers today from small businesses to large enterprises including the PGA TOUR and THE PLAYERS Championship. Narrated by Josh Brolin, the spots demonstrate how Comcast Business helps transform companies into “seamlessly-restocking, frictionless-paying, poke-bowl-ordering, line-skipping” models of service and efficiency. Whether it’s retailers, restaurants, hotels, hospitals – or even the PGA TOUR – businesses all rely on leading connectivity and networking, advanced cybersecurity, and expert partnership. Comcast Business keeps their complex networks running like engines of modern business.



Comcast Business “Powering the Engine of Modern Business Anthem”



To celebrate the second year as a Proud Partner of THE PLAYERS Championship, the campaign includes a spot dedicated to the PGA TOUR and features cameos from Golf Channel’s Rich Lerner, golf legend Tom Watson and pro Billy Horschel. In his role as brand ambassador, Horschel, an eight-time PGA TOUR event winner and past United States President’s Cup representative, will feature the Comcast Business logo on his hat for the 2025 and 2026 PGA TOUR seasons.



The latest example of what Comcast Business makes possible for businesses is providing the technological backbone of THE PLAYERS Championship, in addition to its role as the Official Business Internet, Voice, Wi-Fi and SD-WAN Service Provider of the PGA TOUR. Comcast Business’ provides connectivity solutions at the PGA TOUR Global Home in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, and at Tournament Players Club (TPC) properties around the nation, including TPC Sawgrass.

Comcast Business “Powering the Engine of Modern Business PGA TOUR”



The new campaign debuts March 10 and includes TV, digital, and social media. Goodby Silverstein & Partners (GS&P) led the creative development of the campaign.



“It’s stuff most of us take for granted,” says Jeff Goodby, Co-Chairman and CCO at GS&P. “Like having the products you want when you want them or being able to enter a stadium with a tap of your wrist. Comcast Business is the backbone of it all.”

Héctor Forcén, The R&A’s Sustainable Agronomy Service’s newly appointed agronomist for Central and Northern Europe, talks about his role and the services that he offers to help golf club owners and course managers meet the challenges of maintaining their facilities in this part of the world



Can you tell us about your background and your journey to becoming The R&A’s Agronomist for Central and Northern Europe?

My journey in golf began with a deep passion for the game, which led me to study agronomy to further my career in the golf industry. For my final project studying agronomy, I worked on the construction of a public golf course, sparking my interest in specialising in golf course management skills  which I find valuable every day in my role as an agronomist. 

To develop my expertise, I joined professional associations and trained at Gleneagles, where I gained a strong foundation in greenkeeping. The mix of experience in practical greenkeeping and technical skills from studies has given me a rounded skillset and understanding of everyone’s role in golf. 

During Spain’s golf boom, I worked on several major projects, collaborating with leading designers while furthering my knowledge through specialised turfgrass management studies at the University of Georgia. I then joined a British company on the Tour, gaining valuable experience in global tournament preparation and course conditioning.

In 2009, I moved to Switzerland, where I managed golf course maintenance, consultancy and sustainability initiatives, refining my skills and a particular passion for environmental stewardship. These experiences ultimately prepared me for my current role as The R&A’s Agronomist for Central and Northern Europe.

What do you see as the biggest agronomic challenges for golf courses in Central and  Northern Europe, and how do you plan to address these through The R&A Sustainable Agronomy Service?

The biggest agronomic challenges for golf courses in Central and  Northern Europe stem from climate change, water management and pesticide regulation, and biodiversity pressures.

Climate change is causing drought issues through increased competition for the use of water due to population growth. We also see more frequent extreme weather events, and increased disease pressure because of environmental stress and the demands placed on the turf from golfers. To address this, we promote the development of drought-tolerant turf species through careful management of the golf course environment and maintenance strategies. The successful implementation of appropriate irrigation strategies and integrated pest management practices will be at the heart of success. 

Our access to irrigation water is facing greater restriction due to regulation and public perception. We see inefficient use of irrigation in many situations because of ageing infrastructure.  Supporting clubs in reasoning for upgrading their irrigation systems and becoming more astute with the application of water is one of the main areas of how we help clubs implement actions for raising the standards on the golf course. This may include water recycling solutions and audits to improve long-term sustainability.





Our drive to reduce the use of chemicals is key with regulation tightening and likely to become even more restrictive . We advocate for naturalised areas, precise nutrition, and the use of non-synthetic plant protection products to improve soil health practices and enhance turf resilience. We must ensure that the turf conditioning is healthy and strikes the balance with appropriate and sustainable standards for performance of the playing surfaces. For instance,  soil compaction and nutrient imbalances can also impact turf vitality. We implement soil testing, tailored fertilisation plans and efficient aeration programmes in a well-managed microclimate.

Biodiversity conservation is increasingly important. Our work at The R&A promotes biodiversity using many different strategies in creating pollinator-friendly habitats, incorporating native planting and monitoring biodiversity gains. 

Bringing all of this together in clear and actionable communication is needed for all areas of the golf club and the wider industry. We provide ongoing training through workshops, webinars and field demonstrations to ensure best practices are shared and adopted.

Sustainability is an increasingly significant concern in the golf industry. How will your services support clubs in adopting more environmentally responsible and sustainable practices while maintaining playability?

The R&A Sustainable Agronomy Service is supporting clubs in adopting sustainable practices while maintaining high standards of playability.

Integrated turf management helps minimise resource use and optimising mowing and cultural management practices. We find the balance between intensively managed playing areas and lower-input naturalised zones. We understand the need for setting achievable and optimum standards for each and every course. No two courses are the same either in their environment or resourcing. 

Water conservation is a key priority as already discussed but it’s an important point to reiterate as greenkeeping has come a long way with the introduction of technology such as soil moisture assessment and mapping. We encourage clubs to adopt the collection of meaningful and accurate, measurements to promote the use of efficient irrigation systems.

Improving soil health reduces the need for chemical inputs. We focus on organic matter management, efficient drainage, precision nutrient programmes and productive microclimate conditions to enhance turf resilience. These are intrinsically linked and one will not succeed on its own if the holistic management is not managed with care and understanding.

We also support carbon reduction efforts through minimal-maintenance landscapes, renewable energy adoption and carbon-sequestering practices such as tree and grassland habitat management. 



Which specific innovations or technologies do you believe hold the most promise for promoting sustainability in turf management over the next decade?

Several emerging technologies hold great potential, including:

Precision irrigation using soil moisture sensors and climate-based controllers conserve water by targeting irrigation needs in real-time.

Autonomous and electric equipment reduces emissions and optimises labour efficiency.

Advanced turfgrass breeding has produced drought- and salt-tolerant varieties, which reduce water use and withstand extreme conditions. This will be important for the resilience of turfgrass against increasing disease pressure.

Data-driven management through drones and AI improves turf monitoring and predictive maintenance.

Organic and bio-based solutions – including bio-stimulants, compost and biological pest control – reduce chemical reliance while improving turf resilience.

Carbon sequestration technologies like biochar enhance soil health and carbon storage, and a greater understanding of the benefits of grassland management.

We also see innovation in digital platforms for sustainability tracking, habitat restoration using GIS and drones, and renewable energy adoption for irrigation systems.

These advancements, combined with collaboration and knowledge sharing, will position golf courses to lead by example in sustainability. Our goal is to make these technologies accessible and effective for clubs worldwide.

President Donald Trump has dismissed the growing chorus of CEOs, investors and policymakers who are pleading with the White House for greater clarity about his sweeping tariff agenda.

"They always say that. 'We want clarity,'" Trump said in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday.

"They have plenty of clarity," the president told "Sunday Morning Futures" host Maria Bartiromo.

Appeals to the White House from the business community to provide more concrete guidance, Trump said, are little more than talking points. "They just use that — like almost a sound bite."

Pressed by Bartiromo on whether there would be "clarity for the business community," Trump's reply was telling.

"I think so, but you know, the tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up, and you know, I don't know if it's predictability."

Bartiromo interjected: "That's not clarity."

A day after the full interview aired, the start of a new week of tariff-fueled fears and heightened economic uncertainty sent stocks lower at Monday's opening. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 400 points, or 1%. The S&P 500 slipped 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite shed 2%. Later in the morning, both the 500-stock S&P and tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped to their lowest levels since September 2024.

Trump's comments capped off a week marked by unpredictability about both his tariffs and the broader strength of the U.S. economy.

The S&P 500 fell 3.10%, for its worst weekly mark since September. The Dow fell 2.37%, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 3.45%.

At the center of the storm were Trump's stiff 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which were initially paused for a month, then restarted Tuesday, only to be reined in Wednesday and then partially paused for another month on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Trump and multiple officials in his administration warned that Americans could be in store for some economic strain — including higher prices. But they insisted any adverse impacts would be temporary.

Confusion surrounding Trump's constantly shifting trade plans has left investors uncertain about what's coming next.

While Trump has downplayed the impact of his unpredictable trade policies on domestic markets, Wall Street analysts have not.

"We still have no clarity on the economy moving forward with the Trump turmoil," wrote Byron Anderson, head of fixed income at Laffer Tengler Investments.

"The longer we have chaos and turmoil from Trump, the higher the probability that we will eventually have data trend negative," he wrote in a Friday note.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Trump's latest remarks about his tariffs, or about the widespread confusion surrounding his agenda.

The coming week promises plenty of new economic data to test the competing theories.

Due out Monday is the New York Fed survey of consumer expectations, followed by the Wednesday release of February's consumer price index.

Thursday will see a fresh set of producer price data, before finishing the week with a University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading on Friday.

Now, as the Trump administration embarks on a monthlong reassessment of America's trade relationships around the world, the negative impacts of uncertainty, felt over the past few weeks, could be magnified.

"Markets fear uncertainty more than they fear bad news," wrote Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial. "25% tariffs are easier to price in than 'maybe 10%, maybe more, maybe less.'"

It's not just companies and investors who need greater clarity before they make major decisions.

The Federal Reserve does, too.

Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday said the central bank is "well positioned to wait for greater clarity" while the Trump administration implements "significant policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation."

Speaking at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, Powell said it would be "the net effect of these policy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy."

For now, he said, "uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high."

The Fed, like so many others, is "focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves," he added.

Hello A-J readers!

Three months in to 2025, Lubbock has already seen some shakeups in the business community. This week brought a review of February developments and a feature on a woman who has made a name for herself in the Landman business.

February was a relatively slow month for business updates, with the A-J reporting on six notable developments over the month. However, it did bring some unexpected losses, with the closures of Cinemark Southwest Lubbock Movies 16 and XD, 5721 58th St., and On The Border Mexican Grill and Cantina, 6709 Slide Road.

I spoke with Kathy Robertson, senior vice president and manager of Oil & Gas Property Operations for PlainsCapital Bank, about her nearly 20-year career as a landman. Robertson told me of her journey into the business, which helps people understand their mineral rights and much more. She also offered some advice for anyone looking to get into the career path.

"I got into it and fell in love with it," Robertson said. "It was a little bit accidental, one of those things where you're in the right place at the right time."

I have several messages out to companies regarding tariffs at grocery stores, upcoming locations and rumored new businesses. Nothing is on the books yet, but I hope my contacts get back to me in time for the next weekend edition.

As always, thank you for reading and supporting the A-J.
