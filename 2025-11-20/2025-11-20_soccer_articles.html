                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A simulated 2026 World Cup group stage draw gives the U.S. men's national team's good odds of advancing to the knockout stage. The USMNT are riding a five-game unbeaten streak after defeating Uruguay to close out November. While they won't play another international friendly until March, manager Mauricio Pochettino and his players have their eyes fixed on the upcoming group stage draw. That being said, simulations are already ongoing as coaches, players and fans try to map out a prospective journey. Being in Pot 1 as a host nation automatically avoids clashes with top dogs like Spain, France, England, Brazil and Argentina. One simulation run by Sports Illustrated puts the USMNT in a strong position to not only advance, but possibly top their group kicking off a magical summer run. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. Chances are Pochettino and co. will fancy themselves if this group became a reality. Despite numerous absences and a heavily rotated side, the USMNT routed Uruguay in their final match of 2025. A first-half blitz saw Sebastian Berhalter and Alex Freeman score their first senior international goals going on to win 5–1 in a convincing performance. La Celeste were missing key players as well, but the performance instilled belief in Pochettino's project. Lineups would look largely different if they meet again next summer and the stakes raised. Next up would be Mohamed Salah and Egypt. These two countries have only played twice in a competitive setting, with the USMNT winning their last meeting 3–0 in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup. Salah, being the talismanic presence that he is, can determine any game on his own. Still, the USMNT should be favored on home soil. Closing out their prospective opponents are Saudi Arabia. The USMNT defeated Hervé Renard's side in the Gold Cup this past summer without names like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Folarin Balogun. Two-time champions AAaUruguay will be favored to advance as well, with the third spot up for grabs. Why Malik Tillman Is USMNT's Key to Success at 2026 World Cup Host nation Mexico face a difficult path having to take on Japan, Ivory Coast and New Zealand. They should advance as, at least, a third-place team from this prospective group. Canada would battle Ecuador, Jordan and UEFA-qualifying darling Scotland. The Tartan Army needed a late stoppage time winner from Kieran Tierney to top their group, sending Denmark to the playoffs. Like Mexico, Canada should advance from this group. If this is their group, they should qualify for the knockout stage with ease. Among the rest, South Korea and Türkiye are names to watch this tournament. Curaçao hope to shock the globe after becoming the smallest nation by population to qualify for a World Cup. Belgium and Croatia in a simulated Group F would be overwhelming favorites. This could be the last World Cup fans get to see the likes of Kevin De Bruyne and Luka Modrić play for their respective countries as well. La Albiceleste are not only defending their title as world's best, but this World Cup will likely be Lionel Messi's last. All eyes will be on the superstar to see if he can go back-to-back. They slipped up in the group stage back in Qatar losing to Saudi Arabia, so Senegal and Austria are potentially tricky fixtures. Can he guide Les Bleus to another final appearance? Their simulated group gives them a strong chance of advancing as they look to right the wrongs of a heartbreaking shootout defeat in 2022. Elsewhere, Iran and Paraguay likely fight for the second seed. DR Congo have yet to book their spot through the playoffs, so this group could become a bit more difficult. Julian Nagelsmann's Germany would be favored to advance from a simulated Group I, though they are still looking for a signature moment since their 2014 triumph. Their quarterfinal exit from Euro 2024 also left much to be desired. At minimum, Switzerland will fancy themselves against Germany in a match that could determine who tops this prospective group. Panama and South Africa would hope to qualify by being one of the eight best third-place sides. 2026 also likely represents Cristiano Ronaldo's final World Cup in a Portugal shirt. Unfortunately for the reigning UEFA Nations League champions, they've been drawn into this simulation's group of death. Colombia were runner-ups at the 2024 Copa América, while Ghana are always a tough opponent in international competitions. Portugal's advancement here would be difficult and a mouthwatering clash against Erling Haaland and Norway, qualified for the first time since 1998, is undeniably box office. If not for Harry Kane's penalty miss against France, who knows how far the Three Lions could've gone in Qatar last time. The German manager looks to get over the line in an international tournament after Sir Gareth Southgate came up just short in consecutive Euros. Morocco would be their toughest test here after finishing fourth last World Cup. Poland must go through the playoffs with Haiti rounding out this group. Yet, they have multiple question marks heading into 2026. Carlo Ancelotti must get the most out of his players as he continues to search for consistency. They would be favored over most sides in this group, but how far this iteration of Brazil can go remains to be seen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tottenham loanee Randal Kolo Muani has reportedly been training in a specially fitted mask ahead of the north London derby against Arsenal. During Spurs' 2-2 draw with Manchester United earlier this month, the striker suffered a fractured jaw following a clash with Harry Maguire. However, after the Paris Saint-Germain man did not need to have surgery, Tottenham are doing all they can to give him a chance of facing the Gunners this weekend. Kolo Muani was withdrawn at half time following the coming together with Maguire, with head coach Thomas Frank later saying: "He actually struggled a little bit but nothing big." Initial suggestions were that the France international could miss up to eight weeks with this injury but last week, news emerged that he did not require surgery. It is not yet known if he will be okay to face Arsenal at The Emirates on Sunday afternoon. If the forward does return to the field soon, he could take after ex-Spurs striker Harry Kane when he wore a mask after breaking his nose, before scoring a truly world-class goal in a 2-2 draw with the Gunners. He has featured eight times in all competitions for the north London team but is yet to get off the mark. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. "Randal is a quality player who has proven himself over a number of years, playing for big teams in the Champions League and also with good experience for the France national team," Frank said of his latest addition in early September. Tottenham sit fifth in the Premier League with 18 points from 11 matches. Next up, they travel to bitter rivals Arsenal on Sunday, who sit four points clear at the top of the table. A win will boost their hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League, but a loss could leave them languishing behind their neighbours.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fernandinho has officially decided to bring down the curtain on an extraordinary career, drawing to a close more than two decades at the top of the game and a trophy cabinet that places him among Manchester City's most decorated players of all time. The former Brazil international, now 40, confirmed he will not continue playing, ending speculation that had lingered since his return to Athletico Paranaense in 2022. Fernandinho spent nine seasons at Manchester City after arriving from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, where he had already earned six Ukrainian league titles and a UEFA Cup. Under Manuel Pellegrini and later Pep Guardiola, he became the anchor of City's midfield. Known for his exceptional reading of the game, immaculate tackling, and unrivalled positional awareness, his influence allowed the club's creative talents to flourish. Across 383 City appearances, Fernandinho lifted five Premier League titles, six League Cups, an FA Cup and a Community Shield. After leaving Manchester in 2022, Fernandinho went home, rejoining Athletico Paranaense, the club that first introduced him to professional football. His playing time naturally declined as the seasons passed, and the midfielder had not featured since December 2024 in a league match against Atletico Mineiro. Speaking after a charity game this week at the club's stadium, he made clear his body had given him its final warning. "There's nothing in football that motivates me anymore. The 40-year-old added that his departure came after he and the club failed to reach an agreement on a new deal. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. When Fernandinho left City, he had not initially informed Guardiola about his decision. "I didn't know it," the manager told reporters during a press conference. I said many times we will see what happens. I said at the end of the season we will talk – maybe it is a family decision, maybe he wants more minutes. "Maybe Txiki knows it and didn't tell me," Guardiola said. It is a surprise for me; I will say to him [Txiki]: 'What happened?' Another player would do it for his benefit. I understand the players want to play, it is completely understandable. Look what happened with Ferran Torres: he wanted to play so joined Barcelona. I understand Ferna wants go back to Brazil, with his father and mother there, and I am pretty sure the club is going to help him do what he wants." Attention now shifts to Fernandinho's future beyond the pitch. The Brazilian has previously expressed interest in coaching, and Manchester City have a history of integrating former players into roles across their academy, global network or ambassadorial programmes. With his intimate knowledge of Guardiola's system, he would be a valuable addition should he choose to pursue the coaching path. However, as he mentioned, right now, he would opt for a quieter period dedicated to family life, after spending years at the elite level.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emerging from the locker room following his team's huge 5-1 win over Uruguay Tuesday night in Tampa, Fla., U.S. national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino didn't like the first question at his press conference. Both queries were meant to indicate the program's depth. Few – if any – of the consensus “regular starters” actually started. It's that phrase Pochettino dug his feet in on and didn't give an inch. “I hate the ‘no regular players' (question),” Pochettino said. Every time our decision to pick a starting XI, it's the U.S. men's national team playing.” Pochettino changed nine players from the XI that started in a win over Paraguay on Saturday. This from a squad that is already missing stalwarts Christian Pulisic, Chris Richards, Tyler Adams, Tim Weah, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, Malik Tillman and more. “If you know me, I hate to talk this way,” Pochettino said when asked about players missing. Pochettino consistently preaches fight, competitiveness and togetherness from his teams. And he has put that methodology into practice by creating internal competition. The USMNT has called up 71 players to camps in this calendar year. Tell me which ‘regular players' you are talking about?” Pochettino asked indignantly. What was expected to be a joyful press conference given the match that preceded it quickly went off the rails and never got back on track. “Maybe we need to stop the press conference, I need to go to the dressing room, come back and start the press conference again,” Pochettino said with a laugh, “because it's like we lost 5-1!” Soon after, Pochettino was asked if Berhalter's exquisite goal from a free kick – which was rolled short and touched back to Berhalter before he curled it into the top corner – was rehearsed in training or improvised in the moment. Pochettino threw his hands up and sarcastically – we think – said: “No, it happened by coincidence.” There were few big breakdowns of individual performances, like Berhalter, who boosted his chances of making the World Cup squad in a hugely competitive midfield pool. “To be honest, maybe I'm tired and don't understand the English (questions), but I'm very disappointed at the first two questions,” he said. No matter what questions were asked or performances given, the USMNT has now put together a five-game unbeaten run (4-0-1) since a disastrous performance against South Korea in September. While the national team won't reconvene for four months, the group departs on a hugely positive note, with strong results fueled by strong performances. Pulisic, Richards, Adams, Weah, McKennie and Robinson could all feasibly be back in frame by the spring, but the coaches don't want to look at that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TAMPA, Fla. — It feels like a lifetime ago, but it was just June 10 that a heavily-rotated U.S. men's national team squad was played off the field against Switzerland. So when Mauricio Pochettino named a starting lineup for Tuesday night's friendly against Uruguay that featured nine new starters from the team that beat Paraguay three days before, it was understandable why some might have braced for a similar outcome. Uruguay, after all, was probably the most talented team the U.S. had seen since South Korea in September — and was playing some of its most important players. Instead, the U.S. overwhelmed and steamrolled Uruguay at Raymond James Stadium, scoring three goals in the first 30 minutes en route to a decisive and signature 5-1 victory. It spoke to the sheer amount of progress Pochettino had made in a short time with this U.S. team, not just in building out depth in the pool, but in building belief within that expanded pool of players. That he could field one team that looked like by far the better side against Paraguay, then change out so many players and get an even more impressive performance was a testament to that progress. After the game, Pochettino's press conference started with a surprisingly combative and fiery response to a question about what it meant to get such a positive result despite, “a lot of regulars rested.” Pochettino took it as an attack on the identity he was trying to build in the team; the identity that the result in question was meant to reinforce. “I don't want to be negative, no, but I hate the ‘no regular players' (question). Every time our decision to pick a starting XI, it's the U.S. men's national team playing. If you know me, I hate to talk this way. The focus on that word — ”regulars” — cut to the core of what Pochettino feels he has had to overcome. It has been a theme of his for months now. He has worked to cut the legs out from any sort of complacency or entitlement within the group. The talk about a “golden generation” had to end. It was a journey that he said truly started after March's Nations League, when losses to Panama and Canada sent this U.S. team reeling, but one he hopes ends with this team taking its chance and making a dream run to the decisive stages of next summer's World Cup. The defeats to the pair of Concacaf rivals in March's Nations League felt like a sobering moment for a U.S. team that may have been hoping that changing the coach would be like pushing a fix-it button. There had been so much hope and optimism around the U.S. team going into the 2024 Copa América only for them to fall in the group stage. After firing Gregg Berhalter and hiring Pochettino, the belief was that things would get back on track immediately. Pochettino felt the focus wasn't there in camp. “I think that March (was the turning point). I think with all that negativity, (comes) positive things, because with all this negativity we used (it) to build that journey,” Pochettino said. “Sometimes this type of thing can happen, for changing things. Maybe you see things in a different way. It was, in other words, a moment for the U.S. team to come back down to reality. Whatever the U.S. and its players thought they were — it wasn't and they weren't that. If Pochettino was going to change the mentality of the group, he was going to have to manufacture competition that hadn't existed to a high enough degree in the first years of this cycle. The ensuing months were spent breaking things down and building them back up again. “I think that was good for us to see the reality,” Pochettino said. “When you really touch the reality, and it's not the reality that you perceive, or you were convinced was different, I think this is a good point to be.” The revamp started in the Gold Cup camp with players who mostly had everything to prove. Going into the Gold Cup, the absence of players like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Yunus Musah – “regulars,” if you will, even though Pochettino won't – opened the door for others to step through. Even after the Switzerland loss, Pochettino didn't lose faith in the group he believed could deliver an important message: that there was more talent in this U.S. pool than was being given credit. While just two players — Mark McKenzie and Sebastian Berhalter — were in the starting lineup for both the Switzerland loss and Uruguay triumph, a number of other players who featured in two big wins this window were a part of that game, against the Swiss, including Max Arfsten, John Tolkin, Diego Luna, Tim Ream and Brenden Aaronson. “We know exactly the big group of players that we can rely on,” Pochettino's assistant Jesús Pérez said. “Depending on the circumstances, now it's a matter of state and injuries. But we know (for example), if we call Alex Freeman, what Alex can give us. But the tournament was less about the results and more about building a different mentality within the pool at large: No one's job was secured. … But none of them are going to be right if you are not fully committed,” Pérez said. And if (there) was some noise around those circumstances, I think everything (is now) clear.” On Tuesday night, it was some of the new faces that emerged over the last few months that reignited belief that this U.S. team might be capable of making noise at next summer's World Cup. This is what Pochettino aimed for when he built out his Gold Cup roster. Whether it was Pulisic, McKennie and Weah, or Berhalter, Freeman and Luna, Pochettino was convinced the results could be the same. In part because of that depth that has been built out, the U.S. is unbeaten in its last five games against FIFA top-40 opponents for the first time since 2013. It feels like a completely different world than it did less than half a year ago. “It's a testament to the culture that we're building,” McKenzie said. “It shows, again, the faith that Mauricio has in this team and that the collective have in one another. We have a real brotherhood, a band of guys who are going to go out there and not only play with pride to represent our country, but play for the guys next to us.” It has been a steady drumbeat of positivity around this U.S. team since it downed Japan in September. Players have looked more confident on the field. There seems to be a strong understanding of how they want to play and what the staff is looking for in the team's approach to games. The complacency that Pochettino was combatting is gone. He could sense the confidence building in front of him. In camp, Pochettino contrasted this team to what it looked like in March, calling it the epitome of “professional.” There was no “silly or stupid” things that happened away from the field. The reality now, he said, is better than what we might even think. “Let's be realistic,” Pochettino told the team. It was about reaching for big goals again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. tourism is expecting a World Cup boon in 2026—but President Donald Trump's repeated threats to pull games from Democrat-run cities is adding uncertainty for travelers and the economy. Trump targeted Seattle's newly elected democratic socialist mayor, asking FIFA president Gianni Infantino, “How close are you going to be watching that city with the crime in the city?” The World Cup is projected to drive $30.5 billion in economic output and create 185,000 jobs in the U.S. next year, according to an analysis from FIFA and OpenEconomics . According to the report, roughly 40% of the estimated 6.5 million tournament attendees will be international fans who will stay for an average 12 days, buy two tickets per person and spend about $416 daily. FIFA has advised World Cup host cities to expect a 50/50 split between domestic and international visitors, tourism officials from Philadelphia and Kansas City, two World Cup host cities, told Forbes. Nevertheless, the tourism analytics firm expects the event to help reverse a dramatic 6.3% downturn in inbound international tourism since Trump took office, driven mainly by his tariffs, America First rhetoric and immigration policies. While tourism officials are generally optimistic about the potential for a World Cup boon, some have expressed concern that Trump's rhetoric and policies will inevitably turn off some international soccer fans. With seven months until the tournament kicks off and millions of game tickets already sold, changing host cities would be a legal and logistical nightmare for FIFA. Last month, he singled out Boston when expressing his displeasure with the city's “radical left” mayor, Michelle Wu, saying “we could take [World Cup games] away.” After lambasting Seattle for electing a “communist” mayor, Trump asked Infantino in the Oval Office Monday, “Can I say that we are moving the event to a location where it will be appreciated and safe?” Infantino appeared to appease Trump, saying safety “of course is the responsibility of the government” and “obviously we will discuss, we are working together, we must ensure all fans coming from abroad can experience a celebration of coming together of the sport and with 100 percent safety.” Other FIFA executives have pushed back more definitively on Trump's rhetoric. “At the end of the day it's FIFA's tournament, FIFA makes those decisions,” Victor Montagliani, vice president of FIFA, said at a sports summit in London last month, adding, “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans.” Until the tournament groups are announced on Dec. 5, fans who want to see a specific national team play don't know where to plan their travel. It remains to be seen whether FIFA's tournament draw might potentially penalize host cities Trump has criticized by steering countries with the most ardent fanbases to Republican-leaning cities. “Please do not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle,” Infantino said before the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Since July, FIFA has been a tenant in Manhattan's Trump Tower, which Trump critics have cited as yet another example of the sitting US president co-mingling his role as head of state with his business interests. Infantino was a guest at Trump's inauguration in January and has been an enthusiastic supporter of the president. International soccer organizations, meanwhile, have also criticized Infantino's bromance with Trump. Trump's Big Beautiful Bill Has A Nasty Surprise For World Cup Tourists (Forbes)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gab Marcotti and Mark Ogden discuss the World Cup playoff draw which sees Wales at home to Bosnia & Herzegovina and Northern Ireland travel to Italy. The 2026 FIFA men's World Cup kicks off in just 203 days, but six qualification slots are still up for grabs via the Intercontinental and European playoffs. Two teams will book a place at the event (to be played in the U.S., Mexico and Canada) via the playoffs, which will be staged in Mexico in March, while 16 European nations, including four-time World Cup winners Italy, are set to battle it out for the final four UEFA qualification berths. Following a draw at FIFA HQ in Zurich on Thursday, the playoffs are now locked in, so which teams can start to plan for North America and who has a nightmare route to football's biggest tournament? There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The teams will be divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the Nations League group winners assigned to Pot 4 and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. Semifinal 1, Italy vs. Northern Ireland: The playoff nightmare returns for Italy following elimination at this stage ahead of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, but they will be happy with a home draw against Northern Ireland in the semifinal. Michael O'Neill's team are huge outsiders, and despite finishing second in their qualifying group behind Norway, Italy should be too strong and more than capable of erasing memories of failures to beat Sweden (2018) and North Macedonia (2022) at home in their last playoff campaigns. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Semifinal 2, Wales vs. Bosnia-Herzegovina: Wales coach Craig Bellamy made huge importance of beating North Macedonia in Cardiff in their final group game because that would guarantee a home semifinal, and that advantage should swing the tie in their favor. The Welsh have a formidable record at the Cardiff City Stadium, playing in front of what has been billed as a "Red Wall" of passionate supporters; Bellamy's team should win this game to seal another home tie against Italy in the final. If key men Sandro Tonali and Giacomo Raspadori are fit and in form, Italy should have enough to shade this tie, but Wales are strong at home, and if these two meet in the final, don't be surprised if Wales inflict yet another playoff heartbreak on the Azzurri. Semifinal 1, Ukraine vs. Sweden: While Ukraine have home advantage, the ongoing conflict in the country means Sergiy Rebrov's team will likely play this tie in neutral Poland, and that could tilt the game in Sweden's favor. Sweden were dismal in qualification, finishing at the bottom of Group B without a win in six games, but their Nations League success last year sealed a playoff spot, and star forwards Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyökeres will surely see this as a second chance to qualify that they cannot pass up. Semifinal 2, Poland vs. Albania: Poland have become the team that always qualifies for major tournaments but fails to deliver once on the big stage. Albania, coached by former Barcelona and Brazil defender Sylvinho, are a well-organized, high-energy team, and they will be confident in beating Poland away from home. At 37, this will be Robert Lewandowski's final World Cup campaign. If the Barcelona forward is on form, Poland will win. Final, Sweden vs. Albania: Albania are good enough to cause any opponent problems and could quite easily travel to Sweden and win. But if Sweden overcome Ukraine and seal a home game in the final, it would be tough to deny a team with the attacking qualities of Isak, Gyokeres and Anthony Elanga. Sweden, now coached by Graham Potter, really shouldn't have this opportunity to reach the World Cup, but they are the strongest squad in Path B, so they will qualify. Semifinal 1, Turkey vs. Romania: Turkey showed their strength by earning a 2-2 draw against Spain in Seville in their final Group E game, a result that restored some pride after a 6-0 home defeat against the European champions in September. Having scored 12 goals in three games against Bulgaria (twice) and Georgia in between the Spain fixtures, Turkey are clearly an attacking force and loaded with top talent, including Arda Güler, Kenan Yildiz, Deniz Gül and midfielder Hakan Çalhanoglu. Romania, coached by the 80-year-old Mircea Lucescu, are unpredictable but talented. Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Semifinal 2, Slovakia vs. Kosovo: Kosovo are the most dangerous outsiders in the European playoffs and much stronger than their FIFA ranking of 80th would suggest. Franco Foda's team lack big names, but their players are based throughout Europe, and Kosovo ran Switzerland close in Group B, beating Sweden home and away before being held at home by the Swiss in the final game. Final, Kosovo vs. Turkey: On paper, Turkey are big favorites to make it through Path C to the finals, but home advantage could be decisive for Kosovo if they eliminate Slovakia. Semifinal 1, Denmark vs. North Macedonia: Denmark threw away an automatic qualification spot by drawing at home to Belarus and then losing away to Scotland in their final two games having been in control of Group C, so their status as favorites in this tie should be tempered by the scars of their group-stage failure. Blagoja Milevski's team drew home and away with group winners Belgium and they will relish their underdog status, just as they did when eliminating Italy with a 1-0 win in Palermo in the 2018 playoffs. Denmark should be too strong at home, but North Macedonia are primed to record another shocking result. But Jaroslav Kostl's squad, which includes West Ham's Tomás Soucek and Bayer Leverkusen forward Patrik Schick, held their nerve to seal second position behind Croatia. Ireland came from nowhere to claim a playoff place, though, with a shocking 2-0 home win against Portugal before Troy Parrott's hat trick in Budapest, including a 96th-minute winner, denied Hungary and claimed second spot for Heimir Hallgrimsson's team. Final, North Macedonia vs. Republic of Ireland: Home advantage in a game to decide a place in the World Cup will be crucial, and Ireland, backed by a crowd of 52,000 in Dublin, might just have enough to make it the World Cup. North Macedonia are more individually talented, and the same applies to Denmark if they make the final, but Ireland coach Hallgrimsson made his name guiding Iceland to a series of shocking wins, and he can do it again if key players Troy Parrott, Caoimhin Kelleher and Evan Ferguson are fit and in form in March. Steve McClaren quits his job as Jamaica boss after their failure to directly qualify for the FIFA World Cup. Jamaica blew their chance of automatic qualification with a 0-0 draw at home to Curacao in the final round of Concacaf qualifiers, and that result forced coach Steve McClaren to quit. Congo DR have Premier League experience in Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Arthur Masuaku and Axel Tuanzebe, but Jamaica can also rely on Brentford's Rico Henry and Ethan Pinnock. This tie is a close call, but Congo DR look to have just a little bit more quality and will claim the qualification spot. Iraq won a two-legged Asian playoff against United Arab Emirates to clinch their place in the Intercontinental playoffs -- their winning goal was a penalty 17 minutes into stoppage time. Coached by former Australia coach Graham Arnold, Iraq's squad are largely based in the Middle East, but former Manchester United youngster Zidane Iqbal, now at FC Utrecht, is a player with European experience. Suriname, ranked 123rd, have a squad of players based in Europe, but while Bolivia's squad is largely drawn from South American leagues, they have a recent win against Brazil on their form guide, so they should be too strong for Suriname. If Bolivia face Iraq in the final, it will be tough to call, but their experience of playing at altitude could be crucial in Mexico, and it should give them the edge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup is into its final stages. Argentina will defend their title after Lionel Messi completed his long and occasionally tortuous path to glory at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. La Albiceleste have since retained their Copa America title and finished top of the notoriously gruelling CONMEBOL qualifying section. Here's everything you need to know about World Cup qualification, who has made it to the finals and how many teams from each continent will take part. MORE: Who can qualify for the World Cup this week Each confederation has more slots available under the expanded format. The AFC has double the qualification spots it had at Qatar 2022, up from four guaranteed places to eight, while there will be nine African nations instead of five. CONCACAF will have at least double its 2022 representatives, up from three to six, although half of those slots are accounted for by the United States, Mexico and Canada qualifying automatically as hosts. As was the case at the previous World Cup, two slots will be decided via an inter-continental playoff. MORE: Host countries, cities for FIFA 2026 World Cup By finishing top two in their group in the third round of AFC qualification, they secured an automatic bid to the competition. Following them shortly after was Cape Verde, as the tiny island nation of just 600,000 people earned their first-ever World Cup spot by winning their group ahead of Cameroon. Beating that in November was Curacao, who became the smallest-ever nation to qualify for a World Cup with their population of 150,000. The AFC began its crucial third round of qualification in September 2024. Eighteen teams were split across three six-team groups to contest 10 games in a round-robin format. The teams placed third and fourth in each group advanced to a fourth round split between two groups of three. Nine groups of six teams played each other home and away in Africa. DR Congo prevailed to with the playoff on penalties against Nigeria, moving them into March's inter-confederation round. MORE: Can Nigeria still qualify for World Cup 2026? CONCACAF began the second round of its qualification phase in June 2024, with 30 teams drawn into six groups of five. Each team played every opponent in their group once, with two away games and two home games once the phase concluded in June 2025. The top two in each group advanced to the 12-team third round, where there were three groups of four. South America retained its celebrated marathon World Cup qualification round, with all 10 of the confederation's countries playing one another home and away in a gruelling league format. Argentina clinched their place at the finals thanks to a memorable 4-1 demolition of arch rivals Brazil. The second round, running across October and November 2024, saw two groups of four playing for the four spots in round three. New Caledonia defeated Tahiti in the first semifinal, with New Zealand thrashing Fiji 7-0 in the other. New Caledonia will enter the inter-confederation playoffs, so they have another chance to get there, albeit a slim one. Twelve of UEFA's 16 spots were taken by the group winners from the initial format of four or five-team groups. Those 16 teams were drawn into four paths with two single-game rounds. The four-game playoff will be used as a World Cup test event and played in two venues in Mexico. MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, will host the final on July 19.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Mauricio Pochettino's makeshift United States men's national team beat Uruguay 5-1 in their final fixture of 2025 on Tuesday night, this much is clear: No one's spot on the 2026 World Cup roster should feel secure, not even for those Americans playing for some of the world's most famous European clubs. With only one more international window to go before the 2025-2026 European club season ends, it may be more important than ever for every player with World Cup hopes to earn regular minutes and make contributions at the club level. However, that doesn't describe everyone in the current USMNT player pool, including several names who were expected to be cornerstones of the 2026 squad when Pochettino took over just over a year ago. Here are five USMNT players who desperately need to play more minutes for their club sides to lock down a spot on the final tournament squad. Reyna was excellent during his 104 minutes across two November matches for Pochettino, scoring one goal, assisting another, and setting up a third. The World Cup is a lot different from an international window, with the U.S. facing as many as eight matches between June 12 and July 19 if it can make a run to the semifinals as a host nation. After briefly returning to the pitch, he hasn't played a competitive fixture for Fulham since late September. Additionally, because Pochettino has switched to playing primarily in a 3-4-3 formation this fall, it may be riskier to wait until June to reintroduce Robinson than it would have been had the U.S. coach kept playing a back-four system. Robinson has rarely played as a left wing-back for his Premier League club, and the overwhelming majority of his international experience for the USA has also been in a back four. But that's looking like a bigger "if" with each passing week. While Betis had a phenomenal season in 2024-25, no one can blame the 23-year-old for wanting to join a club that regularly contends for La Liga titles and UEFA Champions League places. And now, after recovering from an ankle sprain early in his first campaign for Atleti, he's been supplanted by veteran captain Koke in his box-to-box midfield role. At this point, it feels like Cardoso needs a pretty dramatic turn in his club's fortunes to climb back into Pochettino's consideration. But Koke is 33, and it's a grueling season for Champions League sides, more so than ever with the new format. With Weston McKennie spared from Pochettino's November roster and Tyler Adams forced to withdraw with an injury, this felt like a camp where Musah could have earned his way back into Pochettino's good graces. Musah probably wishes he could get a do-over on that choice. More than anyone else on this list presently, Musah now needs to prove himself capable of approaching that upper limit by winning a more integral role on the club level. No one's stock has risen more this year than Freeman, who opened his international goal-scoring account with a first-half brace on Tuesday. But the defender faces a potentially pivotal winter for both his club and international futures. While the 21-year-old became one of coach Oscar Pareja's most reliable players for Orlando City this season, he's well underpaid on his current rookie contract and has yet to agree to a new MLS deal. You can understand why Freeman might want to take advantage of his rocketing USMNT stock now, similar to how Patrick Agyemang parlayed his into a giant pay raise at Derby County. And if he doesn't, it's certainly the kind of thing that could interrupt the meteoric rise of a player who has only played one full first-division season.</p>
