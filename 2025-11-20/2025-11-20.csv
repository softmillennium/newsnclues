            Ukraine has identified a Russian commander it accuses of “systematic and coordinated war crimes” in Bucha, near Kyiv, where hundreds of civilians were murdered during its brief occupation by Russian troops in 2022.
    


            Yurii Vladimirovich Kim, the commander of a platoon in Russia's 76th Air Assault Division, is accused of ordering his troops to murder civilians between March 7 and April 1 2022, according to an indictment from Ukraine's Prosecutor General.
    


            Bucha, where the Russian retreat revealed the bodies of children and the elderly lying in the streets, has become synonymous with the brutality of Moscow's ongoing war in Ukraine. Hundreds of civilians were found buried in mass graves, others were tortured and executed in basements.
    


            Ukraine accuses Kim, who is not in custody, of criminal responsibility in 17 killings and four instances of ill-treatment by troops under his command in Bucha. Lawyers from Global Rights Compliance, assisting Ukrainian officials in evidence gathering, said the case against Kim is founded on witness testimonies, forensics, crime scene reconstructions, identity parades, maps and open source intelligence.
    


            Kim is also accused of ordering the bodies of victims to be burned to cover up the crimes.
    


            “The case highlights a methodical approach to war crimes committed by Russian forces, indicating that many atrocities in Bucha were part of a highly coordinated criminal plan that implicates Russian leadership,” Global Rights Compliance wrote in a statement.
    


            Ukraine has previously named soldiers and at least one commander it says is guilty of mass murder in Bucha.
    


            “We have moved beyond bringing low-ranking perpetrators to account — now we are uncovering the chain of command decisions through which ordinary orders turned into mass executions of civilians,” Maksym Tsutskiridze, First Deputy Head of the National Police of Ukraine wrote in a statement issued by the lawyers.
    


            The Kremlin has denied its troops killed civilians in Bucha and has accused Ukraine of creating fake images of civilian bodies in the town.
    


            CNN has approached the Russian government for comment.
    


This story has been updated to remove the line saying Kim was the first commander to be issued with a Notice of Suspicion.

RT India has unveiled a countrywide advertising campaign across out-of-home (OOH), digital, and print platforms ahead of the December launch of its English news channel in the South Asian country.

The campaign, celebrating the historic ties between Russia and India, is titled ‘A new voice from an old friend'.

The Moscow-based global TV news network's new channel is envisaged to cater specifically to the Indian audience.

The rollout spans key business, cultural, and diplomatic areas in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Chennai, as well as major airports and the print and online editions of leading newspapers.

The campaign across 65 prime locations and 190 digital screens and billboards reflects shared perspectives, milestones, and the long-standing spirit of friendship between the nations.

The EU Commission has prepared a plan for a “military Schengen” to facilitate the movement of troops and heavy equipment across the bloc in case of a stand-off with Russia. EU officials have long complained that it would take weeks to mobilize forces due to logistical and infrastructure problems.

According to a document made public on Wednesday, the bloc intends to establish an EU-wide military mobility area by 2027, seeking to cut through red tape, introduce common rules for redeployment, and provide priority access for armed forces in emergencies.

EU officials also aim to “upgrade key EU military mobility corridors to dual-use standards” and defend strategic infrastructure. According to Reuters, the idea is also to create a “solidarity pool” where EU members can choose to provide special military transport capabilities to states that don't have them.

This comes against the backdrop of long-standing logistical problems. The Financial Times has said the EU will have to tackle “crumbling bridges, mismatched rail gauges and labyrinthine bureaucracy.”

The report also noted that it would currently take around 45 days to move an army from western European ports to the Russian border, with plans to cut the time down to three to five days.

EU Transport Minister Apostolos Tzitzikostas has also warned that NATO tanks being redeployed could “get stuck in tunnels [and] cause bridges to collapse.” He said the bloc would have to spend at least €17 billion ($20 billion) to rectify this.

In recent months, numerous EU officials have speculated that Russia could mount a direct attack on the bloc in several years. Moscow has rejected these claims, dismissing them as “nonsense.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has also denounced the bloc's “militarization,” warning that increased defense expenditure is destroying the economies of member states.

Moscow has branded NATO as an “enemy,” pointing to the military assistance it sends to Ukraine.

US President Donald Trump has privately urged lawmakers to advance a bill that would put secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners, Senator Lindsey Graham has claimed.

The bill would allow Trump to impose a minimum 500% tariff on goods and services from any country that trades in Russian oil, uranium, gas, or related products. Graham, the bill's sponsor, has long unsuccessfully pushed to advance the measure, but earlier this week Trump signaled he would be “OK” with it if it passed.

Graham told reporters on Wednesday that Trump instructed Senate Majority Leader John Thune over the weekend to push the legislation forward.

“President Trump told Thune Sunday, when we were playing golf: move the bill,” Graham said, adding that within hours the White House sent him a statement saying it had “signed off on the bill.”

He said a call was scheduled later in the day with House and Senate members to discuss the measure, which he argued the US needs as “leverage” in talks with Russia on Ukraine.

Speaking to reporters, Thune called Graham's bill “an important tool” that could help bring about a peaceful resolution between Russia and Ukraine. He was unsure it could pass this year, however, noting the Senate's December agenda is already full.

Trump has increasingly pushed for sanctions on countries buying Russian oil in recent months, voicing frustration with the pace of talks between Moscow and Kiev. In August, he imposed a 25% tariff on Indian imports over New Delhi's continued oil trade with Russia and later warned China of similar measures. He has also urged NATO and EU states to raise tariffs on Russian trade partners to attempt to pressure Moscow into a ceasefire.

Russia has maintained it seeks a long-term, sustainable peace deal in the Ukraine conflict by addressing its root causes rather than accepting a temporary pause, which it views as a ploy to let Ukraine rebuild and rearm. Moscow has long condemned Western sanctions as politically motivated and illegal, warning they will eventually backfire.

NEW DELHI, November 20. /TASS/. Russia and India are working on the mutual deployment of ground stations for their navigation systems, Russia's GLONASS and India's NavIC, Russian Ambassador to New Delhi Denis Alipov said in an interview with TASS.

""Work is underway on the mutual parity placement of ground stations for collecting measurements of the Russian global navigation satellite system GLONASS and the Indian regional navigation satellite system NavIC,"" he said.

Cooperation in space research remains one of flagship areas of bilateral cooperation between the two countries, the diplomat said, adding that a close dialogue has been established in three major areas: manned space programs, including the Gaganyaan mission, propulsion engineering, and satellite navigation.

Speaking about other areas of scientific and technical cooperation between Russia and India, the ambassador noted the successful development of cooperation in biomedicine, physics, chemistry, healthcare, and materials science. ""We are seeing great interest from our Indian partners in advancing polar research. Quantum technologies occupy a special place in bilateral cooperation, with both countries having significant developments in this area,"" he said.

""More and more specialized scientific organizations and startups in Russia and India are showing interest in collaborating on artificial intelligence.

NEW DELHI, November 20. /TASS/. The Bank of Russia will soon open its representative office in India, Russian Ambassador to New Delhi Denis Alipov said in an interview with TASS.

""A representative office of the Bank of Russia will be opened soon, becoming the second one abroad after China,"" he said. According to the ambassador, ""the need to deepen the financial dialogue is driven by the active expansion of bilateral trade and economic relations"" between the two countries. ""Negative external factors contribute to the closer alignment of independent settlement mechanisms,"" he added.

Much has already been achieved along this path, the diplomat noted. ""Domestic banks have successfully adjusted to the freezing of accounts in the US and EU and disconnection from the SWIFT system. Indian banks have learned to minimize the risks of secondary sanctions. As a result, mutual settlements between Russia and India have become more secure and diversified,"" he said.

""In terms of direct settlements between our countries, the share of national currencies is approaching 95%. We have moved to a qualitatively new level of banking interaction based on national payment systems. There are no longer any so-called frozen payments,"" Alipov stated.

VTB and Sberbank maintain branches in India. Representative offices of VEB.RF and Gazprombank have also been established.

""The integration of payment systems, the Russian Financial Messaging Platform (SPFS) and the Indian Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS), is gradually developing. Projects for retail payments using QR codes are under development. We are continuing the dialogue on the integration of central bank digital currency platforms (CBDC).

Officials say proposal is aimed at stirring up division and disorientating Kyiv's allies

 Europe live – latest updates

A new US-Russian peace proposal to end the war in Ukraine has been dismissed as “absurd” and unacceptable by officials in Kyiv amid talks between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a high-ranking US army delegation.

They said the proposal reportedly drafted by Kirill Dmitriev, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, and Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff was a “provocation”, the aim of which was to stir up division and “disorientate” Ukraine's allies, they added.

“There are currently no signs that the Kremlin is ready for serious negotiations. Putin is trying to stall for time and avoid US sanctions,” said Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of Ukraine's foreign policy parliamentary committee. He dismissed Dmitriev as a “nobody”.

Ukraine's first deputy foreign minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, called the initiative unrealistic. He suggested it was a classic Soviet-style information operation to influence opinion and sow panic.

According to media reports, the sweeping 28-point proposal closely resembles demands made by Moscow soon after its full-scale invasion in early 2022. It was reportedly drawn up by Russian and US officials, with support from Donald Trump. Kyiv was not consulted. One European diplomat said they only learned of the plan when they turned on the news.

It envisages Ukraine giving up the northern part of the Donbas region, which it controls, to Russia, and cutting the size of its army in half. Ukraine would also be forced to relinquish its long-range weapons, used to strike military targets inside Russia.

No foreign troops would be allowed on Ukrainian soil, a condition that rules out a post-deal peacekeeping force led by the UK and France. But the US would provide unspecified security guarantees, according to Axios.

The Russian language and Russian Orthodox church would be given formal status under longstanding Kremlin demands.

Ukrainian officials said the document amounted to Ukraine's capitulation and an effective end to its sovereignty. It comes nearly four years after Russian troops tried, and failed, to seize Kyiv, and as efforts by the Trump administration to end the conflict remain stalled.

On Thursday, Zelenskyy met the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, whom Trump named last week as a “special representative”. Driscoll is on a fact-finding mission to Kyiv, with a brief to examine the war and Ukrainian drone production. It is unclear if the talks included the US's draft plan.

Keith Kellogg, Trump's special representative to Ukraine, has reportedly announced his resignation, saying he would leave in January after a year in the post. Kellogg is regarded as being broadly sympathetic to Ukraine and has been consequently left out of direct US-Russian talks.

The White House's renewed push to force Ukraine to make significant concessions in pursuit of “peace” comes at a difficult time for Zelenskyy, who is embroiled in the biggest political scandal since he became president in 2019.

His former business partner Timur Mindich and at least two government ministers are accused of involvement in a large-scale bribery scheme. Several deputies from Zelenskyy's own Servant of the People party have called on the president to dismiss Andriy Yermak, his powerful chief of staff.

One western diplomat said the Russians were seeking to take advantage of Ukraine's domestic crisis. “It seems Dmitriev has spun this plan at a time when Zelenskyy is weak. The Russians are good at exploiting things,” they said. “It feels like every other Russian plan. I don't think it's going to fly with Ukraine.”

The diplomat said the Kremlin's demands concerning the Russian language were a “hook” it could later exploit. The proposal did not offer the kind of security assurances Ukraine would need from the US and its European allies for any deal to stick, they added.

European leaders meeting in Brussels said they had not been warned in advance about the latest White House initiative. The Trump administration no longer provided direct military aid to Kyiv, a fact that reduced its ability to impose a Moscow-friendly peace settlement on Ukraine, one source noted.

“We commend peace efforts, but Europe is the main supporter of Ukraine and it's, of course, Europe's security that's at stake. So we expect to be consulted,” said Poland's foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski.

The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said Europe welcomed any efforts to achieve a long-lasting and just settlement of the war, but stressed: “For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.”

Kallas said the Dmitriev-Witkoff proposal did not envisage Russia making any concessions. “We have to understand that in this war, there is one aggressor and one victim. If Russia really wanted peace, it could have agreed to an unconditional ceasefire already some time ago.”

The British government said it backed Trump's desire to “bring this barbaric war to an end”. But it emphasised that “only the Ukrainian people can determine their future” and said Russia could end the fighting tomorrow by pulling out troops and ending its “illegal invasion”.

The White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, declined to comment on the peace plan. “I would agree that that's an issue which the president has continued to put at the forefront of our foreign policy goal, which is to reach a settlement in the Ukraine-Russia war, so that we can have peace in Europe and we can end the killing and the slaughter of so many innocents,” he said.

US efforts to broker peace have hit roadblocks since Trump met Putin in Alaska in August. The US president subsequently imposed sanctions on Russia's oil industry, in an apparent attempt to push Putin to the negotiating table.

Trump said last month that he was putting on hold his plan for a meeting with the Russian president in Budapest because he didn't want it to be a “waste of time”. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, met in Ankara, saying they were committed to finding a peaceful settlement.

In recent months Russia has increased its systematic attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, plunging much of the country into darkness. On Wednesday it bombed several western cities, including Ternopil, where 26 people, including three children, were killed in their homes.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Donald Trump and JD Vance reportedly not invited to the former vice-president's funeral; Clintons and Obamas notably absent from the event

Donald Trump and JD Vance snubbed for Dick Cheney's funeral

Several US dignitaries, including former presidents Joe Biden and George W Bush, are attending the funeral of Dick Cheney at the National Cathedral in Washington DC today.

The former vice-president died earlier this month at the age of 84. His daughter, former congresswoman Liz Cheney, will speak at today's service. As we noted earlier, Donald Trump and JD Vance were reportedly not invited to the funeral. However, all former living vice-presidents will be in attendance. This includes Mike Pence, who served as Trump's right hand during his first administration.

My colleague, David Smith, will be at the cathedral and providing updates.

In her eulogy, which appeared to carry subtle digs at Donald Trump – who was reportedly not invited to Dick Cheney's funeral, Liz Cheney spoke of her father's devotion to the US, which she called “deep and substantive.”

“He spent his life studying the history of our great republic. He knew you couldn't truly appreciate what it means to live in freedom if you didn't understand the sacrifices of the generations who came before, and he made sure that his children and grandchildren understood this too,” she said.

Cheney, who has previously condemened Trump over his involvement in the January 6 riots across Capitol Hill and has called him a “fascist,” went on to talk about memories from her father as he flew over Washington DC after becoming secretary of defense in 1989.

“He described departing from the Pentagon. ‘As my helicopter lifted off the Pentagon helipad, I could look across the river to the great monuments of Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, to the White House and the Capitol building where all the great decisions that have shaped 200 years of American history were made. And I could look directly out on Arlington national cemetery and remember what a terrible price 1000s of brave Americans have paid so that all of us could enjoy the blessings of liberty,'” Cheney said.

Cheney , a vocal critic of Trump's administrations, served as the Republican vice chair of the House January 6 special committee despite political peril which saw her ostracized from the Republican party. She has also said that Trump's “election fraud claims were false,” adding: “No president can defy the rule of law and act this way in a constitutional republic, period – comments that stand in stark contrast to her eulogy that hailed father's public service towards the US.

Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz Cheney, just delivered her eulogy.

“He wouldn't force his opinion on you or demand you do things his way. He might not share his opinion at all if he didn't ask. In fact, he was known to go long stretches of time without saying a single word,” said Liz Cheney.

“But if you watched closely, if you asked questions, you listened when he did speak, you had the experience of seeing the world opening up in front of you, of looking at things in new ways, of benefiting from his clarity of thought, his ability to crystallize what was important and what wasn't,” she continued.

Liz Cheney went on to say: “Though he was inspired to service by president [John F] Kennedy, Dick Cheney became a Republican, but he knew that bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans. For him, a choice between defense of the Constitution and defense of your political party was no choice at all.”

One of Cheney's seven grandchildren, Elizabeth Perry, just noted that the former vice-president “was tough with a kind heart”.

“Dick Cheney wasn't just my grandpa. He was my best friend, my hero, my role model, and the most influential person in my life,” said Perry, who is the daughter of former congresswoman Liz Cheney.

JD Vance, who is not attending Dick Cheney's funeral today, offered his condolences to the former vice-president's family.

“Obviously there are some political disagreements there, but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving,” Vance said, while speaking at an event hosted by the far-right news outlet, Breitbart.

Bush recalls that Cheney offered to step aside as vice-president in 2004, in case the 43rd president wanted to replace him.

“I thought about it for a while,” Bush said today. “But after four years of seeing how he treated people, how he carried responsibility, how he handled pressure and took the hits, I arrived back at the conclusion that they do not come any better than Dick Cheney.”

Bush noted that “in a profession that attracts talkers” Cheney was “a thinker and a listener”.

Speaking now, former president George W Bush remembers Dick Cheney – who served as his vice-president for his entire administration – as a “a stoical man”.

“As I quickly discovered in 2000, when you choose one Cheney, you get four,” Bush quipped of the close relationship his vice-president had with his wife, Lynne, and their two daughters, Liz and Mary. “His busy and purposeful life was an adventure they experienced together. In a family so close you dread the day when the circle is broken.”

Reiner added that Cheney showed “a genuine fortitude” in the face of “true mortal terror” that he faced while suffering with heart disease for most of his adult life.

We're now hearing from Dr Jonathan Reiner, Dick Cheney's cardiologist.

“I want to acknowledge the many doctors and nurses here with us today who took such magnificent care of the vice-president over a span of 27 years,” Reiner said. A reminder, that Cheney suffered from several heart attacks during his life, and ultimately died from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.

Cheney's casket is now being placed in front of the altar, and his family are taking their seats.

While there are several high-profile political figures at Dick Cheney's funeral today, notably absent are Bill and Hillary Clinton and Barack and Michelle Obama.

A spokesperson for Bill Clinton said that former president had an unavoidable scheduling conflict which prevented him from attending today's service.

Covered in the American flag, Cheney's casket was just carried into the National Cathedral by the military honor guard. Walking behind were members of his family, including his widow Lynne and elder daughter Liz Cheney.

In the first row at Dick Cheney's funeral, former vice-president Kamala Harris and her predecessor, Mike Pence, sit next to each other.

We're expecting former president George W Bush, who Cheney served as vice-president, to deliver a speech today.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

As the veteran actor turns 100 he reveals that he was approached to play the British spy in the 60s, but realised his accent wouldn't have been up to scratch

For more than six decades, the actor Dick Van Dyke has been pilloried for his attempts at a British accent in Mary Poppins (1964). Now, the actor who has since apologised for the “most atrocious cockney accent in the history of cinema” as chimney sweep Bert in the Disney classic has revealed he was in the running to play another UK icon on screen: James Bond.

Speaking on the Today TV programme in the US, Van Dyke, who turns 100 next month, said that Bond producer Albert Broccoli approached him after his performance in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in 1968 to ask if he fancied being a successor to Sean Connery.

“Would you like to be Bond?” Van Dyke recalls Broccoli saying, to which he replied: “Have you heard my British accent?”

In press since, Van Dyke has credited his notoriously inaccurate attempt in Mary Poppins to an Irish dialect coach, while also suggesting that cast and crew, including Julie Andrews, should have flagged with him any shortcomings.

Van Dyke continued by saying that he is still actively seeking acting work, saying: “I don't want to [retire], I mean, it's my life. I love it.”

The star, who won three Emmys for The Dick Van Dyke Show, as well as a Tony award for Bye Bye Birdie, is promoting a new book, 100 Rules for Living to 100: An Optimist's Guide to a Happy Life.

The star is a famously garrulous chatshow guest. In 2010, then 84, he recalled how he was rescued from drowning by porpoises who pushed his surfboard back to shore after he nodded off on the waves.

Three years later, he was rescued from a burning car on the California freeway, and in 2023 came another close call, when he lost control of his Lexus in rainy weather and crashed into a gate.

The actor who will become the next cinema Bond is still to be announced, after Daniel Craig's departure and rights to the franchise being handed over to Amazon.

Although Scottish, Irish and Australian stars have taken on the role, no American since Van Dyke is thought to have been in contention. Should he again fail to secure the role, Callum Turner, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Theo James are believed to be the frontrunners.

 This article was amended on 20 November 2025. An earlier version said Dick Van Dyke was approached to play James Bond in the franchise's first film; in fact, Van Dyke was asked about replacing Sean Connery in the role. Also, Julie Andrews was incorrectly described as being “London-born”. This has been removed.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

As many of the world's leaders convene in South Africa for the G20, we face a sobering truth: Progress for women, children and adolescents — the foundation of human development — is faltering. Decades of hard-won gains in survival, education and equality are at risk. In too many countries, maternal and child deaths are rising, conflicts are eroding health systems, and climate and economic shocks are widening inequalities.

This is not acceptable. Women and children's well-being is not a secondary issue to be revisited once geopolitical crises subside. It is central to peace, stability and prosperity. No nation can achieve sustainable development, nor ensure its own security, while half its population is denied health, safety and opportunity.

Healthy women and children are a key measure of national welfare. Yet more than 5 million women and children die every year during pregnancy, childbirth or shortly thereafter, most from preventable causes. Nearly 250 million children younger than 5 (one in three) are at risk of not reaching their full potential because of malnutrition, disease and lack of early learning opportunities.

These statistics hide painful human realities. Even now a woman somewhere in the world still bleeds to death while giving birth, often because a clinic lacks basic supplies or skilled care. Meanwhile, we witness unprecedented advances in wealth and technology, yet the benefits remain unevenly shared. These contrasts reveal a profound moral failure in our priorities.

When health systems fail women and children, societies suffer long after the immediate crisis fades. Studies show that every US$1 invested in maternal, newborn and child health yields up to US$20 in economic and social returns. By contrast, neglecting these investments undermines labor markets, productivity and social cohesion.

We cannot speak of progress for women and children without addressing their sexual and reproductive well-being. Each year about 21 million adolescent girls become pregnant and 12 million give birth. This is often due to early marriage or lack of access to essential health information and services. Many still face barriers to voluntary family planning and basic maternal care, putting their health and futures at risk. Supporting adolescent girls with education, information and access to quality healthcare is one of the smartest investments any society can make.

Women's, children's and adolescents' health is not only a development issue, it is a moral and strategic imperative. It is rooted in the universal right to health and dignity, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed in the UN Sustainable Development Goals, but human rights commitments mean little without resources, accountability and political will. The rate of reduction in mortality has decreased since 2015, and in some countries maternal deaths are rising. Importantly, 64 percent of preventable maternal and child deaths occur in conflict and fragile settings. Each loss is both a personal tragedy and a sign of collective failure.

The link between peace and women's welfare has been well established. Countries with greater gender equality are less likely to go to war, more resilient to conflict and more stable. When women participate meaningfully in peace processes, the probability of an agreement lasting at least two years increases by 20 percent, and the prospect of lasting 15 years by 35 percent.

The G20 is meeting at a time of deep geopolitical tension, amid wars, climate catastrophes and economic uncertainty. Global solidarity is under strain and development assistance is facing renewed pressures. Yet this is precisely when leadership matters most. Investing in women and children is not charity, it is strategy. It builds human capital, strengthens economies and stabilizes societies. A strong global economy depends on strong families, and strong families depend on healthy women and children.

Consider the demographic reality: A majority of the world's population lives in low and middle-income countries, where most maternal and child deaths occur. If these nations cannot protect and educate their young people, the consequences would be global. This manifests itself as lost productivity, migration pressures and insecurity.

The G20, which represents 80 percent of the global economy, holds the power to reverse this dangerous drift. We urge G20 leaders to make women's, children's and adolescents' health a central pillar of global recovery and security. This requires three urgent steps:

RECOMMIT TO GLOBAL TARGETS

The world is on track to miss the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. G20 nations must reaffirm their commitment to reducing maternal and child mortality, ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health, and protecting adolescent health and rights.

PROTECT AND EXPAND FINANCING

Despite economic pressures, investment in primary healthcare and community health workers remains one of the highest-return interventions available. Diversified financing mechanisms can help sustain progress.

INTEGRATE WOMEN'S, CHILDREN'S AND ADOLESCENTS' HEALTH INTO PEACE AND SECURITY AGENDAS

Humanitarian aid, efforts to build peace and global security strategies must explicitly prioritize women and children, not as passive victims, but as agents of recovery and resilience.

On the margins of the 80th UN General Assembly, the Global Leaders' Network for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health reaffirmed the urgency of placing women, children and young people at the center of global health and development agendas. As global citizens, we must lead by example, championing investment, accountability and action.

The faltering progress is not inevitable. It is the result of choices. We can choose to turn away, distracted by crises and competition, or we can choose to lead, placing human well-being at the center of decisionmaking. As the G20 deliberates on growth, finance and security, it must remember a simple truth: Nations cannot succeed when mothers die of preventable causes giving birth and children go hungry.

The test of leadership today is in action, not rhetoric. Let this G20 be remembered as the moment the world renewed its commitment to those who make life possible and to the future they represent.

While the law says that foreign agents can be sentenced to death, people who are convicted of spying for Beijing often serve less than nine months in prison because Taiwan does not formally recognize China as a foreign nation, Institute for National Defense and Security Research fellow Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲) said.
Many officials and military personnel sell information to China believing it to be of little value, unaware that

However, due to almost a century of language repression policies, many Taiwanese believe that Tai-gi is at risk of disappearing. To understand this crisis, I interviewed academics and activists about Taiwan's history of language repression, the major challenges of revitalizing Tai-gi and their policy recommendations.
Although Taiwanese were pressured to speak Japanese when Taiwan became a Japanese colony in 1895, most managed to keep their heritage languages alive in their homes.

And it is essential to Taiwan's existence. Apocryphally, it can be traced as far back as Suetonius (蘇埃托尼烏斯) in late first-century Rome. Alas, Suetonius was only talking about ducks (anas).

The government is set to raise fees for residence procedures for foreign nationals to levels comparable to those in Europe and the United States in the next fiscal year, according to government and ruling party sources.

It intends to submit a bill to amend the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Law to the regular Diet session next year. Revenue from the fee increase will fund policy initiatives related to foreigners, including to improve conditions for the rapidly growing foreign resident population and to deport illegal residents.

The government is considering including the following statement in its soon-to-be-drafted economic package: “In fiscal 2026, we will review and raise fees related to foreign residents and visa fees, taking into account the levels in major countries.”

Residence permit fees were raised by ¥2,000 in April this year, setting them at ¥6,000 for changing residence status and renewing stays and ¥10,000 for those applying for permanent residence. This reflects rising prices and labor costs.

The government is considering a plan that would raise fees for changing residence status and renewing stays of one year or longer to somewhere between ¥30,000 and ¥40,000, and that would increase the cost for a permanent residency permit to ¥100,000 or more. As the law currently sets a maximum fee of ¥10,000, an amendment will be required. This would be the first legal revision to increase the fees since 1981.

Fees in Western countries are higher than in Japan. In the United States, changing or renewing one's work permit costs $420 to $470 (about ¥65,000 to ¥73,000), and in Britain it costs £827 (about ¥169,000). In Germany, changing or renewing one's residence permit costs €93 to €98 (about ¥16,000 to ¥17,000).

In June, Japan's foreign resident population stood at a record high of about 3.96 million people, according to the Immigration Services Agency. The government aims to use the revenue from higher fees to improve conditions for foreign residents, such as by speeding up immigration screening and enhancing Japanese language education. Measures to deal with the roughly 70,000 illegal residents will also be strengthened.

Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry plans to raise fees for visas to levels comparable to Europe and the United States in the next fiscal year. If implemented, this would be the first increase since 1978. The government is expected to allocate the revenue to countering overtourism, among other measures.

A single-entry visa currently costs ¥3,000, and a multiple-entry visa runs at ¥6,000. For comparison, short-stay visas cost $185 (about ¥28,000) in the United States and £127 (about ¥25,000) in Britain. The ministry will reference these figures in determining how much to raise the fees.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

An oil refinery was hit in Ryazan Oblast overnight on Nov. 20, Robert ""Madyar"" Brovdi, commander of Ukraine's Drone Systems Forces confirmed on Nov. 20.

According to Brovdi, 1st Separate Center for Unmanned Systems ""Magyar's Birds"" hit the Ryazan oil refinery overnight. It sold 13 million tons of fuel last year.

""Gasoline is now gradually becoming a scarce commodity in Russia, while gas and oil are quickly running out,"" Brovdi said

Local authorities have not reported damage to the Ryazan oil refinery, but have confirmed that a drone attack took place overnight.

""Last night, air defense and electronic warfare destroyed drones over the territory of the Ryazan Oblast. Due to falling debris, a fire broke out on the territory of one enterprise,"" Governor Pavel Malkov claimed.

Ukraine regularly launches strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia and occupied territories as Moscow continues to wage its war.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the reports.

Ryazan, the region's capital, is located 180 kilometers (120 miles) southeast of Moscow and about 450 kilometers (280 miles) from Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia along Sumy Oblast.

Russia's oil and gas production has continued to come under attack as Kyiv attempts to cripple Moscow's primary source of funding for its war in Ukraine.

Ukraine's General Staff reported on Nov. 16 that Ukrainian forces struck the Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery in Russia's Samara Oblast and a drone storage site belonging to Russia's elite Rubikon unit.

During a joint press conference with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Nov. 19, Merz said that Germany is ""doing everything possible"" to equip Ukrainian army with long-range weapon systems.



An oil refinery was reportedly hit in Ryazan Oblast overnight on Nov. 20, local residents claimed.

Late on Nov. 19, Italy's Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling in favor of extraditing the suspect, Serhii Kuznetsov. 

The Russian attack on Ternopil killed at least 26 people, including three children, and injured 93 others, among them 18 children, according to Ukraine's Emergency Service.



According to Healey, the ship had entered U.K. waters for the second time this year during the last few weeks and was located north of Scotland.



Kellogg's exit will leave Ukraine without its chief advocate in the Trump White House as the country faces escalating Russian attacks and a domestic corruption crisis. 

The White House has ""signed off on the bill"" to impose secondary sanctions on Russian trading partners, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham said on Nov. 19.

Rescue operations are still underway as authorities search for 26 people believed to be trapped under the rubble of a destroyed apartment building in Ternopil, western Ukraine.

U.S. President Donald Trump is mounting yet another push to end Russia's war against Ukraine, as Washington begins testing a new peace framework that has already sparked unease among Ukrainian officials. 

A source in the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent that a new peace plan is being crafted by U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, who's been in direct contact with Kirill Dmitriev, Russia's senior economic negotiator.

An Axios source in the Trump administration confirmed that the U.S. is already briefing representatives from Ukraine and Europe on the plan.

Washington has signaled that Ukraine is expected to accept a framework for ending the war that would require Kyiv to give up territory and relinquish certain weapons systems. 

The reported proposals also include reducing Ukraine's army, among other concessions.

A source in the President's Office was decidedly unenthusiastic about the possible plan when speaking to the Kyiv Independent, adding that Washington appears to be shifting toward a framework aligned with Moscow's demands.

During previous rounds of talks, the Kremlin had softened some of its maximalist demands, limiting its focus to territorial concessions from Ukraine. 

The demands previously dropped, however, seem to be resurfacing.

A Kyiv Independent source familiar with the U.S. proposal said the Kremlin has hardened its maximalist conditions, sensing Ukraine's worsening position on the front lines and exploiting the fallout from a major corruption scandal involving people close to President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Zelensky on Nov. 18 announced he would travel to Turkey to ""reinvigorate negotiations"" with Russia, signaling renewed attempts to engage multiple channels.

Speaking the same day, Trump made it clear that he still hopes to stop the war in Ukraine, despite nearly 10 months of mediation yielding no tangible results.

""I've stopped eight wars,"" the U.S. president said. ""I have another one to go with (Vladimir) Putin. I'm a little surprised at Putin. It's taken longer than I thought.""

Against the backdrop of the talks ongoing at the political level, a parallel military-led peace track now appears to be also taking shape.

The Kyiv Independent has learned that a military-led delegation will report findings back to the White House after getting a firsthand look at the reality in Ukraine. The delegation is then expected to travel to Moscow to hold talks with Russian officials.

The last direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow took place nearly four months ago.

The fundamental positions of both sides remain unchanged.

Kyiv, backed by European governments, is pushing for a ceasefire along the existing front line. Moscow continues to insist on Ukraine ceding eastern Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

Asked about recent diplomatic activity, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Nov. 19 that nothing has changed since Putin and Trump met earlier in Alaska.

""No, there are no developments to report at this time,"" Peskov said.

Following his trip to Turkey, Zelensky said in a post on X that ""only President Trump and the U.S. have sufficient strength for the war to finally end,"" adding that Ukraine has supported ""every strong and fair proposal to end this war"" in recent months.

Zelensky welcomed Turkey's willingness to engage in diplomatic efforts and noted Kyiv is ""ready to work in any other meaningful formats that can yield results.""

The main way to stop ""the bloodshed and achieve a lasting peace"" is for Ukraine to work with its allies and for U.S. leadership ""to remain effective, strong, and to bring about a peace that will last long and provide security,"" he said.

As a foreigner in Ukraine, I often hesitate to speak on certain social issues. Despite living here for nearly a decade, I know that my American upbringing still limits how deeply I can feel what my Ukrainian friends and colleagues experience, no matter how much I sympathize.

Still, now that I have given birth to a Ukrainian citizen, I feel I have the right to say at least this: I will never allow my child to believe there isn't a difference between speaking Ukrainian and Russian.

Recently, I was among those disturbed to read about a survey conducted by the State Service for Education Quality, which found that almost a quarter of teachers in Kyiv speak Russian during lessons, and another 40% do so during breaks. Sixty-six percent of schoolchildren said that they don't speak Ukrainian during lessons, and 82% during breaks.

Only 18% of Ukrainian students in Ukraine's capital city, the very heart of the country, said that they exclusively speak Ukrainian.

Language has become one of the most charged topics of this war. Some insist it should remain above politics, and that Russian, like English, Spanish, or French, belongs to the world, not to the Kremlin. They say it would be unjust to tie a language to the violence carried out in its name.

As someone shaped by an education in the humanities, I always tried to hold the world in balance. But that became nearly impossible the night I took my sleeping daughter in my arms and rushed into a basement in Chernivtsi, as air defenses roared above, shooting down Russian drones and missiles.

I remember praying she wouldn't wake during the attack — not because of the noise, but because I no longer knew what words could comfort a small child in a world where such nights can become the new normal. By morning, each word of Russian I heard spoken on the street cut me like small yet deadly acts of betrayal.

If we remain within the realm of the humanities, it is the teachers — the custodians of language, history, and memory — who are among the first to be hunted when Russian forces arrive in Ukrainian cities. In a Russian-occupied city, the very act of speaking Ukrainian no longer belongs to the realm of everyday life. Ukrainian children are taught how to ""be Russian,"" many even trained to become the soldiers of Russia's future wars.

I can no longer see the Russian language as neutral during the full-scale war in this climate of constant threat. It is a weapon of soft power, an advance guard of influence that moves in long before their tanks.

Ukrainian parents who shrug and say, ""What difference does it make?"" when they speak Russian at home, believing that school will provide enough Ukrainian, do not realize the lessons they are imparting to their children. They teach, whether intentional or not, that Russian is the language of home.


I feel compelled to speak directly to every parent raising a Ukrainian child: please, speak with them in Ukrainian!
    

And so their children will inevitably be drawn to Russian books, films, and songs, each carrying that faint resonance of home. Over time, the question ""What difference does it make?"" loops in their minds like an incantation, until the true aim of Russia's war of erasure — the obliteration of Ukrainian language, memory, and identity — slips beyond their understanding.

I understand that languages are not easy for everyone to master — and that struggle only grows with age. Yet as a foreigner who began learning Ukrainian later in life, and who continues to deepen her grasp of it every day, I feel compelled to speak directly to every parent raising a Ukrainian child: please, speak with them in Ukrainian!

Even if the words feel awkward on your tongue, at least make speaking Ukrainian become natural to your kids. My own husband was born under Soviet rule in Ukraine, his family Russified over generations. And yet, despite it feeling more ""natural"" for them to speak Russian, he and his relatives only speak to our daughter in Ukrainian.

I know this will become more complicated once she starts school. She'll meet and inevitably make friends with children whose families didn't prioritize this language choice, and Russian words may slip into her speech. But as my friends with older kids say, you just have to gently remind them of the proper word to use.

In wartime Ukraine, a parent's duty is to avoid turning Russian into some forbidden fruit that can become the source of a child's rebellion once they get older. Instead, they must surround their children with the beauty of Ukrainian — the language their own and previous generations had to reclaim after Russia tried to deprive them of it.

Someday, Russian may lose the harsh, threatening edge it now carries, much as the German language once did after the world associated it with Nazi crimes. That reckoning will come much later through the work of those from Russia searching for the remnants of a culture. It will come through those who support the Ukrainian military's total Russian defeat, so that one day, perhaps, a democratic Russia has a chance to exist.

And once that day comes, perhaps my daughter — or my future grandchildren — will choose to learn Russian for one reason or another. There are practical reasons in the realm of work, after all: the future members of civic society advocating for sanctions or intelligence officers protecting this country need to understand how Russia operates.

It would be their choice to learn Russian, and I wouldn't be able to stop them from doing so. But let it come only after a life steeped in the richness of Ukrainian language and culture, after a life in which they have seen, felt, and understood the clear, unshakable difference between what it means to be Ukrainian and what it means to be Russian.

Today, that data extraction goes further: Instead of information being used to “target” ads, increasingly, it is used to train proprietary AI models by default. 

The open web is being incrementally enclosed behind opaque AI training loops. Now, if you want your website to appear in Google's search results, you have to allow Google's crawler to index it. Historically, that was a pretty fair trade, as indexing brought visibility. But now, Google says that anything indexed for search can also be used to train its generative AI models. Decline the AI crawler, and your site effectively disappears from search. Publishers, authors and creators are being held hostage.

These are old-school market structure problems. Economically, this behaviour resembles tying – a practice where access to one product is conditional on accepting another. When a dominant platform can tie essential services to compulsory data extraction, it undermines competition and erodes user agency. 

This extractive scenario is increasingly common. Soundcloud updated their terms last year to allow content uploaded on the site to be used as training data for AI. Zoom's terms give the company broad rights to use “service-generated data” – such as usage patterns and behavioural metrics – to train its AI models, even if users decline to share their actual meeting content. 

While Zoom insists it won't use video, audio or chat transcripts without explicit consent, simply using the platform still allows certain data to feed into its algorithmic systems. 

Similarly, Anthropic has recently announced that the consumer version of its AI assistant, Claude, will use chats and coding sessions to train models unless the user opts out. LinkedIn just updated its terms to state that it can use member data in many jurisdictions to train content-generating AI models. While you can opt out, all data collected from the years prior remain in training data sets. Reddit is licensing major deals to allow external use of its content for AI training, capitalizing on the information that Redditors freely contribute. 

Just 2% of Canadian businesses got return on generative AI investments, survey shows

Canadian regulators don't seem alive to these abuses, but other jurisdictions are. In the United States and the European Union, digital businesses have taken legal action against Google, citing its coercive collection of data from websites to generate its AI overviews. 

Chegg, an online education platform, sued Google for using its website content to train its generative AI models. The lawsuit highlights that Google's use of website content beyond indexing is “reciprocal dealing,” a form of tied selling and an unlawful leveraging of Google's monopoly powers. 

In Europe, the Independent Publishers Alliance submitted a complaint to the European Commission that Google is abusing its dominant position in online search by appropriating web content to generate its AI overviews. In Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority has opened a strategic market status investigation into Google search, a move that could compel the company to separate its search business from its AI training operations.

That would be a tectonic shift, re-establishing a line between indexing for visibility and harvesting for model training.

Canada should do the same. Our privacy law already requires that consent be voluntary and appropriate. Our Competition Bureau has the authority to examine when bundling consent for multiple uses becomes anti-competitive or unconscionable. Enforcing that line would send a powerful signal: that Canada is a fair place for AI markets.

Doing so could create a powerful competitive advantage. Cloudflare's chief executive suggested that we imagine Canada as the “Delaware of the internet” – a jurisdiction where data relationships are governed by fairness and transparency. If we required search engines to decouple from AI training, publishers worldwide might route their servers through Canada to avoid the coercive extraction of their content. It would give authors the leverage they currently lack.

The last time Canada tried to challenge Big Tech's extraction logic through the Online News Act, Meta retaliated by blocking news entirely. But that shouldn't stop us from acting again, this time on firmer ground: competition and consent. 

Canada has the opportunity to define the terms of a more open and trustworthy digital economy. There's no better time to reject extractive consent models from American Big Tech companies that use our participation as raw material for their profit.

Hamrah rages against the dying of Hollywood's light","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/culture/film-and-tv/film/article-as-hamrah-film-critic-hollywood-new-books/","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

A.S. Hamrah is a writer and resident film critic for the New York-based n+1 literary magazine.Supplied

It is deceptively easy to label A.S. Hamrah a doomsayer. 

Flipping through Last Week in End Times Cinema, one of the two new books coming out this season from the acclaimed writer and resident film critic for the New York-based n+1 literary magazine, you get the sense that Hamrah is acutely attuned to the very worst instincts of modern Hollywood. Written in diary fashion, Last Week collects one example after another of the contemporary film industry's self-imposed injuries, from its disastrous love affair with AI to the ongoing hubris of Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav (whose cocky, sunglasses-clad mug adorns the book's cover). 

Yet speaking with Hamrah the other week as he promotes both Last Week and Algorithm of the Night, his deeply satisfying and frequently hilarious collection of n+1 writing from 2019 to 2025, it becomes clear that the critic isn't a cynical fatalist so much as a till-death-do-we-part champion of movie-going, a true cinephile whose unerring and cutting criticism makes the cultural world feel less empty and doomed than it may appear. 

Ahead of the publication of both Last Week in End Times Cinema and Algorithm of the Night, The Globe and Mail spoke with Hamrah about the state of the seventh art.

Supplied

Both of these books strike me as some of the most depressing things I've ever read, but in an invigorating and almost existentially hopeful way. This is all stuff I've been feeling in the air, but collected into two concise collections of writing. The diary-like form of Last Week had a particularly cumulative effect on me. 

It started in March of 2024, when I was reading the news and there were four ridiculous things that caught my eye. So I posted them on my Instagram stories, just examples of the stupidity of what's going on in the film industry right now, and my followers seemed to like it. That turned into a newsletter, and before you know it I had 1,000 subscribers, and now a book. It can get a little depressing, especially when we get to the L.A. wildfires, the death of David Lynch. 

Books we're reading and loving in November

And you're always careful to check in with Warner's David Zaslav about whatever ridiculous thing he's up to. 

And Bob Iger at Disney, Tony Vinciquerra at Sony, all the studio heads say absolutely absurd things and spin half-truths and obfuscations about their bad products. 

It's an interesting time to be talking about Zaslav, especially as we're in the midst of Warner Bros. being either swallowed up by another studio, maybe disappearing altogether into Netflix's catalogue. How close to the bone are you cutting by using “End Times” in the title? 

There's something particularly depressing about the potential Warner Bros. sale. When Disney bought Fox a while ago, for some reason that didn't register as very depressing, though it was. But with Zaslav you get the sense that he's this kind of villainous character, who maybe his plan all along was to lead to some kind of consolidation that's going to lead to a worse product that costs more money for the moviegoer. All this stuff should be much more regulated than it is. 

When you published your previous book of collected essays in 2018, The Earth Dies Streaming, you described the times as “very bleak,” yet they only feel bleaker now. How do you reconcile that mood with your work as a critic, trying to make sense of the art that is put out into the world at such a tremulous time? 

The landscape that I described back then has gotten worse, yes. But at the same time, because it's gotten worse, the year after my book came out, 2019, now appears as a somewhat golden age for cinema. The pandemic of course was a real opportunity for studios to make a fundamental change in their business regarding streaming, and I feel it was a kind of gleeful moment because they could really envision the end of theatrical exhibition, which they don't like because they can't really control it to the extent that they wish they did. In the first book, I was talking about a world in which streaming was going to take over the world. Now, they've moved on and want to do away with the cinema altogether by turning it into a fully automated assembly line using, at every step in the process, with artificial intelligence, with as few humans involved as possible. But the question was about how do I continue working as a critic, yeah?

Supplied

Well, yes. In the face of such opposing forces and the ever-increasing sense of dread. 

So many people who write about films have turned to writing about older films now, classic Hollywood, avant-garde films. But I think it's the obligation of the critic to write about the films of their time, and I'm very dedicated to doing that. And it doesn't bother me at all that that's the subject matter presented to me. There are very good films made all over the world. And any kind of films made independently will move the cinema forward going into the future. But the health of the film industry in America? It's not an important component of the cinema in general. I feel it's important to document that as a critic.

A new wave of literary satire tackles the sociopolitical issues of our time with sharp wit

And most criticism today doesn't do that, so much. It can be more service-oriented, in a way ... 

It's just responding to films on a case-by-case basis, pretending that there are no problems in the industry. I don't like to do that. I try to do a kind of anti-Rotten Tomatoes style of criticism. ... This extends not only to daily newspapers but to major market magazines. Vanity Fair just got rid of their film critic. There's a giant feeling of, “Who cares?” I'm able to do this because of n+1, because they're the opposite of that kind of thinking. But I also keep my overhead very low. I've made a lot of personal sacrifices. Being an independent critic is important. Being fully a critic is also important. I'm not an academic. I don't have a job at an arts institution, I'm not programming. This is what I do. I'm just a writer. And if you're committed, you have to roll with the punches.

Some 52 Afghans are flying from Pakistan, where their resettlement applications were approved. Meanwhile, Germany has pledged €1 billion to Brazil's rainforest fund. Follow DW for the latest.

Another group of Afghan nationals whose resettlement in Germany has been approved are due to land in the country today, Germany's news agency DPA has reported.

This would be the sixth group of Afghans to arrive in the country since Chancellor Friedrich Merz's coalition came to power in May.

Meanwhile at the COP30, Germany pledged €1 billion ($1.15 billion) over the next decade to Brazil's new global rainforest fund.

Here are the latest headlines and analyses covering issues from and about Germany on Thursday, November 20:

New figures from the German government's statistics agency, Destatis, say that more than 48,700 were lost year-on-year in the German car industry by the end of the third quarter of 2025.

That equates to a dip of roughly 6.3% of the total workforce. The figures are broadly similar to those from a study by EY (or Ernst&Young) earlier this year using data from the end of Q2.

The agency recorded 721,400 employees in the car industry as of the end of September. It said this was its lowest tally on record since the 2nd quarter of 2011, when it had stood at 718,000. 

Nevertheless, the sector remained the second-largest industrial employer in Germany, after machine building (with 934,200 workers).

Industrial jobs figures dipped overall by 2.2% over the past year, but the car sector was well past the trend line.

The Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg opened on Thursday after a man drove a car into a crowd there last year, killing six and injuring hundreds.

At one entrance, flowers and candles circled a series of plaques honoring those killed. 

Various security measures have been implemented, such as barriers and other obstacles trying to ensure that vehicles cannot access the pedestrianized area. 

There was no grand ceremony at 11:00 a.m., with a quiet chime from a nearby church bell ushering in the ""silent opening."" The event only received a definitive go-ahead earlier this week. 

The reopening comes as the trial of the 51-year-old Saudi national accused of conducting the attack continues nearby. The defendant, who does not dispute being behind the wheel, is a dentist who was known to authorities as a vehement online critic of both Saudi Arabia's theocratic governance and Germany's recent migration policy and its institutions.

A similar attack on Berlin's Breitscheidplatz in 2016 where a man drove a truck into a crowd killed 11 people.

In 2018, a man with a gun and a knife killed five people at the Christmas market in the Franco-German border city of Strasbourg. 

Heavy goods vehicle and bus manufacturer MAN plans to cut 2,300 jobs over the next 10 years, without resorting to layoffs, the company announced on Thursday. 

The company aims to achieve the cuts by not replacing people who retire or leave, a spokesman said. 

MAN needed to ""adjust to the continually weakening truck market in Germany and further improve its costs position,"" the company said when announcing the cuts. 

According to the company, MAN's Munich headquarters is set to absorb 1,300 job cuts, with another 600 planned in Salzgitter in Lower Saxony, and 400 in Nuremberg, also in Bavaria.

As compensation, MAN said it also wanted to provide job security guarantees and to pledge to keep all its German manufacturing sites open until 2035.

However, the IG Metall trade union said it predicted more extensive cutbacks than MAN announced on Thursday, anticipating the loss of up to 2,000 jobs in Munich and another 500 in Nuremberg. It attributed these figures in part to plans to relocate some production to Poland, the base of Traton, MAN's parent company since the finalization of a merger in 2021.

The German Weather Service is warning citizens of wet snow showers in various parts of the country, as winter starts to take hold.

Wet snowfall is forecast in low-lying areas, with snow showers expected at the Upper Rhine, the Alps and the Baltic Sea areas.

In the Black Forest, snow is forecast to reach up to 20 centimeters.

The German Weather Service has also warned of slippery conditions, especially in the early hours of the morning.

The majority of femicide cases in Germany take place at the hands of the intimate partners of the women and girl victims, a study has revealed.

The study was presented by the University of Tübingen on Thursday, looking at cases across five German states in 2017.

Of the 292 cases of femicide or attempted femicide the study analysed, 197 would be classified as femicide, which is defined as the killing of women and girls due to their gender.

The most common type of femicide (108 out of 133 murders in total, or 81%) is linked to intimate partners, as per the study findings. Those cases involved killings by men in heterosexual relationships.

The majority of the cases shared similar motives; separation, infidelity, or a fear of either.

A 21-year-old Syrian refugee is now on trial for a knife attack at the German capital's Holocaust Memorial in February which left a Spanish tourist with life-threatening injuries.

The defendant is believed to have travelled all the way from the eastern state of Saxony, where he lived, to carry out the attack. The motive is believed to be radical Islamism and antisemitism in the name of the Islamic State group, according to German authorities. 

The Berlin Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe commemorates the 6 million Jewish people killed during the Holocaust.

The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office has charged the defendant with attempted murder, grievous bodily harm and attempted membership of a foreign terrorist organization.

Germany's top diplomat has stressed that any initiatives for peace negotiations in Ukraine must involve the country itself as well as Europe.

""All negotiations regarding a ceasefire, and indeed any further peaceful development in Ukraine, can only be discussed and negotiated with Ukraine,"" German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said ahead of a foreign affairs council meeting in Brussels, adding that ""Europe will have to be involved.""

News reports emerged on Wednesday suggesting that the US was drafting a new peace plan for Ukraine amid consultation with Russia, with NBC News later reporting that US President Donald Trump has already approved the 28-point peace plan.

No details of the plan are formally available, but some media reports suggest it would require Kyiv to give up some land currently controlled by Russian forces and make dramatic cuts to its military.

On November 20, 1945, the Allied Powers put high-ranking Nazis on trial before an international military tribunal in Nuremberg.

Twelve were sentenced to death. In 2020, witnesses told DW what they remembered about the trials.

The family of one of the victims of the 2020 far-right shooting incident in Hanau are filing a constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe, as they attempt to bring to justice those they believe can be held responsible for the tragic incident, according to the Tagesschau.

On February 19, 2020, a gunman motivated by far-right, racist beliefs went on a murderous rampage in Hanau, a German city near Frankfurt. He targeted places associated with immigrant communities, shooting nine people dead and wounding seven more. Afterward, he turned his gun on his mother and himself.

The perpetrator died before he could be criminally tried or even investigated.

Hamza Kurtovic, then 22, was among those killed at the Arena bar in Hanau.

His family argues that despite the death of the shooter, criminal proceedings should be brought against the authorities and the owner of the bar for failing to stop the shooting spree.

Kurtovic's family is mostly focused on the issue that the bar's emergency exit was locked at the time of the shooting, stripping the victims of their chance of escape.

The family, which has been trying to no avail to bring this issue to court for years, argues that the bar owner constantly kept the emergency exit locked on police orders. Hanau police would regularly carry out raids at the bar, and keeping the emergency exit locked, the family argues, prevented escapes amid the raid.

Previous investigation into the issue, including by the Hanau public prosecutor's office and the Hesse attorney general's office, concluded that there was no evidence that the victims would have been able to escape had the emergency door been unlocked.

After World War II, the Allies brought the Nazis to trial.

For the first time, representatives of a state had to answer for their crimes before an international tribunal.  

On the 80th anniversary of the Nuremberg Trials, DW looks at how the trials started and how the process of trying Nazis has progressed throughout the years.

Germany has committed to contributing €1 billion ($1.15 billion) over the next decade to Brazil's new global rainforest fund.

Brazilian Environment Minister Marina Silva announced on Wednesday at the UN Climate Change Conference in Belem.

The substantial support from Berlin will go to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF).

It is a mechanism designed to reward countries for preserving their rainforests and to penalize those that increase deforestation, based on satellite monitoring.

The pledge comes after German Chancellor Friedrich Merz caused controversy in Brazil with what were seen as disparaging comments made after a brief stop in Belem.

After his return from Brazil, Merz attended a trade conference in Berlin, where he compared Germany to Brazil saying he asked some journalists traveling with him whether they wanted to stay in Brazil, to which they said no.

Some observers in Germany believe that with this comparison, he meant to suggest that Germany has first-world problems which pale in comparison to the world's poorest places.

A group of Afghan nationals have taken off from Islamabad, Pakistan and are due to arrive in Germany on Thursday, Germany's DPA news agency reported.

Some 52 people were on board, sources told DPA. They are due to land in Berlin and Hanover.

This would be the sixth group of such Afghans to arrive in the country since the new government of Chancellor Friedrich Merz came to power in May, DPA said. 

Only Afghans who were approved for resettlement under the federal resettlement program and legally obtained visas are allowed to come into the country.

Under the new conservative government, Berlin suspended in May a resettlement program for particularly vulnerable Afghans.

Those eligible for the suspended program included Afghans fearing persecution by the Taliban government, which returned to power in 2021. Examples include former local staff of German institutions in Afghanistan and their relatives, as well as journalists and lawyers.

Despite the suspension, some Afghan nationals still manage to secure visas after suing the German government.

Reports suggest some German officials are considering bringing in Afghans on chartered flights, a method the previous government also resorted to.

It comes as Pakistan plans to deport Afghan nationals waiting to be resettled in Germany as of next year regardless of the status of their resettlement application.

Some 1,900 Afghans have been stuck in limbo in Islamabad, some for even years, waiting to be resettled to Germany.

Ukraine's government has not said what the reported US-Russia proposal contains. The EU has insisted that Brussels and Kyiv be involved in any peace talks. DW has more.



The office of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was meeting with a US military team visiting Kyiv, has said Ukraine is ready to engage with the White House on a reported US-Russia peace proposal.

Kyiv has not confirmed what the latest US-backed proposal contains.

US media outlets had reported that President Donald Trump had approved the ceasefire plan earlier this week. 

The proposal would reportedly see Kyiv give up land currently controlled by Russian forces and cut its army by more than half.

Meanwhile, EU ministers were meeting on Thursday to discuss the US-Russia plan for Ukraine and the bloc's continued support for Kyiv.

The bloc's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the EU's plan is to weaken Russia and strengthen Ukraine.

Here is a roundup of events from Russia's war in Ukraine on Thursday, November 20: 

The Ukrainian government said on Thursday that it was prepared to engage with what it called ""draft"" proposals drawn up by the United States to end the ongoing Russian invasion . 

But other senior officials in Kyiv have alled the suggestions ""absurd"" and a ""provocation.""

""The President of Ukraine has officially received a draft plan from the American side which, according to the American side's assessment, could invigorate diplomacy,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said in a statement.

""We are ready now to work constructively with the American side and our partners in Europe and around the world to achieve peace as the result.""

The precise proposals have not been published but media outlets including the AFP news agency have reported that the plan echoes many of Russia's most maximalist demands for ending the war, including the ceding of territory which is still controlled by Ukraine.

Following a meeting with US army officials in Kyiv, Zelenskyy's office said, ""it was agreed to work on the plan's points to ensure a dignified end to the war,"" but other senior Ukrainian figures dismissed the proposals.

""There is nothing concrete about this next 'peace plan,'"" said Oleksandr Merezhko, chairman of the parliamentary committee on foreign policy, telling the Ukrainian Interfax news agency that the suggestions were ""a Russian provocation to disorient Ukraine's allies and stir up society."" 

He accused US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Kremlin representative Kirill Dmitriev, who have reportedly drawn up the proposals, of ""putting forward this absurd plan just to remind people of their existence and pretend that they are doing something.""

On Wednesday, Ukraine's first deputy foreign minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, dismissed suggestions of peace proposals as ""unrealistic.""

The EU's foreign policy and security chief Kaja Kallas has responded to reports that the US and Russia have agreed on a peace plan for the war in Ukraine.

After meeting with Kyiv representatives and EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Thursday, Kallas said the EU has a ""two-point plan"" to end the war.

That plan, Kallas said, consists of weakening Russia and supporting Ukraine.

""If Russia really wanted peace they would have accepted the unconditional ceasefire offer already in March,"" Kallas stressed.

""Russia has repeatedly paid lip service for peace talks and previous talks fell apart because Russia never made real commitments,"" she said, adding that ""the pressure must be on the aggressor, not the victim."" 

Kallas also said that to that end the EU plans to impose more sanctions on Russia. In particular, the EU will continue to go after Russia's so-called shadow fleet of vessels and its enablers.

""The data is very clear, the export of Russian crude oil is the lowest it has been in months. Russian tax revenues from oil are the lowest since the war started,"" Kallas said, claiming that sanctions against Russia are working.

Ukraine has said it received 1,000 bodies of what Russia said were fallen Ukrainian soldiers.

""Investigators from law enforcement bodies, together with expert agencies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, will soon conduct all necessary examinations and identify the repatriated bodies,"" Kyiv's prisoner-of-war coordination center said on Telegram.

The returning of the bodies of dead military servicemen is a rare occasion of cooperation between the two sides.

There have been numerous swaps conducted since the war began, although Kyiv has accused Moscow of returning bodies in a disorderly way and even of sometimes sending the bodies of Russian soldiers, which Moscow has denied.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko held talks with the Secretary of the US Army Dan Driscoll, she wrote on social media.

Driscoll is part of the US delegation of military officials who arrived in Ukraine on Wednesday.

""This visit provides an important opportunity for the senior military officials accompanying the Secretary to assess the situation on the ground and to witness firsthand the consequences of Russian aggression,"" Svyrydenko wrote on X.

The prime minister called for further sanctions against Russia and ""reaffirmed that the US–Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, initiated by President Trump,"" saying it was ""being successfully implemented.""

Following the major Russian strike in the western city of Ternopil on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that 22 people were still missing.

The strike — one of the deadliest on civilians since the war began in February 2022 — killed at least 26 people, including 3 children. 

""All night long, our rescuers worked in Ternopil, and search-and-rescue operations are still ongoing. 22 people are still missing,"" Zelenskyy said on social media. 

Wednesday's strike ripped through the top two floors of a residential block. Some 200 rescue workers from across the country have been sent to look for survivors, Zelenskyy said.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has reiterated sentiments made by his EU colleagues regarding reports of a peace proposal that was quietly approved US President Trump earlier in the week.

""All negotiations regarding a ceasefire, and indeed any further peaceful development in Ukraine, can only be discussed and negotiated with Ukraine,"" he said ahead of a foreign affairs council meeting in Brussels.

""And Europe will have to be involved,"" he added.

Amid reports that the US has approved a ceasefire proposal put together by US and Russian delegations, the European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said that Ukraine and Europe must be ""on board.""

""For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board,"" Kallas told reporters ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels.

""We have to understand that in this war, there is one aggressor and one victim. So we haven't heard of any concessions on the Russian side.""

The proposal would reportedly see Ukraine cede land and reduce its military. The AFP news agency said it was not clear if President Trump had personally signed off on the proposal, citing a source familiar with it.

""We welcome all meaningful efforts to end this war, but like we have said before it has to be just and lasting,"" she said.

""If Russia really wanted peace, it could have agreed to an unconditional ceasefire already.""

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barret also commented on the reports, saying that peace cannot mean Ukrainian ""capitulation,"" according to AFP.

""Discussions are needed for us to reach a just and durable peace in Ukraine, they should start with a ceasefire on the contact line that allows for orderly discussions on the question of territories and security,"" he said.

A US delegation led by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll is in Kyiv on a ""fact-finding mission"", the US Embassy in Kyiv said.

Driscoll, along with Army Chief of Staff General Randy George, will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters news agency.

Driscoll's trip to Ukraine to discuss the country's drone warfare innovations and tactics was in the making for some time, a US official who requested anonymity told Reuters.

The official also said that last week President Trump decided to identify him as a kind of ""special representative"" to kickstart peace negotiations and execute a fact-finding mission.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is under increasing pressure as a corruption scandal in the energy sector is testing his government's credibility.

An investigation revealed fund embezzlement of funds to the tune of $100 million in the country's energy sector through kickbacks paid by contractors.

Following which, last week, Zelenskyy fired two top officials and imposed sanctions on close associates.

However, calls are growing for him to take more accountability and sack his longtime chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, who many consider to be Ukraine's de facto vice president.

Zelenskyy's critics, as well as allies, are worried the scandal could weaken their parliamentary governing coalition and have said more needs to be done to gain public trust.

""It's really hard to imagine that all this happening at the behest of people from the outside without political support,"" Anastasia Radina, the head of parliament's anti-corruption committee, said on Facebook on Wednesday.

By not cutting ties with Yermak, Zelenskyy is ""provoking an even greater internal crisis,"" she said.

 A US-backed ceasefire plan to end the war in Ukraine would require Kyiv to give up some land currently controlled by Russian forces and make dramatic cuts to its military, according to reports by the AFP and Reuters news agencies. 

The US wants Ukraine to accept the main points of the peace deal, sources who requested anonymity told Reuters news agency.

The new US plan expects Ukraine to grant Moscow part of eastern Ukraine it does not currently control in return for a US security guarantee for Kyiv and Europe against future Russian aggression, according to an Axios report.

The White House has refused to comment on the matter.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X that Washington ""will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.""

""Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas. And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions,"" Rubio said.

US President Donald Trump has already approved the 28-point plan, NBC News reported late Wednesday. 

Kyiv has not been involved in preparing the proposals, a Ukrainian official told Reuters.

On Telegram, Zelenskyy did not comment on Washington's peace plan but called for effective US leadership to help bring an end to the war that has been dragging on for years now.

Zelenskiy said only the United States and U.S. President Donald Trump ""have sufficient strength for the war to finally come to an end.""

Reports of a possible peace plan to end the conflict in Ukraine sound ""like surrender,"" Oleksiy Goncharenko of Ukraine's opposition European Solidarity party told DW.

The lawmaker dismissed reports of a plan allegedly negotiated between the United States and Russia that would require Kyiv to cede land controlled by Russian forces and cut its military size by more than half, calling it disinformation by Moscow.

""The main guarantee for Ukraine, as for any other country, [is] its own armed forces,"" he said. ""That's exactly what Russia wants — to reduce Ukrainian armed forces to finish Ukraine in the next attack.""

Goncharenko said he did not believe the US would ""push Ukraine to surrender because it's not in the interest of Ukraine, nor of the United States."" 

""I really want to thank President [Donald] Trump for his efforts trying to achieve peace, but to achieve peace this agreement should be in Ukrainian interests too, and I think he realizes this,"" he added.

Reports of the peace plan apparently negotiated between the US and Russia come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy faces his biggest domestic crisis in years, with close aides under investigation for a major criminal scheme and two ministers having resigned.

""Zelenskyy is definitely weaker because of the scandal at home, and this is a bad story overall,"" Goncharenko said.

He added that any deal would not have to be accepted by Zelenskyy alone, but by Ukrainian society as a whole.

""If we want to have any agreement, Ukrainian society should accept it. There are things which are acceptable for Ukrainian society; there are things which are not,"" he said.

A report by US broadcaster NBC has said US President Donald Trump signed off on a 28-point ceasefire agreement to end the war in Ukraine.

The agreement was developed in consultation with Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and Ukrainian officials, a senior administration official said, according to NBC News.

Some five passengers reportedly suffered injuries from the impact after the vessel ran aground on a small rocky island near Jindo.

Rescuers in South Korea have saved all 267 people after a passenger ferry ran aground near the peninsula's southwestern tip on Wednesday.

The 26,000-tonne vessel was traveling from Jeju Island to the Mokpo port when it hit a small rocky island in the southwest of the country near Jindo Island.

On board were 246 passengers and 21 crew members.

The coast guard said it rescued all those on the ship after mobilizing about 20 vessels and a plane.

Some five passengers reportedly suffered injuries from the impact of the grounding.

The Coast Guard has said human error may have caused the accident, but a full investigation is underway, according to Commissioner General Kim Yong-jin.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung ordered real-time updates on the rescue operation.

Lee was conducting a state visit to the United Arab Emirates for talks with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

Jeju is located some 80 kilometers (nearly 50 miles) south of the Korean Peninsula, while the smaller Jindo island is connected to the mainland by bridge.

The island in the Korean Strait is a top holiday destination for South Koreans. It is home to the Hallasan volcano and has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The site of the Wednesday grounding is near the area where the Sewol ferry sank in 2014, an accident that killed over 300 people.

Donald Trump's Ukraine envoy Lt Gen Keith Kellogg is leaving the role, it has emerged hours after a US plan to end the war leaked.

Lt Gen Kellogg, 81, is expected to step down as US special envoy in January in a departure that will deal a hammer blow to Kyiv's diplomatic efforts to end the war on favourable terms.

The retired general has been a key advocate for Ukraine inside the Trump administration at a time when the White House's support for Kyiv has dwindled.

His position as special presidential envoy is a temporary designation, and such envoys in theory must be confirmed by the US Senate to stay in their positions past 360 days.

But as he approaches that time limit, Lt Gen Kellogg has indicated to his associates that January would be a natural departure point, according to Reuters.

His exit will come as unwelcome news to Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, who is being pressured to give up territory to Russia.

News of his resignation came just hours after an unfavourable draft agreement to end the war was leaked to the media.

Under the US proposal, Ukraine would be forced to give up all of its territory in the eastern Donbas region and slash the size of its military in half.

The 28-point plan was thrashed out between the US and Russia in a recent flurry of secretive talks, renewing fears that Ukraine is being frozen out of discussions about its future.

The Telegraph understands that the draft proposal could see Ukraine give up the territory but maintain legal ownership in a cash-for-land deal.

Russia would pay an undisclosed rental fee for de-facto control of the region.

Initially feared to be something of a Ukraine sceptic, Lt Gen Kellogg quickly became one of Kyiv's few allies in the White House, viewed as a sympathetic ear in an administration that has at times leaned toward Moscow's view on the origins of the war in Ukraine.

At times, it put him at odds with Steve Witkoff, the president's lead negotiator, who has advocated a lopsided territorial swap as part of a long-term peace deal.

Among the retired general's successes was facilitating the release of dozens of hostages held by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko in return for limited sanctions relief.

In a sign of his appreciation in Ukraine, he would often be greeted by Mr Zelensky with a hug when the pair met in Washington or Kyiv.

But for all the warm welcomes, Lt Gen Kellogg had concluded that there were too many administration officials working on Ukraine, according to one person familiar with his thinking.

A lack of acknowledgement within the administration that Russia – not Ukraine – is stalling peace talks had led him to become increasingly frustrated.

While his departure will be viewed as unwelcome news in Europe, in Washington, it will come as little surprise.

Insiders suggest Mr Trump had picked him because the US president viewed his sympathetic ear as a valuable tool to keep Ukraine at the negotiating table while Witkoff carved out a deal with Putin.

He has become notably absent from key decision-making meetings and did not travel to the peace summit in Alaska in August.

Earlier this month, his deputy, John Coale, left to become the US special envoy for Belarus.

It was not immediately clear who, if anyone, would replace the retired general.

The US has yet to appoint a Senate-confirmed ambassador to Ukraine.

The legacy press has shown little interest in investigating Epstein's ties to governments or the broader implications.

“President [Trump] Expected to Sign Bill on Release of Epstein Files” read the November 19, 2025 New York Times headline. The report came a day after the House of Representatives passed a bill to release the government's case files on the deceased convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with only a single dissenting vote. The Senate followed with unanimous approval. What the files contain, and whom they implicate, remains to be seen. But their impending release marks a pivotal moment in an Epstein saga that has consumed and distorted political discourse throughout the entire first year of Trump's second presidential term. While much of the coverage frames the release as either a bipartisan effort to seek justice for Epstein's victims or a political challenge for the president, a far more complex and unsettling question remains largely unaddressed by the mainstream press: Are some of our elected leaders, past or present, compromised by influence operations? Yet there is still time. The press now has a rare opportunity, and a constitutional responsibility, to confront these questions with the rigor and courage the public deserves.

Since Congress returned after the November 2025 shutdown, Trump has responded to the looming release of the Epstein files with efforts to silence dissent. He publicly denounced Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who supported releasing the files, as a “traitor.” After Representative Lauren Boebert advocated for releasing the files, he summoned her to the Situation Room, a space typically reserved for high-level classified briefings, in what many viewed as an act of intimidation. He appeared to attempt to purchase silence from convicted, and imprisoned Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell by refusing to rule out pardoning her for all crimes, and by relocating her to a ‘Club Fed' facility where she enjoyed extra bathroom breaks, computer access, and even puppies, despite her role in trafficking children.

Pressure on Trump intensified on November 12, 2025, when the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released 20,000 pages of documents obtained from Jeffrey Epstein's estate. They include his communications up until his death in prison in 2019. Trump is referenced 1,500 times in the documents, including Epstein's claim that Trump liked watching “young women” in Epstein's pool and “spent hours” in Epstein's house with one of the victims. By November 18, 2025, the day Congress was set to vote on releasing the files, he lashed out at a Bloomberg reporter who asked about the files by calling her “piggy.” That same day, he threatened an ABC reporter with revocation of their broadcast license for asking about Epstein. Presumably to save face after what was seen as an embarrassing political failure to control his party members, who were set to approve the release, Trump reversed course and supported the release of the files.

With the release of the files now certain, Trump shifted gears, attempting to convince the public that the files were only damaging to Democrats. Trump warned that Democrats would “regret” the release of the Epstein files, an assertion that appears to encompass investigations by the Department of Justice into prominent members of the Democratic establishment mentioned in 20,000 documents: Harvard University's Larry Summers, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, and former President Bill Clinton.

Upon the release, Summers, who served under both President Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, quickly stepped back from public appearances and resigned from OpenAI's board. Yet he remains a professor at Harvard University despite email exchanges with Epstein after the sex offender's 2008 conviction, in which Summers suggested that women had lower IQs than men, and admitted to using Epstein to help him conduct an affair with a woman he referred to as his “mentee.” Meanwhile, Clinton's spokesperson insisted the emails reveal no wrongdoing on the former president's part (more on that below), while Hoffman, who connected with Epstein in 2015, seven years after Epstein's conviction, maintains the relationship was strictly professional, a claim not disputed by the documents reviewed thus far.

While the sordid details of Summers and Trump received a fair amount of media coverage, less was paid to the documents which referenced Epstein's connections to the Russian, the United States, and Israeli governments. Emails suggest that Epstein may have held compromising information on U.S. politicians that could have been shared with foreign governments, potentially allowing those governments to compromise American leaders. In the emails, Epstein claims to have photographs of Trump with “girls” in “bikinis,” but it is not known if they were under the legal age of consent.

In a series of emails, Epstein claimed that he had been sharing information with Russia about President Trump. A March 2018 email from Epstein's brother Mark to Steve Bannon asked whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had “the photos of Trump blowing Bubba.” “Bubba” was Bill Clinton's nickname, though Mark recently insisted that the reference in the email had nothing to do with the former president. The denial only deepened the ambiguity as Mark did not deny that a picture existed. So, did the photo exist? If so, who is Bubba? And if the email was a joke, why did Mark later tell News Nation that “Jeffrey definitely had dirt on Trump?”

More damning emails reveal Epstein's connections to Israel. Drop Site News cited emails documenting “Epstein's role in brokering intelligence deals for Israel.” These include facilitating a security agreement between Israel and Mongolia, establishing a backchannel between Israel and Russia during the Syrian civil war, and acting as a facilitator of a security agreement between Israel and the African nation of Côte d'Ivoire. The emails also reveal that Epstein hosted Yoni Koren — a Mossad agent and former aide to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak — at his home. Again, all the evidence mentioned so far is available to the legacy news media, yet they appear unwilling to confront the questions it raises.

The legacy press has shown little interest in investigating Epstein's ties to governments or the broader implications. This was made crystal clear by CNN's Dana Bash. On November 16, 2025, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene made headlines when she apologized on CNN for engaging in “toxic” rhetoric. This exchange with reporter Dana Bash received widespread coverage from press outlets and content creators, yet most avoided mentioning what Greene insinuated about Epstein and the intelligence community. It is important to note that Greene serves on the Oversight Committee and therefore is privy to sensitive information regarding Epstein. However, as a politician, her claims should be approached with caution and trusted only when supported by substantial evidence.

During the interview, Bash asked Greene, “You questioned who and what country is putting so much pressure on Trump to keep the Epstein files hidden. And you included a picture about donations from the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs Committee]. What are you trying to say there?” Greene responded that asking about the intelligence connections between Epstein and Israel is fair, “especially when we saw information recently come out in these emails…We saw Jeffrey Epstein with ties to [Former Israeli Prime Minister] Ehud Barak. We saw him making business deals with them, including deals involving the Israeli government, which seem to have led into their intelligence agencies. I think the right question to ask is: was Jeffrey Epstein working for Israel?”

Indeed, Drop Site News reported on the emails Greene referenced. Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting acknowledged the credibility of Drop Site News's reporting but noted that it was largely ignored by legacy media because, in the months prior, The New York Times repeatedly dismissed claims linking Epstein to Israeli intelligence as “conspiracy theories.” This had the effect of leading audiences to dismiss these accusations based on the outlet's influence.

Bash, apparently unaware of the evidence that she should have reviewed before asking that question, said, “I just want to be clear. Are you saying Israel is pushing the president of the United States to cover up the Epstein files? And what evidence do you have that that is the case?” This was a strange question, given that Greene had just cited the evidence. Nonetheless, Greene replied, “No, I simply — no, I simply asked.” Which seems to be more than Bash is willing to do. Whether due to ignorance, negligence, or institutional caution, such exchanges illustrate how the press shapes public perception by filtering which parts of the Epstein story are legitimate enough to acknowledge.

The failures extend far beyond CNN. Complicating matters further, in their communications with Epstein, journalists and politicians acted as if it was a fact that Epstein had damning material on Trump, but the revelations were not reported to the public. Take the New York Times' Landon Thomas Jr., a financial reporter, trusted Epstein as a source for his reporting on Trump between 2015 and 2018. In the emails, Thomas repeatedly referenced Epstein's alleged knowledge of Trump's interest in “young women,” including Epstein's claim that he had “given” Trump one of his former girlfriends. Yet Thomas never reported this information, nor did his colleagues. As Krystal Ball of Breaking Points pointed out, even if Thomas did not report this information, much of this material existed on NYT servers for other reporters to access. Even Thomas was shocked his colleagues did not report on Epstein's claims. In a damning email from May 2016, Thomas wrote to Epstein, “I am kind of shocked that our reporters did not contact you[.] re the Trump/women story. Seems to me he got off rather lightly.”

Others in the press, such as reporter Michael Wolff, also viewed Epstein as a valuable source for damaging President Trump's public image. Wolff appears in emails strategizing with Epstein about whether they should provide answers to Trump regarding his relationship with Epstein or let him “hang himself.” It is not clear if Wolff or Epstein or both or neither were communicating directly with Trump at the time.

The documents raise serious questions about journalistic ethics, revealing that both Thomas and Wolff advised Epstein on how to weaponize damaging information about Trump to protect Epstein's reputation ahead of an upcoming book by thriller author James Patterson and journalists John Connolly and Tim Malloy. Thomas' relationship with Epstein would eventually bring down his career. He was forced to resign from The New York Times in 2019 after admitting to editors that he solicited a $30,000 donation from Epstein.

It was not only journalists but also at least one politician who recognized Epstein as a valuable source brimming with compromising information. Stacey Plaskett, the delegate from the U.S. Virgin Islands, also seemed to be convinced that Epstein had dirt on Trump. So much so that she live-tweeted with Epstein during a 2019 House Oversight Committee hearing on Michael Cohen, over a decade since Epstein's conviction, raising serious questions about the proximity between political power and Epstein's influence.

The legacy news media have long possessed the sources and evidence needed to expose critical aspects of the Epstein saga. Yet much of the story is only now slowly emerging through these recent document releases. Given Epstein's proximity to power, these revelations will inevitably raise uncomfortable questions for many citizens who have tried to avoid sounding like the internet “cranks” they disdain (believe me, I feel it every time I write about this). The press is constitutionally entrusted to raise these questions responsibly and base their reporting on solid evidence. Transparency about those in power is essential, because sunlight remains the best disinfectant.

Historically, the media has faced justified criticism for mishandling the Epstein story, most famously Amy Robach's complaint that ABC News “quashed” her Epstein report in 2015. Some journalists, like Dana Bash, choose to ignore glaring facts, while others, such as Megyn Kelly, attempt to minimize the gravity of the issue, equating “barely legal” with Epstein victims as young as 15 years old. Even though 15 is not legal, let alone barley legal. It is also disturbing that entire outlets persist in referring to victims as “young girls” rather than “children,” a dangerous softening of language that should alarm everyone.

Yet for every soft-peddling media outlet, and for every Kelly and Bash, there are courageous reporters producing serious journalism — like the Wall Street Journal's investigation into Epstein's birthday book or CBS's exposé on the suspicious prison video from Epstein's final days. This kind of fearless reporting is exactly what the public needs. If the president or anyone else, regardless of their political affiliation, is compromised, the public deserves to know. That is journalism's essential role. So go down that rabbit hole because if the revelations of 2025 teach us anything, it is this: the real danger was never simply what Epstein knew, but what the American media chose to ignore.

Shrapnel from a tank shell lodged near a nerve in my hand in 2024. It remains there, a reminder of what I have endured.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

The Gaza Strip is facing an ever-deepening crisis in medical care and rehabilitation.

In September 2024, the World Health Organization estimated that nearly a quarter of the injured — more than 22,000 people — had sustained wounds that resulted in the loss of limbs or permanent disabilities. By September 2025, that number had almost doubled: More than 41,800 people in Gaza now require long-term rehabilitation due to injuries. 

With restrictions on the entry of medical equipment, prosthetic limbs and mobility aids such as wheelchairs and crutches have become nearly inaccessible.

As a result, thousands of wounded people — including children, women, and the elderly — face an uncertain future, deprived of any real chance of treatment or recovery.

Behind these horrifying statistics are real faces, real names, and real stories.

These are beloved people who have lost parts of their bodies — not just numbers in UN reports.

During a visit to Shuhada Al-Aqsa Hospital to check on my friend after her home was struck by an Israeli missile, I met Nour, whose hands were injured, and her little sister Alaa, a 5-year-old girl whose arm and leg were amputated.

Walking through the hospital corridors, the smell of medicine and the sound of pain took me back to June 8, 2024, the day I was wounded by a tank shell.

That day, shrapnel hit my hand, back, and face. One fragment lodged near a nerve in my hand, where it still remains, a constant reminder of what so many of us have endured.

Alaa and I shared the same pain — the pain of the body and the pain of loss.

When I first saw her, she was crying softly, whispering through her tears: “I wish I could eat with my right hand again … play and color with my friends.”

Her simple words captured the tragedy of an entire generation deprived of its most basic right — to live a normal childhood.

Whenever Alaa needed to go to the bathroom or undergo medical tests, her sisters had to carry her in their arms.

There were no wheelchairs or crutches in the hospital.

Her suffering wasn't only physical. It was also the crushing feeling of helplessness and total dependence on others at a time when she should have been receiving care and emotional support.

In times of war, caring for a wounded child who cannot even relieve themselves without help becomes an unbearable burden, even for those who love them deeply.

Not because they don't want to help, but because they themselves are struggling to survive.

As the siege continues and medical supplies remain restricted, Israel compounds the pain of the wounded, adding psychological torment to physical suffering and leaving children and women to face their pain with no tools to ease it, no devices to help them move.

Recently, reports spread about a young woman from Gaza named Nibal Al-Hissi, who pleaded through media and social networks for a medical referral that would allow her to travel abroad to receive prosthetic limbs.

I couldn't wait. I reached out to her myself, hoping her voice could be heard by the world.

She spoke to me through tears, her voice heavy with grief and longing for a life she had lost — “I had so many dreams and ambitions…”

Al-Hissi, 25 years old, lived in northern Gaza with her 2-year-old daughter, Rita.

During one Israeli airstrike, their home was bombed while she was holding Rita in her arms, trying to shield her from the blast.

The child miraculously survived, but her mother lost both of her arms.

Since that day, Al-Hissi has been unable to hold or feed her daughter, yet she continues to fight every day through pain, isolation, and a fragile hope of getting treatment.

Now, she depends entirely on her family for everything — eating, drinking, moving, and even basic personal care.

Al-Hissi told me she longs for the moments when her daughter, little Rita, would ask her for something simple, but what hurts her most is that she can no longer meet any of her child's needs.

Her pain deepened when her husband left her after the incident, believing she could no longer care for their child or their home.

Al-Hissi says that everything in her life has become difficult, from the unhealed wounds to the loneliness that her disability has imposed, to the postponed dream of receiving prosthetic limbs that would restore even a small part of her independence.

To the tragedy of Gaza's wounded, another layer of suffering is added: the near-impossible task of securing medical referrals and traveling for treatment outside the Strip.

Despite the growing number of those needing complex surgeries or prosthetics, medical referrals remain scarce and heavily bureaucratic, often taking months for approval if they ever arrive at all.

The Rafah crossing, the only real gateway for patients, opens and closes unpredictably due to political and security conditions, leaving thousands of wounded people trapped in endless waiting.

Behind every referral request lies a human story suspended between hope and despair. Patients wait for a phone call or a travel permit that could mean life itself, as their days fade away in pain and immobility inside hospitals lacking even the most basic resources.

War does not only kill. It steals. It steals land, homes, and loved ones. It steals limbs. It steals souls.

Pain does not end with survival; it begins when you are left to live with what's missing, with what's broken, with a body that will never be the same again.

And if death sometimes seems easier than losing a part of yourself, then choosing to live afterward, despite it all, is the purest form of resistance.

In announcing his signature of the bill, Trump omitted his own connections to the alleged child sex trafficker.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

On Wednesday night, the White House announced that President Donald Trump had signed the bill passed by Congress earlier this week to release the files on the federal investigation into alleged child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. 

Shortly after, Trump himself shared the news on Truth Social. Trump's message was rife with misleading statements, likely meant to divert attention from his former longtime relationship with Epstein.

Trump, for example, called the disgraced New York financier a lifelong Democrat who “donated Thousands of Dollars to Democrat Politicians” — a statement that is true. But Trump made no mention of his own personal friendship with Epstein, which lasted from the 1980s through the early 2000s.

Trump also downplayed his attempt to obstruct the release of files.

“As everyone knows, I asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, to pass this Bill in the House and Senate, respectively,” Trump wrote.

However, Trump only made that decision after months of describing calls for the files to be released a “hoax” against him, changing his mind only when it became evident that the legislation had enough bipartisan votes for passage.

Indeed, in his evening missive, Trump continued to describe the entire ordeal as a “hoax,” disregarding Epstein's victims, who have been demanding the release of the files for years. 

Trump's name reportedly appears within the Epstein files, but to what extent remains unclear. During the 2024 presidential race, Trump had campaigned on releasing the files, capitalizing on conspiracy theories popular amongst his base. Upon taking office, however, the president's position on the matter changed dramatically. In July, after his Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that there would be no further investigation into Epstein — and that the files would remain private — Trump vehemently rejected calls for their release, taking on a deeply adversarial tone toward those who disagreed with him. 

The law stipulates that most of the Epstein files must be released to the public, in a searchable database created by the Justice Department, within the next 30 days (around December 18). However, some critics are concerned that Trump could still limit what will be available, as he has many options to restrict files.

Trump could, for example, limit the release of files that relate to ongoing federal investigations. Indeed, Trump ordered Bondi to open new inquiries into several of his political adversaries just days before he announced support for the bill. Trump could also issue an executive order deeming certain documents' release as dangerous for national security or foreign policy reasons.

“It would be naive of any of us to think that Trump has really had a conversion,” Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vermont) said. “He does not want the information out.”

DNC chair Ken Martin similarly expressed skepticism over Trump's sudden change of heart, stating:

We can see where this is headed: He's already threatening to play games with the files that are released and those that are withheld. Here's our call: Protect survivors, withhold nothing. Trump's Department of Justice must release ALL of the Epstein Files immediately.

Polling shows widespread support for the release of the Epstein documents, though there is still some skepticism regarding Trump's role in the matter. According to an Economist/YouGov survey published this week, four in five voters (80 percent) said they backed the release of the files, with only 7 percent opposed. 

Meanwhile, a plurality of respondents — nearly half, at 49 percent — believe Trump is trying to cover up Epstein's crimes.

 China's Cautious Response to America's Retreat

 Maria Repnikova

Since the start of his second term, U.S. President Donald Trump has been dismantling the traditional channels of American soft power. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is no longer operational, and Voice of America is tied up in legislative and court battles. The State Department has significantly reduced its staff and programming. Restrictive new visa and immigration policies have made the United States less accessible and less attractive to potential visitors, and Washington's coercive and transactional dealings with U.S. allies have damaged trust abroad. In The New York Times, Jamie Shea, a former NATO official, referred to these sweeping changes as the United States' “soft power suicide.”

Many experts and commentators have interpreted the United States' loss as China's gain. The late political scientist Joseph Nye, who developed the concept of soft power, cautioned earlier this year that China “stands ready to fill the vacuum that Trump is creating.” Yanzhong Huang, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, similarly contended that the Trump administration's actions have “boosted China's charm offensive.”

But as I argued in 2022 in Foreign Affairs, the U.S.-Chinese soft-power competition is not a zero-sum quest for influence. The two countries take distinct approaches to building soft power: China has tended to rely on drawing in other countries with pragmatic benefits, whereas the United States has placed ideals and values at the center of its outreach. Recipient countries, especially those in the so-called global South, have perceived Chinese and U.S. offerings as complementary, accepting both rather than seeing a need to choose one over the other.

Over the last three years, and especially since Trump's reelection, China's relative position has undoubtedly improved. As the United States retreats, China looks to the world like the more accessible and reliable partner. But this has not turned China into a global leader in soft power. Although Beijing still emphasizes its pragmatic offerings in its diplomacy, it has reduced, rather than expanded, its international assistance to lower-income countries, and has shown few signs of stepping in to replace USAID. Nor is China positioning itself to fill the United States' former role of promoting a particular governance model to the world. Beijing is generally looked upon more favorably than before, yet that change in attitude varies significantly from region to region, and even the countries that hold the most positive views of China regard its actions with a mix of appreciation and resentment. China may be passively gaining stature from the United States' soft-power retreat, but that is not enough to guarantee greater global influence in the years ahead.

Chinese interpretations of soft power differ from Nye's original definition, which emphasizes culture, values, and foreign policy as the key ingredients of a country's ability to influence others without coercion. In Chinese writings, cultural power is fused together with material power: Beijing considers its economic development model, technological innovation, and material assistance to developing countries, not just its traditional culture and principles, to be vectors of soft power.

When Chinese leaders try to appeal to developing countries, they consistently underscore China's pursuit of mutual economic benefit and its understanding of human rights as a concept rooted in economic rights and material well-being, rather than in individual and political freedom. Diplomacy is about offering something practical to other countries, whether that is trade deals (which are often announced with some kind of cultural spectacle), infrastructure projects, or training and educational programs that bring thousands of officials, policymakers, journalists, and students to China.

And with the arrival of the Trump administration, developing countries have few alternatives to what China is offering. According to the Lowy Institute, a think tank in Australia, the administration's cuts to USAID have made China's bilateral development assistance commitments the largest in the world. Steep U.S. tariffs have ensured that China, which still embraces trade (even if it is criticized for its unfair practices), is the more economically accessible of the two countries. China's openness to international visitors—it now allows 30-day visa-free entry to citizens of more than 70 countries—also sharply contrasts the increasingly restrictive United States.



Yet China does not appear to be ramping up its developmental assistance, even though Trump's policies provide it an opportunity. Beijing's recent pledges of lending assistance to developing countries have been smaller than in the past, and there is little sign so far of that trend changing. At a May summit between China and the 33-country Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, for instance, Beijing promised members of the bloc $9.2 billion in credit—less than half of what it pledged at the same summit in 2015. In September, China pledged $1.4 billion in loans to the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a ten-country economic and security association, down from the $5 billion it pledged in 2014. These reductions reflect Beijing's effort to “revise” its Belt and Road Initiative by focusing on “small and beautiful” projects—downsizing, in effect—which is likely a response to both China's domestic economic pressures and the soaring debt that many BRI countries have accumulated. Although China is still offering loans to many neighboring, resource-rich countries, as well as to higher-income countries, such as the United States and Russia, it is increasingly wary of over-lending to developing countries. In some cases, such as in Ethiopia, it has paused new loans entirely.

There are few signs that China aims to fill other gaps left by USAID, either. Prior to 2025, China's foreign-aid budget (separate from its development finance funds) was a fraction of the United States' pre-2025 budget, and much of it was disbursed as concessional loans, rather than grants. This year, only in a handful of cases—such as increasing its contributions to Cambodia's largest demining organization and offering informal assurances that it will provide humanitarian aid to Nepal—has Beijing jumped in to meet the needs of countries affected by the USAID cuts. These isolated examples do not add up to a wholesale reorientation of Chinese diplomacy.

China is not holding back economically across the board. In recent years, Chinese trade with and private investment in countries across Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia have increased. The primary drivers of this expansion, however, have been commercial actors, rather than the state (although the lines between the two can be blurry).

The United States has also reduced its promotion of democratic values and human rights abroad, no longer taking pains to position itself as an aspirational democracy. This leaves another vacuum that China could, in theory, fill with an ideological agenda of its own—but Beijing may not be willing or able to do so. China's approach to soft power has generally focused less on the promotion of political ideals and values than that of the United States. This may be slowly changing, particularly as Chinese officials talk about principles such as noninterference and promote an alternative path to modernization and democracy in summit diplomacy and in the training sessions they run for foreign-policy makers. But China's messaging does not offer, as the United States' messaging once did, a clear vision of the country's role in the global order, nor a coherent model to “export.” This may be intentional, as it gives China flexibility and helps it present itself as a less imposing global power than the United States has been.

A main theme of Beijing's ideological promotion today is to differentiate China from the West. In speeches and public commentaries, Chinese officials often denounce Western hegemony and portray China as a responsible and stable major power. In a comment in Russian media in July, for example, China's ambassador to Russia criticized the United States for abandoning the postwar global order and described China, by comparison, as a country able to keep its promises. In September, at the SCO summit in Tianjin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for a “fairer” world order, and launched the Global Governance Initiative to demonstrate his commitment to advancing the goal of multipolarity.

In discussions with African leaders and policymakers, Chinese academics and diplomats tend to contrast the nonintrusive, benevolent China with the more interventionist and impulsive United States. China's approach to modernization, for example, is presented as inclusive of national differences rather than dictating a set of Western rules. Highlighting the unfairness of U.S. policies, both real and perceived, can foster grievance-based unity that can bring some countries closer to China. The Chinese-led SCO, for instance, has expanded its agenda from border security to global diplomacy, and has grown from a group of six countries in 2001 to one with ten full members, 14 dialogue partners, and two observers today, with more countries waiting to join. Yet China's messaging does not go much further than criticizing the dominance of the United States and demanding more say in international institutions and governance mechanisms. It falls short of delineating and inspiring an alternative world order.



Similarly, the recent tumult in U.S. democracy would seem to give China an opportunity to promote its governance model to a more receptive international audience. What constitutes this model, however, is not entirely clear. As I found in a study of training seminars for African policymakers, Chinese educators and officials do not try to sell the Chinese political system as something wholly different, but instead adopt and invert Western concepts to promote it. China is presented as just another version of democracy, but one that is more efficient and adaptive to public feedback. The Chinese leaders of these training sessions, moreover, rarely provide a roadmap for how to imitate China, even when it comes to topics such as poverty alleviation in which China is widely regarded as successful. In one striking scene at a seminar in Addis Ababa, an Ethiopian official asked the Chinese lecturer to at least provide some specific advice on how Ethiopia could mimic China's accomplishments. Another Chinese expert chimed in to say, “We are not here to give advice,” shutting down further discussion. Technical trainings related to agriculture or Chinese technology transfers likely do offer more specific lessons, but African officials and journalists have told me that concrete suggestions about China's broader developmental and political experience are limited. Without them, Beijing may present its own example as something to aspire to, but not as a model for other countries to follow.

This is not to say that China is not making new inroads. In recent months, the growing popularity of Chinese popular culture products such as Labubu dolls, the animated film Ne Zha 2, and several popular video games, along with Chinese technologies including the artificial intelligence platform DeepSeek, have inspired such headlines as “How China became cool.” This kind of cultural influence can translate to greater affinity for China's values and governance principles, especially when foreign publics latch onto films and video games that glorify Chinese history, traditions, and futuristic technology. Exports such as Labubu dolls and DeepSeek more plainly relate to commercial and technological acumen—something that can bolster China's material soft power but will not necessarily spread its vision.

Soft power is always challenging to measure definitively. One approximation is public opinion polls, which have shown China receive at least a passive boost in popularity since Trump's reelection. A July Pew survey across 24 countries found that more people still view the United States favorably than they do China, but the gap is closing. The United States has suffered a large decline in positive perceptions since spring 2024—favorable views of the country dropped 20 percentage points in Canada, for instance—whereas China has made marginal gains. In another recent survey across five major Latin American countries, more people preferred China to the United States as an economic partner in every country polled.

But these positive signs come with caveats. Perceptions of China still vary significantly. Unlike in Africa and Latin America, where opinion toward China is generally favorable, China's reputation is overwhelmingly negative in the Asia-Pacific and in Europe. In these regions, concern about the security threat Beijing poses likely outweighs attraction to the economic opportunities it has to offer, even as Washington pulls back.

Moreover, appreciation of China as an economic partner does not translate to trust in China's global leadership. In the Pew survey in July, a median of 66 percent of respondents across 25 countries did not have confidence in Xi “to do the right thing regarding world affairs.” Such contrasting views of China on economic and ideological levels also come up in conversations with policymakers. Ethiopian officials who took part in diplomatic training programs in China told me that they admired China's economic prowess and appreciated its material offerings, but they remained skeptical of Beijing's promises of cooperation bringing mutual gain, asking, “Is it a win-win or a China win?” Many struggled to articulate China's perspective on global affairs beyond a pursuit of self-interest.



Subtle resentments and fears of China's economic power rarely get captured in surveys, but they do show up in other ways. Even in a country such as Ethiopia, which is more favorably disposed toward China, university students across the country have expressed to me a mix of approval and apprehension about the long-term implications of Belt and Road projects. Many invoked the high debt owed to China (Ethiopia is China's second-largest loan recipient in Africa) and the possibility that China could end up taking over critical projects and sectors if Ethiopia can't pay back its loans. In Central Asia, where many countries are also relatively pro-China, organized protests against Chinese infrastructure and energy projects, among other issues, have grown more common in the last decade. Among countries that prefer to hedge between major powers or to avoid alignment, the withdrawal of the United States generates even more unease, as it leaves China's presence uncontested.

It would be premature to declare the relative improvement in China's soft-power position a definitive victory for the country. For now, Beijing seems to be holding back rather than fully taking advantage of the United States' decline. It presents itself as a reliable and accessible developmental partner, as it did before the second Trump administration, but it has also been cautious about expending more resources abroad. China's ideological message still draws largely on resentment toward the West, rather than presenting a compelling alternate international vision or offering concrete, replicable policy lessons. Many foreign publics remain wary of China, especially when it comes to global leadership.

Yet Beijing's conservative approach may be strategic, rather than a sign of weakness or disregard for soft power. China is avoiding overcommitment and opening itself up to greater scrutiny over its domestic politics and global vision while still enjoying passive gains from the U.S. withdrawal. Unlike the Washington of the past, Beijing is more interested in legitimizing its distinctive path than in convincing others to follow in its footsteps. Highlighting the stark contrasts between China and the United States may suffice for now.

 And Why Regime Change Is the Only Way Forward in Venezuela

 Elliott Abrams

On the last day of October, CBS's 60 Minutes asked U.S. President Donald Trump about his policy on Venezuela and his thoughts about that country's dictator, Nicolas Maduro. “Are Maduro's days as president numbered?” asked Norah O'Donnell. “I would say yeah,” Trump replied. “I think so, yeah.”

This phlegmatic response was a good summary of current U.S. policy: Washington favors Maduro's downfall, but its position lacks clarity and is not backed by the actions—including military strikes inside Venezuela—that would bring about the outcome U.S. officials appear to want. And therein lies the danger for Trump and his administration: that after a great deal of chest-thumping and a show of naval force aimed at Maduro, they will leave him in place. In that scenario, Maduro would emerge as the survivor who bested Trump and showed that American influence in the Western Hemisphere is limited at best.

Removing Maduro, on the other hand, would advance Washington's interests, protect U.S. national security, and benefit Venezuelans and their neighbors. Regime change would result in reduced migration to the United States, less drug trafficking, more freedom and prosperity in Venezuela, and an end to the country's cooperation with China, Cuba, Iran, and Russia, which gives countries hostile to U.S. interests a base of operations on the South American mainland.

The use of American military force to overthrow Maduro would not be without risk. It could fail to end the Maduro regime and could incite demonstrations against the United States. But regime change would not require any ground deployments of U.S. forces except, at most, Special Forces raids against regime figures who have already been indicted for narcoterrorism by U.S. law enforcement. The potential gain for the United States from the collapse of the Maduro regime far outweighs the risk, because it would end a brutal dictatorship that relies on drug trafficking to stay afloat and would open the door to Venezuelan economic recovery. That would end the mass migration of Venezuelans and reduce the role of Venezuela in cocaine flows to the United States.

Most recently, Trump has left open the possibility of more talks with Maduro while also signaling that deploying U.S. troops to Venezuela remained an option, as well. The Trump administration should eliminate this ambiguity and make clear that it intends to deal not only with the symptoms of the problem—trafficking in gold, drugs, and human beings; mass migration; violent crime; and instability—but with their root cause: the Maduro regime.

In 2019, toward the end of his first term, Trump initiated a pressure campaign against the Maduro regime. At the time, I served as special representative for Venezuela in the U.S. State Department and helped organize diplomatic efforts and severe economic sanctions to delegitimize and undermine Maduro. Nearly 60 countries joined the United States in recognizing Juan Guaidó, who had been National Assembly speaker, as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela. The theory was that the presidency was vacant because Maduro had stolen the 2018 presidential election—which he had.

But those U.S. efforts failed, because economic and diplomatic pressure was simply insufficient against a regime willing to use violence and brutal repression against the Venezuelan people to stay in power. When Trump left office in 2021, Maduro was still ruling Venezuela. In the ensuing years, the repression, economic ruin, refugee flows, and trafficking in drugs, gold, and human beings have continued. But in the 2024 presidential election, the opposition figure Edmundo González crushed Maduro in a landslide, making clear that Venezuelans want an end to the dictator's rule. Still, Maduro refused to accept the result.

Back in 2020, Maduro had been indicted by U.S. federal prosecutors, who charged him with, among other things, conspiring to commit narcoterrorism and leading a drug-trafficking organization known as Cartel de los Soles, or “cartel of the suns.” The State Department announced a $15 million reward for information that led to his arrest; this past January, that amount was raised to $25 million. Last summer, the Department of the Treasury sanctioned the cartel as a specially designated global terrorist entity, and the reward amount was doubled, to $50 million.

In addition to this diplomatic, political, economic, and legal pressure, the Trump administration has added more direct forms of coercion. In the Trump first term we used to say “all options are on the table,” but the administration made no military moves against Maduro. And a lack of enthusiasm for and commitment to the goal of bringing down the regime (plus perhaps a lack of capability) meant that Washington took no effective covert actions, either. By contrast, in the past few months, the United States has struck nearly two dozen ships in the Caribbean and the western Pacific, and its largest and most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, arrived there on November 16.

Typically, the U.S. Fourth Fleet, covering Latin America and adjacent waters, has no vessels permanently assigned to it and has only four to six surface ships under its command. Today, about a dozen surface ships including the Gerald R. Ford and a nuclear attack submarine, plus a considerable amount of airpower assets, have been sent to the region. This suggests that the list will expand to include targets inside Venezuela. “We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,” Trump said in mid-October. Around the same time, U.S. officials told The New York Times that Trump had authorized the CIA to carry out a program of covert action inside Venezuela, although its parameters and objectives remain secret.



So far, the Trump administration has characterized all these steps as intended to stop the Maduro regime's drug trafficking, not to overthrow the dictator. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio put it, “This is a counterdrug operation.” The New York Times recently reported that Rubio held a private meeting with House and Senate leaders earlier this month during which he “insisted that ousting Mr. Maduro was not the administration's objective.” But if Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela and is instead a narcoterrorist and a cartel kingpin, it would be difficult to understand why the Trump administration would surround the country with a gigantic armada only to leave him in power.

This is not the only anomaly in the current policy. Despite stringent U.S. economic sanctions, Trump continues to permit Chevron to drill for oil in Venezuela—and give some of it to the Maduro regime, as a form of tax payment. Maduro then sells that oil for cash. As a result, this “Chevron exception” to the sanctions helps him stay in power.

Trump has also withdrawn the temporary protected status that the Biden administration conferred on hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who sought refuge in the United States. In effect, this means the Trump administration is telling them to return to a country for which the State Department's travel warning tells Americans this: “Do not travel to or remain in Venezuela due to the high risk of wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, and poor health infrastructure. All U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents in Venezuela are strongly advised to depart immediately.” It continues: “Violent crimes, such as homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, are common. . . . Police and security forces have instituted a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy or anti-regime demonstrations.” Describing Venezuela as a hell on earth led by a vicious criminal and then ending temporary protected status suggests mixed motives and no clear policy.

Finally, leaving Maduro in place also leaves in place his ties with China, Cuba, Iran, and Russia. In Trump's first term, the administration received reliable reports about Iranian plans to transfer missiles to Venezuela—which the administration concluded would be unacceptable and would be stopped, with the use of force, if need be. That threat was conveyed to Venezuela and Iran, and the transfers were never made. Iranian drones that can reach Israel from Iranian territory can also reach U.S. territory from Venezuela—potentially hitting Puerto Rico and U.S. facilities there. Today, Iran uses Venezuela as a base for Hezbollah activity, money laundering, acquisition of blank passports for use by its agents, and other actions that Trump should stop by putting an end to the regime that enables them. Otherwise they will continue, and they will grow whenever it is to Iran's advantage. As for Cuba, the Maduro regime gives it between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil per day, on average, for free or with a huge discount—a critical source of support for the communist regime in Havana. A democratic government in Caracas would end that subsidy for repression. It would also remove the Russian military personnel usually in the country to train Venezuelan forces, and it would end the country's reliance on Russian and Chinese military equipment.

So far, Trump's approach mostly resembles a psychological operation, also known as a psyop. The public revelation that there is a covert CIA program seems to be part of that. If an electricity transformer blows up in some part of Venezuela, it would be hard to say whether it was the result of years of poor maintenance or an act of sabotage. The doubling of the reward for Maduro was clearly meant to incentivize regime officials or military leaders to break with him now. Presumably, one of the CIA's jobs is to convey to them that Maduro is going down—but they need not go down with him. That messaging should include discussion of a potential amnesty (something that has accompanied every Latin American transition to democracy) and assurances that, under a democratic government, the Venezuelan military would be better equipped and more professional, with plenty of room for advancement when some top Maduro cronies are weeded out. The current strikes on boats and the consequent reduction in maritime drug traffic may help reduce the cash Maduro has to continue buying military support.

But Venezuela's military is permeated with Cuban and Cuban-trained intelligence agents whose precise task is to avoid coups. Over the years, there has been plenty of military unrest in Venezuela, and hundreds of officers have been arrested and remain in the regime's hellish prisons (or have died there). Last year, a former Venezuelan army lieutenant who became a dissident, Ronald Ojeda, was murdered while living in exile in Chile—a killing that Chile's leftist government blamed on “instructions or orders given by the Venezuelan authorities.” The case shows not only the criminal and terrorist nature of the Maduro regime but the extent of its nervousness about any military dissidence.

Trump's actions thus far have raised the stakes for him and for the United States, and the Venezuelan democratic opposition is fully behind him. María Corina Machado, the leader of the opposition and recent Nobel Peace Prize winner, called Trump's moves “absolutely correct” and called Maduro “the head of this narcoterror structure that has declared war on the Venezuelan people and [on] democratic nations in the region. . . . Maduro started this war, and President Trump is ending that war.”

But victory for the democratic opposition and Trump, and the end of the regime, are not guaranteed. It is possible that if the U.S. flotilla can be kept in place and economic sanctions tightened, the regime's income will steadily decline and, with it, the ability to keep buying support. But the regime has had decades to coup-proof itself with massive help from Cuba. Merely starving it will not be enough: it must be forced out of power with military strikes, which will throw the regime's support structures, including in the military, into disarray and make them fear for their own futures.



The point of military action should be to cripple the regime's drug trafficking and demonstrate to the top leaders of the Venezuelan military and everyone except the small Maduro inner circle that the game is up, that Maduro is doomed, and that the best way for them to protect their own futures is to remove him and negotiate the installation of the next government. They will see the beginning of the use of force by the United States, but they will not know where it might end: they will be left wondering whether there will be more strikes at military targets or at regime physical assets, whether Washington will use Special Forces to apprehend indicted regime leaders, and whether the United States might even carry out a small invasion. Trump is wise to say he has not ruled anything out because the limited use of force is in its way another psyop, threatening something larger if Maduro is not removed. The goal is to replace regime confidence with fear, and insiders' displays of loyalty with their search for escape hatches.

And the escape hatch should be clear: Maduro's departure from power, followed by the installation of the legitimate government led by González, followed by economic recovery, free elections, and the kind of negotiated amnesty (for all but the top figures of the regime) and national reconciliation that has been possible in other Latin American countries after dictators have fallen. The loyalty of the army and police to the new government cannot be assumed, of course, but if it can pay them using frozen assets or loans, their fealty to the departed Maduro will rapidly disappear. Soldiers are also Venezuelan citizens, after all, who have seen how their own families and neighbors have been forced to live or flee under Maduro's reign.

It would be neither wise nor necessary to deploy U.S. ground forces to Venezuela. But creating the conditions for Maduro's overthrow will require hitting more than just drug-trafficking boats in international waters, because such strikes do not telegraph to Venezuelans that the regime is truly under great threat of losing power. First, Washington should expand its target list to include drug-trafficking speedboats in ports in addition to those on the high seas, because the threat must be brought home to the Venezuelan military. To protect U.S. planes that may strike targets in Venezuela (and to demonstrate that such strikes are planned), U.S. forces should destroy Venezuela's air defense systems, F-16 fighter aircraft at the Palo Negro Air Base, and Sukhoi jets at the air base located on La Orchila, an island about 100 miles off the coast. Airstrikes should also target small airstrips in western Venezuela used for drug trafficking and bases in western Venezuela used by the National Liberation Army (known by its Spanish acronym, ELN), a Colombian terrorist group aligned with Maduro and also engaged in narcotics traffic.

No single step would have a greater effect on the Venezuelan military, intelligence services, and police than removing Diosdado Cabello, the regime's chief thug, who is currently serving as interior minister and thus controls the police. Cabello was indicted in New York in 2020 for conspiracy to commit narcoterrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine, and the U.S. State Department has offered a reward of $25 million for information leading to his capture owing to his participation “in a corrupt and violent narco-terrorism conspiracy between the Cartel of the Suns . . . and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.” Removing him from power would show everyone in the regime's security organs that they were not safe, and that its power to protect itself and them was fast eroding.

Maduro rules over a country with a collapsed economy, 270 percent inflation, vast poverty, and a populace that voted in a landslide to end his days in power. It is not likely that his regime could withstand such an assault. No such policy is without risk—including the fact that failure could leave Maduro in power and weaken American credibility and prestige. That outcome would strengthen not only Maduro and other leaders of his ilk, such as Miguel Díaz-Canel in Cuba and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, it would guarantee more drug trafficking and more migration from Venezuela. But the risks of the status quo are even greater.

“Regime change” is hardly a phrase associated with Trump, but the goals he has stated in Venezuela require it. The Maduro regime depends on illicit activities to remain in power, and U.S. descriptions of Maduro as a criminal are accurate. Unlike the South American regimes that returned to the barracks during democratic transitions in the Reagan years (when I served as assistant U.S. secretary of state for Latin America), the Maduro regime isn't a military dictatorship. The military juntas of the past were amenable to negotiated agreements with democratic political parties wherein they left power in exchange for some form of amnesty for their coups and related crimes. Maduro and his top lieutenants, by contrast, are drug traffickers, under U.S. indictment for narcoterrorism and other crimes such as money laundering. They will not peacefully negotiate the end of their rule because they know that doing so would mean prison. That is why they must be forced from power if Venezuela is to have a decent future. While, in theory, all the indictments could be quashed in return for their leaving power—the deal that was rejected by Panama's Manuel Noriega—only the clear U.S. intent to remove the regime will make Venezuela's criminal leaders even consider such an alternative outcome. And they know that even if the United States agrees to end criminal prosecutions, Venezuela or the International Criminal Court may come after them. Such negotiations can be tried but are an illusory path; this criminal regime must be forced from power if Venezuela is to have a decent future.

Venezuela is a far better candidate for regime change and a return of democracy than were countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. After bringing down the dictator Marcos Pérez Jimenez in 1958, Venezuelans enjoyed two generations of democracy and built a large and educated middle class until Hugo Chávez and Maduro brought repression and ruin. The country has no significant ethnic or religious divisions. It has a long tradition of close financial, commercial, social, educational, and military contacts with the United States. It is the alienation from the United States in the last 20 years—and the links to China, Cuba, Iran, and Russia—that is anomalous. Rebuilding democratic institutions, clearing out the Cuban influences in the intelligence service, and attacking the country's vast corruption will take years of hard work. But that is what a huge majority of Venezuelans voted for last year, despite all the efforts of the Maduro regime to intimidate them and to rig the election.

The only way for Trump to be able to declare victory credibly is for Maduro to go. Trump is obviously reluctant to launch strikes inside Venezuela. It's a fair guess that it isn't the problem of how to legally justify and defend such strikes that is deterring him, but his own doubts about the chances of success. And if Trump backs down, he would not acknowledge defeat; he would instead claim that his only goal had been to depress drug trafficking. He would declare victory and cite statistics showing that the number of drug shipments on boats in the Caribbean had gone down—which it would have.

But once the U.S. fleet is withdrawn, those shipments will inexorably rise again—and the Cartel de los Soles and its putative leader, Maduro, will be back in business with the wind in their sails. Moreover, refugee flows from Venezuela would continue, and Venezuelans would not return home in large numbers, while Maduro would remain in power. So although Trump may feel he is not yet committed, in fact his own prestige and American credibility are already on the line. His advisers should persuade him that he's already past the point of no return: the game is on, and either he wins or Maduro wins.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","CDC website changed to include false claims that link autism and vaccines","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/health/cdc-website-autism-vaccines","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 14:19:41 GMT","


            Scientific information on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website was replaced on Wednesday with anti-vaccine talking points that don't rule out a link between vaccines and autism, despite an abundance of evidence that there's no connection.
    


            Bullet points on the top of the page now state that “vaccines do not cause autism is not an evidence-based claim” because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism. However, the preponderance of scientific evidence shows this is not true, according to a position statement from the Autism Science Foundation.
    


            “The science is clear that vaccines do not cause autism. No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines. This includes vaccine ingredients as well as the body's response to vaccines,” the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement on Thursday.
    


Vaccines Fast Facts



            Other CDC bullets say studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have been ignored by health authorities. This, too, is not true. Studies showing a connection between vaccines and autism have proven to be fraudulent or have been poorly done or biased. There are many well done, credible studies that find no such relationship.
    


            The page also says HHS has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.
    


            The main heading on the page states “Vaccines do not cause Autism,” but now has an asterisk that directs readers to a footnote: “The header “Vaccines do not cause autism” has not been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.”
    


Why not split the MMR vaccine?



            The footnote seems to refer to a commitment by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and Republican from Louisiana, during his confirmation process that language on the CDC website “pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism” would not be removed. Cassidy described the promise in a speech in which he explained his support for Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist.
    


            HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said Thursday, “We are updating the CDC's website to reflect gold standard, evidence-based science.”
    


            In a post on social media late Wednesday night, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as director of the CDC's National Center on Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, called the changes “a national embarrassment.”
    


            “The weaponization of the voice of CDC is getting worse. This is a public health emergency,” he said.
    


            Daskalakis said the scientists at CDC were completely blindsided by the page update.
    


            “This distortion of science under the CDC moniker is the reason I resigned with my colleagues,” he told CNN.
    


            CNN has reached out to CDC for comment.
    


Fact check: What you need to know about Trump's misinformation about vaccines, autism and hepatitis B



            This is the latest move by the Trump administration to alter long-standing US vaccine policy and practice and cast doubt on vaccinations.
    


            Kennedy has hired long time anti-vax allies, including David Geier, a discredited researcher who was once disciplined by the Maryland State Board of Physicians for practicing medicine without a license, and Lyn Redwood, a nurse who was the president of the World Mercury Project, which later became Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group Kennedy ran before campaigning for office, to undertake new evaluations of government data in an effort to prove conspiracy theories that hazards of vaccines have long been hidden from the public.
    


            The rate of routine childhood vaccinations has dropped in the United States, allowing preventable diseases including measles and whooping cough to surge. This year the United States has seen its highest numbers of measles cases in 25 years. In a call with state health officials on Monday, the CDC disease detectives leading the measles response suggested that the United States status as a country that has eliminated continuous measles spread was in jeopardy as cases continue to rise.

Live Updates


            • Cheney's funeral: Political leaders from both sides of the aisle gathered to pay respects to former Vice President Dick Cheney at the Washington National Cathedral. During the service, his daughter and former Rep. Liz Cheney said he chose to defend the Constitution over political partisanship. Neither President Donald Trump nor Vice President JD Vance were invited, according to a source.
    


            • Epstein files: Trump signed the bill last night that directs the Department of Justice to publicly release all of its Jeffrey Epstein-related files after a stunning reversal in his position. The Justice Department now has 30 days to release the documents.
    


• Uncertainty remains: Attorney General Pam Bondi said yesterday the DOJ will “follow the law,” but some lawmakers and analysts worry the Trump administration may try to hinder the process by slowing the release or redacting information. Read more about the fine print in the legislation. 



            As Dick Cheney's funeral service comes to a close, elsewhere in DC, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended President Donald Trump's call for the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials in a video to disobey illegal orders.
    


                    “I know the DOJ and the Pentagon are looking into the legality of all that, but what I can address is what everybody knows. That was wildly inappropriate. It is very dangerous. You have leading members of Congress telling troops to disobey orders. I think that's unprecedented in American history,” Johnson said. 
                





            The speaker noted his son attends the Naval Academy, and said, “I know young soldiers, airmen, sailors. They don't need that kind of nonsense from people in Congress. It is very dangerous.”
    


            Pressed on Trump saying the Democrats' actions should be punishable by death, the speaker said, “I'm gonna let others define what it is, but it's wildly inappropriate.”
    


            Johnson a bit later expanded on his thoughts, saying he took Trump's suggestion to be the president simply explaining sedition.
    


            “What I read was he was defining the crime of sedition. That is a factual statement, but obviously attorneys have to parse the language and determine all that,” he told reporters.
    


            When it came to choosing between his party and the Constitution, it was an easy choice for Dick Cheney, his daughter and former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney said.
    


                    “For him, a choice between defense of the Constitution and defense of your political party was no choice at all,” she said.
                





            Liz Cheney said her father was “inspired to service” by a speech from former President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat, despite him joining the Republican Party.
    


            “He knew that bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she added.
    


            Liz Cheney closed her eulogy by recalling her father's final words after a night in which she said the skies above her parents' house “filled with clouds in the shape of winged angels.”
    


            “As my dad left this earth, his last words were to tell my mother he loved her,” she said.
    


            “And now all of us who loved him so dearly, say to him: Good night, sweet Dad. May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest,” Cheney added, referencing the line from Shakespeare's “Hamlet.”
    


            Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman and one of Dick Cheney's daughters, recalled that her father attributed the path he'd traveled to being “born an American — a blessing, surely, among life's greatest.”
    


            “My dad thought deeply about what this blessing meant, about the duties it imposed,” she said.
    


            She recalled visiting Civil War battlefields with her family when she was young, saying her father “read every word of every sign” at every stop they made. Liz and her sister, Mary Cheney, then young children, “moaned and groaned.”
    


            “My dad's devotion to America was deep and substantive. He spent his life studying the history of our great republic. He knew you couldn't truly appreciate what it means to live in freedom if you didn't understand the sacrifices of the generations who came before. And he made sure that his children and grandchildren understood this, too,” she said.
    


            From driving to rodeos to cooking Christmas dinner, Dick Cheney's grandchildren remembered the little moments of life with their grandfather.
    


            Elizabeth Perry talked about when Cheney drove her to her first day of college. He spent the drive giving her advice as she was set to start her freshman year and reminisced on the times he drove his own kids to university.
    


            “I will forever see him that way. Driving along an open road and telling me stories about his life while talking about the family that he loved so dearly,” she said.
    


            Richard Perry said one thing he and his grandfather both had in common was that they played high school football. He said Cheney kept the schedule of his games on his desk.
    


            “Every Christmas, Grandpa would cook our dinner while we hung out in the kitchen watching his favorite John Wayne movies, year after year,” he said.
    


            But above all, Richard Perry said he remembered the way his grandfather would look at him. He didn't have to say anything, but “you could just feel his love.”
    


                    “He always told us how proud he was of us, and we will always try to follow his example. To be people driven to love our families, to be respectful and to live through the lessons he taught us. To put love and our families first,” Richard Perry said.
                





            Grace Perry shared her own memories and lessons she learned from Cheney. When she did rodeo, she said her grandfather drove her and her horses across the state.
    


            “My grandpa had a love for the land, a love for his country, and a love for Wyoming. Any day of the week, any hour of the day, he was there to help,” Grace Perry said.
    


            Attendees at former Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral include the current and former top-ranking Senate Republicans: John Thune of South Dakota and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
    


            The attendees of Cheney's funeral in many ways represent the old guard of the GOP, including former presidents and vice presidents who aren't aligned with the shift of the party under President Donald Trump. Trump and Vice President JD Vance were not invited.
    


            McConnell has become a fierce Trump critic and is retiring from the Senate.
    


            Former President George W. Bush called Dick Cheney, a “true man of the West, ” as he described his former vice president's demeanor on the campaign trail.
    


            “If any voters came looking for a kind word and a hug, they'd have to settle for the kind word,” Bush joked.
    


                    But, he added: “You can't question the appeal of the only person from America's Mountain West elected to national office.”
                





            Bush said Cheney offered to step aside in 2004 to allow Bush to choose a different running mate in his bid for reelection. But, he said, he “arrived back at the conclusion that they do not come any better than Dick Cheney.”
    


            “He lifted the standards of those around him just by being who he was,” Bush said. He said Cheney was an “old breed of public servant, defined by their substance and character.”
    


            “You did not know Dick Cheney unless you understood his greatest concerns and his ambitions were for his country,” Bush said. “Across 40 years, his service was consistent, faithful and noble.”
    


            As Dick Cheney's funeral is underway at the Washington National Cathedral, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are reacting to President Donald Trump calling six congressional Democrats “traitors” over a video they posted urging troops to disobey illegal orders.
    


            Republican Sen. Rand Paul warned the president against using violent rhetoric, saying he doesn't “think it's a really a good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.”
    


                    “I think we have political disagreements, and we need to work them out in the political run,” Paul told reporters.
                





            Trump said Sens. Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin, and Reps. Jason Crow, Chrissy Houlihan, Maggie Goodlander and Chris Deluzio — all of whom are former military or intelligence officers — should be arrested and put on trial, adding the video was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”
    


            The Republican senator added that people who are “not stable” could see this kind of rhetoric and attack those Democrats.
    


            “I think we should be careful about rhetoric, as far as saying people are traitors, Marjorie Taylor Greene, things like that. That kind of rhetoric isn't good. It stirs up people among us who may not be stable, who may think, ‘Well, traitors, what do we do with traitors? That's the death penalty. Maybe I'll just take matters into my own hands,' which is not something we should be encouraging,” said Paul.
    


            “So I have a lot of disagreement with Democrats, but I try to keep it on the civil, civil level, and try not to call any of them traitors or anything like that, because I think that is something that could incite some people among us who aren't stable to commit violence.”
    


            While searching for a running mate, former President George W. Bush enlisted the help of a trusted source to lead the effort: Dick Cheney.
    


            “Dick Cheney and I went through the files name by name. We talked over the various qualities I was looking for in a vice president: preparedness, mature judgment, rectitude and loyalty. Above all, I wanted someone with the ability to step into the presidency without getting distracted by the ambition to seek it,” Bush said.
    


                    “After weeks of these meetings, I began to have a thought I could not shake. I realized the best choice for the vice president was the man sitting right in front of me,” he said.
                





            Pete Wiliams, who worked closely with former Vice President Dick Cheney, talked about his humility and character as a leader during his decades of public service.
    


            Williams, the press secretary for Cheney when he was defense secretary, told a story about when then-President George H. W. Bush was trying to reach a nuclear weapons agreement with the Soviet Union.
    


            A new negotiation strategy Bush planned to announce in a speech was leaked early, Williams said, prompting Cheney to call him and another official to his office.
    


            “He looked at us sternly and he said, ‘The bad news is that the president of the United States is very angry with you both,' and then I asked for the good news, and he said, ‘I only have to fire one of you.'” Williams said. “I could tell he was joking. I'm not sure the senior official realized it.”
    


            “Then Secretary Cheney said, ‘It's okay guys, I told the president it was my idea.' He could have told President Bush that it was our fault, but he took the blame and saved us from ourselves,” Williams said.
    


            This story was just one example of how Cheney “demonstrated that kind of decency and concern for all the people who served him during his more than 40 years in public life.”
    


            Williams also talked about Cheney's love of fly fishing and the outdoors.
    


            Former President George W. Bush, who is eulogizing his former vice president, Dick Cheney, joked that he discovered in 2000 that “when you choose one Cheney, you get four.”
    


            Bush started his speech at Cheney's funeral by acknowledging his wife and two daughters.
    


            “In a family so close, you dread the day when the circle is broken,” he said. “He sure loved you all, and he was proud of his family.”
    


            Dr. Jonathan Reiner, Dick Cheney's cardiologist for 27 years, described the late former vice president as the model patient as he recounted Cheney's lifelong battle with heart disease, starting with a heart attack at age 37, during his first run for Congress.
    


            He prompted laughter from the crowd when he drew an implicit comparison to the opaque statements issued by President Donald Trump's doctors. Trump is not in attendance, having not been invited to the funeral.
    


            “He never allowed politics to influence his personal health care decisions, and not once in all my time as his doctor did he try to to write or change a single word of a statement I issued,” Reiner said.
    


            Reiner said that “in moments of true existential risk for him, the vice president was always the calmest person in the room — including me.”
    


            “He lived most of his adult life with a relentless disease intent on killing him, but he never looked over his shoulder — he only looked ahead,” he said.
    


            Previous vice presidents and lawmakers of both parties have gathered inside the Washington National Cathedral for Dick Cheney's funeral.
    


            Just moments ago, Cheney's casket was brought inside. The clergy met it on the steps of the cathedral where they said a prayer.
    


            In the cathedral, former President Joe Biden and former first lady Jill Biden are seated next to former Vice President Kamala Harris. Former Vice President Mike Pence is also in the front row.
    


            Former President George W. Bush, who is expected to give the eulogy, and his wife Laura Bush are seated next to the Bidens. Joe Biden and Laura Bush were seen having a long conversation.
    


            Lawmakers such as the Republican former Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, and the Democratic former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, are also in attendance.
    


            Meanwhile in New York City, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is previewing his Friday meeting in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump.
    


            He said at a press conference that their meeting was an “opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers.” Mamdani was questioned repeatedly about how he would approach Trump, who has used a series of Oval Office meetings this year to provide dressing-downs of foreign heads of state, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, an episode Mamdani was asked about.
    


            “I'll stand up for New Yorkers, every single day,” Mamdani responded.
    


            “I think being a New Yorker means that you're prepared for all situations, all kind of comments, all kind of commentary. And at the end of it, the focus has to be, what's the case that you are making? Why are you there?,” Mamdani added. “For me, it's not about myself, it's not about a relationship with an individual. It's about a relationship between New York City and the White House.”
    


            Mamdani also emphasized that the affordability agenda at the center of his mayoral campaign would be the focus of his conversation with the president.
    


            “I view this meeting as an opportunity for me to make my case. And I'll make that case to anyone, frankly, as we've been doing over the course of the campaign, and now as I will be the next mayor of this city, it behooves me to ensure that I leave no stone unturned in looking to make this city more affordable,” Mamdani said.
    


            Vice President JD Vance on Thursday offered condolences to the family of former Vice President Dick Cheney, praising his predecessor's public service while acknowledging his “disagreements” with President Donald Trump.
    


            “My condolences go to Dick Cheney and his family,” Vance said during an appearance at a Breitbart News event. “Obviously there were some political disagreements there, but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.”
    


            Neither Vance nor Trump were invited to Cheney's memorial service on Wednesday, where a slew of former presidents and vice presidents were expected to attend.
    


            Cheney emerged as a sharp critic of Trump following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. His daughter, former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, also clashed repeatedly with Trump, serving as a chief supporter in Congress of Trump's impeachment over the riot at the Capitol.
    


            Both Cheney and Pence had high-profile breaks with President Donald Trump. Pence's came in the wake of his refusal to attempt to reject electoral college votes on January 6, 2020; he later ran against Trump for the 2024 GOP nomination. Cheney in 2024 endorsed the Democratic nominee, former Vice President Kamala Harris, as he warned that Trump was a threat to the republic.
    


            Pence would not directly address whether Cheney's warnings have come true.
    


            “I would never begrudge the late vice president his opinions or political judgment,” he said. “But at the end of the day, I think his lifetime is evidence of the fact of, really, the strength of this nation. And in a very real sense, as we go forward, I think people will continue to be inspired by his devotion to our military, his devotion to our national defense, and a lifetime of service — and that's where we should focus today.”
    


            Former Vice President Mike Pence says Cheney called him after the 2016 presidential election and shared two pieces of “sage advice.”
    


            First, Pence told CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Cheney said he received the president's daily brief, first thing in the morning, at the vice president's residence, before attending as the president received the same classified intelligence report.
    


            “It was a way that he said, ‘You will be better equipped to be able to advise the president if you know in advance what's coming and can run that through the filter of the president's priorities,'” Pence told Zeleny before Cheney's funeral.
    


            Cheney also advised Pence to “spend a lot of time on Capitol Hill” — which both vice presidents, who were members of the House and held the same Republican leadership post, made a regular practice.
    


            “He was the one that said to me, ‘Don't just go to Capitol Hill when the administration is looking for something; looking for a vote. But go on a regular basis,” Pence said. He said he regularly attended Senate lunches.
    


            Neither President Donald Trump nor Vice President JD Vance were invited to former Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            Cheney will receive full military honors at the memorial service, which is expected to be a bipartisan who's who of Washington dignitaries.
    


            More than 1,000 guests are expected at Cheney's invitation-only funeral this morning at Washington's National Cathedral — including all four living former vice presidents and two former presidents.
    


Who's going: Former presidents George W. Bush and Joe Biden will pay their respects, along with former vice presidents Kamala Harris, Mike Pence, Al Gore and Dan Quayle. There are also expected to be a number of Supreme Court justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Elena Kagan. A large number of past and present Cabinet members from both Republican and Democratic administrations will also attend, as well as congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle.
    


            Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi is expected to attend, along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and former leader Mitch McConnell.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


Some context: While official Washington funerals usually include invites to the White House, excluding Trump should not be a surprise. Trump has not publicly expressed his condolences or commented on Cheney's death.
    


            Both Cheney and his daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney, have been fierce critics of Trump since the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, and Trump's attempts to get his supporters to stop the peaceful transfer of power.
    


            President Donald Trump on Thursday called for the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials to disobey illegal orders that might be issued by the administration, calling it “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”
    


            “It's called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
    


            He was referring to half a dozen members of Congress who previously served in the military or intelligence community who posted a video on X earlier this week urging the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”
    


            “Their words cannot be allowed to stand - We won't have a Country anymore!!! An example MUST BE SET,” Trump wrote, going on to add in a subsequent Truth Social post, “LOCK THEM UP???”
    


            He added “punishable by DEATH!” in yet another post later Thursday morning, after reposting another user's post that read: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House.
    


            In the video, the lawmakers said, “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law, or our Constitution,” adding, “Know that we have your back… don't give up the ship.” The lawmakers don't specify which orders service members have received, or might receive, that could be illegal.
    


            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Wednesday that the Justice Department will be taking a “very close look” at these lawmakers' actions, calling it a “disgusting and inappropriate display of supposed leadership from the Democrat party.”
    


This post has been updated with additional Truth Social posts. 



            Waking up to the news that President Donald Trump signed a bill to release the full Department of Justice case files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a survivor of Epstein's abuse told CNN she felt mixed emotions.
    


                    “It feels incredible; it feels like surreal,” Haley Robson said to CNN's John Berman. “But, you know, of course there's a part of me that wants to be full-on happy, but … I do have reservations because, you know, he's become very unpredictable, especially with the Epstein files,” she said, referring to Trump.
                





            Robson said Trump's back-and-forth about supporting the release of the records makes her feel “a little skeptical,” but ultimately she is happy the president “did the right thing.”
    


            In his Truth Social post announcing he signed the bill, Trump said, “This latest Hoax will backfire on the Democrats just as all of the rest have!”
    


            “I think it's appalling that he keeps referring to all this as a hoax when him and I both know this is not a hoax,” Robson said.
    


            Looking ahead, senators from both parties said the Justice Department has 30 days to comply with the law and release the full files. Robson said she expects the biggest impact will be a fuller picture of the “diabolical abuse of children through using coercive control and sexual abuse.”
    


            While it's important for people mentioned in the files to be held accountable, Robson said the scale of this abuse is what she sees as the more important revelation.

            The first time Mwezi Mugerwa saw the African golden cat, he didn't know what it was.
    


            While reviewing camera trap footage at Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park, the conservation biologist spotted an unfamiliar creature around twice the size of a domestic cat in the grainy black-and-white footage.
    


            None of his colleagues could identify it; “but, when I talked to the hunters and communities who lived around the park, they knew the species,” Mugerwa recalls.
    


            Known as Embaka in the local language, the “cryptic” golden cat was often caught accidentally in forest snares.
    


            “That was really concerning for me — that we may lose this species before we even get to know about it,” says Mugerwa.
    


            Over the past 16 years, Mugerwa has dedicated his career to “Africa's least known, least understood, least studied big cat.” Found in dense tropical forests across Central and Western Africa, the species is so elusive that the last IUCN assessment — over a decade old — has no population estimates, and in all his years of fieldwork, Mugerwa has only managed a fleeting glimpse of the African golden cat three times with his own eyes. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the world's largest environmental network of government and society organizations, tracks threatened wildlife.
    


            “They're really, really difficult to see in the wild,” says Mugerwa, who won the Indianapolis Prize Emerging Conservationist Award earlier this year for his work on the species.
    


            But, realizing that accurately counting the big cats was the first step to protecting them, he set out to conduct the first population census across the species' range, expected to publish next year.

            Mugerwa knew that gathering data on the African golden cat wasn't something he could do on his own. So, in 2019, he founded the African Golden Cat Conservation Alliance (AGCCA), a network of 46 conservationists across 19 countries.
    


            Together, they launched a standardized camera trap survey across the cat's suspected range, supported by funding from the National Geographic Society.
    


            But manually reviewing thousands of images from 30 sites across 19 countries — the largest camera trap grid for any African wildlife species, says Mugerwa — “was really, really painful.”
    


            At the same time, US-headquartered nonprofit Panthera, another of Mugerwa's collaborators, was developing an AI algorithm that could quickly sort the images and identify individual cats based on their unique coat patterns, similar to how tiger stripes are used like fingerprints.
    


            “That's really important, because now we are able to speak to number and density,” says Mugerwa, adding that without AI, distinguishing individual cats would be nearly impossible due to their small size and subtle markings.
    


            Preliminary data suggests the species exists at low densities — even in protected habitats. In Uganda and Gabon, for example, surveys found just 16 individuals per 100 square kilometers.
    


            The surveys have also revealed the true impact of poaching: in areas with hunting restrictions, Mugerwa says cat populations were up to 50% higher, with wider distribution. The study has also observed that while the cats are active both day and night, many are strictly nocturnal — likely to avoid human activity during the day, he adds.
    


            Establishing population numbers was just the first step. Early in his research, Mugerwa realized that hunting was the cat's primary threat.
    


            In East Africa, where Mugerwa is based, the African golden cat is rarely the target of hunters. But bushmeat snares, set for pigs and antelopes, are indiscriminate, often catching other species unintentionally. In 2019, Mugerwa received reports of 80 golden cats caught in snares in three Ugandan forests, 88% of which were accidental.
    


            “We are dealing with a bushmeat crisis: the level of hunting ongoing in this forest is unsustainable and out of control,” he says, adding: “The species is being pushed to the edge of extinction in many of its range countries.”
    


            To combat the cat's biggest threat, Mugerwa went directly to the residents, creating Embaka: the first community-based anti-poaching conservation project focused on the African golden cat.

            Working with over 8,000 families across the cat's range, including Gabon, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, and Uganda, the project engages local communities — many of whom are former poachers — to deploy camera traps and report sightings.
    


            “We have learned a lot from local communities; the range expansion, for instance, some of that data comes from hunters,” says Mugerwa. Embaka offers incentives like dental care and livestock support to encourage communities to “speak out against hunting” and protect the forest ecosystem.
    


            Bringing reformed hunters on board not only reduces the threat the cats will face from hunting, but it also “improves the relationship between the African golden cat and the communities,” says Mugerwa.
    


            “It also allows the local communities to own and to be part of the camera trap grid, which is really beautiful to see,” he adds.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Washington National Cathedral on Thursday hosted a bipartisan show of respect and remembrance for Dick Cheney, the consequential and polarizing vice president who in later years became an acidic scold of fellow Republican President Donald Trump.

Trump, who has been publicly silent about Cheney's death Nov. 3, was not invited to the memorial service.

Two ex-presidents came: Republican George W. Bush, who eulogized the man who served him as vice president, and Democrat Joe Biden, who once called Cheney “the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American history” but now honors his commitment to his family and to his values.

“Solid and rare and reliable,” Bush said of his vice president, praising a man whose “talent and his restraint” exceeded his ego. “Smart and polished, without airs.”

Among the eulogists, Liz Cheney, his eldest daughter, only obliquely addressed what amounted to a father-daughter feud with the president — a man her dad had called a “coward” for trying to overturn his loss in the 2020 election.

She spoke of her father's conviction that when confronted with a choice between defending the country and a political party, the country must come first. “Bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she said.

A former high-ranking House member whose Republican political career was shredded by Trump's MAGA movement, Liz Cheney chose not to speak directly of Trump. She spoke of seeing clouds in the shape of angels just before her father died.

Moments before the service began, figures of recent but now receded power mingled: Bush and Biden and their wives sitting in a row together, former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris and Mike Pence chatting side by side in their pew with Al Gore and Dan Quayle together behind them. 

Biden greeted Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former longtime Senate leader, and his wife, former labor and transportation secretary Elaine Chao. Behind them sat Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker. All gathered in the grand cathedral known as “a spiritual home for the nation.”

Others delivering tributes at Thursday's funeral were Cheney's longtime cardiologist, Jonathan Reiner; former NBC News correspondent Pete Williams, who was Cheney's spokesman at the Pentagon; and the former vice president's grandchildren. Six grandchildren were there — a seventh is about to give birth.

“I'm happy to report that I haven't given many eulogies,” Reiner said in his remarks. “Nobody wants a doctor who is great at funerals.” 

Reiner recalled doctors telling Cheney decades ago, after the first of multiple heart attacks, that he should abandon his political ambitions then. Yet he kept winning elections as a Wyoming congressman for years after that.

Cheney, he said, was always the “calmest person in the room.”

Cheney had lived with heart disease for decades and, after the Bush administration, with a heart transplant. He died at age 84 from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said.

Trump's vice president, JD Vance, on stage at another event in the morning, was asked about Cheney and said: “Obviously there's some political disagreements there but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.”

Vance was also not invited to the funeral, according to a person familiar with the details who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The White House lowered its flags to half-staff after Cheney's death, as it said the law calls for, but Trump did not issue the presidential proclamation that often accompanies the death of notable figures, nor has he commented publicly on his passing.

The deeply conservative Cheney's influence in the Bush administration was legendary and, to his critics, tragic.

He advocated for the U.S. invasion of Iraq on the basis of what proved to be faulty intelligence and consistently defended the extraordinary tools of surveillance, detention and inquisition employed in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Bush credited him with helping to keep the country safe and stable in a perilous time.

After the 2020 election won by Biden, Liz Cheney served as vice chair of the Democratic-led special House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. She accused Trump of summoning the violent mob and plunging the nation into “a moment of maximum danger.”

For that, she was stripped of her Republican leadership position and ultimately defeated in a 2022 Republican primary in Wyoming. In a campaign TV ad made for his daughter, Dick Cheney branded Trump a “coward” who “tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.”

Last year, it did not sit well with Trump when Cheney said he would vote for the Democrat, Harris, in the presidential election.

Trump told Arab and Muslim voters that Dick Cheney's support for Harris should give them pause, because he “killed more Arabs than any human being on Earth. He pushed Bush, and they went into the Middle East.”

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — GE Appliances on Thursday touted wide-ranging ripple effects from shifting production from China to Kentucky as it announced more than $150 million in new contracts awarded to U.S.-based suppliers.

The supplier contracts range in value from $330,000 to $41 million, span 10 states and cover crucial segments of the supplier chain for the appliance maker's washer and dryer production — from plastics and castings to steel and aluminum, the company said. The suppliers range in size from U.S. Steel to family-owned companies.

With the new contracts, GE Appliances said it is increasing domestic spending on suppliers by 3.3%.

The suppliers will support production of a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers, all of which GE Appliances is moving from China to its sprawling Louisville complex known as Appliance Park. The company says it's investing $490 million to retool a plant for the project, which will create 800 new jobs.

Production is scheduled to begin in early 2027, it said, and will expand the total footprint devoted to clothes care production at Appliance Park to the equivalent of 33 football fields.

“When we invest in U.S. manufacturing and our people, it drives growth far beyond our own walls,” Lee Lagomarcino, a GE Appliances vice president, said Thursday in a news release. “These new supplier contracts represent what ‘Built for America' is all about — investing in U.S. manufacturing, creating more American jobs and building opportunity that multiplies.”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




The announcements come as President Donald Trump attempts to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes — tariffs — on foreign goods. The president recently said the U.S. would lower tariffs implemented earlier this year as punishment on China for its selling of chemicals used to make fentanyl from 20% to 10%. That brings the total combined tariff rate on China down from 57% to 47%.




The $150 million-plus in new supplier contracts reflects the amount GE Appliances will spend each year for shipments of parts, components and raw materials to produce the washers and dryers, it said. Contract values could increase if sales of the washers and dryers grow, the company said.

GE Appliances said it spends $4.6 billion with more than 6,500 U.S. suppliers, a 69% increase in spending and a 58% rise in its number of suppliers since 2019. Its U.S. supply chain has grown for more than a decade, it said.

“While tariffs have certainly been a factor, there are also many other benefits such as shorter lead times, reduced transportation costs and the ability to collaborate with your supply chain to ultimately serve our customers better,” Lagomarcino said.

The new contracts were awarded to businesses in Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Alabama and California, GE Appliances said. It awarded more than $40 million in contracts to suppliers in Kentucky, more than in any other state.

The contracts are the first of many expected ripple effects from its broader, five-year, $3 billion commitment to strengthen its U.S. manufacturing, reshore certain production and create more than 1,000 jobs, the company said. GE Appliances announced plans in August to shift production of refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters out of China and Mexico. The company also has manufacturing plants in South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Connecticut. The company is a subsidiary of the China-based Haier company.

BOSTON (AP) — Inside the wide mouth of a stoneware jar, Daisy Whitner's fingertips found a slight rise in the clay — a mark she hoped was a trace left behind by her ancestor, an enslaved potter who shaped the vessel nearly 175 years ago in South Carolina.

Standing in the gallery of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston last week, Whitner said she felt a quiet connection to her ancestor, David Drake, in that moment.

“I was telling the kids, 'Inside this jar, I'm sure I'm feeling his tears, sweat drops off his face, his arms,'” said 86-year-old Whitner, a Washington, D.C., resident and a retired account manager for The Washington Post.

The jar is one of two returned to Drake's family as part of a historic agreement this month between Drake's descendants and the MFA Boston, one of the institutions that holds pieces of his work.

The vessels are among hundreds of surviving works by “Dave the Potter,” an enslaved man who labored in the alkaline-glazed stoneware potteries of Edgefield, South Carolina, in the decades before and during the Civil War. Dave signed many of his jars — and inscribed some with rhyming couplets — an extraordinary and unparalleled assertion of identity and authorship during a time when literacy for enslaved people was criminalized.

The agreement represents what experts say is the first major case of art restitution involving works created by an enslaved person in the U.S. — a process traditionally associated with families seeking the return of art looted by the Nazis in World War II.

It's also rare: as enslaved people were denied legal personhood and documentation, tracing the ownership or lineage of their works is often impossible.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Children's book author Yaba Baker, Dave's 54-year-old fourth-generation grandson, called the return “a spiritual restoration.” Baker, whose first two children's books explore Black history, said the family felt a dual sense of pride and grief. Many Black families, he noted, struggle to trace their ancestry past a few generations; recovering Dave's work gave them back a piece of themselves.




After the museum returned the pots to the family, they sold one back so people can continue to learn from Dave's legacy. The other is on lease to the museum, at least temporarily. The MFA Boston said it wouldn't disclose how much it paid.

“We don't want to hide them away in our house. We want other people to be inspired by it,” Baker said. “We want people to know that this person, Dave the Potter, who was told he was nothing but a tool to be used, realized he had humanity. He deserved his own name on his pots. He deserved to write poetry. He deserved to know who he was.”

Laboring in the pottery yards in the South Carolina heat, Dave etched his name next to the date — July 12, 1834 — on a clay jar that would be sold by his owner and used to store pork and beef rations for enslaved people like him across the region.

He also inscribed the jar, which would likely end up on a cotton plantation in South Carolina, with the couplet: 

“Put every bit all between / Surely this jar will hold 14” to mark the jar's 14-gallon capacity.

The vessel was the first of hundreds, if not thousands, of stoneware jugs and jars made by Dave alongside other enslaved potters over 50 years before and during the Civil War.

Much of Dave's poetry followed Christian themes. As he aged, he wrote more and explored themes related to his enslavement. One of his most resonant poems was etched into a jar he produced in 1857, around the time scholars believe Dave and his family were separated after being sold to different slave owners. 

“I wonder where is all my relation / friendship to all – and every nation”

Multiple Drake descendants said they felt especially moved by Dave's question about his relations — and that their restitution felt like Dave's question was finally answered. 

It's unclear what became of the jars after Dave died. The MFA purchased them in 1997 from an art dealer. MFA Boston's Art of the Americas Chair Ethan Lasser said he thinks they survived mostly from pure “benign neglect” in South Carolina because they were large and difficult to transport or break. 

The MFA has two Drake pots, a “Poem Jar” and a “Signed Jar,” both from 1857.

The jar the Drake descendants sold back to the museum is similar to the 1857 pot on which Dave asks about his relations because he uses first-person language that suggests ownership — something that makes it especially powerful, Lasser said.

“Think of this as an enslaved person, speaking in the first person claiming authorship,” Lasser said.

In the poem, Dave writes: 

“I made this Jar = cash – / though its called = lucre Trash”.

On more than one pot, Dave writes “and Mark” next to his own name, suggesting he worked on the piece with another enslaved laborer. Oral histories indicate that Dave was disabled after losing a leg, although it's unclear how, and may have needed help with his ceramic work later in life.

His last surviving jar, made as the Civil War raged on in 1862, reads: “I made this Jar, all of cross / If you don't repent, you will be lost”.

Researchers believe Drake died sometime in the 1870s after gaining his freedom in the Civil War. He is accounted for in the 1870 census, but not in the 1880 census. 

For the Drake descendants, encountering Dave's work has been both moving and difficult — a collision of pride in his artistry and grief for the conditions in which he lived. 

Yaba Baker, who has a 17-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son, said the experience gave his family something they had never had before: a traceable link.

“I was able to turn to my son and say, ‘This is your lineage.' Dave the Potter was not only a great artist — he resisted oppressive laws, even though he could have been killed for it,” he said. “That's what you come from. Before, we didn't have that link.”

Yaba Baker said he often thinks about the anguish Dave may have felt if, as some historians speculate, the poems on his jars were attempts to signal to family members sold away from him — a common trauma of slavery.

“I can't imagine not knowing where my own kids are,” Baker said. “Completing that circle is very moving for me.”

For his mother, Pauline Baker, discovering Dave's story filled a void many Black families know intimately.

“If you're not African American, you don't understand the missing links in your history,” she said. “When you do find a connection, it becomes very personal.” She studies his life — the heat, the labor, the loss of a limb — and wonders how he managed such precision and focus. “He did not allow them to enslave his mind,” said Baker, 78, a retired speech pathologist who worked for three decades in Washington, D.C., public schools.

Since the MFA agreement was announced, the family has heard from museums and private collectors who hold Dave's work and want to discuss what ethical restitution might look like for them as well.

Daisy Whitner said she felt her ancestor's presence each time she slid her hand inside the jar.

“It broke my heart,” she said. “The outside is beautiful, but when you think about what he went through — sunup to sundown, in that South Carolina heat, on one leg — this poor man in bondage had no say in working so hard for nothing.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Big swings keep rocking Wall Street, and U.S. stocks erased a huge morning gain on Thursday as skittishness continues to dominate the market following weeks of doubts and erratic moves. 

The S&P 500 dropped to a loss of 0.7% after initially soaring 1.9%, which would have marked its best day since May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 231 points, or 0.5%, as of 12:15 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1% lower. 

The sharpest losses came again from what used to be the market's biggest winners. Technology stocks, cryptocurrencies and other areas of the market that had been soaring with nearly relentless momentum, as traders feared missing out on more gains, dropped. Bitcoin fell below $87,000, down from nearly $125,000 last month, for example.

The market had been shaky coming into Thursday, largely because of twin worries: Nvidia and other superstar stocks caught up in the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology may have simply shot too high, and the Federal Reserve may be done delivering the invigorating cuts to interest rates that Wall Street loves. 

Nvidia initially appeared to tamp down the worries about a potential bubble for AI stocks after reporting another big profit for the summer that topped analysts' expectations, along with a forecast for coming revenue that easily cleared analysts' estimates. By delivering big profits and indicating more are coming, Nvidia can justify its stock's price gains and make it look less expensive.

Given the forecasts that Nvidia gave late Wednesday, “it is very hard to see how this stock does not keep moving higher from here,” according to analysts at UBS led by Timothy Arcuri. They also said “the AI infrastructure tide is still rising so fast that all boats will be lifted.” 




Nvidia jumped to an early gain of 5% but then dropped to a loss of 1.5%, sending it again 10% below its record. Because it's the biggest company in the U.S. market by value, Nvidia's stock has more pull on the S&P 500 than any other company's. 

Worries about a potential AI bubble aren't gone. The concern among investors is that all the dollars pouring into AI chips and data centers may not ultimately produce the big profits and productivity for the economy that proponents have been promising. 

Yes, Nvidia expects to sell another $65 billion of chips in the coming three months, which is more than analysts expected. But will all those chips turn into much bigger profits for Amazon and other companies using them? They still need to prove that all the investment in AI chips are worth the cost. 

The most recent survey of global fund managers by Bank of America showed a record percentage of investors saying companies are “overinvesting.” That helped make a potential AI bubble the No. 1 risk that they saw for the market, one with a lower probability of happening but a chance of very big damage. 

Amazon went from an early gain of 2.1% Thursday to a loss of 1.3%. Palantir Technologies swung from a jump of 5.5% to a loss of 4.3%. 

For the second worry that's been dogging Wall Street, Thursday's jobs report from the U.S. government offered some relief. 

Financial markets initially seemed to pick the data apart for encouraging signals, according to Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. The report showed hiring by U.S. employers was stronger in September than economists expected, which may suggest the economy remains solid. But it also said the unemployment rate worsened slightly, which could give the Fed reason to cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in December.

Traders still see a December rate cut as relatively unlikely, giving it a roughly 40% probability, according to data from CME Group. But that's better than the 30% chance they saw a day earlier, before the September jobs report.

What the Fed does is critical for the stock market because prices ran to records in part because of expectations for continued cuts to rates. The Fed has already cut rates twice this year to shore up the slowing job market. But lower rates can also worsen inflation, which has stubbornly remained  above the Fed's 2% target. 

On the winning side of Wall Street was Walmart, which rallied 5.8% after the retailer delivered another standout quarter. It reported strong sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations as it continues to lure cash-strapped Americans nervous about the economy and prices.

In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.08% from 4.13% late Wednesday. 

In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. 

Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 2.6%, and South Korea's Kospi rose 1.9% for two of the bigger gains.

When former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral is held at the Washington National Cathedral in the nation's capital, he will join a bipartisan but exclusive list of figures memorialized there.

WASHINGTON (AP) — When former Vice President Dick Cheney ‘s funeral is held Thursday at the Washington National Cathedral in the nation's capital, he will join a bipartisan but exclusive list of towering figures memorialized there, in a church that tells the story of America on hallowed ground.

Presidents from Dwight D. Eisenhower to Jimmy Carter have received state funerals at the gothic-style cathedral. Funeral services have also been held there for Thurgood Marshall, the first Black Supreme Court Justice, and the moonwalking astronaut Neil Armstrong. The list of notable figures interred at the cathedral includes the author and activist Hellen Keller. Just one president, Woodrow Wilson, is buried there.

The church's history and tradition, said Washington National Cathedral Provost Rev. Canon Jan Naylor Cope, put it “at the intersection of the civic and the sacred.” The funerals held there shed light both on the deceased and their place in the country's history.

Titans of American history keep watch over the cathedral, as statues of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln stand in two separate bays near the entrance of the nave. The cathedral has five chapels on the main level and four chapels and burial vaults on the lower level, or the crypt.

French-born architect Pierre L'Enfant's original design for Washington included a church “for national purposes.” In 1893, a congressional charter was authorized to build a cathedral dedicated to religion, education and charity.




Construction on the Protestant Episcopalian church began in 1907, with President Theodore Roosevelt present to help lay the foundation, but wasn't totally completed until 1990. Today, the cathedral stands as the sixth largest in the world and is the second largest in the country, following the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. 

For Eisenhower's 1969 funeral, the World War II general was dressed in his wartime military uniform and at his request placed in a simple, government-issued casket that was meant for regular U.S. soldiers, according to the White House Historical Association.

At former President Ronald Reagan's funeral in 2004, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher — a partner of Reagan's in confronting the Soviet Union — was one of the attendees, but her eulogy, recorded weeks earlier as her health was deteriorating, was aired to mourners by video. Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who negotiated over nuclear arms with Reagan in the final years of the Cold War, was also there.

For astronaut Armstrong, eulogies meshed the divine with the extraterrestrial. Armstrong's legacy was already linked to the church, as a sliver of moon rock collected by his Apollo 11 mission has been located inside a stained-glass window there known as the “Space Window” since its dedication in 1974.

At Cheney's funeral, the second held at the cathedral for a vice president, former President George W. Bush will speak, as will Cheney's daughter, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney. 

There is a selective list of Americans who are interred within the cathedral compound. President Woodrow Wilson is the only president who is buried there, along with his wife, first lady Edith Wilson. The ashes of Matthew Shepard, the gay American student at the University of Wyoming who was beaten, tortured and left to die near Laramie, Wyoming, on Oct. 6, 1998, are also interred at the cathedral.

“It's a pilgrimage,” Cope said of visits to Shepard's grave. “And it lives into our hope and desire to be a house of prayer for all people. No exceptions.”

Initially, those buried within the cathedral were people associated with the building itself, including some clergy and some of the cathedral's original stone carvers. For the others — 220 in total are interred there — it was a choice of their families or their own and those interested must apply. 

Even some of the cathedral's ornate 215 stained-glass windows tell the story of the nation. It permanently removed stained-glass windows commemorating Confederate Gens. Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson in 2017, after a reckoning that forced its leaders to ask whether the windows, installed in 1953, were “an appropriate part of the sacred fabric of a spiritual home for the nation.” New windows with a racial justice theme replaced the old ones in 2023. 

Many presidents have visited the cathedral for prayer. During the Iran hostage crisis, Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale gathered there to pray for the captives held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Inaugural prayer services have also been held for presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and most recently, Donald Trump.

Cope said the cathedral, the final stop on a journey for some, could be a place of introspection in the lives of others.

“I would hope that a place like this, designed to inspire and to bring awe as gothic architecture does and gothic cathedrals do, would continue to inspire the next generation,” said Cope, “to live a life of meaning that matters and makes a difference.”

Protesters in Charlotte urge Home Depot to keep immigration officers off its property

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Federal agents have now arrested more than 250 people during a North Carolina immigration crackdown centered around Charlotte, the state's largest city, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday.

The operation that began over the weekend is the latest phase of Republican President Donald Trump's aggressive mass deportation efforts that have sent the military and immigration agents into Democratic-run cities — from Chicago to Los Angeles. 

Immigration officials have blanketed the country since January, pushing detention counts to all-time highs above 60,000. Big cities and small towns across the country are targeted daily amid higher-profile pushes in places such as Portland, Oregon, where more than 560 immigration arrests were made in October. Smaller bursts of enforcement have popped up elsewhere.

The push to carry out arrests in North Carolina expanded to areas around the state capital of Raleigh on Tuesday, spreading fear in at least one immigrant-heavy suburb. 

Federal agents in North Carolina are expanding their immigration crackdown. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports.

Late Wednesday, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said via the social platform X that “border patrol enforcement appears to have been suspended” in the city. DHS did not announce a change to its presence and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The number of arrests around Charlotte and beyond during what the government has dubbed “ Operation Charlotte's Web ” was about double the total announced by DHS officials earlier this week. The department said in a statement that agencies “continue to target some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens.”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Their targets include people living in the U.S. without legal permission and those who allegedly have criminal records.




Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They've also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge.

The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests.

About 100 people gathered outside a Home Depot store in Charlotte on Wednesday, where federal agents have been spotted multiple times since the surge started. Protest organizers briefly went inside the store with orange and white signs that read, “ICE out of Home Depot, Protect our communities.”

Arrests in Charlotte and the Raleigh area have created a chilling effect in immigrant neighborhoods — school attendance dropped, and small shops and restaurants closed to avoid confrontations between customers and federal agents.

Customers at a laundromat left behind their clothes in washers and dryers and haven't returned after agents showed up at a Charlotte shopping center on Sunday, said David Rebolloso, who owns the business.

Agents didn't target his laundromat, but it still impacted his bottom line and shut down the neighboring shops, said Rebolloso, a Mexican American born in Brownsville, Texas. 

“We're only open because I'm an American citizen, so it doesn't bother me,” he said. “But of course, business is down. I have no customers.”

Just days after beginning the crackdown in North Carolina, Border Patrol agents were expected to arrive in New Orleans by the end of the week to start preparing for their next big operation in southeast Louisiana, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press and three people familiar with the operation.

Around 250 federal border agents are set to descend on New Orleans in the coming weeks for a two-month immigration crackdown expected to begin in earnest on Dec. 1.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander tapped to head the Louisiana sweep, has been on the ground in North Carolina this week, leading the operation there as well. 

Louisiana Republicans voiced their support on Wednesday. The chair of the state party, Derek Babcock, said it shows a commitment from Trump and Republican Gov. Jeff Landry to “keeping our citizens safe.” 

The head of the state's American Civil Liberties Union chapter said they were compiling information to help people know their rights and coordinating with legal services and groups connected with the immigrant community.

“We urge those with privilege and the opportunity to risk it to stand up for their neighbors and friends,” said Alanah Odoms with the ACLU of Louisiana.

A California mother and father were convicted on Tuesday of stabbing and decapitating their 13-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son, then forcing their two younger children to look at the bodies, authorities said.

Natalie Sumiko Brothwell, 48, and Maurice Jewel Taylor Sr., 39, were found guilty of murdering their 13-year-old daughter, Maliaka, and 12-year-old son, Maurice, inside the family's Lancaster home on Nov. 29, 2020, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said.

""This was a monstrous act of cruelty that shattered an entire family,"" Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan J. Hochman said in a news release on Tuesday. ""Two innocent children were brutally murdered, and their young brothers were left to live through unimaginable horror.""

Firefighters discovered the bodies five days later while responding to a possible gas leak, FOX11 Los Angeles reported. Brothwell, Taylor, and the couple's other two sons, then aged 8 and 9, were also inside the home.

UConn's Silas Demary Jr lobbed it to Eric Reibe for the and-1 vs. Arizona. 

UConn head coach Dan Hurley was pretty blunt in his assessment of the team's 71-67 loss to No. 4 Arizona on Wednesday night at Gampel Pavilion. 

Hurley's squad was without two of its top players – senior center Tarris Reed Jr. and five-star freshman Braylon Mullins – in the close loss, and the two-time champion head coach ripped up the stat sheet in disgust. 

""We just f---ing blew a chance to beat one of the best teams, down two studs,"" Hurley said postgame at his press conference.

The No. 3 Huskies were dominated on the boards, as the Wildcats outrebounded them 43-23, yet they were still in the game. Hurley expressed his displeasure with the team's lack of fight. 

""We should have been minus-10 on the glass today. I mean, we got punked. We punked out. It's going to be a bad film session coming out of here where there are people; there's a street fight going on in the paint and men can't watch fights,"" Hurley said.

""You know, men, you can't stand on the outside when your buddies are in a fight. You get in the fight, you don't stand on the periphery of the fight. And I think we're going to see a lot of clips where guys were not in the fight with their teammates.""

Despite being outrebounded and committing more fouls (the Huskies had 21 fouls to the Wildcats' 16), they went stride for stride with Arizona. UConn clawed back to tie the game at 60-60 after trailing by 13 with 13:44 left in the game.

But down the stretch, Arizona executed better and pulled out the win in the battle of two of the top five teams in the nation. 

The loss was UConn's first of the year, dropping them to 4-1. They will look to bounce back against Bryant (1-4) on Sunday at 6 p.m. ET. 

Arizona improved to 5-0 with the win and will look to continue their hot start to the season against Denver (1-3) at 10:30 p.m. ET.

Police in New York have arrested a 33-year-old woman in connection with the brutal death of a 52-year-old man outside a yacht club on Long Island's scenic north shore.

The Stony Brook Yacht Club parking lot is better known for kayak launches and wedding photos than crime scene tape, but police allege that Kacy Corso, who lived in nearby Setauket, was involved in the stabbing death of Christopher Millwater, of Selden.

The altercation began in the parking lot across from 21 Shore Road, used by visitors to a pair of marinas and also a restaurant and wedding venue, the Three Village Inn, about 60 miles east of New York City.

The yacht club itself is surrounded by cameras, with several affixed to each light pole, and sources tell Fox News Digital much of the violence was caught on video.

Corso was due in court in Central Islip Thursday morning on a charge of second-degree murder. Under New York law, that's the charge for intentional murder.

It was not immediately clear whether additional charges were expected.

A July post from a Facebook account in Corso's name appears to show she knew Millwater before his death.

The same account also posted at least one other picture from the yacht club parking lot in July, taken from a space near the boat ramp, where fishermen can access the mouth of the channel from the dock. Millwater ""liked"" one of her posts from days earlier.

Court records show she racked up unrelated charges at another boat launch in the area earlier this year.

On May 5, she was charged with illegally accessing the boat ramp parking lot in the neighboring town of Smithtown and with entering or remaining in a park or beach area after dark.

According to Millwater's Facebook page, he was given an ""all clear"" in October following a battle with cancer.

His sister told the local TV station, News 12, that Stony Brook was his favorite place to go fishing.

Karina Pasian was tapped to sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" before the NFL's first-ever regular-season game in Spain over the weekend but drew backlash on social media for her outfit choice.

Pasian came out onto the field in a black mini dress with thigh-high stockings and garters to sing the national anthem. While the backlash was rather harsh, Pasian explained in an interview with TMZ Sports that she was surprised with the negative criticism.

""I honestly had no expectations with anyone saying anything. I felt great in what I chose to wear. I worked with two stylists of mine named David and Adrianne and they're amazing and they brought my vision to life,"" Pasian said. ""It wasn't my intention to offend anyone. I'm really sorry if anyone felt offended by it, but my intention was to have a good time.""

""My look is super cabaret and super burlesque. That's the aesthetic I love. I really admire that aesthetic.""

""I've read a lot of positive comments, and I'm trying to feed into more of that energy. That's what I try to focus on and what I'm trying to spread. People have a right to express their opinion,"" she added.

Pasian has been in the music industry for quite a while. Her R&B album, ""First Love,"" reached No. 11 on the U.S. R&B charts and No. 57 on the overall U.S. charts when it debuted in August 2008.

Panelists Sonja Shaw and Ryan Walters discuss a Harvard professor's remarks about conservative views at the university, a report on incoming University of California students' math struggles and more on 'Fox News @ Night.' 

The Anchorage School District in Alaska admitted it made a ""mistake"" by adding a disclaimer saying that the school district ""does not endorse these materials or the viewpoints expressed"" on a flyer which solely contained the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. 

A parent in Anchorage was shocked to find the sticker after her daughter brought the pamphlet home, which was handed out to students in class.

""Today my daughter brought home a pamphlet with the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution,"" Karen Waldron posted to Facebook. ""On the back was a sticker saying that the Anchorage School District ‘does not endorse the materials or viewpoints expressed in them.'""

""I was honestly stunned,"" Waldron continued. ""These aren't controversial documents, they are the foundation of our country and what our students are supposed to be learning about. Why would a school need to distance itself from the very principles we are built on?""

""I'll be asking the district for an explanation,"" Waldron concluded in the post. 

Fox News Digital spoke with Waldron on the phone, who expressed frustration about the situation and said the wording on the sticker was highly inappropriate. 

Waldron explained that she fully supports transparency in education and just wants to understand the thinking behind the sticker being placed on every packet.

Waldron also told Fox News Digital that parents deserve clarity and that if outside materials are being sent home, especially involving American founding documents, the messaging should be thoughtful and not confusing to families.

Anchorage Daily News reported that M.J. Thim, a spokesperson for the school district, said that the disclaimers were a ""mistake"" and that the flyers ""shouldn't have been processed"" through a system that adds the stickers to materials that come from outside the school district. 

""This was our mistake,"" Thim wrote to the Anchorage Daily News. ""The request that came in wasn't for a flyer or poster and shouldn't have been processed through that system. We will be following up directly with the requestor to make things right.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the school district but did not receive a response. 

The flyer was produced by Hillsdale College, as illustrated on the back of the pamphlet, which also displayed the disclaimer from the Anchorage School District. 

Alaska Attorney General Stephen J. Cox also weighed in on the disclaimer on the pamphlet, calling the school district's actions ""deeply concerning.""

WISCONSIN STUDENT SAID TEACHER PRESSURED HER TO PUBLICLY IDENTIFY POLITICAL PARTY DESPITE SAFETY FEARS

""The Declaration of Independence and Constitution are foundational American documents, and it is essential to teach students about the birth of our nation, their rights, and the government's duty to protect those rights,"" Cox told Fox News Digital. ""The stickers only invite confusion about these founding documents.""

The packet was handed out to students across Anchorage Public Schools. (iStock)

""Shortly after the news broke, the School District took ownership, apologized, and promised corrective action,"" Cox added. ""The Law Department and the Department of Education and Early Development have followed up with the District with specific questions, but in a spirit of cooperation, we have offered to help review ASD's policies and procedures to ensure it never happens again.""

Following the backlash and public spotlight on the flyer, the spokesperson from the Anchorage School District told Anchorage Daily News that the district is reviewing the process to ensure it doesn't happen again and that the ""founding documents are taught in every school and reflect the values we want every student to understand.""

Hillsdale College did not respond to a request for comment.

The Department of Justice has charged Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-FL) with stealing $5 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds and laundering it, and using the proceeds for her 2021 congressional campaign.

A federal grand jury in Miami handed down the indictment. McCormick was first elected to Congress in 2022 in a special election after the death of Rep. Alcee Hastings. She then won general elections in 2022 and 2024.

Cherfilus-McCormick and her brother's family healthcare company allegedly received a $5 million overpayment from FEMA in 2021 and hid the money through multiple accounts before rerouting a “substantial portion” of it to her congressional campaign.

She and co-conspirator Nadege Leblanc, 46, allegedly gave the illicit money to relatives who then donated to her campaign via a straw donor scheme.

Cherfilus-McCormick and her 2021 tax preparer, David K. Spencer, are also accused of conspiring to file a false federal tax return because they allegedly “falsely claimed political spending and other personal expenses as business deductions and inflated charitable contributions in order to reduce her tax obligations.”

Cherfilus-McCormick is the second House Democrat to be charged with a crime this year after Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ) was charged with impeding federal officers in June.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is from Florida, condemned Cherfilus-McCormick's actions. 

“Using disaster relief funds for self-enrichment is a particularly selfish, cynical crime,” she said in a statement. “No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain. We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.”

McCormick had been under the scrutiny of the House Ethics Committee after being referred by the Office of Congressional Ethics. 

SHEILA CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK MAY HAVE VIOLATED HOUSE RULES AND CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS, ETHICS PANEL SAYS

The Washington Examiner reported that the OCE recommended the Ethics Committee look into whether she requested community project funding for a for-profit entity, accepted campaign contributions linked to an official action, and whether her office either made payments to an entity or her campaign accepted and failed to report in-kind contributions

The DOJ said Cherfilus-McCormick faces up to 53 years in prison if convicted. Her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, faces up to 35 years, Spencer up to 33 years, and LeBlanc up to 10 years in prison.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A half-dozen Democratic veterans in Congress released a joint video urging U.S. service members to disobey unlawful orders, though they did not specify what those would be.

Sens. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and Reps. Jason Crow (D-CO), Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Chris Deluzio (D-PA), and Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA) said the “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home.” They repeatedly urged military and intelligence personnel to “refuse illegal orders.”

None of the Democrats in the video specified what illegal orders they should be concerned about or what to do if they believe they are given one.

Trump blasts ‘seditious' Democratic veterans: ‘Punishable by death'

“We are standing by our troops, our service members who are often put in very difficult positions and Donald Trump has put them in very difficult positions and has alluded to putting them in even more difficult positions in the months and years ahead, so we are reminding folks about what the uniform code of military justice says, what the Constitution says, what the law of war says,” Crow said on Fox News on Wednesday afternoon.

He cited President Donald Trump's musings during his first term about whether service members could shoot U.S. protesters in the leg, his more recent decisions to send the National Guard into several U.S. cities to crack down on illegal activities, and possibly sending U.S. troops to election polling stations.

“Donald Trump has made a series of very disturbing comments and suggestions that would violate U.S. law and put our military in a terrible position,” Crow, a former Army ranger, added. “I don't want to wait until that happens to remind our troops of this obligation because then it will be too late.”

Republicans rebuked the Democrats' video.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn said on Fox, “It is inconceivable that you would have elected officials that are saying to uniformed members of the military who have taken an oath that they would defy the orders that they have been given to execute their mission.”

Similarly, War Secretary Pete Hegseth responded to the video on social media, saying, “Stage 4 [Trump Derangement Syndrome].”

Crow denied that they were referring to the ongoing military operations in the Caribbean in the video. The military currently has its largest buildup of U.S. forces in the Western Hemisphere in decades. Since early September, the military has carried out roughly 20 lethal airstrikes on vessels they claim were carrying drugs intended for the United States, killing more than 80 people.

The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel found in July that the U.S. troops involved in the lethal targeting of alleged drug smuggling vessels would not be exposed to future prosecution.

“We got lawyers on lawyers, all the authorities necessary to do so, treating these terrorists like the al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere,” Hegseth said last week.

Service members are required to follow lawful orders in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and they can face prosecution for following unlawful orders. 

DOJ MEMO SAYS US TROOPS SAFE FROM PROSECUTION OVER SMUGGLING BOAT STRIKES

The precedent of whether a service member can face charges for following an illegal order came out of the trial of Lt. William Calley, who participated in the March 1968 slaughter of hundreds of Vietnamese individuals known as the My Lai massacre. Calley took the stand in his own case, stating that his superior, Capt. Ernest Medina, who was later court-martialed and ultimately acquitted, had directed him to kill everyone in the village.

Calley's defense team got the defense idea from the Nuremberg trials of captured Nazis following World War II.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance will not attend former Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral Thursday, as they were not invited. 

Former President George W. Bush, former President Joe Biden, and all living former vice presidents will attend the funeral. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama will not attend.

Speakers at the funeral will include Bush, with whom Cheney served in the White House from 2001 to 2009, and Cheney's daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney.

The elder Cheney long disliked Trump for repeatedly criticizing his daughter for her conduct during the congressional investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. 

“In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said in a 2022 campaign ad for his daughter. 

Cheney added, “He is a coward. A real man wouldn't lie to his supporters. He lost his election, and he lost big. I know it. He knows it, and deep down, I think most Republicans know.”

He also said he would vote for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 elections, which prompted Trump to call him “an irrelevant RINO,” short for Republican in name only, on Truth Social.

Other prominent political figures expected to be in attendance include House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), and Supreme Court Justices John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, and Elena Kagan.

New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani vowed again this week to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu should expose the weakness and dishonesty behind that threat by accepting the invitations of New York's Jewish leaders to attend Mamdani's inauguration. If Mamdani wants to open his term with an unlawful international incident, let him. The clarity would be invaluable.

Mamdani first pledged to use the New York City Police Department to arrest Netanyahu in September, two years after he said the NYPD “boot on your neck is laced by the IDF.” Mamdani, who has echoed Hamas's call to “globalize the intifada,” said Netanyahu is a “war criminal” who has committed “genocide” in Gaza.

Last November, the International Criminal Court indicted Netanyahu for “starvation as a method of warfare,” “intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population,” and other “crimes against humanity” tied to his military response to Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, massacre of Israelis.

“This is something that I intend to fulfill,” Mamdani said in September before his election. “It is my desire to ensure that this be a city that stands up for international law.”

In an interview this week with a local television station, Mamdani again pledged to try and enforce the ICC arrest warrants.

“I've said time and again that I believe this is a city of international law, and being a city of international law means looking to uphold international law,” he said. “And that means upholding the warrants from the International Criminal Court, whether they're for Benjamin Netanyahu or Vladimir Putin.”

“We are a global city,” Mamdani continued, “and what New Yorkers are looking for is consistency in the way we talk about our values and follow through with them.”

Every utterance from Mamdani is a lie. New York is not a global city. It is an American city, under the jurisdiction of, first, the state of New York, but ultimately the United States. As such, New York has no authority whatsoever to enter into international agreements or enforce what its mayor deems to be international law. 

To put it bluntly: International law does not exist outside of what the U.S. has chosen to be a party to. And the U.S. never signed on to the complete and total farce that is the ICC.

Adopted at a United Nations conference in 1998, the Rome Statute has 139 signatories, though neither the U.S. nor Israel is among them. Washington has long viewed the ICC as a risk to its ability to conduct national defense, a concern vindicated in 2020 when the court authorized an investigation of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. No indictments came, but the willingness to entertain such a case exposed the hazards of the court's ambitions.

Far from an impartial tribunal, the ICC functions as a tool of a decadent international elite, one that turns a blind eye to butchers such as former Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is responsible for more than 300,000 civilian deaths, while pursuing nations acting in self-defense, as Israel did after Oct. 7.

THE SOCIALIST TAKEOVER OF DEMOCRATIC CITIES

Mamdani has no legal authority to enforce ICC warrants, and any attempt by him or the NYPD to obstruct Netanyahu's movements in New York would constitute a direct violation of federal law. If Mamdani or anyone acting on his orders so much as lays a hand on Netanyahu, they would expose themselves to federal prosecution, and President Donald Trump would be fully justified in sending him to prison.

It is no surprise that New York's Jewish community was alarmed to hear its mayor repeating the slogans of terrorists who want them annihilated. Netanyahu could expose Mamdani's bluster for what it is by showing up at his inauguration and revealing how empty and cowardly his threats truly are.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, releasing files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein a day after the House and Senate approved the legislation.

Trump said he would sign the bill after reversing his long-held opposition to the resolution and encouraging Republicans to vote for it. 

“I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES! As everyone knows, I asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, to pass this Bill in the House and Senate, respectively. Because of this request, the votes were almost unanimous in favor of passage. At my direction, the Department of Justice has already turned over close to fifty thousand pages of documents to Congress,” Trump said on Truth Social.

In announcing the signing, the president painted Epstein as “a lifelong Democrat” who “donated Thousands of Dollars to Democrat Politicians, and was deeply associated with many well-known Democrat figures, such as Bill Clinton (who traveled on his plane 26 times), Larry Summers (who just resigned from many Boards, including Harvard), Sleazebag Political Activist Reid Hoffman, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (who asked Epstein to donate to his Campaign AFTER Epstein was charged), Democrat Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett, and many more.”

On Tuesday, the House approved a resolution with only one lawmaker, Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA), voting against it before transmitting it to the Senate, which fast-tracked the bill and sent it to Trump's desk. It marked one of the very few times during Trump's second administration that Congress has so defiantly ignored his wishes. 

Despite Speaker Mike Johnson‘s (R-LA) preference for the measure to include protections for whistleblowers and the victims of Epstein, the Senate did not make those changes. 

EPSTEIN FILES BILL HEADED TO TRUMP'S DESK AFTER SENATE GIVES GREEN LIGHT

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) brought the measure to the Senate floor that same day, where it passed via unanimous consent. 

Four Republicans—Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY), Nancy Mace (R-SC), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), and Lauren Boebert (R-CO)— provided the four votes needed to bring the measure up for a vote on the House floor via discharge petition. 

Massie, along with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), originally co-sponsored the discharge petition that forced a vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The House needed 218 signatures for the petition to force leadership to schedule a vote on legislation. After Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ) was sworn into office, 50 days after she won the seat to replace her late father Rep. Raul Grijalva, the petition reached 218 signatures. 

EVERY HOUSE REPUBLICAN, BAR ONE, VOTES TO RELEASE EPSTEIN FILES

The White House unsuccessfully attempted to pressure Greene, Boebert, and Mace from dropping their support of the petition. 

Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and FBI Director Kash Patel reportedly met with Boebert to pressure the congresswoman not to sign a petition in Congress. 

“Doesn't it show transparency that members of the Trump administration are willing to brief members of Congress whenever they please?” Leavitt responded during a press briefing last week about the meeting. 

Trump later branded Greene, the firebrand Georgia House member, a “traitor” over her support for releasing the Epstein files. 

“Let me tell you what a traitor is. A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves,” Greene responded during a press conference at the Capitol with survivors of Epstein's abuse on Tuesday. 

The president also ordered the FBI and the Justice Department to investigate Epstein's ties to leading Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, after the House Oversight Committee released thousands of Epstein emails publicly.

President Donald Trump posited a rhetorical question last weekend. “Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs?” Trump asked, continuing, “It's OK with me. Whatever we have to do to stop drugs.”

Really? “Whatever we have to do?”

I think not. Drug cartel activity from Mexico poses a far greater threat to U.S. national security and well-being than that of drug cartel activity out of Venezuela or Colombia. And it's not even close. These cartels smuggle truly vast amounts of drugs of all kinds across the U.S. border every day. The Drug Enforcement Administration's courage notwithstanding, the scale of drug smuggling makes drug seizures and indictments almost ludicrous in comparison. And Trump has, so far, limited his direct-action campaign against the drug cartels to Venezuela. The same applies to the sharper edges of CIA covert action.

TRUMP RIGHTLY FETES MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN AT THE WHITE HOUSE

However, in light of growing protests in Mexico against the drug cartels and the apparent unwillingness of President Claudia Sheinbaum's government to take more robust action against them, it's worth asking why Trump is sparing the Mexican cartels from more robust American action. There are indications that the Trump administration intends to bolster direct action against the two Mexican kingpin cartels: the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Trump has designated both as foreign terrorist organizations, and his ambassador to Mexico City is a former CIA paramilitary officer. Still, Trump's action against the Mexican cartels has thus far only involved boosted intelligence gathering operations and bolstered domestic law enforcement operations.

The CJNG is now the most dominant cartel in Mexico. It has pared back the power of other cartels, including El Chapo Guzman's once supreme Sinaloa Cartel. It has done so through its application of extreme aggression, financial creativity, and, more recently, by taking advantage of the Sinaloa Cartel's internal conflicts. The CJNG revels in violence that makes Islamic State terrorists look timid by comparison. Smuggling fentanyl, cocaine, and drugs of all types across the U.S. border to their strongholds in cities including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Houston, and Atlanta, the CJNG has built a highly lucrative American empire. CJNG operations targeting the United States include fraud, human smuggling, and money laundering. Operations in Mexico range from shaking down avocado farmers to stealing from the state oil company.

The degree to which the drug trade precipitates street violence and associated criminality underlines why Trump is justified in part in using force against cartels in their overseas bastions.

Mexico needs a stronger hand against these cartels.

Led by Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, also known as ‘El Mencho,' the CJNG ensures that politicians and security officials who dare challenge it face rapid, brutal executions. This threat is particularly problematic when it comes to local mayors who lack the kind of protection afforded to Mexican regional governors and federal politicians.

Consider Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan in the central Mexican state of Michoacán. Rejecting corruption and confronting the cartels for their extortion of avocado farmers, Manzo was gunned down on Nov. 1 as he celebrated the Day of the Dead at a public carnival. The well-sourced El Pais reported that the CJNG was responsible for the assassination. Sadly, neither the Michoacán regional government nor Sheinbaum's administration shares Manzo's courage and incorruptibility. This underlines why a growing protest movement is rising to demand better justice in his memory. This included a rare march outside the presidential palace last weekend.

The protesters' courageous rage is impressive. But the CJNG's threat is only growing. 

While Sheinbaum's Morena Party and her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, have traditionally maintained close links to the Sinaloa Cartel, political obedience to the CJNG will likely grow alongside its power. There has certainly been no sign of the kind of robust federal crackdown that the CJNG's threat to Mexican sovereignty plainly requires. Just as it's easy to snort cocaine and pretend that the ensuing ecstasy carries no consequences for American street corners and Mexican stability, it's easy and profitable to be a coward in Mexican politics. It's very dangerous to be an honorable public servant.

The CJNG's perverse reach extends across Latin America. The group retains a close alliance with the Ecuador-based Los Lobos crime group, for example. Responsible for the August 2023 assassination of Ecuadorian presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio, the Wolves then covered their tracks and showed their extraordinary reach by murdering seven members of the assassination team in prison. Although the group's leader was recently arrested in Spain, it remains a powerful organization. Similar to the CJNG in Mexico, the Wolves pose a threat to Ecuador's democratic stability.

The question bears repeating, then, why has Trump spared the CJNG and the Sinaloa Cartel the ferocity that has defined his repeated strikes on drug boats departing Venezuela?

The answer appears to be twofold. First, a concern that escalated U.S. action against these cartels might lead Sheinbaum to suspend cooperation with the U.S. on counterdrug activities. This is something Mexican governments have frequently threatened during previous disagreements with Washington. Second, there is a fear that the CJNG might retaliate against U.S. interests.

These concerns are legitimate. The CJNG has the military capacity to conduct terrorist attacks against Americans. And yet, Trump's excess deference to hesitation clearly undermines his pledge to do “Whatever we have to do to stop drugs.”

It's impossible, of course, to totally or even substantially reduce the flow of drugs onto U.S. soil — any true reduction would require removing the huge profit incentive afforded by millions of American daily drug users. But Trump could take action against the cartels in a way that increases their cost and complexity of doing business. That might, in turn, gradually translate into higher street prices, a measure of reduced demand for drugs, and some weakening of the cartels and their ability to spread corruption and criminality.

How to do it?

Trump could, for example, direct the CIA's paramilitary wing to launch unilateral capture-kill missions against cartel leaders and their enablers in the Mexican government and security forces. These people could then be removed to the U.S. for later prosecution or detention as foreign terrorist combatants. Trump could also order drone strikes or other attacks on cartel strongholds and safe havens. Alternatively, he could order the NSA to engage in cyber pilfering actions designed to remove funds from cartel accounts and/or crash the websites of banks that enable the cartels. He could name and shame those who help the cartels, such as Sinaloa Cartel partner and Albanian prime minister Edi Rama.

All these actions would increase the physical, financial, and psychological cost of doing business for and with the cartels. And while the risks of destabilizing Mexico are real, the current status quo is hardly sustainable. The aspiration of any direct action against the cartels would be to provoke a greater effort from Mexican authorities against the cartels and to encourage courageous Mexican public servants and citizens to be emboldened by U.S. action. But Trump would need to be ready to out-escalate the cartels by wreaking havoc upon them if they moved against U.S. citizens.

DEMOCRATS RECKON WITH LOFTY OBAMACARE PROMISES AFTER SHUTDOWN DEFEAT

Yes, Trump can instead keep doing what he's been doing, marginally increasing pressure on the cartels in terms of their U.S. operations and bolstering U.S. intelligence understanding of where and how they operate.

But that's not going to move the needle against drug smuggling onto U.S. soil. And when judged against Trump's far greater action against a lesser, if significant, drug threat from Venezuela, it suggests the president's strategy in Venezuela might not be about drugs, after all.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Infighting. Bad polls. Party divisions. Midterm fears. It's all back.

President Donald Trump's administration has been embroiled in scandal and sloppiness. His own party has defied his political pressure. His senior staff has been beset by infighting. He has sparred with reporters and offered over-the-top praise to an authoritarian with a dire human-rights record. A signature hard-line immigration policy has polled poorly. And Republicans have begun to brace themselves for a disastrous midterm election.

That was 2017. But it's also 2025.

Ten months into the president's second term, Trump 2.0 is for the first time starting to resemble the chaotic original. And that new sense of political weakness in the president has not just emboldened Democrats who have been despondent for much of the past year. It's also begun to give Republicans a permission structure for pushing back against Trump and jockeying for power with an eye to the elections ahead.

This was not the plan. Trump and his inner circle used their four years out of office to create a policy blueprint—drawn substantially from Project 2025—and form a disciplined team of true believers who used their experience with the levers of power to dominate their political opposition. The beginning of Trump's second term was marked by an unprecedented display of executive authority, as the president dominated a subservient Congress and defied the courts, brought to heel some of the nation's most formidable institutions and wealthiest people, fulfilled long-held conservative wishes to dramatically shrink the size and influence of the federal government, reoriented the nation's relationship with the rest of the world, and rammed through legislation that benefited the rich over the working class and the poor. Trump has been a steamroller.

But that has begun to change. Voters punished Trump's party in this month's elections, seeming to condemn his presidential overreach and the abandonment of his central campaign promise to rehabilitate the nation's economy. A rare Republican rebellion on Capitol Hill rattled the West Wing and embarrassed the president. And although the White House likes to project a political image of never surrendering, a pair of retreats in the past few days has punctured Trump's aura of invincibility.

Few things have frustrated Trump like his inability to make Jeffrey Epstein go away. The disgraced sex offender and financier, of course, has been dead for six years. But questions about the powerful men with whom he associated—and the mystery around his death in prison, which was ruled a suicide—created a conspiracy theory in the MAGA base that has overwhelmed the White House. Trump angrily ordered his supporters to let the matter go this past summer but was largely ignored. And then, last week, four GOP lawmakers—some of whom have been among Trump's most ardent acolytes—triggered a full House vote to release Department of Justice records related to Epstein.

Revolt was in the air. One of those defiant lawmakers, the MAGA icon Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, did not buckle, even as Trump called her a traitor. “Let me tell you what a traitor is,” she responded yesterday. “A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves.” GOP leadership signaled to the White House that most lawmakers could not put their name to a vote to protect a pedophile and that the measure would pass easily, two officials told me on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Trump was furious, but he didn't want to be seen as getting rolled by his own party.

Trying to save face, he begrudgingly posted on social media that he would support Republicans who voted to release the files. The measure passed the House yesterday 427–1. It then cleared the Senate by unanimous consent. Trump announced tonight he had signed it. (Questions persist as to whether the Justice Department may try to block the release of some or all of the files, citing a need to protect an ongoing investigation of prominent Democrats that it launched last week at Trump's request.)

The other Trump walk-back came far less dramatically, buried in the text of an executive order released late Friday. But it was no less noteworthy. Trump, as is often said, has few constant ideological stances, yet one is that tariffs will spur economic growth and benefit the consumer. In a tacit admission that tariffs have, in fact, caused prices to rise (as most economists have long said), the administration quietly lifted tariffs on goods such as bananas, beef, and coffee.

The reversal came days after Republicans were swept in off-year elections in places such as Virginia, New Jersey, and New York City. Voters made clear that the GOP was not fulfilling its promises on affordability that helped Trump get elected last year. A number of Republican lawmakers loudly insisted that Trump needs to refocus on prices and inflation—defiance reminiscent of when senators voted down the White House–led efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017.

Chaos within the White House was the norm during Trump's first term. This time around, the president's team has prioritized professionalism and tried to minimize turnover. Senior-level firings have been rare, and even the president's deposed national security adviser, Mike Waltz, was given a soft-landing spot as ambassador to the United Nations. Trump's first administration was plagued by sloppiness; the original travel ban, Trump veterans will remember with a shudder, was hastily scrawled by Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon and not properly reviewed by government attorneys before it was enacted. (It was promptly tossed out by a federal court.) This time, Trump aides vowed they would be methodical and efficient, and for months, they faced little resistance as they rolled out the president's agenda.

But that sense of disorder has returned, and the losses have begun to pile up. Just in the past two weeks: Trump's prized tariffs were greeted with great skepticism by the Supreme Court, with the justices appearing unsympathetic to the notion that the president could usurp what is normally congressional power on the back of a flimsy declaration of a national emergency. The president's campaign of retribution may have hit a snag when a federal judge found that the case put forth by Trump's handpicked interim U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, was marred by a series of errors that could lead to the dismissal of the criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey.

And yesterday, a Trump-appointed federal judge issued a rebuke of the methodology used by Republicans in Texas to redistrict the state's congressional map. (The judge wrote in his opinion that it was “challenging to unpack” all of the “factual, legal, and typographical errors” in a Justice Department letter that claimed that the original districts were to be eliminated because they were created solely on the basis of race.) Trump, desperate for his party to keep control of both houses of Congress next fall, had pushed for a number of GOP-led states to create more Republican seats, but he took a loss in Texas and has been rebuffed by Indiana, meaning that the Democrats—who responded to the Texas push by successfully creating friendly districts in California and may follow suit in Virginia and Maryland—could end up besting the Republicans at their own game. The administration is confident that the Supreme Court will take up the Texas case and ultimately approve the new districts.

Read: ‘None of this is good for Republicans'

There have been other recent flashbacks to Trump's first term. Much like in 2018, the president and the Republicans were on the losing end of a government shutdown. Infighting was frequent during the first Trump administration, as aides tried to knife one another in the press to improve their standing with the boss. There has been less internal dysfunction this time around—especially after Elon Musk departed DOGE—but last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had to publicly ask his supporters to stop criticizing White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles for allegedly blocking his MAHA agenda. And yesterday, the president ignored the CIA's conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman played a role in the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi—much as in Helsinki in 2018, when Trump famously sided with Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies on Russian election interference. When an ABC News reporter asked about Khashoggi in front of MBS, Trump threatened to revoke the network's broadcast license.

The White House spokesperson Kush Desai told me in a statement that the past two weeks have brought nothing but victories. “President Trump and the Administration have been delivering results since Day One, and the past two weeks have objectively been a continuation of this winning streak for the American people,” he said. But White House aides have privately admitted that this month has been the most challenging stretch of Trump's second term.

Other Republicans have begun to notice. Some of Trump's closest allies have warned him about polls that show the public is unhappy with some of his extreme moves, including cheering on masked ICE raids and demolishing the East Wing of the White House. Trump has so far been unwilling to do much to take on—or even acknowledge—the problem of affordability, but aides say that plans will be unveiled soon. Meanwhile, an urgency has set in: The calendar churns even for a president who has wielded power in extraordinary ways. Each day closer to next year's midterms is a reminder that Trump is a lame duck whose time governing with Republicans in charge at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue could soon be coming to a close. Even before then, his sway within his own party appears to be ebbing. One official who worked in both Trump administrations told me, “The president has had absolute loyalty from Republicans this year.” But, the official added, “losing that would be the first step toward losing power—and relevancy.”

What could go wrong when Black Friday shopping meets an affordability crisis?

The other day, I went to buy my first big Christmas gift of the year, and there it was, on the checkout page: Would I like to split this purchase up into four easy interest-free payments?

Parting with a smaller amount of money to get something you want sooner is a compelling offer. So compelling that half of all shoppers in the United States plan to use so-called “buy now, pay later,” or BNPL, services for holiday shopping this year, according to a PayPal survey. The same survey showed that one in four millennials and Gen Z-ers use payment options like Affirm and Klarna on a regular basis. These are the same young people who are having a hard time finding a job, struggling to pay overdue student loan bills, and dealing with rising food prices. That might be why it felt so dark when DoorDash announced a partnership with Klarna earlier this year, ushering in an era where people are taking out loans to pay for their takeout.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

As affordability becomes the dominant issue in American politics, the holiday shopping season feels different this year. Everything is more expensive, sure. But with BNPL options being offered by everyone from fintech startups to major banks, it's also easier than ever to finance purchases you couldn't otherwise afford. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has taken some of the guardrails off this shadowy lending industry, leaving consumers more vulnerable to unexpected fees and endless debt. Some are even warning that the precarious situation is starting to look a lot like the early days of the subprime mortgage crisis that led to the Great Recession.

“BNPL lenders are not currently required to [...] determine whether consumers can afford their BNPL loans,” said Nadine Chabrier, senior policy and litigation counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending. “There are currently no checks and balances on borrowers taking out multiple BNPL loans at the same time, which may lead to overextension.”

If you've seen The Big Short or simply followed along as history unfolded, this sounds pretty concerning. Before I get too carried away with warning of an imminent economic crisis, however, let's review how these little loans work.

In the industry's early days, you were mostly likely to come across a BNPL option on the checkout page of an e-commerce website, probably one selling luxury goods. The option to pay in installments, often with zero interest, made it easier for consumers to pull the trigger on high-dollar items, so stores were quick to adopt the feature. The lenders would make their money by taking a small cut of the purchase price, and they would also charge the consumer fees for late payments.

Venture-backed fintech startups led the charge. Affirm, founded in 2012, helped take BNPL mainstream and Klarna joined the market in 2015. The pandemic supercharged the industry, and the dollar amount borrowed skyrocketed from $16.8 million in 2019 to $180 million in 2022, according to a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) report released that year. The average loan at the time was $135.

One big problem, as Chabrier pointed out, is that BNPL lenders typically don't have to check to see if you can afford to take out a loan, and it's possible to take out several at once, a practice known as “loan stacking.” These factors might explain why late payments are so common. More than 40 percent of BNPL users say they made a late payment in the last year, up from 34 percent last year, according to a Lending Tree survey. Meanwhile, more than 20 percent say they've had three or more loans going at once, and a quarter of people surveyed said they've taken out a BNPL loan to buy groceries.

This is a good time to highlight the fact that not all of these loans are interest-free. Both Affirm and Klarna say their interest rates can go as high as 36 percent (Klarna's actually tops out at 35.99 percent, but it's fair to round up). That's still much lower than payday loans, which can get as high as 600 percent, but it's a lot higher than zero.

Now back to the looming financial crisis. Until very recently, most BNPL loans weren't reported to credit agencies, which meant there was very little visibility into who was borrowing and at what rates. During the Biden administration, the CFPB tried to regulate the industry by issuing a rule that would treat BNPL lenders like credit card companies, but the Trump administration rescinded that rule earlier this year. Around the same time, the company that makes the FICO score, a measure of how likely someone is to pay back a loan, said that it would introduce a new type of score that took BNPL debt into account. Those scores can currently only be seen by lenders, however, not consumers.

The BNPL industry remains largely unregulated at a national level. All that consumer debt, meanwhile, is becoming a financial product of its own. Elliott Investment Management just made a deal to buy $6.5 billion worth of debt from Klarna, as the fintech company expands its business into larger, longer-term loans for consumers. Affirm had sold nearly $12 billion worth of securitized debt as of June.

In a recent TechCrunch piece, Connie Loizos explained what BNPL companies are doing in bleak terms: “Slice up risky consumer debt, sell it to investors who believe they understand the risk profile, and create layers of financial engineering that obscure where the actual exposure lies.”

Again, it sounds a lot like the subprime mortgage crisis. It's unclear if we should be using such big words for what's happening at this moment, though.

“It would be premature to say there is a crisis,” Chabrier told me. “While it's possible, we do not know enough about the scope of BNPL borrowing to say such a thing.”

What we can say, on an individual level, is that BNPL is getting more dangerous. The industry “has built a delirious new culture of consumption — and trapped users in a vortex of debt,” according to a New York Times Magazine feature on people who just started shopping, missed the fine print, and got in real trouble.

As this holiday shopping season kicks off, read the fine print. Or better yet, don't buy now or pay later. The US economy may thank you for it.

﻿Do not bring your child to a child-free wedding. They don't want to go.

There are many places where adults would prefer not to be around other people's children. Seated next to or in front of them on airplanes, their homes, spas, commercial fishing vessels; these places range far and wide. But there are few places where regular citizens, outside of private business and local governments, can impose a no-child rule themselves.

One of these rare spaces is weddings.

Some people getting married are now asking, some more politely than others, to leave kids out of their special day. There are plenty of reasons why some wouldn't want children around. Perhaps it's because they want their friends to party late into the night. Maybe they want their guests to fully take advantage of the open bar. What if no one wants children to witness the violent, erotic thrill of the chicken dance?

Or maybe the couple simply wants to avoid interruptions during their ceremony.

Naturally, because adults — who were all children at one point in their lives — are nosy and opinionated, they cannot help but give their thoughts on a child-free wedding. A smaller portion of those people, whether they're invited to said nuptials or not, cannot help but think of needed exceptions to and complaints about prohibiting children from a wedding that isn't theirs. As it often happens online, a discourse (derogatory) was born. Some of the debate's talking points included:

Perhaps the couple should provide babysitting or some kind of child care to invitees? What if the rules only apply to children and not newborns? What if my child, who is not like other children, is the exception?

This brand of loophole-hunting evoked spirited defenses: Just stay home. Find someone to watch your child. No, of course not.

With so many adults turning the debate into a cacophony of jumbled thoughts and jagged replies, I wondered if we were missing key voices in the squabble, the people affected most by a child-free wedding: children themselves. Do they want to go to weddings? Do they believe they're being discriminated against? Do they even know what weddings are?

Knowing how they feel and what they believe might help both sides parse the no-kids debate. With the help of their parents, I interviewed a few kids to get to the bottom of this: Ronan, who is 8, Rafi (Rafaella), who is 5, and Ellie, who is also 5.

Do you know what a wedding is?

Ronan: Yes.

Rafi: Yes, it's when people get married.

Ellie: Yes, you get to wear a fancy dress.

Would you ever want to go to a wedding? 

Ronan: Maybe. Depends whose wedding it is.

Rafi: Yeah, I think I want to see people get married.

Ellie: Yeah, because it seems kinda fun.

Let's pretend that a grown-up had a wedding or a party and they said, “no kids allowed.” How would that make you feel? 

Rafi: Sad.

Ellie: Bad. I don't like when grown-ups don't allow kids.

Do you think grown-ups are boring?

Ronan: When they're working, they are.

Rafi: No because, they don't do any boring stuff. Like, they get to take pictures every day.

If you were the only kid at a (boring) grown-up party, would you go or would you skip it altogether?

Ronan: Skip the grown-up party altogether.

Rafi: No other kids? No. Skip the party and hang out with my friends — I love 'em.

Ellie: I'd run away and play with other kids.

Why? 

Ronan: I'd be embarrassed. I don't want to talk about it. Oh, wow.

Rafi: I like laughing at parties.

It's important to acknowledge that children are sometimes known to misjudge situations before they experience them. (A crucial part of growing up is witnessing the world not live up to your expectations.) But based on this extensive and extremely scientific survey, it does seem like children do in fact enjoy the ideas of a wedding and being invited. And it seems like kids also give grown-ups the benefit of the doubt when it comes to being boring. It's pertinent to note, though, that the enjoyment value they see drops precipitously if they're the only kid present. Being the only human being under 10 in a gathering full of grown-ups — which may well be the exact situation if they're brought to a child-free wedding — is not a scenario they desire.

This all-around agreement among my survey group is affirming to me. It also aligns with the advice from adult etiquette experts at The Knot and Emily Post who say that the couple should have the final say. They also note that once the child-free decree is sent, no exceptions should be made, because it signals favoritism and creates the potential for even more feelings.

As someone who believes that whoever is getting married is allowed to do whatever they want at their wedding, and that whomever is invited is always allowed to say no and not attend, a child-free wedding should be child-free. The people getting married want it. The people going want it — if they really don't, they are allowed to stay home. And the people affected by the actual rules, the children themselves, don't want to be there either if they are the only kids there — no matter what their parents say.

﻿They hardly ever fall. When they do, it usually means serious trouble.

Before his second term, then-former President Donald Trump ran a campaign in 2024 promising to lower the prices of pretty much everything. “When I win, I will immediately bring prices down. Starting on day one,” he said.

And in the months since retaking office, Trump has said, “The economy's doing great. The stock market's higher now than when I came to office.” But regular folks — people outside of the administration — aren't necessarily feeling as great about things.

Electricity prices are up 11% since January. Groceries are up about 2.7% from last year as of September, with items like coffee up almost 21% and ground beef up 11.5% in the past year. And there hasn't been nationwide relief for housing expenses either.

Trump is showing us all something that former President Joe Biden had already proven: It's really difficult to lower prices, have a productive economy, and satisfy voters. (Indeed, his approval rating is at the lowest point of his second term, largely driven by costs.) Still, Trump has recently offered some ideas to help out with the cost of living, including a $2,000 check for lower- and middle-income taxpayers and a housing plan that could include 50-year mortgages.

Can the president of the United States really lower prices? Catherine Rampell, the economics editor at the Bulwark and an anchor on MS NOW, says it's not likely. “The overall price level, so like, in aggregate all of the things across an economy — that basically never comes down,” she told Today, Explained co-host Noel King. “And that's by design.”Rampell and King discussed inflation, deflation, the pressure of keeping up with the Joneses, and more. Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Catherine, I am a very cheap American. I pay very careful attention to prices, and I don't remember prices ever coming down in any significant way in my entire adult life other than during the great financial crisis, where I remember you could, like, get a house for real cheap. 

It feels like that is saying something: that maybe prices don't just come down? 

Yeah, that's pretty much accurate. To be fair, prices of individual things can fluctuate. You mentioned housing when there was a big housing bust. For example, if an oil refinery goes offline, oil prices, gasoline prices might shoot up. And then once that refinery comes back online, the prices might go down.

Same thing for other supply shocks like bird flu: Bird flu happens; all the chickens die. Chicken prices go up; egg prices go up. Once those flocks are replenished, then you start to see prices come back down again.

So it's not as if there's no such thing as, like, fluctuation for individual products, particularly really volatile things that are vulnerable to supply shocks like energy and food, but the overall price level — in aggregate, all of the things across an economy — that [number] basically never comes down. You are spending more today than you did a year ago, than you did 10 years ago. than you did 20 years ago.

And yet when politicians are out on the campaign trail, the thing that they will say again and again — no matter what level of office they're running for is, “I am going to make life more affordable.”

What exactly is the disconnect? Why do we believe a politician who says, “I'm gonna make life more affordable” when we also sort of know that a year from now things will probably be a little more expensive? 

I think it's partly that it's just not intuitive. People remember life being cheaper. Particularly pre-pandemic life. They remember it being cheaper. And so it seems like a reasonable thing to ask of your public officials, whether elected officials or those at the Federal Reserve, let's say: Why can't things go back to the way that they were?

And if you explain to them, well, actually the Federal Reserve is targeting an overall price increase of 2% and not a negative — none of this is obvious to anyone, and that's reasonable. Most of the time, Americans don't really care, because price growth is so slow that they have time to adjust, right? If we have a 2% average price increase year over year, which we had for many, many years, it doesn't feel that painful, particularly since your wages are probably going up by that much or more.

So life feels about as affordable as it did a year before or two years before, or five years before. What's different recently is that we did have this very sudden surge in inflation in the several years following the pandemic. And so the lower prices that people had recently experienced were still very fresh in people's memories.

You remember President Biden telling us that the economy was great. That was not true for a lot of people, for millions of people. President Trump says, “Prices in my administration are going down.” That is also not true. 

Is the president telling us, “Don't believe your eyes?” Is that part of what is contributing to Americans being so ticked off about prices? 

I assume so. You know, you can lie to the American public about a lot of things. But they see what's happening in their bank account. They see what's happening when they get rung up at the grocery store. So I think it is harder to pull the wool over people's eyes when they are actually paying their own bills.

Now, to be fair, when Biden was saying the economy was good, there were a lot of good things happening in the economy. The job market was really hot. The economy contains multitudes. But people didn't really care about the fact that there were plentiful jobs to be had, because they had a job and their life was still getting less affordable.

The other thing that I want to flag here is that even as wages were going up and prices were going up [under Biden], I think psychologically people experienced those things differently. When you get a raise, you think it's because you earned that raise, right? You did something really meritorious at work. Your pay went up because your boss recognized it. Or maybe you even changed jobs, and your pay went up when you changed jobs. And that was due to your own gumption and hard work. Whereas inflation is something that happened to you — that robbed you of the full value of that pay raise. And that's partly true, but it's also partly not true in the sense that part of the reason why wages were rising is that employees were demanding higher pay to compensate for higher inflation.

I'm sure that both President Trump and President Biden would've liked to bring prices down, right?

Oh yeah.

It would've been enormously successful. The question is, can any American president really just overall make life cheaper for us? 

There is no dial under the Resolute desk that allows them to turn prices down.

Dang.

Although I'm not sure that they would've really wanted to. Because look, when you have prices go down, it has lots of negative consequences too. Or oftentimes, when you do see some very salient price go down, it might be because something else bad is happening in the economy. As an example of this, Donald Trump lately has been promising that he's going to get gasoline prices down to $2 a gallon again, which would be quite a big decline from where they are today. Do you know the last time gas was $2 a gallon?

No, when? 

It was in spring of 2020.

Oh God. Okay. Don't wanna do that again.

Exactly. What was going on in spring of 2020? Well, there was a global pandemic. People stopped driving to work. Factories shut down. Businesses of all kinds needed less energy. There was a lot less demand for fuel. And because there was less demand for fuel, that meant fuel was cheaper; gasoline was cheaper.

So if the overall price level is going down — not just one really salient good like gasoline — that often means an economy is very sick. It basically means that everything is on a fire sale. Consumers have stopped spending, and everyone, every business out there is trying to cut their prices to lure consumers back in. And if you are a consumer and you see prices already falling, you don't want to be the chump who is like, “I'm gonna buy something now only to see it get cheaper tomorrow.”

What happens is this becomes a self-perpetuating cycle. People see prices falling, they hold off on spending, consumer spending grinds to a halt, and prices get lower and lower and lower. This is sometimes called a deflationary spiral. We saw a version of this during the Great Depression. We've seen versions of this in Japan, for example, in the '90s, [and] in Greece during the Greek debt crisis and thereafter.

This is really not a good pattern [that] you want the economy to get into — where prices are falling or even when they're just imperceptively hovering around 0% growth. That's why the Federal Reserve is targeting a 2% pace of inflation rather than 0%, or heaven forbid, negative. Because again: If you get into that negative price growth, if prices are actively falling across the board, you can really end up in a dark place economically.

I was reading an article in the New York Times over the weekend, and there was this couple interviewed. They bought a house, their interest rate was high, and they were saying they've had to give up vacations and outings and budget more carefully. And I thought, Is that not just life?

Is it not just that we constantly wish we had more money and we don't? Should we be changing our mindset a little bit around prices and affordability? 

You know, different people make different choices about what to do with a fixed amount of money, and it's very easy to judge other people's choices. But yeah, we all live within some constraints. That doesn't mean it's not reasonable to say, it feels like everybody else is getting ahead and everybody else can afford a home and a vacation, and I can't. And that's really frustrating.

But it's also up to policymakers to ensure that people — aside from side-eyeing their neighbors and feeling poor — that they do feel like they can get the things that we think are the basic needs of humanity.

It's more subtle than Skynet.

It would take about 30 minutes for a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to travel from Russia to the United States. If launched from a submarine, it could arrive even faster than that. Once the launch is detected and confirmed as an attack, the president is briefed. At that point, the commander-in-chief might have about two or three minutes at most to decide whether to launch hundreds of America's own ICBMs in retaliation or risk losing the ability to retaliate at all.

This is an absurd amount of time to make any consequential decision, much less what would potentially be the most consequential one in human history. While countless experts have devoted countless hours over the years to thinking about how a nuclear war would be fought, if one ever happens, the key decisions are likely to be made by unprepared leaders with little time for consultation or second thought.

And so it shouldn't be a surprise that the people in charge of America's nuclear enterprise are interested in finding ways to automate parts of the process — including with artificial intelligence. The idea is to potentially give the US an edge — or at least buy a little time.

But for those who are concerned about either AI or nuclear weapons as a potential existential risk to the future of humanity, the idea of combining those two risks into one is a nightmare scenario. There's wide consensus on the view that, as UN Secretary General António Guterres put it in September, “until nuclear weapons are eliminated, any decision on their use must rest with humans — not machines.”

By all indications, though, no one is actually looking to build an AI-operated doomsday machine. US Strategic Command (STRATCOM), the military arm responsible for nuclear deterrence, is not exactly forthcoming about where AI might be in the current command-and-control system. (STRATCOM referred Vox's request for comment to the Department of Defense, which did not respond.) But it's been very clear about where it is not. 

“In all cases, the United States will maintain a human ‘in the loop' for all actions critical to informing and executing decisions by the President to initiate and terminate nuclear weapon employment,” Gen. Anthony Cotton, the current STRATCOM commander, told Congress this year.

At a landmark summit last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping and then-US President Joe Biden “affirmed the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons.” There are no indications that President Donald Trump's administration has reversed this position.

But the unanimity behind the idea that humans should remain in charge of the nuclear arsenal obscures a subtler danger. Many experts believe that even if humans are still the ones making the final decision to use nuclear weapons, increasing reliance on AI by humans to make those decisions will make it more, not less, likely that those weapons will actually be used, particularly as humans start to place more and more trust in AI as a decision-making aid.

A rogue AI killing us all is, for now at least, a far-fetched fear; a human consulting an AI on pressing the button is the scenario that should keep us up at night.

“I've got good news for you: AI is not going to kill you with a nuclear weapon anytime soon,” said Peter W. Singer, a strategist at the New America think tank and author of several books on military automation. “I've got bad news for you: it may make it more likely that humans will kill you with a nuclear weapon.”

To understand exactly the threat AI's involvement in our nuclear system poses, it is important to first grasp how it's being used now.

It may seem surprising given its extreme importance, but many aspects of America's nuclear command are still surprisingly low-tech, according to people who've worked in it, in part due to a desire to keep vital systems “air-gapped,” meaning physically separated, from larger networks to prevent cyber attacks or espionage. Until 2019, the communications system that the president would use to order a nuclear strike still relied on floppy disks. (Not even the small hard plastic disks from the 1990s, but the bendy 8-inch ones from the 1980s.)

The US is currently in the midst of a multidecade, nearly trillion-dollar nuclear modernization process, including spending about $79 billion to bring the nuclear command, control, and communications systems out of the Atari era. (The floppy disks were replaced with a “highly secure solid-state digital storage solution.”) Cotton has identified AI as being “central” to this modernization process.

In testimony earlier this year, he told Congress that STRATCOM is looking for ways to “use AI/ML [machine learning] to enable and accelerate human decision-making.” He added that his command was looking to hire more data scientists with the aim of “adopting AI/ML into the nuclear systems architecture.”

Some roles for AI are fairly uncontroversial, such as “predictive maintenance,” which uses past data to order new replacement parts before the old ones fail.

At the extreme other end of the spectrum would be a theoretical system that could give AI the authority to launch nuclear weapons in response to an attack if the president can't be reached. While there are advocates for a system like this, the US has not taken any steps toward building one, as far as we know.

This is the kind of scenario that likely comes to mind for most people when it comes to the idea of combining nuclear weapons and AI, due in part to years of films in which rogue computers try to destroy the world. In another public appearance, Gen. Cotton referred to the 1983 film WarGames, in which a computer system called WOPR goes rogue and nearly starts a nuclear war: “We do not have a WOPR in STRATCOM headquarters. Nor would we ever have a WOPR in STRATCOM headquarters.”

Fictional examples like WOPR or The Terminator's Skynet have undoubtedly colored the public's views on mixing AI and nukes. And those who believe that a superintelligent AI system could attempt on its own to destroy humanity understandably want to keep these systems far away from the most efficient methods humans have ever created to do just that.

Most of the ways AI is likely to be used in nuclear warfare fall somewhere between smart maintenance and full-on Skynet.

“People caricature the terms of this debate as whether it's a good idea to give ChatGPT the launch codes. But that isn't it,” said Herb Lin, an expert on cyber policy at Stanford University.

One of the most likely applications for AI in nuclear command-and-control would be “strategic warning” — synthesizing the massive amount of data collected by satellites, radar, and other sensor systems to detect potential threats as soon as possible. This means keeping track of the enemy's launchers and nuclear assets to both identify attacks when they happen and improve options for retaliation.

“Does it help us find and identify potential targets in seconds that human analysts may not find for days, if at all? If it does those kinds of things with high confidence, I'm all for it,” retired Gen. Robert Kehler, who commanded STRATCOM from 2011 to 2013, told Vox.

AI could also be employed to create so-called “decision-support” systems, which, as a recent report from the Institute for Security and Technology put it, don't make the decision to launch on their own but “process information, suggest options, and implement decisions at machine speeds” to help humans make those decisions. Retired Gen. John Hyten, who commanded STRATCOM from 2016 to 2019, described to Vox how this might work.

“On the nuclear planning side, there's two pieces: targets and weapons,” he said. Planners have to determine what weapons would be adequate to threaten a given target. “The traditional way we did data processing for that takes so many people and so much time and money, and was unbelievably difficult to do. But it's one of the easiest AI problems you can define, because it is so finite.”

Both Hyten and Kehler were adamant that they do not favor giving AI the ability to make final decisions regarding the use of nuclear weapons, or even providing what Kehler called the “last-ditch information” given to those making the decisions.

But in the unbelievable pressure of a live nuclear warfare situation, would we actually know what role AI is playing?

It's become a cliche in nuclear circles to say that it's critical to keep a “human in the loop” when it comes to the decision to use nuclear weapons. When people use the phrase, the human they have in mind is probably someone like Jack Shanahan.

A retired Air Force lieutenant general, Shanahan has actually dropped a B-61 nuclear bomb from an F-15. (An unarmed one in a training exercise, thankfully.) He later commanded the E-4B National Airborne Operations Center, known as the “doomsday plane” — the command center for whatever was left of the American executive branch in the event of a nuclear attack.

In other words, he's gotten about as close as anyone to the still-only-theoretical experience of fighting a nuclear war. Pilots flying nuclear bombing training missions, he said, were given the option of bringing an eyepatch. In a real detonation, the explosion could be blinding for the pilots, and wearing the eyepatch would keep at least one eye working for the flight home.

But in the event of a thermonuclear war, no one really expected a flight home. “It was a suicidal mission, and people understood that,” Shanahan told Vox.

In the final assignment of his 36-year Air Force career, Shanahan was the inaugural head of the Pentagon's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.

Having seen both nuclear strategy and the Pentagon's push for automation from the inside, Shanahan is concerned that AI will find its way into more and more aspects of the nuclear command-and-control system, without anyone really intending it to or fully understanding how it's impacting the overall system.

“It's the insidious nature of it,” he says. “As more and more of this gets added to different parts of the system, in isolation, they're all fine, but when put together into sort of a whole, is a different issue.”

In fact, it has been malfunctioning technology, more than hawkish leaders, that has more often brought us alarmingly close to the brink of nuclear annihilation in the past.

In 1979, National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski was woken up by a call informing him that 220 missiles had been fired from Soviet submarines off the coast of Oregon. Just before Brzezinski called to wake up President Jimmy Carter, his aide called back: It had been a false alarm, triggered by a defective computer chip in a communications system. (As he had rushed to get the president on the phone, Brzezinski decided not to wake up his wife, thinking that she would be better off dying in her sleep.)

Four years later, Soviet Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov elected not to immediately inform his superiors of a missile launch detected by the Soviet early warning system known as Oko. It turned out, the computer system had misinterpreted sunlight reflected off clouds as a missile launch. Given that Soviet military doctrine called for full-scale nuclear retaliation, his decision may have saved billions of lives.

Just a few weeks after that, the Soviets put their nuclear forces on high alert in response to a US training exercise in Europe called Able Archer 83, which Soviet commanders believed may actually have been preparations for a real attack. Their paranoia was based in part on a massive KGB intelligence operation that used computer analysis to detect patterns in reports from overseas spies.



“It's all theory. It's doctrine, board games, experiments, and simulations. It's not real data. The model might spit out something that sounds unbelievably credible, but is it justified?”

Today's AI reasoning models are far more advanced, but still prone to error. The controversial AI targeting system, known as “Lavender,” which the the Israeli military used to target suspected Hamas militants during the war in Gaza, reportedly had an error rate of up to 10 percent.

AI models could also be vulnerable to cyberattacks or subtler forms of manipulation. Russian propaganda networks have reportedly seeded disinformation aimed at distorting the responses of Western consumer AI chatbots. A more advanced effort could do the same with AI systems meant to detect the movement of missiles or preparations for the use of a tactical nuclear weapon.

And even if all the information collected by the system is valid, there are reasons to be concerned about AI systems recommending courses of action. AI models are famously only as useful as the data that's fed into them, and their performance improves when there's more of that data to process.

But when it comes to how to fight a nuclear war, “there are no real-world examples of this with the exception of two in 1945,” Shanahan points out. “Beyond that, it's all theory. It's doctrine, board games, experiments, and simulations. It's not real data. The model might spit out something that sounds unbelievably credible, but is it justified?”

Stanford's Lin points out that studies have shown humans often give undue deference to computer-generated conclusions, a phenomenon known as “automation bias.” The bias might be especially difficult to resist in a life-or-death scenario with little time to make critical decisions — and one where the temptation to outsource an unthinkable decision to a thinking machine could be overwhelming.

Would-be Stanislav Petrovs of the AI era would also have to contend with the fact that even the designers of advanced AI models don't often understand why they generate the responses they do.

“It's still a black box,” said Alice Saltini, a leading scholar on AI and nuclear weapons, referring to the internal operations of advanced reasoning models. “What we do know is that it's highly vulnerable to cyberattacks and that we can't quite align it yet with human goals and values.”

And while it's still theoretical, if the worst predictions of AI skeptics turn out to be true, there's also the possibility that a highly intelligent system could deliberately mislead the humans relying on it to make decisions.

The notion of keeping a human “in control over the decision to use nuclear weapons,” as Biden and Xi vowed last year, might sound comforting. But if a human is making a decision based on data and recommendations put forward by AI, and has no time to probe the process the AI is using, it raises the question of what control even means. Would the “human in the loop” still actually make the decision, or would they merely rubber-stamp whatever the AI says?

For Adam Lowther, arguments like these miss the point. A nuclear strategist, past adviser to STRATCOM, and co-founder of the National Institute for Deterrence Studies, Lowther caused a stir among nuke wonks in 2019 with an article arguing that America should build its own version of Russia's “dead hand” system.

The dead hand, officially called Perimeter, was a system developed by the Soviet Union in the 1980s which would give human operators orders to launch the country's remaining nuclear arsenal if a nuclear attack was detected by sensors and Soviet leaders were no longer able to give the orders themselves.

The idea was to preserve deterrence even in the event of a first strike that wiped out the command chain. Ideally, that would discourage any adversary from attempting such a strike. The system is believed to still be in operation and former President Dmitry Medvedev referred to it in a recent threatening social media post directed at the Trump administration's Ukraine policies.

An American Perimeter-style system, Lowther says, would not be a ChatGPT-type program generating options on the fly, but an automated system carrying out commands that the president had already decided on in advance based on various scenarios.

In the event the president was still alive and in a position to make decisions during a nuclear war, they would likely be choosing from a set of attack options provided by the nuclear “football” that travels with the president at all times, laid out on laminated sheets said to resemble a Denny's menu. (This “menu” is shown in the recent Netflix film House of Dynamite.)

Lowther believes AI could help the president make a decision in that moment, based on courses of action that have already been decided. “Let's suppose a crisis happens,” Lowther told Vox. “The system can then tell the president, ‘Mr. President, you said that if option number 17 happens, here's what you want to do.' And then the president can say, ‘Oh, that's right, I did say that's what I thought I wanted to do.'”

The point is not that AI is never wrong. It's that it would likely be less wrong than a human would be under the most high-pressure situation imaginable.

“My premise is: Is AI 1 percent better than people at making decisions under stress?” he says. “If the answer is that it's 1 percent better, then that's a better system.”

For Lowther, the 80-year history of nuclear deterrence, including the near-misses, is proof that the system can effectively prevent catastrophe, even when mistakes occur.

“If your argument is, ‘I don't trust humans to design good AI,' then my question is, ‘Why do you trust them to make decisions about nuclear weapons?',” he said.

The encroachment of AI into nuclear command-and-control systems is likely to be a defining feature of the so-called third nuclear age, and may be already underway, even as national leaders and military commanders are adamant that they have no plans to give authority to use the weapons over to the machines.

But Shanahan is concerned the allure of automating more and more of the system may prove hard to resist. “It's just a matter of time until you're going to have well-meaning senior people in the Department of Defense saying ‘Well, I've got to have this stuff.'” he said. “They're going to be snowed by some big pitch” from defense contractors.

Another incentive to automate more of the nuclear system may be if the US perceives its adversaries as gaining an advantage from doing so, a dynamic that has driven nuclear arms build-ups since the beginning of the Cold War.

China has made its own aggressive push to integrate AI into its military capabilities. A recent Chinese defense industry study touted a potential new system that could use AI to integrate data from underwater sensors to track nuclear submarines, reducing their chance of escape to 5 percent. The report warrants skepticism — “making the oceans transparent” is a long-anticipated capability that is still probably a long way off — but experts believe it's safe to assume Chinese military planners are looking for opportunities to use AI to improve their nuclear capabilities, as they work to build up their arsenal to catch up with the United States and Russia.

Though the Biden-Xi agreement of 2024 may not have actually done much to mitigate the real risks of these systems, Chinese negotiators were still reluctant to sign onto it, likely due to suspicions that it was an American ruse to undermine China's capabilities. It's entirely possible that one or more of the world's nuclear powers could increase automation in parts of their nuclear command-and-control systems simply to keep up with the competition.

When dealing with a system as complex as command-and-control, and scenarios where speed is as disturbingly necessary as it would be in an actual nuclear war, the case for more and more automation may prove irresistible. And given the unstable and increasingly violent state of world politics, it's tempting to ask if we're sure that the world's current human leaders would make better decisions than the machines if the nightmare scenario ever came to pass.

But Shanahan, reflecting on his own time within America's nuclear enterprise, still believes decisions with such grave consequences for so many humans should be left with humans.

“For me, it was always a human-driven process, for better and worse,” he said. “Humans have their own flaws, but in this world, I'm still more comfortable with humans making these decisions than a machine that may not act in ways that humans ever thought they are capable of acting.”

Ultimately, it's fear of the consequences of nuclear escalation, more than anything else, that may have kept us all alive for the past 80 years. For all AI's ability to think fast and synthesize more data than a human brain ever could, we probably want to keep the world's most powerful weapons in the hands of intelligences that can fear as well as think.

Nvidia's blockbuster earnings just blew a hole through Wall Street's AI bubble anxieties.

Analysts said the chipmaker's third-quarter results prove the AI boom is nowhere near running out of steam.

On Wednesday, Nvidia posted $57 billion in revenue, topping Wall Street's $55 billion estimates. Its data center division generated revenue of $51 billion, surpassing the $49.31 billion analysts had projected. The company reported earnings of $1.30 per share compared to the $1.26 estimate. It also forecast $65 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations of $61.98 billion.

Nvidia's stock rose more than 5% in premarket trading on Thursday.

""Fears of an AI bubble are way overstated,"" Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote after the print. The tech bull called the results a ""pop-the-champagne moment"" for tech investors.

""This is another validation point for the AI revolution,"" Ives wrote. ""We are in the top of the third inning of this AI game.""

Other analysts echoed that view. Thomas Monteiro, a senior analyst at Investing.com, said Nvidia's report shows the AI revolution is ""nowhere near its peak,"" with both demand and supply chain scaling continuing.

Despite concerns that ballooning capital expenditures — estimated at more than $400 billion across top cloud platforms — could lead to a slowdown, Monteiro said Nvidia's numbers show that tech companies remain committed to scaling their data centers.

Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said investors remain wary of what he calls the ""three C's"" — capex sustainability, circular financing, and rising competition.

""While these issues were not put to rest, the recent print does give investors confidence that Nvidia is still executing at a high level,"" he wrote. Nvidia's results suggest those fears can at least be ""punted"" into the next quarter, he added.

EMARKETER tech analyst Jacob Bourne told Business Insider that while Nvidia ""delivered another blockbuster quarter,"" investors are increasingly focused on whether physical constraints — including power availability, land, and grid access — may limit how quickly hyperscalers can turn GPU capacity into actual revenue.

During the earnings call, Nvidia reiterated that it has ""half a trillion"" in Blackwell and Rubin chip revenue on the books through 2026.

""We'll probably be taking more orders,"" said Colette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, noting that new customers — including Anthropic following its recent deal — would add demand. ""There's definitely an opportunity for us to have more on top of the $500 billion that we announced,"" she added.

CEO Jensen Huang revealed at Nvidia's October GTC conference that the company has $500 billion worth of AI-chip orders booked for 2025 and 2026, including orders for Blackwell, its most powerful chip, and Rubin, which is set to surpass it when it launches next year.

""Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,"" Huang said in Nvidia's earnings release.

Jefferies' analysts said that Nvidia's Blackwell GB300 GPU sales, which accounted for two-thirds of Blackwell sales, were ""very strong.""

""Nvidia answered the bell with GB300 shipments driving healthy upside to estimates,"" they wrote. They said that Nvidia's results ""should help steady the ship"" for AI stocks into the end of the year.

""Commentary around cloud service providers being sold out across the board and full utilization for Blackwell, Hopper, and even Ampere should help put the useful life conversation to bed,"" the analysts added.

The Nvidia CEO kicked off his remarks on Wednesday by taking aim at the ""AI bubble"" chatter.

""There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,"" said Huang, who is a longtime AI bull. ""From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference.""

Some tech leaders have been warning that AI may be in bubble territory.

Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said in October that the market could be in the middle of an AI bubble.

""The value is extremely high, just like creating the internet ended up being, in net, very valuable,"" Gates said in an appearance on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"". ""But you have a frenzy. And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they'll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive.""

""There are a ton of these investments that will be dead ends,"" he added.

Michael Burry, the contrarian investor who called and profited from the 2008 financial crisis, has also been warning about AI market mania — and betting against Nvidia.

Others, like Huang, have pushed back on the AI bubble narrative.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said in July that the AI frenzy may resemble a bubble, but that doesn't mean it is one in reality.

""I think it's unlikely, based on my experience, that this is a bubble,"" Schmidt said during an appearance at the RAISE Summit in Paris. ""It's much more likely that you're seeing a whole new industrial structure.""

Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said both sides of the debate could take something away from Nvidia's earnings.

""Overall the bulls got what they wanted last night, while bearish investors (hello, Michael Burry) will still be able to argue that such exuberant spending will ultimately end in tears,"" he said.

Business Insider Edition 

Duduzile Zuma, daughter of former President Jacob Zuma, is at the centre of a growing scandal after different families revealed she helped send young Southern African men to Russia, where they were later deployed to the war in Ukraine.


        The daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma has been implicated in the recruitment of young men from South Africa and Botswana to join Russian forces in the war in Ukraine, according to relatives of the recruits and WhatsApp correspondence reviewed by Bloomberg.



        The allegations have raised concerns within South Africa's government, which recently launched a formal investigation into the recruitment of its citizens for foreign military service.
    


        According to relatives of the recruits, approximately 20 men were approached by Duduzile Zuma and told they would participate in a bodyguard training programme for Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MKP).
    


        The men reportedly travelled to Russia in July, signed military contracts in Russian, and were subsequently sent to frontline areas in Ukraine.
    


        Photographs reviewed by Bloomberg show the group in Russia, first traveling together and later wearing camouflage alongside instructors. WhatsApp messages between Duduzile Zuma and some parents indicate that the recruits were assured they would not be sent into combat.
    


        “The recruits thought they were signing documents for the bodyguard course,” several relatives said.
    


        In one exchange, a recruit wrote: “As we speak now, we are packing and preparing to move to the war zone,” with Duduzile Zuma replying: “It's not the frontline. They are just scaring you… you may just patrol or be put on cooking duties or gun cleaning,” adding she would retrieve them “personally” if required. Families report losing contact with the men in August.
    


        Although South African law has prohibited citizens from serving as mercenaries or fighting for foreign governments since 1998, reports of its citizens being recruited to join Russia's war effort have risen sharply this year.
    


        Economic hardship and high unemployment have made young people across the continent increasingly vulnerable to offers of “training” or well-paid security jobs abroad.
    


        Similar recruitment cases have emerged in Kenya, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Nigeria and several other countries.
    


        Prior to these disclosure, Business Insider Africa reported that the South African government had received distress calls from 17 citizens trapped in Ukraine after joining Russian forces. In response, President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered a formal investigation. “President Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered an investigation into the circumstances that led to the recruitment of these young men into these seemingly mercenary activities,” the Presidency said.
    


        Officials have confirmed that diplomatic efforts are ongoing to secure the safe return of those involved.
    


        Duduzile Zuma has yet to respond to requests for comment. Attempts to reach the MKP, the South African Presidency, the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, the Russian Embassy, and Russia's foreign ministry were unsuccessful.
    


        Meanwhile, Jacob Zuma's own legal challenges remain unresolved, with a recent court ruling declaring his medical parole unlawful and ordering him to return to prison to serve the remainder of his 15-month sentence.
    


        At the same time, relatives and available evidence suggest that Duduzile Zuma has previously shared pro-Russian content on social media, including images from Russia and posts critical of President Cyril Ramaphosa.
    


        She is also currently facing trial for allegedly inciting violence on social media during the 2021 unrest.
    


        South African news outlets report that Jacob Zuma wrote to Russia's defence minister requesting the removal of 18 South Africans from the combat zone, citing that they had been misled into signing infantry contracts in Pskov, near Estonia.
    


        The involvement of African nationals in Ukraine highlights the international dimension of the conflict. According to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, at least 1,436 individuals from 36 African countries are currently fighting alongside Russian forces.
    


        This figure excludes Africans who were already residing in Russia prior to the war and subsequently volunteered or were recruited to join the conflict.

One analyst has taken a dimmer view of two AI kingmakers this week.

Alex Haissl, an analyst at Rothschild & Co Redburn, is a lonely dissenting voice among research analysts when it comes to shares of Amazon and Microsoft. In a note to clients this week, Haissl downgraded the firm's rating on the tech giants despite the ongoing hype for generative AI and the billions both firms have pledged to spend on the new tech in the coming years.

Investors look like they're valuing Amazon and Microsoft's capex plans as ""as if cloud-1.0 economics still applied,"" Haissl wrote, referring to the low-cost structure of cloud-based services that allowed Big Tech firms to boom in the 2010s.

But there are a few problems that suggest the AI boom likely won't play out in the same way, and it is is probably far more costly than investors realize, he said.

""We downgrade Amazon and Microsoft with a heavy heart,"" Haissl wrote, noting that the firm had held a bullish view on the two stocks for the last several years.

""But after turning over every stone, we no longer see a credible path back to cloud 1.0 economics. The market, however, still prices in that outcome, implying returns we believe are no longer achievable,"" he added.

There are key differences between the business model for ""cloud 1.0"" and generative AI, Haissl said.

For one, AI is far more costly. According to Rothchild's analysis, a GPU costs firms around $40 billion in capex per gigawatt of power.

It's also believed to generate less revenue. Each GPU generates around $10 billion of revenue per gigawatt, per the firm's calculations.

Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Apple are on track to spend around $349 billion in capex this year, much of which is directed toward AI infrastructure, according to company statements.

""We are not concerned about operating margins; those can be managed. The real constraint is the capex required relative to the growth delivered,"" Haissl said, later adding that he believed the market was overestimating the returns related to AI investment.

Second, AI chips are also known to have a short lifespan, another factor that can make projects costly. If a GPU were to be replaced every three years, projects would turn ""value destructive,"" according to Rothchild's estimates, implying losses for the owners of the chips.

Third, hyperscalers have limited pricing power, Haissl said, pointing to the expenses associated with AI hardware, which is largely provided by tech startups.

""Passing higher costs on to startups would simply deepen their losses unless those costs could be pushed through to end users; if not, hyperscaler economics deteriorate further,"" he said.

Amazon and Microsoft already look like they're ""re-rated meaningfully"" in price, Haissl said, pointing to the recent declines in both stocks. Amazon shares are down around 13% from their peak in early November, while Microsoft shares are down 10% from their peak in late October.

""While there may still be some upside to growth, we believe it is limited relative to buy-side expectations and, more importantly, less relevant given the low value of that growth,"" Haissl said.

That's not to say the firm is turning completely negative on Amazon and Microsoft. It's hard to hash out a bear case for the near-term for these stocks, Haissl wrote, adding that the firm believed both would continue to post strong growth figures over the next year.

""In our view, it is not a bear case — but it is no longer a bull case either,"" he said, adding that the firm would need to see high growth and a ""meaningful reduction in capex"" in order to turn more optimistic.

It's a fragile time for the AI trade, with tech stocks sinking in recent weeks as investors take stock of high valuations and begin to doubt the billions being sown into AI-related investments. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is down 6% from its high in late October. 

The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which tracks the seven tech titans at the heart of the AI trade, is down 7% from its peak last month.

Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang pushed back against fears of an AI bubble on the company's blowout earnings call on Wednesday.

""There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,"" Huang said. ""From our vantage point, we see something very different."" 

Coming from the world's most valuable company that powers nearly every major AI data center, that vantage point matters.

Huang said that AI is fueling three transformative shifts that Nvidia is uniquely poised to capitalize on.

The first stems from the slowdown of Moore's Law — a trend that's seen computer chips double in power roughly every two years. As that progress stalls, companies are shifting from traditional chips to GPUs, which Nvidia specializes in building to power AI systems.

Huang also cited the rise of generative AI, which is transforming search and recommendations at companies like Meta. Finally, he cited the shift to agentic AI and physical AI—which power coding assistants and robotics—as other game-changing opportunities.

""Nvidia is chosen because our singular architecture enables all three transitions and does so for any form and modality of AI across all industries,"" Huang said.

Before Nvidia's earnings report, concerns about a potential AI bubble were swirling. Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus, wrote that a key concern was that spending by major cloud companies may be ""moving into bubble territory"" and could prove difficult to sustain.

On the earnings call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said that the company's chips are being used at full capacity. 

""The clouds are sold out,"" she said, and the company's GPU installed base is ""fully utilized.""

Beyond Huang's remarks, the company's earnings spoke volumes. Nvidia reported record quarterly revenue of $57 billion, up 62% year-over-year. And it's forecasting more growth ahead — to the tune of $65 billion in the fourth quarter. Shares were up about 5% in after-hours trading.

The strong results rippled across the chip sector. Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor each rose more than 7% in after-hours trading, while AMD climbed over 6% and Oracle gained more than 5%.

Elon Musk and Donald Trump were at war all summer, but that relationship appears to be warming up.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO received an invitation to Trump's White House dinner on Tuesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

The dinner had a guest list dominated by CEOs. Musk was joined by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. This was Musk's first public appearance at the White House after he fell out with Trump in May.

Following the dinner, Musk posted pictures taken at the dinner on X, which showed himself, the crown prince, Huang, and Trump.

""I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world,"" Musk's post said. 

And during his speech at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Trump made some lighthearted jokes at Musk's expense.

""You're so lucky I'm with you, Elon. I'll tell you. Has he ever thanked me properly?"" Trump said. 

The slow thawing of tensions between the two comes after several months of intense public feuding.

Musk and Trump have had a tumultuous relationship over the past year. The two became steadfast political allies when Musk backed Trump's 2024 presidential bid.

Musk then called himself the ""first buddy"" after Trump's win.

Musk later headed the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a post he left in May.

The relationship soured in June, when Musk criticized Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill."" The two men started feuding publicly, with Musk saying Trump would not have won the presidential election if not for his support. Trump, meanwhile, threatened to cut government contracts that Musk's companies held.

Musk then said he would form a new political party called the ""America Party.""

""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,"" Musk wrote in an X post in July.

The duo have been spotted in public together since their alliance imploded. They were seen shaking hands at political activist Charlie Kirk's memorial service in September.

And before Trump's visit to Asia in October, Trump said he had always had a good relationship with Musk.

""I like Elon, I've always liked him,"" he told reporters on Air Force One in October.

Business leaders, including Elon Musk and AMD CEO Lisa Su, joined a dinner with President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House on Tuesday.

The guest list, shared by the White House, included members of the Saudi government and royal family, as well as almost 50 US business executives. Soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo also attended.

The dinner was the Tesla CEO's first public visit to the White House since his bitter feud with Trump this summer, following Musk's departure from his role as leader of the White House DOGE Office.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev were on the guest list, but it is unclear if they attended the event.

Here is a list of US executives who attended the high-profile dinner.

Elon Musk made a rare public appearance at the White House since his falling-out with Trump earlier this year, after stepping down as the informal head of the White House DOGE Office.

The world's richest man and head of Tesla, SpaceX, and X, Musk exerts significant influence in technology, energy, and artificial intelligence — industries central to both the US and Saudi economic ambitions.

Nvidia chief Jensen Huang attended the White House dinner as one of the most influential figures in artificial intelligence and chipmaking.

Nvidia's CEO's presence underscored the pivotal role of advanced computing in US-Saudi economic relations and the global competition to dominate AI technology.

Apple chief Tim Cook joined the White House dinner as one of the most powerful figures in global business, representing a tech giant that shapes everything from consumer tech to privacy standards.

His appearance highlighted Apple's pivotal role in US innovation — and its importance to any conversation about the future of tech and trade.

AMD's Lisa Su was among the high-profile executives at the White House dinner, bringing the perspective of one of the world's top chipmakers.

As the leader driving fierce competition in semiconductors — a sector vital to both AI development and global supply chains — Su's inclusion signaled the critical importance of her industry to US strategy.

Late on Wednesday evening, Su shared photos from the dinner, including one of her sitting with Ronaldo.

Billionaire investor Bill Ackman attended the White House dinner as one of Wall Street's most outspoken figures.

Known for his bold market bets and influence in finance and policy circles, Ackman's presence reflected the growing alignment between political power and the capital shaping global markets.

OpenAI president Greg Brockman joined the White House dinner as a key architect behind the modern AI revolution.

His invitation underscored the growing importance of artificial intelligence in diplomacy and economic strategy, with OpenAI's technology now at the center of global debates about innovation and regulation.

Venture capitalist and White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks was among the attendees at the dinner, reflecting his growing influence at the intersection of tech, politics, and finance.

As both an early investor in major startups and the chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, Sacks embodies the blend of innovation and policymaking that defined the evening's guest list.

In December, Trump appointed Sacks as White House's AI and crypto czar, guiding the government on policy and regulation around the digital asset industry.

Great night! pic.twitter.com/XfdC9bJqP4

Coinbase's chief, Brian Armstrong, attended the White House dinner as the leading voice in America's cryptocurrency industry.

His presence showed the increasing importance of digital assets in global finance and the White House's commitment to engaging with fintech leaders who are shaping the future of money.

Indeed, the world's largest job site, just released its big annual study. The data on tech jobs is pretty gruesome. The outlook for data and analytics jobs is particularly grim.

Let's start with the overall job market. This chart, which includes Indeed's Job Postings Index, shows a steady decline in available jobs since the pandemic boom of 2022.

Dig deeper, and you can see that the tech job market has done a lot worse than some other sectors. Indeed's Tech Job Postings Index peaked above 200 in 2022 and has since plunged to 67.

Data and analytics jobs really stand out, though. This sector had a Jobs Posting Index of 60, the lowest of all sectors Indeed tracked as of the end of October. That means there are 40% fewer data and analytics job openings than before the pandemic.

Even worse: There is still a rising number of applications per job in this sector, according to Indeed.

These types of roles include business analyst, data analyst, data scientist, and business-intelligence developer. Indeed's data shows a clear mismatch between employer demand and worker supply here. Years of investment in data-science training have left a glut of skilled candidates just as hiring appetite cools.

""Workers who received that training are likely to continue to look for jobs that match their skills, regardless of the pullback in postings, because it is often difficult, costly, and time-consuming to change careers,"" said Cory Stahle, a senior economist at Indeed.

The pullback in data & analytics jobs has been more dramatic than in other occupations. Employers went on a hiring spree during the post-pandemic boom. Since then, many firms simply haven't needed to replace these workers as much.

Adding to the chill: the rise of generative AI, which is making it easier for more people to analyze data with less formal training.

""AI is not yet capable of replacing workers, but it may be helping workers and businesses do more with less,"" Stahle said.

For job seekers, that translates into a fierce market.

""This combination of fewer postings and more applications suggests that the market is competitive,"" Stahle warned. ""Finding the right job may take some time, and your wage growth is likely to be weaker than it was a few years in these roles.""

In this article

U.S. wireless carrier Verizon said Thursday it will cut more than 13,000 jobs in its largest single layoff as it works to shrink costs and restructure operations.

Verizon also said it plans to convert 179 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised operations and close one store.

Verizon's new CEO, Dan Schulman, said in a note to employees the company would reduce its workforce by more than 13,000 employees across the organization, and significantly reduce outsourced and other outside labor expenses.

""Our current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,"" Schulman wrote in a note to employees seen by Reuters. ""We must simplify our operations to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers.""

A company spokesperson confirmed the job cuts, saying ""this is an opportunity for Verizon to reset, restructure and realign our priorities on ways that will help us regain our leadership as a communications provider."" Reuters and other outlets reported last week Verizon was planning to cut around 15,000 jobs. Most of the cuts are to its U.S. workforce.

Schulman said Verizon was establishing a $20 million career transition fund for laid-off employees to focus on the ""opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI.""

Verizon said the job cuts were not the result of the company's use of AI.

The wireless carrier faces mounting market pressure amid concerns over a shrinking pool of new customers as older rivals offer cheaper plans and cable operators jump into the fray. Schulman, a Verizon board member since 2018, was named CEO in October, arriving from the helm at PayPal and facing promotions by rivals AT&T and T-Mobile around the launch of new iPhone models, with aggressive discounts and trade-in deals.

Verizon added just 44,000 monthly bill-paying wireless subscribers in the third quarter, lagging AT&T. T-Mobile led with more than 1 million net subscriber additions.

Verizon had about 100,000 U.S. employees at the end of 2024, including about 70,000 non-union employees. The telecommunications company cut almost 20,000 jobs over the prior three years.

Verizon spent $52 billion to acquire key wireless midband spectrum in a 2021 auction to boost its 5G network. The company also struck a $20 billion deal to acquire Frontier Communications last year and spent $6 billion to acquire prepaid mobile phone provider TracFone Wireless.

In this article

One week into what baristas have threatened to make the ""largest, longest"" strike in Starbucks' history, the Workers United union said it is adding more than two dozen new cities and stores to its strike count. 

The union said Thursday it will now be striking at 95 stores in 65 cities, with some 2,000 baristas now engaged in the action. On Wednesday, baristas and allies also picketed and held a rally outside of the company's distribution center in York, Pa. Starbucks said there were no disruptions to its operations in York.

Workers United said the majority of stores where strikes were held had to close down on the first day of the strike due to staffing issues, and the lack of workers impacted some 50 locations in the days to follow. Starbucks said stores that had issues were often able to reopen quickly and that less than 1% of its locations are experiencing disruption from the strike.

The strike has so far not appeared to dent foot traffic and sales, according to the company and data from Placer.ai. The location intelligence tracking firm's data show foot traffic on Red Cup Day, when the strike was launched, was up 44.5% compared to the daily average between Jan. 1 and Nov. 14 this year.

In a memo to workers last week, CEO Brian Niccol touted the success of the holiday launch so far. 

""Together, we set new records. Last Thursday's Holiday launch was our biggest sales day ever in North America. Then yesterday, we had our strongest Reusable Red Cup day in company history,"" the memo sent Friday said. 

The union began organizing at Starbucks in 2021 and says it now represents more than 11,000 workers across more than 550 stores. This week, it said five non-union stores filed for union elections, including locations in the Baltimore, Md. area, Harrisonburg, Va., and Little Rock, Ark. The company last week told CNBC that the union only represents 9,500 workers. 

Workers United is seeking new proposals that address its top issues to finalize a contract. Those include improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges levied against Starbucks. The two parties have not been in active negotiations to reach a contract after talks between them fell apart late last year. The strikes have not changed that fact so far.

Starbucks and the union entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April. Both sides have pointed blame at the other for failure to reach a bargaining agreement, and say they're ready to negotiate.

The strike has threatened to hurt business during Starbucks' busy holiday season, which typically provides a sales boost and will be key to the chain's plan to turn around performance in the U.S. under Niccol. Starbucks broke a nearly two-year streak of same-store sales declines in its most recently reported quarter. Past strikes have impacted less than 1% of its stores, the company said.

Starbucks maintains it will be ready to serve customers across its stores this holiday season.

""As we've said, 99% of our 17,000 U.S. locations remain open and welcoming customers —including many the union publicly stated would strike but never closed or have since reopened,"" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said in a statement regarding the strike escalation.

""Regardless of the union's plans, we do not anticipate any meaningful disruption. When the union is ready to return to the bargaining table, we're ready to talk,"" Anderson said. ""The facts are clear, Starbucks offers the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging $30 per hour for hourly partners. People choose to work here and stay here—our turnover is less than half the industry average, and we receive more than a million job applications every year.""

When the U.S. Department of Education announced this week that it would transfer much of its programs to other agencies, it didn't appear that the country's federal student loan portfolio would be impacted. 

However, financial aid experts and consumer advocates are still worried for borrowers. 

More than 40 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. 

""What is concerning is the destabilization of the Department of Education and Federal Student Aid at the very moment when consistent, technically skilled oversight is most needed,"" said Carolina Rodriguez, director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York. 

The major overhaul of the agency is occurring at an especially challenging time for the federal student loan system. More than 5 million people are in default on their education debt, and President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminates several long-standing affordable repayment plans and relief options.

""Student loan eligibility and repayment involve multiple systems working together, and institutions need that process to be seamless, current and accurate,"" said Melanie Storey, president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. ""As the delivery of other programs moves to other agencies, these dependencies must be carefully considered."" 

On Tuesday, Trump administration officials said they had signed agreements with four federal agencies, including the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, to start managing programs currently under the Education Department.

The move is part of Trump's directive to dismantle the agency, experts said. Education Secretary Linda McMahon has argued that the recent government shutdown proved that the department is not needed.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration laid off nearly half of the Education Department's staffers.

""They are attempting to hollow out the U.S. Department of Education, leaving behind a shell of the original organization,"" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

The Trump administration's goal of hobbling the Education Department will be difficult while the agency still oversees the massive federal student loan portfolio, experts say. But it may be trying to offload the debt. 

The new restructuring at the Education Department doesn't involve the loans, but Trump officials are exploring options to sell some of the debt to the private market, Politico reported in October.

Student loan borrowers have faced even more problems in the private market than with the government, consumer advocates said. When private companies played a bigger role in federal student lending in the past under the Federal Family Education Loan, of FFEL, program, Rodriguez said, ""borrowers saw their debt balloon with no end in sight due to loan mismanagement."" 

Any major loan transfer ""will also result in errors that could harm borrowers and push relief further out of reach,"" said Aissa Canchola Banez, the policy director at Protect Borrowers. 

Currently, private lenders account for 8% of all student loans but are the subject of more than 40% of student debt complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, lawmakers recently wrote in a letter to Trump officials.

In this article

Abbott said on Thursday it would buy cancer test maker Exact Sciences in an up to $23 billion deal, bolstering the medical device maker's diagnostics business.

This marks one of Abbott's largest deals in nearly a decade and its first major push into cancer screening with preventative diagnostic devices.

The transaction would bring Exact Sciences' flagship colorectal cancer test Cologuard into Abbott's diagnostics portfolio, helping offset revenue declines from its Covid-19 testing kits. 

As part of the agreement, Exact Sciences shareholders will receive $105 apiece in cash, implying a premium of about 21.8% to the stock's last closing price. Exact shares jumped more than 17% in premarket trading, while Abbott was down nearly 2%.

The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026 after Exact Sciences' shareholder approval.

Ukraine could face some tough choices amid reports that the U.S. and Russia have secretly formulated a peace plan to end the war, potentially including significant concessions to Moscow.

Senior U.S. military officials are in Ukraine on Thursday ""on a fact finding mission to meet with Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war"" with Russia, a U.S. army spokesman said.

The visit comes a day after media reports suggested Washington and Moscow had held secret talks and devised a new 28-point peace plan for Ukraine, without Kyiv's involvement.

The 28-point plan — first reported by Axios but followed by other media, including the Financial Times and Reuters, citing unnamed sources — allegedly contains proposals for Ukraine to concede territory in its eastern Donbas region to Russia, abandon certain categories of weaponry and reduce the size of its armed forces by 50%, among other conditions. 

One report in The Telegraph newspaper suggested that Russia could take control of the Donbas region despite Ukraine maintaining legal ownership, with Moscow essentially paying rent for the land. CNBC was unable to confirm the information contained within the media reports.

A senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that Kyiv had received ""signals"" about a set of U.S. proposals to end the war, but that Kyiv had had no role in preparing the proposals, the unnamed source said.

The Kremlin on Wednesday denied that there had been any ""innovations on possible peace proposals"" since Russian President Vladimir Putin had met U.S. President Donald Trump in August. When asked specifically about the Axios report, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was nothing he could share publicly.

Meanwhile, the White House has not explicitly confirmed the existence of the 28-point peace plan, reportedly modeled on the Gaza peace agreement, but U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that new proposals were in the works.

""Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,"" Rubio posted on X overnight Wednesday. 

""Achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict,"" he said.

Ukraine leadership has not publicly commented on the 28-point plan, but peace proposals are expected to form part of Thursday's talks between President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the U.S. delegation of military officials.

On Wednesday, Zelenskyy commented that ""only President Trump and the United States have sufficient power to make this war come to an end.""

He said Kyiv had ""supported every decisive step and the leadership of [President Trump], every strong and fair proposal aimed at ending this war,"" and added that Ukraine was ""ready to work in any other meaningful formats that could yield results.""

Ukraine's First Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia addressed reports of the peace plan head-on, however, suggesting in a post on X that Moscow was behind a push to hype up ""a factory of unrealistic plans.""

Whether Ukraine would accept such concessions to end the war is highly uncertain, with pushback likely. 

However, Kyiv finds itself in a vulnerable position given its reliance on the U.S. for military aid, and although it still has staunch support from its European allies, military and financial aid are slower to materialize now than in the early days of the war.

Still, European diplomats appear unhappy at the reports of a peace plan lacking Ukrainian or regional involvement, with the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas commenting Thursday that ""for any plan to work, it needs to have Ukrainians and Europeans on board.""

""In this war, there is one aggressor and one victim. So far, we haven't heard of any concessions from Russia's side,"" she told reporters.

Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War said that if the reports are true, the 28-peace plan would amount to ""Ukraine's full capitulation and would set conditions for renewed Russian aggression against Ukraine.""

""The reported proposed peace plan would deprive Ukraine of critical defensive positions and capabilities necessary to defend against future Russian aggression, apparently in exchange for nothing,"" the ISW analysts said Wednesday. 

They noted it would ""give this significant land to Russia — apparently for no specified compromise — sparing Russia the time, effort, and manpower that it could use elsewhere in Ukraine during renewed aggression."" 

The ISW concluded that the plan, if verified, showed Russia's maximalist territorial demands on Ukraine had essentially not changed since the initial invasion in 2022. ""This reported peace plan is fundamentally the same as Russia's 2022 Istanbul demands, which Russia presented to Ukraine when the circumstances on the battlefield appeared to favor Russia more heavily.""

Global tech stocks rallied Thursday as investors piled back into AI-related names, buoyed by Nvidia earnings. 

Nvidia topped forecasts for revenue, which jumped 62% to $57.01 billion year-on-year, and issued stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter sales guidance, giving investors the confidence they were looking for to continue placing bets on the AI industry. Shares were 5% higher in premarket trade.

In Europe, Dutch semiconductor firms BESI and ASMI moved up over 3% and 2% in the first hours of trading, respectively. ASML, which makes critical equipment for semiconductors, gained 2.1%.

Asia-listed stocks Samsung Electronics and Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, climbed 3.5% and 3.3% higher, respectively. 

Stateside, investors flocked to tech stocks in premarket trade: AMD rose 5%, Arm gained almost 4%, Micron Technology advanced 2.7%, Marvell Technology added 3.3%, Broadcom was last seen 3.1% up and Intel moved 2% higher.

Dan Hanbury, global equity portfolio manager at Ninety One, which holds Nvidia as its second-largest holding in its global strategic equity fund, cautiously welcomed Nvidia's share price jump in Thursday's premarket trade.

""As a holder, it's great to see an early positive reaction but of course as we know those reactions can reverse further into the day,"" Hanbury told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

""Our reading of the numbers is they are very strong. Clearly, we can get caught up in the quarterly noise of a company like this but if we just put those [numbers] in context … only three years ago they were delivering $15 billion of data center revenue, we're now looking at consensus forecasts into next year of $280 billion,"" Hanbury said. ""That is phenomenal growth that these guys are delivering.""

Karen McCormick, chief investment officer at London-based venture capital company Beringea, spoke with CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" about some of the recent moves to bulk-up on AI and scale, particularly following Nvidia and Microsoft's recent push to invest up to $15 billion in OpenAI rival Anthropic.

""It's always a little bit intimidating to contradict Jensen Huang right after he has made phenomenal earnings results but in terms of the almost incestuousness of the valley and the AI companies, it is more than we have seen in the past,"" McCormick said.

""I mean, if you think about traditionally, we might have called something like this vendor financing, where your vendor is helping to support the business,"" McCormick said. ""In this case we are just doing it with hundreds of billions of dollars and the ecosystem itself is now so intertwined that it's almost a little bit nerve-wracking because if we are in a bubble and if any of that bubble bursts, what is going to happen to all of the related businesses?""

The culmination of circular dealmaking, debt issuances and high valuations added pressure to the market ahead of Nvidia's much-anticipated results, despite other Big Tech firms posting solid quarterly earnings. 

""The flip side to that is that each of them has incredibly robust balance sheets and incredibly robust investors, who may not let them fail either way,"" McCormick said.

Quilter Cheviot's global head of technology research and investment strategist Ben Barringer, added that Nvidia's valuation isn't ""particularly excessive.""

Valuations aren't that streteched when you look at the core big tech companies, he told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Thursday. 

In terms of debt that's also at the peripheral, he said. While Meta and Amazon have raised debt, ""they're still net cash positioned,"" Barringer added. 

""I think it's more about them managing their treasury position and managing their balance sheet, as it were. Yes, it's not great that they are doing some of this capex from debt, but it's nowhere near as bad as 1999 where these were very heavily levered telecom companies doing a lot of this capex.""

However, Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, told CNBC on Thursday that Nvidia is not a bubble barometer. ""The concern is about companies raising a lot of debt to build data centers,"" he said. 

""Any concerns about Nvidia were certainly laid to rest [with Nvidia's earnings], but that doesn't mean that we don't need to keep an eye on companies lending or borrowing to build data centers,"" Luria added.

Shares in artificial intelligence darling Nvidia initially popped as much as 5% Thursday after the U.S. firm beat expectations in third-quarter results, but later reversed that surge and turned negative.

Wednesday after the bell, Nvidia topped forecasts for revenue, which jumped 62% to $57.01 billion year-on-year, and issued stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter sales guidance.

""There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on an earnings call, as the firm set out its view of the industry. ""From our vantage point, we see something very different.""

The blowout quarter exceeded even the whisper numbers for the AI chip leader, and while most major analysts commented on and touted the positives, Ross Seymore at Deutsche Bank noted that the shares are ""fairly valued.""

The firm kept a neutral stance on the stock.

Nvidia's upbeat guidance helped lift investor sentiment around the AI trade, which has weakened in recent sessions amid fears about elevated valuations, debt financing and potential chip depreciation. 

The results boosted a slew of stocks across the AI ecosystem immecdiately following the report, including chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom and power infrastructure companies such as Eaton.

Shares of each company sank Thursday as part of the broader market turnaround.

Quilter Cheviot's Ben Barringer, who is the global head of technology research and investment strategist, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" that Nvidia brought relief in two-parts: it beat gross margins, which is important for semiconductor stocks, but the firm also addressed market concerns head-on in its earnings call.

""They really went through and sort of tried to disprove pretty much all of the bear cases out there. They talked about scaling laws, they talked about all the different elements of demand, not just hyperscaler capex, but the model demand that they're seeing from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, software demand, enterprise demand, sovereign AI,"" Barringer said.

Nvidia also addressed supply constraints, vendor financing, partnerships and China. 

""So they really did a stand up job of calling out every elephant in the room, every, every possible bear case, and going through and giving their perspective on it,"" Barringer added.

Asia chip stocks rallied on Thursday, with Samsung Electronics and Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, leading gains.

In this article

Nvidia on Wednesday reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat expectations, and provided a strong forecast for the current quarter.

Wall Street welcomed the report, and Nvidia stock rose after the release and during the conference call. Other stocks in the so-called artificial intelligence trade also saw a boost.

A closer look at Nvidia's report shows that it continues to dominate the market for AI chips called GPUs, and CEO Jensen Huang sounded confident in the company's products and bullish on the company's outlook during a call with analysts. 

Nvidia said it expects about $65 billion in sales in the current quarter, which ends in late January. That would be 65% growth on an annual basis. 

Here are three key takeaways from Nvidia's earnings:

On Wednesday's earnings call with analysts, Huang began his comments by rejecting the premise of an ""AI bubble"" held by some investors who are concerned about the billions of dollars being spent on Nvidia chips and potential return on investment. 

""There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,"" Huang said. ""From our vantage point, we see something very different.""

Huang said there were three different kinds of uses for AI that are currently growing, and that all three are contributing to the boom in infrastructure investments.

He said that non-AI software, like for data processing, was increasingly being run on the company's GPUs, that AI will create new kinds of apps, and that ""agentic AI"" which doesn't need user input, will require additional computing power. 

Huang said that people will soon start appreciating what's happening underneath the surface of the AI boom, versus ""the simplistic view of what's happening to CapEx and investment.""

Bernstein analysts said in a note that Huang's comments helped settle investor fears of a bubble after a recent pullback in AI names, saying ""perhaps the AI trade is not yet dead after all.""

""More than just good numbers, we believe investors needed some hand-holding from Jensen which he provided in spades,"" the analysts wrote.

Last month, Huang said at a conference in Washington, DC, that his company had orders for $500 billion in AI chips in 2025 and 2026.

On Wednesday, the company said that the forecast was still on track. Any long-term outlook from Nvidia is important to the technology industry because Nvidia counts many of the most powerful technology customers as customers. 

Nvidia said on Wednesday that its order backlog didn't even include a few recent announcements, like the company's deal with Anthropic or the expansion of a deal with Saudi Arabia this week. 

""The number will grow,"" CFO Colette Kress said on the call, saying the company was on track to hit the forecast. ""We'll probably be taking more orders.""

""We see the opportunity to grow for quite some time,"" Huang said. 

Several analyst notes on Thursday drew attention to the $500 billion forecast and the addition of the recently announced deals.

Jefferies said Nvidia ""answered the bell"" in its earnings report and said the numbers should help steady the AI trade into the end of the year.

""We don't expect every AI bear to be satisfied, but these results and added context from management around demand outlook should offer some near-term reprieve,"" the analysts wrote.

Nvidia fought over the summer to gain licenses to export its H20 chip, a slowed-down version of 2022 technology, to China. Some analysts projected the China business could be worth $50 billion per year to Nvidia. 

The company eventually got the licenses this summer after Huang personally met with President Donald Trump and struck a deal to give the U.S. government 15% of China sales. 

But it turns out that the sales of H20 chips during the quarter was ""insignificant."" Kress told analysts that the company recorded $50 million in H20 sales during the period. 

""Sizable purchase orders never materialized in the quarter due to geopolitical issues and the increasingly competitive market in China,"" Kress said. 

Nvidia has argued that the U.S. government should allow exports of the most advanced chips because it's better for national security if Chinese developers get used to Nvidia technology, rather than being forced to use Chinese chips and make them better.

The H20 is old technology, but Nvidia wants to gain approval to send a version of its current-generation Blackwell chip in China. 

""While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the US and China governments and will continue to advocate for America's ability to compete around the world,"" Kress said.

Analysts at Melius said Thursday that the lack of China sales made the numbers ""all the more extraordinary"" and projected Nvidia would generate nearly $400 billion in free cash flow over the next nine quarters.

""Currently Nvidia isn't delivering to China and we are not counting on this situation to get straightened out,"" the firm said.

Nvidia on Wednesday stateside reported fiscal third-quarter figures that beat analyst expectations (ironically, nothing unexpected there). It also provided guidance for sales in the current quarter that exceeded estimates (all good still). It was CEO Jensen Huang's comment, however, that piqued more interest. 

""There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on an earnings call. ""From our vantage point, we see something very different.""

Of course, this could be the regular sales pitch all CEOs have to do on earnings calls. Which leader is going to publicly put down their business model? Having said that, Huang might be intimating that, because of the insight Nvidia has into the artificial intelligence industry — such as precise sales figures, the relationships and deals still being forged, clients' plans on utilizing data centers — the sum of the sector is more than its parts.

That could be hopeful thinking. And there was some uncertainty regarding Nvidia's announced $100 billion investment in OpenAI. 

But investors certainly cheered Huang's statement and the chipmaker's results. Shares of Nvidia popped more than 5% in extended trading, after its post-bell earnings announcement. Prior to that, shares rose 2.85% in regular trading, pushing up major indexes.

Regardless of what the AI industry and trade might look like in the future, from investors' perspectives, Nvidia's earnings are clearly something to celebrate for today.

The S&P 500 snaps a four-day losing streak. Major benchmarks rose Wednesday stateside as investors returned to tech stocks, with Alphabet touching a new high. Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose Thursday as Asian chip stocks rallied on Nvidia's blockbuster results. 

Nvidia's numbers beat forecasts. Fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue were higher than Wall Street's estimates, with net income rising 65% year on year to $31.91 billion. Nvidia's guidance for sales in the current quarter also beat expectations. 

The Fed is divided on a December cut. ""Many"" officials think interest rates do not need to be lowered further for the rest of the year, but ""several"" assessed a reduction could be ""appropriate in December,"" according to minutes of their October meeting. 

Singapore's bourse ties up with the Nasdaq. The partnership streamlines the process of attaining a dual listing in the U.S. and Singapore for companies with a market capitalization of more than 2 billion Singapore dollars (about $1.5 billion).

[PRO] Nvidia's earnings shine but questions remain. Even though markets got a ""pop the champagne moment,"" as one analyst wrote, others are questioning the long-term viability of the AI business.

China's homegrown games capture overseas players as its cultural influence expands

From Nezha 2 to Labubu, it's been quite a year for Chinese cultural exports. Now, one of the latest titles to hit the $189 billion global gaming market is also from China. 

More than 2 million people played the martial arts video game ""Where Winds Meet"" within 24 hours of its overseas release this past weekend on PlayStation and PC, according to the game's Chinese publisher NetEase — and China's emerging soft power in games has captured the attention of wealthy investors in Saudi Arabia.

While artificial intelligence spending is forming a bubble in the market, investors don't need to give up their positions, according to Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio.

""Don't sell just because there's a bubble,"" Dalio said Thursday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""But if you look at the correlations with the next 10 years' returns, when you are in that territory, you get very low returns.""

Dalio's comments come as AI darling Nvidia surged more than 5% Thursday on the back of better-than-expected earnings and guidance. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang brushed off bubble concerns, telling analysts on Wednesday that ""we see something very different.""

Nvidia's rally lifted the stock market, with Wall Street appearing to move past fears around the AI trade faltering that weighed on stocks in recent sessions. 

The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite has climbed nearly 17% in 2025, propelled by gains in megacap tech stocks amid continued excitement around AI.

While Dalio sees a bubble forming, he said there would also need to be something to pop it. The billionaire investor said it's unlikely to be tighter monetary policy, but it could come from higher wealth taxes.

""The picture is pretty clear, in that we are in that territory of a bubble,"" Dalio said. ""But we don't have the pricking of the bubble yet.""

Dalio said market participants should look to diversify their portfolios through investments like gold. The metal — which has long been viewed as a safe-haven trade — has surged to all-time highs this year.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin extended its recent slide Thursday, diving below the $87,000 mark for the first time since April as traders weighed the prospects of a third rate cut this year following the delayed release of September jobs data.

The price of Bitcoin has fallen as low as $86,520 on the day, with a nearly 3% daily fall that's extended the leading cryptocurrency's weekly dive to 13.5% as of this writing.

Bitcoin has plunged by 31% since setting a new all-time high mark above $126,000 in early October.

Overall crypto market liquidations have surged over the past hour, currently sitting at $933 million across all crypto assets over the last 24 hours, per CoinGlass. Bitcoin leads the losses on the day, with $380 million worth of liquidated positions, followed by Ethereum at $239 million.

Ethereum and XRP are showing slightly sharper daily losses, both down about 3% as of this writing to prices of $2,827 and $2.00, respectively. ETH is down 15% over the past week, with XRP's loss in the same period nearing 18%.

Stocks are similarly falling on the day, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both showing losses in excess of 1% as of this writing.

Proposed Bitcoin for America Bill Would Enable BTC Tax Payments, Which Go to Reserve

Optimism over a potential December rate cut—which Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell tried to temper hype for in late October—has fallen in recent days, with analysts and traders now betting against cuts.

According to CME's FedWatch tool, just 37.6% of interest rate traders expect a 25 bps cut in December, while over 62% expect no change. The odds were effectively even just one week ago. On prediction market Polymarket, the odds show a similar spread, with a 63% likelihood of no change, flipping on late Tuesday as optimism faded.

September's delayed U.S. jobs report, issued Thursday following last week's government reopening, shows that the country added 119,000 jobs during the month. That's better than expected, but analysts have said the report doesn't provide clarity for traders.

""The September jobs report is a mixed bag,"" wrote Navy Federal Credit Union Chief Economist Heather Long on X. ""It's encouraging that more people are looking for work (the labor force grew +470,000). But more people are also unemployed now (+219,000).""

""The Fed probably won't cut in December,"" she added.

The scammers introduced their ruse with accusations and threats and wound up convincing the Cooks to use their own money to help investigate and trap bad actors on the “dark web.”

The scam would take the Cooks to gas stations and bodegas across Maine and in Florida, where they spend winters. Both 80 at the time, they drove to places they'd never been, into neighborhoods they normally wouldn't go. They even booked a last-minute flight to Portland and drove through a snow storm to meet the scammers' demands. In the end they were handing over taped-up cardboard boxes filled with cash or gold bullion to strangers who came to their homes in broad daylight or the pitch black night.

Week after week, they spent hours on the phone with Ryan Terry, ostensibly a Federal Trade Commission investigator. They would come to trust him, even appreciate his kindness, as he talked them through the painstaking process of gradually syphoning off their life savings.

They transferred retirement funds to a TD Bank savings account, then made $10,000 to $150,000 withdrawals so they could send bitcoin to a U.S. Treasury holding account, or cash or gold to government safe houses. They were told all of it would be returned to them when the investigation ended.

Neither the account nor the safe houses ever existed.

“The minute I put money in the machine, it was gone out of the country,” Larry Cook said during a recent interview at the couple's home in China, a rural town of about 4,500 near Augusta.

All the while, they thought they were helping the FTC catch criminals involved in identity theft and money laundering. They promised to keep their involvement secret, even fending off questions from a concerned family member and bank employees. They had receipts and letters signed by government officials — solid proof it was for real. They didn't notice the odd wording, faded government seals and chronic misspelling.

“We had a letter signed by Janet Yellen,” Larry Cook said, referring to the former U.S. treasury secretary.

Two years later, the Cooks are still dealing with fallout from the scam, trying to avoid losing their Social Security benefits and paying taxes on the money they lost, which counted as income in 2023 and 2024. The Internal Revenue Service recently agreed they don't have to pay federal income tax on the scammed money. Maine legislators are working on a plan so they won't have to pay state income taxes. But they're still on the hook for a $24,000 underpayment to Medicare and Medicaid.

The Cooks say they are sharing their story now because they are people of faith — Larry Cook is a retired pastor from Pennsylvania who established two orphanages in Kenya — and they believe they have been called to warn others against being scammed.

Before you judge them for falling prey to one of the fastest growing scams, they want you to know that they didn't think they would ever be conned like this either. 

Scam victims are prevalent across every generation. But while people ages 30-39 reported the greatest incidence of fraud in 2024 — 178 scams per 100,000 population, with a median loss of $450 — people age 80 and up reported the greatest losses, in part because they have more savings — 85 scams per 100,000 population, with a median loss of $1,650, according to the FTC.

“You think you're smarter than them, whoever they are,” Barbara Cook said. “But we're also of the generation that we trust the authority figures in our lives, especially government officials.”

They were shopping at the Augusta Walmart on Sept. 21, 2023, when Barbara Cook got a cellphone call from people who said they were security personnel with Amazon and TD Bank. She was having trouble accessing her Amazon account at the time and had sent several emails seeking help, which lent credence to the call.

She handed the phone to Larry, and from then on he was the scammers' primary contact. They said his name and Social Security number were being used on the dark web to make purchases in New York state and California, which the Cooks denied making. The calls continued for days, including from FTC representatives, who accused the Cooks of being involved in illegal financial activity and threatened to investigate their entire family. 

Trying a different tack, they also said the Cooks' savings were at risk of being stolen by cyber scammers and had to be moved into safer accounts. They would close all accounts associated with Larry Cook's current Social Security number and give him a new number. They emailed documents purportedly signed by Yellen and other officials to prove their legitimacy. Then they assigned Ryan Terry to handle the case.

“He insisted that we cooperate with a current FTC criminal investigation involving money laundering, bank fraud and other issues,” Larry Cook wrote in an account of their experience.

When the Cooks resisted his pressure, they said Ryan threatened them with a federal indictment, “which would involve heavy court costs, legal fees and the possibility of ruining not only (our) reputation, but also that of our two sons, both successful businessmen.”

In a final appeal, Ryan told the Cooks it was their “patriotic duty” to assist in the investigation and prosecution of these perpetrators. They reluctantly agreed. In early October 2023, they signed and returned letters of consent bearing what appeared to be the insignia of the U.S. Treasury Department.

“But we were warned that all activity and information would have to be kept in total confidentiality, including from family members, our accountant, our lawyer — everyone,” Larry Cook said.

Throughout their ordeal, they never told a soul.

Looking back, the Cooks still can't believe they did what they did, but they know exactly why they fell prey to one of the fastest growing scams.

The number of complaints about government impersonation scams increased 50% over the last three years, from 11,554 incidents worth $240.6 million in 2022 to 17,367 incidents worth $405.6 million in 2024, according to the FBI's cybercrime center. 

Among people age 60 and up, scams involving cryptocurrency more than tripled in the same period, from 9,991 incidents worth $1 billion to 33,369 incidents worth $2.8 billion.

“I look at it now and it seems so easy to say ‘no,' but it's not when you're right in the middle of it,” Larry Cook said. “At the time, we prayed for God's direction, but on this God was silent. Once you get enmeshed in the situation, it's almost like Stockholm syndrome.”

The Cooks describe themselves as hardworking, honest, Christian people who don't lie and expect others to tell the truth, especially those in authority.

Now 82, the Cooks met when they were 10 years old and attended the same Baptist church in Philadelphia. They began dating at 15 and married 61 years ago, when Larry was a senior in college. They moved to Maine in 2013 to be near family in Yarmouth and China.

Larry Cook made his fortune early, working first for an auto parts manufacturer, then as vice president of human resources for Johnson Matthey, a multinational precious metals and chemicals company.

At age 40, when he was ordained in the Church of the Nazarene, he left the corporate world with hefty retirement savings. He knew his earnings as a pastor would not be so robust, but he was raised to be a penny-pincher. Barbara Cook went back to work as an executive secretary.

Larry Cook stresses in multiple interviews that they thought they were helping to stop criminals from defrauding others.

Helping people is why he went into ministry, he said. His corporate bosses used to say he was “too nice.” They counted on him to reel in difficult clients and deliver difficult news to employees. Even in retirement, he's still promoting Kenya's Kids, the all-volunteer Christian ministry and children's homes he started in the East African country in 1997.

“I've always wanted to help people,” he said. “God created me that way.”

The Cooks experienced many of the tools in the scammer's toolbox — high pressure, threats, intimidation, fast-talking, fast-moving, emotional manipulation and what seemed to be a deep knowledge of their personal finances, family life and day-to-day whereabouts.

“They had information before we told them anything,” Larry Cook said. The couple isn't sure whether the scammers got their initial contact and financial information through Barbara's Amazon account or from TD Bank.

The Cooks got to know Ryan, the scammer who spoke with them almost daily. He had a slight foreign accent and called them sir and madam, things that seem like yellow flags in retrospect. But he calmed them down when they were stressed and shared personal information about himself.

“We liked Ryan,” Larry Cook said. “He was so nice. He talked about his wife and family. He said he wanted to meet us. He wanted us to go to Washington. He told us we were doing great.”

The Cooks also came to believe Ryan was tracking them through a WhatsApp account he helped to install on their phones. It allowed him to call them anytime and talk them through cryptocurrency purchases and pickups of cash and gold.

“When I was driving to a bodega in Lewiston and couldn't find a parking space, he told me spaces were available right around the corner,” Larry Cook said. “It was like he was watching me.”

Showing that kind of familiarity is a prime feature of the scammer's playbook, much like a psychic demonstrates personal knowledge in front of a large audience, said Dan Simons, a psychology professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He and Christopher Chabris, a cognitive scientist, co-authored a book on scams, “Nobody's Fool: Why We Get Taken In and What We Can Do About It.”

“There's a lot of information online that's available to everyone,” Simons said. “(The scammer) was probably on Google Maps and could see the area. They give you just enough information to make it sound like they know things about you.”

Simons said most cyber scams are run by international crime syndicates from call centers in places like Myanmar, Pakistan and India. Often they're staffed by victims of human trafficking who have no choice in the matter.

Most scammers also have a virtual script based on a lot of trial and error, Simons said. They're happy when someone suspects it's a scam and hangs up because they don't want to waste time.

“They don't have to catch everybody. They only have to catch a few,” Simons said. “It's not just a lone con artist anymore. It's organized crime on a massive scale.”

The proliferation of largely unregulated bitcoin machines also makes it easier to scam the uninitiated, Simons said. In September, Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued Athena Bitcoin, one of the largest operators of bitcoin ATMs, charging that it neglected to implement anti-fraud measures when his office found that 93% of its deposits came from scams.

The Cooks likely were more vulnerable because they were less savvy about technology, they had a sizable nest egg and they were especially trusting, Simons said. But we all want to believe that people are telling us the truth.

“We tend to have a truth bias and it takes a lot of effort to counter that,” Simons said. “(Getting scammed is) traumatic, it's embarrassing and it's great that they're willing to share their experience so others may learn from it.”

Ryan kept moving the goal posts, telling the Cooks repeatedly that “this will be the last time.” They never did tell anyone, not even their 20-something grandson when he interrupted their first bitcoin purchase. He pressed them to know why they were buying bitcoin. He even called later that day because he was worried about them.

“I told him we knew what we were doing,” Barbara Cook recalled. “I told him, ‘You just have to trust me on this.'”

They purchased and transferred cryptocurrency from convenience stores in Augusta, Waterville, Lewiston, Freeport, Portland and Naples, Florida. They struggle to remember exactly where, saying the experience is too painful to remember details they'd rather forget.

They became friendly with bank tellers and managers at TD Bank branches in both states. They went to different branches because most had limited amounts of cash on hand, and they succeeded in dissuading any serious intervention. 

“All of them asked if I was being scammed,” Larry Cook said. “A few had me sign a statement. I wouldn't lie. I told them, ‘It's my money and you don't have to know what it's for.' A bank manager in Naples said he was obligated to notify bank security and I said, ‘Please do.'”

At some point Ryan added gold to the mix, coaching the Cooks on how to buy bullion online and have it delivered to their homes. Six times “undercover” couriers picked up cardboard boxes filled with cash or gold — four times in Maine and twice in Florida. The value of each package ranged from $50,000 to $150,000.

In early 2024, the scammers seemed to grow skittish, the Cooks said, and Ryan indicated that TD Bank might be audited. He had them open a savings account with Chase Bank, where they were treated well, Larry Cook said.

“I was getting a lot of questions at TD Bank, so it became clear that we weren't going to get more than $20,000 at a time,” he said.

In October 2024, TD Bank pleaded guilty and was fined $1.8 billion for failing to maintain an anti-money laundering program and conspiring to commit money laundering. Several bank employees also were charged. “By making its services convenient for criminals, TD Bank became one,” U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time.

TD Bank declined to discuss its fraud prevention protocols. A spokesperson said the company “is committed to supporting clients who report they may have fallen victim to a scam” and it provides resources to help customers avoid them.

The last cash transfer took place on April 8, 2024. The Cooks fed $50,000 into a bitcoin machine in Florida. Their role in the investigation was over. They were relieved.

But when they tried to call Ryan to find out how and when their $1.3 million would be returned, his WhatsApp account had been deleted. The cold reality sank in.

“My first reaction was to shame myself and blame myself,” Larry Cook said. “I know I'm not stupid, but I made a lot of stupid decisions.”

The Cooks reported the scam to federal, state and local authorities.

FBI agents spent two days in their home, reviewing all of their documents and purging their devices of any malware. They told the Cooks last week that they don't expect to recover their money, but they continue to investigate and use their experience to train other agents.

The FBI declined to discuss the Cooks' case but responded to questions about similar scams.

“No legitimate law enforcement or federal agency is ever going to call or email you demanding payment, threatening arrest, or requesting personal or sensitive information,” said Kristen Setera, spokeswoman for FBI Boston. “We're not going to ask you to send us large sums of your own money to help us catch criminals, or for you to mislead anyone about why you are making the withdrawal. Legitimate investigations simply don't work this way.”

While the Cooks' seven-month ordeal was at turns terrifying, exhausting, all-consuming and ultimately traumatic, they admit they were deflated afterward. It had been exciting, especially when they were fully absorbed into their roles as operatives in a federal investigation.

Family members were shocked to learn of the scam but have been understanding and supportive, the Cooks said. They have shared their story at church and community meetings in Maine and Florida, where audience members lined up afterward to tell their own scam stories.

They are thankful for the prayers and support of family and friends, especially as Larry deals with macular degeneration and Barbara is being treated for lung cancer. And they are grateful to still have some financial resources so they can move to a retirement community in Pennsylvania. Their home on China Lake is up for sale.

“We're not destitute and we're being careful,” Larry Cook said. “But we're not enjoying our retirement as we planned. Our life is much diminished.”

The Cooks are now wrangling with income tax and Social Security impacts of an $802,000 increase in their 2023 income and a $508,000 increase in their 2024 income as a result of fraud.

After a year of negotiating, and at the urging of U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the IRS capitulated, refunding $161,000 that the Cooks paid up front on the retirement disbursements and writing off $243,000 that they still owed.

Maine Revenue Services is poised to write off $60,000 that the Cooks owe on their state tax returns, and legislators are planning to change state law so $40,000 that the couple paid up front may be refunded eventually.

“This is a bipartisan, all-hands-on-deck situation,” said Rep. Dan Sayre, D-Kennebunk, House chair of the Legislature's taxation committee. “It's unfortunate that these scams are getting more sophisticated. What's happening to (the Cooks) is unjust and we need to correct it.”

But so far, Social Security has been intractable. Under federal law, the Cooks' financial losses cannot be deducted from their income in assessing Medicare and Medicaid premiums, an administrative law judge said in a letter to Larry Cook last month.

The judge acknowledged the Cooks experienced a “significant hardship” but said being scammed isn't among the qualifying life-changing events that can trigger a recalculation of premiums, or allow an independent decision if the perpetrators haven't been convicted of fraud or theft.

With little chance of that happening, Social Security is deducting a combined $1,000 from the Cooks' $3,300 monthly benefits in 2025 and 2026 to offset a $24,000 underpayment to Medicare and Medicaid, they said.

“It's not over and it won't be over until this situation is resolved,” Larry Cook said. “I'm not anti-government, but when this kind of thing happens — they say it's the law, but the law never imagined fraud like this.”

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Cybersecurity firm Quarkslab has completed the first public, third-party security audit of the Bitcoin Core codebase — the open-source reference implementation that underpins the Bitcoin network, including a full-node client, a GUI, and an embedded wallet.

The four-month assessment, funded by Brink, a non-profit organization that supports open-source Bitcoin protocol development, and coordinated by the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF), focused on the peer-to-peer networking layer — the network's primary attack surface — as well as adjacent components, including mempool management, chain state, transaction validation, and consensus logic, according to a Wednesday announcement.

Completed in September, the audit totaled 100 man-days of work conducted by three Quarkslab engineers, with technical support from Brink and Bitcoin research and development firm Chaincode Labs. Before the code review began, two auditors worked in person with Brink engineers to familiarize themselves with Bitcoin Core's architecture and development practices.

The process combined manual code analysis, dynamic testing, and advanced fuzzing techniques drawn from Bitcoin's existing continuous integration workflows. Fuzzing is an automated software testing technique that attempts to break code by feeding it large volumes of unexpected, random, or malformed data.

The goal was not to certify Bitcoin Core, but to ""actively search for vulnerabilities, improve testing methodologies, and identify practical ways to strengthen the codebase,"" Brink noted in a separate post.

Quarkslab reported no critical, high, or medium-severity findings. The auditors did identify two low-severity issues and provided 13 informational recommendations, none of which qualified as security vulnerabilities under Bitcoin Core's classification standards.

""No high-impact issues were found, but marginal gain was brought on existing fuzzing harnesses as well as new ones to cover untested scenarios like chain reorganization,"" Quarkslab said.

""While no findings with critical, high, or medium security impact were identified during this engagement, this audit provided valuable feedback, insight, information, and testing improvements for Bitcoin,"" OSTIF added.

The results reinforce long-standing views of Bitcoin Core as a mature and conservatively engineered system maintained by dozens of contributors and reviewed by multiple organizations. While the assessment focused on a defined subset of the codebase, independent reviews may again be valuable in the future, particularly for new components introduced in upcoming releases, the firms noted.

""Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation that powers the Bitcoin network and helps secure trillions of dollars in value,"" Brink said. ""The project has a strong security track record, but it has never undergone an external security assessment. The more independent, security-minded reviewers who bring their unique perspectives, the better.""

The audit arrives amid renewed discussion over the long-term quantum threat to Bitcoin's cryptographic assumptions. Bitcoin, like most major blockchains, relies on elliptic curve digital signatures, which are secure against classical attacks but theoretically vulnerable to Shor's algorithm on a future large-scale quantum computer.

If elliptic curve cryptography were broken, private keys could be derived directly from exposed public keys — not through brute-force guessing, which would remain infeasible, but through a mathematical shortcut enabled by quantum algorithms. Researchers continue to debate timelines for when post-quantum upgrades may become necessary, with estimates ranging from a few years to decades, prompting ongoing exploration of migration paths that would protect funds once public keys are revealed.

Native SegWit Bitcoin address formats that start with ""bc1q"" are considered more resistant to quantum attacks because they do not reveal the public key until funds are spent. Only the hashed public key is visible onchain, which would be far harder for a quantum computer to attack.

This means funds stored at these addresses remain protected from quantum key-recovery attacks as long as they have never been spent and the public key has not otherwise been exposed. Once that spend occurs, however, the public key becomes visible, and any remaining funds tied to that address would inherit the same vulnerability — reinforcing long-standing guidance to avoid address reuse and move the full balance when spending.

Bitcoin Core's review also follows recent debate within the Bitcoin ecosystem over client diversity and the relationship between Bitcoin Core and Knots — a derivative implementation that maintains certain policy and configuration options modified in Core's latest v30 release last month. The often-heated debate highlighted differing views on how Bitcoin should balance conservatism, optionality, and decentralization in its software stack.

11/20 update below. This post was originally published on November 19

Bitcoin, ethereum and smaller cryptocurrencies have plunged over the last month as crash fears suddenly sweep through the market.

The bitcoin price has dropped under $100,000 per bitcoin, giving up the psychological level and dragging ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies lower even as analysts claim the liquidity “flood gates” have been opened.

Now, as traders brace for a potential $1 trillion bitcoin and crypto market crash, the threat to crypto from quantum computers has led to ethereum cofounder and the project's spiritual leader Vitalik Buterin warning elliptic curve cryptography could break before the next U.S. presidential election in 2028.

“Elliptic curves are going to die,” Buterin warned, referring to one of the foundational pillars of bitcoin, ethereum and crypto encryption, during the Buenos Aires Devconnect conference in comments reported by DL News.

11/20 update: Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin has also warned that the growing influence of Wall Street giant BlackRock over cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and ethereum could cause problems for the networks.

“How do you avoid capture by big behemoths like BlackRock?” Buterin was asked on stage, according to a DL News report, referring to a surge of institutional interest after the launch of BlackRock's bitcoin and ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024.

Buterin warned that if BlackRock and other large institutions keep expanding their ethereum holdings, the network faces the possibility that those focused on decentralization get crowded out and base-layer choices are optimized for institutions, making it harder for regular users to run nodes, and in turn driving centralization. 

“It easily drives other people away,” Buterin said. “We need to focus on the things that would otherwise be in short supply: global, permissionless, and censorship-resistant protocol.""

This week, BlackRock registered a staked ethereum fund in Delaware, signaling its intent to enter the staked ether ETF market, while its flagship ethereum ETF now holds $10 billion worth of ethereum.

Last month, Google claimed a breakthrough in quantum computing, following in Microsoft's footsteps after it unveiled a new quantum-enabling chip in February.

These and similar developments have catapulted quantum computing's risk to bitcoin, ethereum and crypto up the agenda.

“Given the current staggering rate of hardware progress, I now think it's a live possibility that we'll have a fault-tolerant quantum computer running Shor's algorithm before the next U.S. presidential election,” quantum computer researcher Scott Aaronson wrote in blog post this month, referring to how a quantum computer could break the encryption that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.

The “magnitude of the threat that quantum poses to all blockchains,” has given crypto investor Nic Carter “an urgent sensation like I have to act on it now with as much intensity as I can muster,” he posted to X.

""We don't need to panic, but we need to get serious,"" Alex Pruden, the chief executive of quantum computing risk company Project 11 posted to X, adding that “quantum computers at sufficient scale will break crypto at the most fundamental level imaginable.”

Meanwhile, bitcoin developers have also been warned they need to prepare for the post-quantum world that could become a reality by 2030.

“You should have a few good years ahead of you but I wouldn't hold my bitcoin,” Théau Peronnin, the chief executive of Alice & Bob, told Fortune during the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Portugal.

“They need to fork [move to a stronger blockchain] by 2030, basically,"" Peronnin said. ""Quantum computers will be ready to be a threat a bit later than that.""","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin extended its recent slide Thursday, diving below the $87,000 mark for the first time since April as traders weighed the prospects of a third rate cut this year following the delayed release of September jobs data.

The price of Bitcoin has fallen as low as $86,520 on the day, with a nearly 3% daily fall that's extended the leading cryptocurrency's weekly dive to 13.5% as of this writing.

Bitcoin has plunged by 31% since setting a new all-time high mark above $126,000 in early October.

Overall crypto market liquidations have surged over the past hour, currently sitting at $933 million across all crypto assets over the last 24 hours, per CoinGlass. Bitcoin leads the losses on the day, with $380 million worth of liquidated positions, followed by Ethereum at $239 million.

Ethereum and XRP are showing slightly sharper daily losses, both down about 3% as of this writing to prices of $2,827 and $2.00, respectively. ETH is down 15% over the past week, with XRP's loss in the same period nearing 18%.

Stocks are similarly falling on the day, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both showing losses in excess of 1% as of this writing.

Proposed Bitcoin for America Bill Would Enable BTC Tax Payments, Which Go to Reserve

Optimism over a potential December rate cut—which Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell tried to temper hype for in late October—has fallen in recent days, with analysts and traders now betting against cuts.

According to CME's FedWatch tool, just 37.6% of interest rate traders expect a 25 bps cut in December, while over 62% expect no change. The odds were effectively even just one week ago. On prediction market Polymarket, the odds show a similar spread, with a 63% likelihood of no change, flipping on late Tuesday as optimism faded.

September's delayed U.S. jobs report, issued Thursday following last week's government reopening, shows that the country added 119,000 jobs during the month. That's better than expected, but analysts have said the report doesn't provide clarity for traders.

""The September jobs report is a mixed bag,"" wrote Navy Federal Credit Union Chief Economist Heather Long on X. ""It's encouraging that more people are looking for work (the labor force grew +470,000). But more people are also unemployed now (+219,000).""

""The Fed probably won't cut in December,"" she added.

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, registered a new Delaware statutory trust, the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, on Wednesday.

Delaware Division of Corporations records show that the trust was formed on November 19. The listing does not include product documentation, but the public entity record can be viewed directly through the state's search portal.

Forming a Delaware statutory trust is a common early step for ETF issuers, particularly for commodity and crypto products. 

The next stage typically involves filing a registration statement with the SEC, which can be an S-1 or another form depending on the fund structure. 

The preparatory move, however, does not indicate that a filing is imminent. Decrypt has reached out to BlackRock and its registered agent for further information.

The registration comes as Ethereum staking ETFs have begun trading in the U.S., including the REX Osprey ETH + Staking ETF, which launched the first combined spot and staking-enabled Ethereum ETF in late September.

Grayscale, meanwhile, became the first U.S. issuer to add staking to an exchange-listed Ethereum product in October, following the SEC's approval of generic crypto ETP listing standards, which enabled the firm to incorporate native staking into its Ethereum ETFs. 

The move gave the market its earliest regulated benchmark for how staking yield could be passed through to shareholders.

Still, dedicated staking-focused Ethereum ETFs remain small. The REX-Osprey ETH + Staking ETF, for example, reported about $2.4 million in assets as of mid-November, with trading activity remaining light since its launch.

Earlier in July, BlackRock filed a rules-change request to allow additional staking functionality in its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). 

New language in the proposed changes stated the trust would “receive all or a portion of the staking rewards” generated by the staking provider, adding that such rewards may be “treated as income to the Trust.”

In Ethereum, staking means locking up Ethereum while staked so the network can choose users to validate transactions, in return for earned rewards. It also affects the circulating supply, as staked Ethereum is not freely tradeable until it is withdrawn.

Staking remains a point of regulatory caution because it involves active participation in network validation and introduces operational, slashing, and custody risks that differ from simple asset holding.

Issuers seeking to stake inside a registered product have had to detail validator selection, liquidity management, custody segregation, and how rewards will be accounted for under securities rules.

RIAs' ETF adoption continued to expand across investment categories, issuers and funds in the third quarter of 2025, according to the RIA ETF Trends report from AdvizorPro.

Advisors stepped up the pace at which they added new ETFs compared to previous quarters, AdvizorPro found. Almost 59% of RIAs added new funds to their portfolios during the quarter, up from 57.8% the quarter prior. In contrast, only 18.6% decreased their ETF counts. RIAs' average number of ETFs rose to 72.7 funds up from 69.9.

Advisors added an average of 17.54% more ETFs relative to their previous holdings during the quarter, and withdrew from an average of 7.74% of funds, according to AdvizorPro data. Based on average (21%) and median ETF turnover ratios (10.99%), AdvizorPro researchers believe that most RIAs took a measured approach to updating their ETF allocations, keeping the number of new ETFs low and withdrawing from only a few funds.&nbsp;The highest turnover in ETFs was concentrated among a few active RIAs.&nbsp;

However, RIAs leaned further into some of the in-vogue investment themes in the third quarter that correspond with secular trends, including AI, defense technologies, industrial reshoring and precious metals. They also continued to allocate to ETFs focused on digital assets, although they&nbsp;started noticeably expanding from primarily bitcoin ETFs to Ethereum funds, noted Michael Magnan, founder and CEO of AdvizorPro.&nbsp;

In fact, iShares' Ethereum ETF (ETHA) and Fidelity's Ethereum ETF (FETH) took the top two spots for the fastest growing funds among RIAs in the third quarter. The number of RIAs invested in EHTA rose by 112.43% quarter-over-quarter, to 376, while the number of RIAs holding FETH rose by 85.25% to 113.&nbsp;

“In the second quarter, Bitcoin dominated advisor interest,” Magnan wrote in an email. “In the third quarter, Ethereum-focused ETFs—ETHA, FETH, ETH—became the strongest growth engines across the RIA channel. That shift didn't show up in prior quarters and suggests advisors are beginning to treat digital assets as more than a single-asset trade. The trend is reinforced by broader institutional signals as well—e.g. this week's news that the Harvard endowment significantly increased its IBIT holdings. Even the most sophisticated institutions are increasing exposure in this space significantly, which is influencing how advisors think about client portfolios.”

AdvizorPro also found a visible shift in which issuers were gaining the most investors among RIAs. The data showed that the fastest-growing issuers' spots were taken over by newcomers such as Fundstrat and First Eagle Investments within just one quarter. Fundstrat emerged as the ETF issuer experiencing the strongest growth within the RIA segment in the third quarter. The company saw an almost 56% jump in its number of RIA subscribers, to 170. First Eagle Investments RIA subscriber count was up 35.7%, NEOS Investment Management was up 19.52% and CoinShares was up 14.29%.

“The most notable shift [in the third quarter] was the complete turnover in ETF leadership,” Magnan wrote. “None of the second quarter's fastest-growing ETFs reappeared in the third quarter, and nearly all of the fastest-growing issuers were new as well. The common thread is that ETFs continue to grow quarter-over-quarter, but the level of rotation shows how quickly RIAs are adapting to new products and responding to changing market signals rather than staying anchored to the same themes/issuers.”

Among the most popular new ETFs (those launched within the past three years) were NEOS Investment Management's derivative income-focused SPYI (with a 19.05% increase in the number of RIAs invested in it, to 225), T. Rowe Price's mid-cap blend vehicle TMSL (with a 14.67% increase, to 86 RIAs) and American Century Investments' small value fund AVSC (with a 13.6% increase to 142 RIAs).&nbsp;

AdvizorPro relied on 13F filings, ETF statistics and its database of 4,774 RIAs to draw its conclusions.&nbsp;","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

Crypto heatmap today, on Nov. 20, looks greener than during the bloodbath at the start of the week. However, major coins have not yet recovered: is still hovering around $91k, while is down 2% to $3k.

Let's follow Michael Saylor's advice to stay bullish and look at the coins that outperform the crypto market today, posting visible gains.

Cosmos (ATOM) has surged 14% in the recent 24 hours to $3.11, making it one of the best altcoins to buy today. Recent ecosystem headlines have turned more constructive after fall turbulence. A November network maintenance on major Korean exchange Bithumb that restored ATOM deposits/withdrawals underscored steady infra support, while community discussions about channeling Interchain Security (ICS) revenues into ATOM buybacks have rekindled token-economics debate, both helping sentiment at the margin.

Cosmos was created by Jae Kwon and Ethan Buchman to build an “Internet of Blockchains.” The 2016 whitepaper laid out the stack (Cosmos SDK, IBC, and what's now CometBFT/Tendermint). The Cosmos Hub launched in 2019 as the first zone. Messari's 2024 primer details ATOM's role in security, fees, and governance.

Zcash (ZEC) is up 8.6% to $672 at the time of writing, making it the second-best-performing altcoin today.

ZEC has benefited from specific catalysts, including reports of fresh treasury accumulation and new wallet features (e.g., shielded swaps in the Zashi wallet stack). Those narratives helped ZEC decouple in a few sessions this month.

Launched in 2016 by the Electric Coin Company, Zcash pioneered zk-SNARK-based private transactions. The NU5 upgrade (May 2022) introduced the Orchard pool built on Halo 2, removing the trusted setup and modernizing its privacy architecture.

Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) gained 9.6% and is trading around $0.32. The ASI token, tracked under the FET line on major price sites, has rallied at points on renewed AI-crypto momentum and ongoing exchange support for migration/conversion behind the alliance (e.g., conversion rates for OCEAN→FET). The bigger AI narrative around the merger keeps speculative interest elevated even as parts of the alliance evolve.

ASI is the result of a high-profile 2024 initiative to combine Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol into a single token economy, aimed at building an open, decentralized AI network. The Financial Times chronicled the merger's goals and delays; subsequent coverage has tracked changes to the coalition's makeup.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Exclusive: Former BlackRock employees raise $4.6 million for HelloTrade, a blockchain-powered trading platform","https://fortune.com/2025/11/20/former-blackrock-employees-raise-4-6-million/","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Kevin Tang and Wyatt Raich used to work in digital assets at BlackRock, where they helped the company pivot from its loud skepticism of crypto to being one of Wall Street's major players in the sector. During this time, they came to feel it was too difficult for people overseas to participate in common investment opportunities like purchasing U.S. stocks. That's why they co-founded HelloTrade, a mobile-first, blockchain-powered trading platform. 

The company announced on Thursday that it raised $4.6 million in a first round of funding from Dragonfly Capital, with backing from Mirana Ventures, along with angel investors. 

“We see a huge market opportunity to make these traditional assets such as stocks and commodities accessible to anyone around the world with an internet connection,” Tang, co-founder and CEO of HelloTrade, said in an interview with Fortune. “We believe that the next frontier of blockchain adoption will be the movement of these traditional markets on chain.”

HelloTrade aims to give investors around the world access to U.S. assets. For example, people in Vietnam or Indonesia may want to buy Tesla stock. But through their current brokerage systems, those aren't easily accessible. By using crypto technology, HelloTrade plans to solve that problem. The platform also offers perpetual futures, which give customers more exposure to an asset than they would have in cash on the platform. 

HelloTrade's value proposition is similar to that of trading platforms like Robinhood and Revolut. Tang says those companies can be clunky and hard to use, and that HelloTrade will focus on building a better user interface. 

The startup's product has not launched yet, but Tang said he expects it to launch at the end of this year or the beginning of next year. The company currently has about 10 employees. 

At BlackRock, Tang and Raich, HelloTrade's co-founder and CTO, helped develop the firm's crypto offerings. Tang worked as senior director on its digital assets team, and Raich was the head of engineering at its digital asset lab. During their tenure, the company released the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) ETFs, funds that both had record debuts on the stock market and were among the first crypto ETFs to launch. 

The two HelloTrade co-founders aren't the only ones bringing their legacy finance talents to the crypto world. In a report from last month, the well known venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz's crypto arm found that workers coming into crypto tend to come from a traditional finance background. This blending of Wall Street and crypto coincides with President Donald Trump's friendly policies toward the sector. Since last year's election, big banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have developed their blockchain technology. 

Tang and Raich often heard a saying at BlackRock: you spend decades building up trust, and you can lose it in a matter of minutes. It's an ethos they have brought to HelloTrade, which is why they plan to spend their new capital in part to educate individuals around the world about the benefits of blockchain technology, and to invest in the safety and security of their product.

ByPam Kaur,

Contributor.

For years, banks have tip-toed around blockchain. They've explored pilots, commissioned research, partnered with fintechs, and debated tokenization strategies—all while waiting for regulators to clarify where the guardrails actually sit. With the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) latest interpretive guidance, those boundaries are clearer: banks may hold crypto—but only when needed for operational purposes.

Earlier this week, the OCC issued Interpretive Letter 1186, confirming that national banks and federal savings associations may hold crypto-assets as principal on their balance sheets when those assets are necessary to operate or support otherwise permissible banking activities. In practical terms, this includes maintaining small amounts of digital assets to pay blockchain network or gas fees, operating a tokenized deposit platform, or testing blockchain-based settlement systems.

This guidance does not authorize speculative activity to “crypto trading desks”, but instead represents a targeted, operational path forward, as well as signals a shift from conceptual exploration to infrastructure enablement.

For many institutions, blockchain work has remained conceptual. Teams exploring tokenized deposits or real-time settlement frequently encountered a fundamental constraint: how to test or run blockchain-based functions if the institution is unable to hold the digital assets required to operate the rails. The OCC's interpretation removes the friction point. Banks may now hold limited amounts of crypto strictly to facilitate pilots and operational processes. It acknowledges that modern settlement and payment systems may require new forms of digital “fuel”, even when underlying business models remain traditional. 

This marks the transition from speculative crypto to operational crypto. Capabilities that were previously difficult to test, such as blockchain-based settlement pilots, tokenized deposit experiments, cross-platform interoperability testing, smart-contract-enabled workflows and on-chain KYC/AML proofs, now move into scope. For an industry that tends to move cautiously in the face of ambiguity, regulatory clarity itself is a catalyst for change.

Most banks are not prepared to tokenize their balance sheets, but the OCC's guidance gives them a clearer path to modernize the rails beneath their core services. With permission to hold small amounts of crypto for operational use, institutions can finally begin piloting tokenized deposits, programmable payments, and blockchain-based settlement systems without wading through regulatory uncertainty. 

Even with this new flexibility, governance and risk management remain central. The ability to hold operational crypto does not alter long-standing expectations around safety and soundness, custody controls, vendor oversight, or AML/KYC requirements. Banks that pair technical experimentation with disciplined compliance frameworks will be best positioned to advance.

The guidance also reshapes how banks may evaluate vendor partnerships. Institutions exploring operational crypto will increasingly look for fintech partners that offer secure custody, manage gas-fee abstraction, support token-agnostic infrastructure, and deliver audit trails that meet supervisory expectations. This shift may encourage a new wave of collaboration focused on core infrastructure rather than consumer-facing digital asset products. 

For fintech firms working in tokenization, settlement technology, compliance infrastructure, or on-chain/off-chain connectivity, the OCC's interpretation represents a meaningful opening. Regulatory uncertainty has long slowed bank adoption; the ability for institutions to hold operational crypto changes that conversation. Fintechs that can demonstrate clear operational efficiency—rather than emphasize speculative applications—may see stronger engagement from banks.

Success will require “bank-ready” architecture: detailed audit trails, token-handling practices aligned with supervisory expectations, clear separation between operational and speculative assets, and enterprise-grade risk and compliance capabilities. As banks begin piloting tokenized deposits, collateral flows or settlement processes, fintechs that can quantify improvements in speed, treasury efficiency, or operating cost will be well-positioned. 

While the OCC's interpretation does not answer every question in digital asset regulation, it removes one of the most practical obstacles to blockchain-based modernization. Banks do not need to take a market view on digital assets to test or operate emerging rails. They simply need the ability to use small amounts of crypto to make these systems function. The operational moment has arrived—and both banks and fintechs now have an opportunity to advance within a defined regulatory perimeter.

The collector Vignesh Sundaresan today unveiled a new project space, Padimai Art & Tech Studio, located in Singapore's Tanjong Pagar Distripark area. Sundaresan, who also goes by Metakovan, is best known for his 2021 purchase of Beeple's nonfungible token (NFT) work Everydays: The First 5000 Days for $69.3 million, which helped to make NFTs mainstream within the art market.

Sundaresan, who is based in Singapore, says Padimai is a heritage, contemporary art and research institution “dedicated to the question of how technology can function as cultural infrastructure. That means examining how digital works are created, how they survive, how they circulate, and how they shape collective memory.” It is, he continues, “meant to play a complementary, not competitive, role within Singapore's cultural landscape”.

Tanjong Pagar Distripark is already home to the state-backed contemporary art institution Singapore Art Museum and several commercial galleries. Sundaresan envisions his venue supporting projects that “don't fit neatly into gallery timelines or commercial expectations, supporting artists to work with technologists, archivists, coders and designers in ways that allow the work to evolve organically rather than being rushed toward display,” and also exploring the preservation of digital works. “Experimentation at Padimai is not about spectacle; it's about process,” he continues.

The space opens with an Olafur Eliasson exhibition, Your view matter—an adaptation of a virtual reality work the Norwegian-Danish artist made in 2022. It will involve visitors moving through six digital installations which respond to their movement—with each person's experience recorded and stored on a blockchain-based system devised by Sundaresan. The project “emerged from a shared interest in how technology can deepen, rather than distract from, the experience of perception,” the collector says. It “resonates strongly with Padimai's ethos because it treats technology as a philosophical tool,” he adds. “The work explores how we orient ourselves in the world, using virtual reality not simply for an immersive encounter, but for examining how we orient ourselves in digital and physical space, how perception shapes experience and how memory is formed.”

Sundaresan hopes Padimai will foster more such collaboration between art and technology, helping to push the boundaries of digital art. “Rather than focusing on novelty or market trends, we are interested in projects that operate at the intersection of embodiment, memory and digital infrastructure,” he says.

Sundaresan says his own collection will inform but not dominate the space. “The Beeple acquisition is part of the story that brought me here, but it is not the programme. If anything, it serves as a historical marker, a reminder of the moment when the art world confronted the idea of digital ownership at scale.”

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth

The UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) made its first major arrests in a cryptocurrency case, detaining two men in London and Bradford over an alleged $28 million fraud linked to the collapse of the Basis Markets scheme.

The November 20, 2025, operation marks a pivotal shift in UK crypto enforcement. Authorities are expanding efforts to counter sophisticated digital asset crime.

The Serious Fraud Office announced the arrests of one man in his thirties in Herne Hill, London, and another in his forties near Bradford. Raids, conducted in collaboration with the Metropolitan and West Yorkshire Police, focused on fraud and money laundering linked to the Basis Markets scheme.

This investigation is the SFO's first significant step into crypto crime, reflecting its growing strategy against digital asset fraud. The joint operation highlights the unique challenges of prosecuting cases that involve blockchain technology and NFTs.

SFO Director Nick Ephgrave confirmed the agency has developed specialized resources targeting cryptocurrency fraud. With digital asset schemes increasing, these capabilities are seen as critical for investor protection.

Solicitor General Ellie Reeves stated that such fraudulent activity poses a serious threat to the UK economy. She pledged government backing for enforcement, warning that crypto fraud erodes trust in the financial sector.

The SFO called for victims and whistleblowers to contact [email protected]. This public appeal suggests authorities anticipate more victims and that the case could set important legal precedents.

Basis Markets raised $28 million through two public NFT-based fundraisers in late 2021, capitalizing on the surge in NFT market activity that year. The first, in November 2021, focused on NFT sales, promising investors a stake in a new crypto investment vehicle.

The second offering came in December 2021, with funds intended to create a “crypto hedge fund” that employs advanced trading strategies. Investor momentum was high, as NFT sales and enthusiasm for crypto projects peaked during this period.

However, in June 2022, the project abruptly halted. Organizers cited “proposed US regulations” as the reason for its suspension just as US agencies were rolling out broader scrutiny of NFT and crypto fundraising practices.

This collapse left investors unable to access the $28 million raised. The project's timing, coinciding with broader crypto market downturns in 2022, raised concerns that regulatory changes may not fully explain the failure.

NFT-based fundraising became a common approach in 2021, with projects leveraging digital collectibles to attract capital. 

US Treasury research shows that about 65% of NFT fraud cases involve misleading marketing. This significant rate of fraud underlines the regulatory and enforcement challenges facing authorities.

The Basis Markets probe comes as the UK intensifies efforts against digital asset-related crime. The Crown Prosecution Service's Economic Crime Strategy 2025, published in May 2025, identified cryptocurrency and cyber-enabled fraud as high-priority threats that require multi-agency coordination.

Authorities have appointed operational leads for cryptoasset recovery and created frameworks to boost cooperation between the CPS, SFO, and law enforcement. 

These reforms show a recognition that new tools and strategies are needed to address blockchain-based financial crime.

The SFO's move to prosecute crypto-related cases aligns with a global trend of increased enforcement against digital asset fraud. 

Worldwide, regulators are scrutinizing fundraising methods that blur lines between securities, collectibles, and investments. The Basis Markets case could help define how UK courts approach crypto fraud charges going forward.

Social media reaction highlights investor attention to enforcement. Bitcoin Archive highlighted the significance of the SFO's pursuit of large-scale crypto prosecutions with this investigation.

This case signals greater regulatory risk for digital asset fundraisers that lack legal clarity. The SFO's willingness to pursue complicated crypto cases sends a message that regulatory uncertainty will not protect those accused of fraud. 

The outcome of this prosecution could shape how aggressively the UK approaches future crypto crime as the sector evolves.

A union representing Lloyds Banking Group employees is asking the Information Commissioner to investigate the lender's use of staffers' personal current account data as part of its pay negotiations.

Earlier this month, it emerged that Lloyds compared the transaction data of around 36,000 employees with accounts at the bank to the wider public.

The group - which is made up of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland - looked at that data, along with the saving rates and salary increases of low paid employees - and compared them to its customers.

According to the Financial Times, the Accord union claimed in correspondence with Lloyds that, on reviewing the account data, the bank ""concluded we are more financially resilient than the general public. This was used to justify a lower pay award.""

Lloyds defended the practice, stating: ""In these situations, any insights used are always aggregated and anonymised to ensure both compliance with important data protection regulations and to support our common practice of using data to underpin our decision making.""

Now, another union, Affinity, has written to the Information Commissioner, arguing that the fact that data was aggregated and anonymised ""does not mean that those activates are exempt from the Data Protection Act"".

Says the letter: ""The data was taken from the personal accounts of employees and their spouses or partners without their express permission. Lloyds had no reason to access that data other than to justify its proposed pay increase. That's not a legitimate reason under the Data Protection Act.""

This, writes, Affinity general secretary Mark Brown, ""needs to be investigated as a matter of priority"".

Affinity - which is not recognised by Lloyds - has also taken aim at ""in-house lap dogs"" Accord and Unite unions. 

""Instead of breaking off pay negotiations to tell their members what Lloyds had done, Accord and Unite agreed to the pay increases instead,"" says Affinity.

High-performance blockchain's public token sale reaches 75% of $187 million target with three days remaining, facing headwinds from market conditions and community concerns

Monad's public token sale has raised $140 million toward its $187 million target with three days remaining before the sale closes on Saturday, marking a more cautious reception than recent comparable offerings despite the project's technical ambitions.

The sale, conducted through Coinbase's token launch platform, is offering up to 7.5 billion MON tokens, representing 7.5% of the initial 100 billion token supply, at $0.025 per token, valuing the network at $2.5 billion. 

The sale opened on November 17 and runs through November 22, two days before Monad's public mainnet launch scheduled for November 24.

The fundraise follows MegaETH's $1.4 billion ICO last month, which filled its $50 million allocation within five minutes and concluded 28x oversubscribed. Bitcoin traded $110,000 during the MEGA sale, while it's exchanging hands at around $92,000 currently.

Market conditions have impacted pre-launch valuations. MON's pre-market valuation on Hyperliquid has declined 36% from $6 billion to $3.8 billion, implying approximately 50% gains for ICO participants if the token launches at current prices.

The sale structure includes a $100 minimum and $100,000 maximum contribution cap for standard participants, with higher thresholds available for Coinbase One subscribers. Purchases are subject to KYC requirements and geographic restrictions, excluding certain jurisdictions including most of Europe and New York where Coinbase operates under regulatory constraints.

Community sentiment has emerged as a complicating factor. Monad allocated just 3.3% of token supply to community airdrops, disappointing some early supporters who participated in Discord events and community activities over several years. The decision reflects tensions common to major token launches between rewarding genuine community members and avoiding exploitation by airdrop farmers using bots and paid participants.

""Decentralization is only possible with widely distributed ownership of the MON token,"" the Monad Foundation stated in a blog post, describing the Coinbase platform as enabling ""smaller allocations across more participants"" and bringing ""public sales to retail purchasers in the US and globally.""

Monad positions itself as a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain designed for speed without sacrificing security or decentralization while maintaining full Ethereum compatibility. The project has spent several years developing what it describes as ""state-of-the-art financial infrastructure"" to power applications for a global user base.

""The mission is to power a new world economy, suitable for a world that is increasingly online and onchain,"" the foundation said, outlining pillars focused on developer experience, global reach, and technical excellence.

If the sale is undersubscribed, unsold tokens will be reallocated to ecosystem development. If oversubscribed, a ""filling up from the bottom"" distribution mechanism will prioritize broader distribution and limit concentration among large purchasers.

Polymarket currently gives Monad an 81% probability of attracting more than $300 million in total commitments. A potential catalyst for final flows could come from the finalization and release of funds from the MegaETH ICO, expected on November 21, one day before the MON sale concludes.

The raise comes as competition intensifies in the decentralized perpetuals market, where Lighter has rapidly emerged as a leading player.

LivLive's 200% Bonus Pushes It Toward Becoming the Next 1000x Crypto Presale","https://crypto-economy.com/missed-the-xrp-ico-surge-livlives-200-bonus-pushes-it-toward-becoming-the-next-1000x-crypto-presale/","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 13:16:25 GMT","

Home - Crypto Presales - Missed the XRP ICO Surge? LivLive's 200% Bonus Pushes It Toward Becoming the Next 1000x Crypto Presale

The crypto market often feels like a cosmic test of timing. Anyone who brushed off XRP under $0.20 remembers exactly when it exploded past $1, creating life-changing returns for early believers. Now that XRP is trading far above its early accumulation zone, investors are again seeking the next 1000x crypto presale with similar early-stage potential.

LivLive is emerging as that unexpected answer. The project has already raised over $2.1M, with more than 300 buyers stepping into Stage 1 at a base price of just $0.02. Unlike XRP's quiet beginnings, LivLive is launching with massive bonuses, timed incentives, and a narrative built around real-world utility that rewards early movers before the broader market reacts.

LivLive ($LIVE) has taken an aggressive approach to early-stage adoption by activating a flash sale during a market dip. Instead of slowing momentum, the downturn triggered its strongest bonus structure to date. Buyers can double or triple their allocations instantly, creating an environment where hesitation becomes costly and early participation becomes the engine for oversized upside before Stage 1 closes.











What makes LivLive stand out is its category-defining model. It introduces a live-to-earn ecosystem combining augmented reality, blockchain rewards, physical actions, and on-chain verification into a unified earning experience. With a total supply of 5B tokens and a community allocation of 65%, LivLive positions early supporters at the center of long-term value creation, offering the ground-floor access investors crave.

LivLive's tech stack is engineered for real-world utility rather than speculative hype. Its augmented-reality engine transforms physical locations into interactive earning spaces, while blockchain-verified presence ensures that every action is genuine and free from bot manipulation. This fusion of digital triggers and real-world validation gives LivLive the structural strength expected from the next 1000x crypto presale.

Supporting this innovation is a rapid reward pipeline connected to the upcoming LivLive wearable. The wristband verifies location, unlocks quests, and syncs AR interactions in real time, enabling frictionless participation. A scalable API layer also allows brands and venues to deploy campaigns inside the platform. Together, these components give LivLive a competitive moat few presales can match.

LivLive introduces a rare mechanic with its $2.5M Treasure Vault, where more than 300 winners will be selected across multiple reward cycles. With a top prize of $1M, participants gain tangible financial upside even before the token launches. This structure creates excitement, encourages activity, and motivates investors to accumulate more packs to maximize their winning potential.

The ROI potential heightens the appeal further. Stage 1 pricing at $0.02 contrasts sharply with Stage 10's $0.20 and the launch price of $0.25. Buyers using EARLY100 can double their allocation, while BOOST200 triples it for purchases of $2,000 or more. This means a $2,000 buy can convert into more than $6,000 worth of tokens at the very earliest valuation.

XRP remains one of the most established digital assets in the market, backed by enterprise adoption, global liquidity, and a loyal community that has endured regulatory turbulence. Its resilience through multiple market cycles has positioned it as a dependable asset with long-term relevance. However, mature strength comes with slower growth, limiting the explosive multiplier potential that new investors often seek.

The era of XRP under $0.20, when early buyers quietly secured life-changing positions, is now long gone. Today, XRP behaves like a top-tier asset rather than a high-risk, high-reward early-stage play. For investors seeking asymmetric upside, early access, and ground-level pricing, the opportunity zone has shifted. That early-stage window now belongs to LivLive, which is shaping up to be the next 1000x crypto presale for bold movers.











LivLive's combination of real-world earning mechanics, AR-driven exploration, blockchain validation, and wearable integration sets it apart from ordinary presales. The rapid $2.1M raise showcases undeniable momentum, and its bonus structure positions early participants with an advantage rarely found in emerging projects. Every layer of the ecosystem fuels long-term scalability and meaningful user engagement.

XRP remains a powerful, reliable asset, but its early-stage upside has already played out. LivLive offers what XRP can no longer provide: a true ground-floor entry with explosive potential, tangible utility, and a tech stack built for mass adoption. For investors seeking the next 1000x crypto presale, LivLive is the strongest candidate in the current cycle.

Secure your LivLive Stage 1 tokens now before bonuses expire and prices climb.

India's Asset Reserve Certificate (ARC), a fully collateralized stable digital asset developed by Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development giant Polygon and India-based fintech firm Anq, could go live in the first quarter of 2026, sources familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.

Sources said that each ARC token will trade 1:1 with the Indian rupee and will be minted only when issuers acquire cash or cash equivalents such as fixed deposits, government securities, or cash balances. This setup ensures transparency, safety, and compliance, addressing shortcomings often seen in foreign-backed stablecoins or speculative tokens.

Essentially, ARC is designed to prevent liquidity outflow into dollar-backed stablecoins, keeping liquidity and innovation within India's domestic economy while simultaneously fostering demand for public debt instruments.

The proposed digital token will complement the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) by serving as a regulated interaction layer developed by the private sector.

In this two-tier framework, the RBI's Central Bank Digital Currency remains the ultimate settlement layer, safeguarding monetary sovereignty and security. At the same time, the private sector operates the platform that fosters responsible innovation in payment solutions, programmable transactions, and remittance systems within a regulatory-compliant environment.

This framework ensures strong control over the monetary base by maintaining central oversight, all within the boundaries of India's financial and regulatory system.

Sources said that the ARC will align with rupee partial convertibility: the INR is fully convertible for current account transactions such as trade, business payments, and remittances, but remains restricted for capital account transactions to protect economic stability.

The stable digital token will do so by allowing payments for business transactions without requiring full convertibility. Importantly, only business accounts will be authorised to mint ARC tokens, ensuring compliance with the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) rules governing individual foreign exchange transactions.

Additionally, ARC's ecosystem will use Uniswap v4 protocol hooks to restrict token swaps exclusively to whitelisted addresses, reinforcing controlled access and regulatory adherence.

India's pursuit of a sovereign stablecoin comes amid rising concerns over capital outflows from emerging markets into dollar-backed stablecoins, following the Trump administration's pro-crypto regulatory measures.

Notably, the landmark GENIUS Stablecoin Act legalized dollar-backed stablecoins, raising alarms about significant liquidity shifts away from emerging economies. 

Standard Chartered recently warned that emerging market banks could face deposit outflows of up to $1 trillion over the next three years as savers increasingly turn to dollar-backed stablecoins.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Exclusive: Former BlackRock employees raise $4.6 million for HelloTrade, a blockchain-powered trading platform","https://fortune.com/2025/11/20/former-blackrock-employees-raise-4-6-million/","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Kevin Tang and Wyatt Raich used to work in digital assets at BlackRock, where they helped the company pivot from its loud skepticism of crypto to being one of Wall Street's major players in the sector. During this time, they came to feel it was too difficult for people overseas to participate in common investment opportunities like purchasing U.S. stocks. That's why they co-founded HelloTrade, a mobile-first, blockchain-powered trading platform. 

The company announced on Thursday that it raised $4.6 million in a first round of funding from Dragonfly Capital, with backing from Mirana Ventures, along with angel investors. 

“We see a huge market opportunity to make these traditional assets such as stocks and commodities accessible to anyone around the world with an internet connection,” Tang, co-founder and CEO of HelloTrade, said in an interview with Fortune. “We believe that the next frontier of blockchain adoption will be the movement of these traditional markets on chain.”

HelloTrade aims to give investors around the world access to U.S. assets. For example, people in Vietnam or Indonesia may want to buy Tesla stock. But through their current brokerage systems, those aren't easily accessible. By using crypto technology, HelloTrade plans to solve that problem. The platform also offers perpetual futures, which give customers more exposure to an asset than they would have in cash on the platform. 

HelloTrade's value proposition is similar to that of trading platforms like Robinhood and Revolut. Tang says those companies can be clunky and hard to use, and that HelloTrade will focus on building a better user interface. 

The startup's product has not launched yet, but Tang said he expects it to launch at the end of this year or the beginning of next year. The company currently has about 10 employees. 

At BlackRock, Tang and Raich, HelloTrade's co-founder and CTO, helped develop the firm's crypto offerings. Tang worked as senior director on its digital assets team, and Raich was the head of engineering at its digital asset lab. During their tenure, the company released the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) ETFs, funds that both had record debuts on the stock market and were among the first crypto ETFs to launch. 

The two HelloTrade co-founders aren't the only ones bringing their legacy finance talents to the crypto world. In a report from last month, the well known venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz's crypto arm found that workers coming into crypto tend to come from a traditional finance background. This blending of Wall Street and crypto coincides with President Donald Trump's friendly policies toward the sector. Since last year's election, big banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have developed their blockchain technology. 

Tang and Raich often heard a saying at BlackRock: you spend decades building up trust, and you can lose it in a matter of minutes. It's an ethos they have brought to HelloTrade, which is why they plan to spend their new capital in part to educate individuals around the world about the benefits of blockchain technology, and to invest in the safety and security of their product.

NVIDIA has released its Q3 earnings after the U.S. market closed earlier today. Into the print, crypto markets have stayed cautious, and the day's tone has hinged on whether equities digest the update cleanly or slide into a fresh risk-off swing that bleeds into digital assets.

NVIDIA reported fiscal third-quarter earnings of $57 billion, exceeding the $54.92 billion expected by Wall Street, and EPS of $1.30, also exceeding the $1.25 expected.

NVIDIA has forecast fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 revenue of about $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, and expects GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins of roughly 74.8% and 75.0%. The company has also guided for about $6.7 billion in GAAP operating expenses, $500 million in other income, and a 17% tax rate, signaling confidence that AI-driven demand will sustain elevated profitability.

The release lands at a point when equity indices have been unusually sensitive to AI-hardware demand trends, export constraints, and supply timelines, which means any miss or soft guidance could widen tech-sector drawdowns and tighten cross-asset correlations just as after-hours liquidity thins.

A revenue mix that points to slower data-center orders or elongated delivery cycles would typically raise beta across semiconductors, and those moves have tended to trigger de-risking that reaches crypto during the U.S. evening handover and into the Asia open.

A cleaner result with steady commentary on supply, deliveries, and capital spending would more likely stabilize equity futures and ease the defensive rotations that have coincided with weaker closes in digital assets this month, since index volatility often resets the short-term relationship between tech and crypto during event windows.

Spot order-book depth for BTC and ETH has lagged the headline pace of the month's swings, and spreads have widened around key U.S. time stamps, so shocks that hit when books are thin can produce outsized crypto moves relative to the underlying news. 

When that pattern appears, futures funding and basis usually recalibrate first, with spot stability showing up only after market makers rebuild inventory and tighten quotes, which leaves intraday bounces vulnerable if equity futures fade into the close.

ETF activity and stablecoin supply trends offer a second layer that has mattered for durability: net outflows from Bitcoin vehicles on risk-off days have lined up with heavier late-session pressure, while stretches of rising stablecoin float have coincided with firmer spot settlement and less reliance on leverage to support rebounds. 

If tonight's tech reaction shows tighter financial conditions, these channels often determine whether bids return promptly or whether the market leans on short-covering that exhausts quickly.

Macro context has remained central, because a firm dollar on growth unease or tighter conditions has tended to weigh on global risk, whereas a softer dollar on relief has supported equities and, by extension, crypto pairs that trade in step with index futures during event-driven sessions. 

NVIDIA's color on demand, supply chains, and customer spending plans feed that policy-growth mix, since AI-hardware cycles have become shorthand for investment appetite across large-cap tech and for the earnings breadth that anchors equity sentiment.

Against that backdrop, the near-term crypto path depends less on a single headline and more on whether liquidity rebuilds alongside calmer basis while ETF and stablecoin series move in a direction that supports cash-driven accumulation rather than transient squeezes. 

If those pieces lean constructive after the numbers post, risk tends to settle across both screens; if they diverge in the hours following the call, volatility usually lingers into the next session.

The token pierced the critical $2.10 floor during late-session selling as traders dumped positions ahead of a potential deeper correction.

• XRP traded within a volatile $2.03–$2.15 range as broader crypto markets weakened under macro pressure• The token's sharp bounce from $2.03 occurred amid a 28% volume surge, signaling active dip-buying before momentum faded• Multiple failed attempts to reclaim the $2.14–$2.15 zone capped upside throughout the session• Market sentiment remains fragile as Bitcoin's death-cross and heavy ETF outflows weigh on altcoins• Institutional activity slowed sharply in final trading hour as XRP cracked the widely-watched $2.10 support level

XRP slid 1.0% from $2.13 to $2.11 over the latest 24-hour session, navigating a choppy $2.03–$2.15 range. The token initially showed resilience against broader market weakness, but bullish momentum deteriorated steadily.

The most significant move came at 21:00 UTC when a 177.9M volume spike—28% above the 24-hour average—helped XRP rebound sharply from $2.03. However, the recovery stalled repeatedly at the $2.14–$2.15 resistance band. A pattern of lower highs developed as sellers absorbed each attempted breakout.

The session ended with a decisive breakdown: XRP plunged from $2.124 to $2.103 as heavy sell volume hit the tape. The drop punched cleanly through the critical $2.10 support, a level that had held for several sessions.

Late-session liquidity collapsed, signaling institutional traders stepped to the sidelines ahead of potential continuation selling.

XRP's chart structure shifted firmly bearish as breakdown signals stacked across intraday timeframes.

The loss of $2.10 turned prior support into immediate resistance. Meanwhile, the market now orients around the cycle low at $2.03, which formed during the heavy-volume rejection earlier in the session. The inability to reclaim $2.14–$2.15 keeps the near-term ceiling well-defined and the risk skewed to the downside.

The 177.9M surge during the $2.03 rebound confirmed strong participation, but the lack of follow-through volume during recovery attempts signaled exhaustion. The final-hour breakdown occurred on 4.4M units in a single interval—enough to trigger algorithmic momentum selling.

XRP now prints a clear sequence of lower highs and lower lows, consistent with early-stage continuation structures that often precede retests of major swing supports. The broader trend remains pressured by an unresolved medium-term downslope that began after repeated failures above $2.48.

Short-term oscillators approach oversold readings, suggesting potential stabilization if $2.03 holds. But without reclaiming $2.15, any bounce risks becoming reactive rather than structural.

XRP sits at an unstable inflection point:

• $2.03 must hold to prevent a deeper breakdown toward $1.91–$1.73 next-tier support• A reclaim of $2.15 is required to neutralize the bearish continuation structure• Liquidity conditions suggest institutions paused activity after the $2.10 failure—renewed volume will dictate the next impulse• Bitcoin's weak structure and death-cross dynamic continue to pressure altcoins disproportionately• Watch for volatility clusters around derivatives liquidation points—XRP saw ~$28M liquidated in prior sessions, and fresh forced selling could accelerate moves

The next stage of the continuing difficulties for digital asset treasury company (DAT) is fully upon markets as firms — many of whom after stock declines of 50%-98% are trading at levels far below the value of the crypto on their balance sheet — sell said crypto to fund share buybacks.

FG Nexus (FGNX), a DAT firm focused on Ethereum, said Thursday it had sold a chunk of its ether ETH$2,846.83 stash to repurchase stock.

The firm disclosed it has used proceeds from the sale of 10,922 ETH, roughly $33 million at current prices — along with $10 million in borrowed funds — to buy back 3.4 million of its shares. That amounts to about 8% of the outstanding float bought at an average price of $3.45, far below the reported NAV of $3.94 per share.

The news hit crypto prices, with ETH quickly sliding about 2% before a modest bounce. Bitcoin slipped about 1% as well, but has also clawed back some of that dip.

FG Nexus now holds around 40,000 ETH, along with $37 million in cash and USDC stablecoin, according to firm's update.

The move underscores the growing pressure on DATs, many of whose stock prices have plunged below the net asset value of their underlying crypto holdings. Fellow ETH treasury firm ETHZilla sold roughly $40 million of tokens last month to repurchase shares.

Share buyback programs offer one way to close that gap, but they also raise questions about how long such firms can sustain operations while liquidating core assets.

""We plan to continue buying back shares while our stock trades below NAV, which creates increasingly asymptotic effect on our per-share valuation metrics as the number of shares outstanding declines and net asset value per share increases,"" chairman and CEO Kyle Cerminara said is a statement.

FGNX shares were up 2% in the early minutes of the Thursday session, but remain lower by more than 95% from last summer's peak.

Modular RWA-focused layer 2 blockchain Plume announced Wednesday that tokenization giant Securitize is set to expand its footprint in DeFi by rolling out institutional-grade assets on Plume's Nest staking protocol.

The partnership, underscoring the growing convergence of traditional finance and DeFi infrastructures, will connect BlackRock and Morgan Stanley-backed Securitize's tokenized funds to Plume's network of over 280,000 real-world asset (RWA) holders – supposedly the largest RWA investor community globally.

In essence, Securitize's institutional-grade assets gain another robust onchain venue to move, trade and earn yield at scale. All underlying assets are issued and managed under Securitize's rigorous regulatory framework, ensuring transparency, full auditability, and compliance.

Plume's Nest staking protocol lets investors move, trade, and earn yield on tokenized assets within a regulated and composable DeFi ecosystem, supported by Bluprynt's Know-Your-Issuer verification system for enhanced transparency and trust.

""Through Plume, we're connecting institutional-grade assets to one of the largest communities of onchain RWA holders anywhere in the world. This collaboration represents a major step toward realizing truly global, transparent, and accessible digital capital markets,"" Carlos Domingo, Co-Founder and CEO of Securitize, said in a press release shared with CoinDesk.

Teddy Pornprinya, co-founder and CBO of Plume, emphasized that the on-chain world operates under the same principle as traditional markets: distribution determines scale. He explained that tokenized assets require liquidity, reach, and composability to realize their potential, capabilities Plume is uniquely positioned to provide.

“Securitize sets the gold standard in compliant issuance. Plume delivers the global distribution, composability, and liquidity layer that makes these assets come alive in DeFi,"" Pornprinya said.

The rollout starts with Hamilton Lane funds and will expand through 2026, targeting $100 million in capital, according to the press release. As a part of the deal, Bitcoin finance platform Solv plans to invest up to $10 million in Plume's RWA vaults, broadening BTC-based yield offerings with regulated, real-world asset exposures.

Speaking on the matter, Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol, stressed BTC's role in yield-bearing markets.

“As regulated on-chain markets emerge, bitcoin will underpin a new generation of yield, credit, and liquidity infrastructure, where demand for yield-bearing bitcoin with RWA-backed yields replaces passive treasuries as the next phase of institutional adoption,"" Chow said.

The labor market strengthened more than expected in September as the government begins to again release official economic data following a deal to end the shutdown.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 119,000 in September, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report released Thursday morning. Economists had expected a gain of 50,000 while the August reading was a decline of 4,000 (revised from an originally reported gain of 22,000).

The unemployment rate, however, rose to 4.4% against 4.3% expected and 4.3% in August.

This jobs report normally would have come in the first week in October, but was delayed due to the government shutdown. More topical jobs data won't be available until mid-December.

Up modestly after strong results and outlook from Nvidia calmed markets Thursday evening, bitcoin mostly held that gain, trading at $91,900. U.S. stock index futures continued with strong Nvidia-led gains, the Nasdaq higher by 1.9%. The 10-year Treasury yield remained at 4.11% and the dollar continued with small gains.

Prior to the report, markets have more or less eliminated the chances of a Fed rate cut in December and this data isn't likely to reverse that idea.

After you close your eyes, there is actually a certain point that brain activity falls off sharply, plunging until it reaches a sleep state.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Until now, it used to be thought that falling asleep was a gradual process, like being buoyed by clouds and drifting into dreamland. What actually happens is more like reaching the edge of a precipice—and taking a sudden fall into the shadows below. 

Falling asleep is quite literal. This is what a team of researchers from Imperial College London and the UK Dementia Research Institute, led by neuroscientist Nir Grossman, found out when they hooked subjects up to an EEG and saw that brain activity remains stable until there is a drastic drop in the final minutes before sleep sets in. Previous attempts to define the moment the brain transitions from a waking state to a sleep state had relied on short and mostly inconsistent EEG data fragments. Sleep does not lie at the end of a winding road, but rather at the bottom of an abrupt drop.

“The tipping point accurately defines the critical time during the transition from a steady wake state into a steady sleep state, providing an objective and physiologically precise definition of the wake–sleep cutoff,” Grossman said in a study recently published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.

Sleep involves both cognitive and physiological shifts. During the process of falling asleep, changes in brain activity cause breathing and heart rate to slow down, muscles to relax, and a reduced response to external stimuli.

There is a reason so many magazine articles keep urging you to get more sleep. It boosts regenerative processes such as homeostatic plasticity, meaning the adaptation of neurons to overall neural network activity so they can keep up normal communication with each other. Memories are also stabilized as information is reorganized during sleep, making it less likely to forget.

The transition between waking and sleeping states is overseen by clusters of neurons known as nuclei. Some of these nuclei promote wakefulness while others bring on sleep. For the brain to go into sleep mode, certain functions in both nuclei are switched off, which rapidly changes how neurons communicate. When sleep would take over used to be predicted by the activity of these nuclei between sleep and wake states. What Grossman and his team found is that the transition between states has a defined boundary as opposed to the brain gradually fading into sleep. 

It also turns out that the longer it takes you to reach the edge of sleep, once your brain takes the plunge, you will spend less time “falling” until you land in the sleep state. Sleep distance is how long it takes to fall asleep from the moment you close your eyes. Though it seems counterintuitive, EEG monitoring revealed that if it takes longer fall asleep, less of that time will be spent in the falling phase than for someone who falls asleep sooner. The average time between the fall and onset of sleep is 4.5 minutes. Maybe it would take 3.8 out of 30 total minutes for one sleeper, but 5 minutes out of 15 total minutes for someone else.

Why the fall takes longer for shorter sleep distances can be explained by the occipital cortex, which processes visual information, reaching that point of falling earlier than the frontal cortex, which is involved with thinking, emotion, personality and memory along with muscle movement and control. Once the researchers measured sleep distance for individual subjects, they were then able to use it to predict the time of the fall and of sleep onset in real time during the following nights. Predictions were within about 49 seconds of the actual fall. Recording brain activity for just one night showed that there would be 95% similarity on later nights. 

Being able to identify the point of no return for falling asleep isn't only demystifying how the brain transitions from awake to asleep. It could also help create new treatments for disordered sleep that not only increase quality of life, but promote safety in situations where someone needs to be fully awake and alert.

“Understanding the dynamics of brain activity during the process of falling asleep has profound implications for human health and public safety, especially given the increasing prevalence of sleep-onset disorders and the devastating consequences of falling asleep during critical activities such as driving,” the researchers said.

Next time you lay your head down on your pillow, prepare for a fall.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists reawaken exhausted T cells to supercharge cancer immunity","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251120002828.htm","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 05:53:48 GMT","

A new study has identified a molecular cue that cancer cells use to exhaust the T cells responsible for destroying them, and the findings show that shutting down this signal may help restore the body's immune defenses. The work, led by researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine and published Nov. 17 in Nature Immunology, reveals that tumors do more than slip past the immune system. They can also alter immune cells in ways that reduce their ability to fight back.

""Our dream is to make immune-based therapies available to every patient. To overcome resistance, we must unlock the power of exhausted T cells, reviving them to destroy cancer. This discovery moves us closer to a future where the immune system itself defeats tumors,"" said the study's co-senior author, Dr. Taha Merghoub, Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor in Oncology Research, and professor of pharmacology at Weill Cornell Medicine.

Why Immunotherapies Sometimes Fall Short

Modern immunotherapies have reshaped cancer treatment by boosting the body's own defense system. However, not all patients benefit, and even those who do may see their response diminish as their T cells become overworked.

""Our findings reveal a completely new way that tumors suppress the immune system,"" said co-senior author Dr. Jedd Wolchok, the Meyer Director of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, professor of medicine at Weill Cornell and an oncologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. ""By blocking this pathway, we can help exhausted T cells recover their strength and make existing immunotherapies work better for more patients.""

How T Cells Lose Their Ability to Fight

T cell exhaustion occurs when the immune system faces long-term infections or persistent tumor activity. Under these conditions, T cells can still recognize harmful cells, yet they stop attacking. ""So, they're primed, but they're no longer killing,"" explained Dr. Merghoub, who is also deputy director of the Meyer Cancer Center and co-director of the Parker Institute of Cancer Immunotherapy at Weill Cornell. He added that although this loss of activity seems harmful, it can prevent uncontrolled inflammation and sepsis.

Earlier studies showed that a surface protein called PD1 contributes to this exhaustion process. Drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors target PD1 and have already proven effective at reviving T cells in cancers such as melanoma.

CD47 Emerges as a Second Immune Brake

The research team set out to determine whether CD47, a molecule found on cancer cells, also plays a role in pushing T cells toward exhaustion. Previous work revealed that tumors use CD47 as a ""don't eat me signal"" to prevent certain immune cells from ingesting them.

What surprised the scientists was discovering that T cells themselves display CD47. ""When T cells are activated, they express CD47. And when they get exhausted, they increase CD47 to very high levels,"" Dr. Merghoub said.

Experiments showed that mice lacking CD47 had slower tumor growth, suggesting the exhaustion effect came from CD47 on immune cells rather than on cancer cells. In further tests, T cells missing CD47 were more effective against melanoma tumors than T cells that still carried the protein.

Thrombospondin-1 and CD47 Work Together to Exhaust T Cells

The team then investigated how cancer cells might manipulate this process. Their attention turned to thrombospondin-1, a large protein produced by metastatic cancer cells that binds to CD47. When mice were engineered to lack thrombospondin-1, their T cells showed fewer signs of exhaustion.

""That was the real eureka moment,"" said Dr. Merghoub. ""It showed us that CD47 and thrombospondin are clearly key players because eliminating either one gives you the same effect.""

Disrupting the Exhaustion Signal With TAX2

To understand the interaction more closely, the researchers used a peptide called TAX2, which was designed to block the connection between CD47 and thrombospondin-1. The results were clear: TAX2 helped maintain T cell activity and slowed tumor progression in mice with melanoma or colorectal cancer.

T cells in treated animals stayed more active, released more immune-boosting cytokines, and were better at entering tumors. TAX2 also enhanced the effectiveness of PD1 immunotherapy in colorectal tumor models.

""We used the TAX2 peptide as a proof-of-concept to confirm that disrupting the crosstalk between TSP-1 and CD47 prevents T cell exhaustion in mice with tumors,"" said Dr. Chien-Huan (Gil) Weng, an instructor in pharmacology and the study's lead author. ""Next, we plan to study both upstream and downstream modulators that regulate the TSP-1:CD47 pathway and develop means to selectively, effectively and safely disrupt this pathway to improve T cell-based cancer immunotherapy.""

Toward Stronger, Longer-Lasting Immune Therapies

Blocking this interaction could serve as an effective therapy by itself and may also help sustain tumor-targeting T cells in patients who are at risk of becoming resistant to current immune checkpoint treatments. According to Dr. Merghoub, early experiments in animal models suggest that inhibiting both PD1 and CD47 creates T cells that are significantly better at destroying cancer cells. ""We plan to explore this therapeutic angle.""

Sea level rise (SLR) increases the risk of flooding at coastal sites that use and produce hazardous substances. We assess whether socially marginalized populations in the United States are more likely to be impacted by projected SLR-related flooding of hazardous sites that could result in contaminant releases. We identify 5500 facilities at risk of a 1-in-100-year flood event by 2100 under a scenario of continued high greenhouse gas emissions, including coastal power plants, sewage treatment facilities, fossil fuel infrastructure, industrial facilities, and formerly used defense sites. Seven states (Louisiana, Florida, New Jersey, Texas, California, New York, and Massachusetts) account for nearly 80% of projected at-risk facilities. Controlling for population density and county, a one standard deviation increase in the proportion of linguistically isolated households, neighborhood residents identifying as Hispanic, households with incomes below twice the federal poverty line, households without a vehicle, non-voters, and renters is associated with 19-41% higher likelihood of having a site at risk of SLR-related flooding within 1 kilometer (odds ratios [95% confidence intervals]: 1.19 [1.09, 1.31], 1.22 [1.08, 1.37], 1.27 [1.16, 1.39], 1.35 [1.21-1.51], 1.36 [1.21, 1.53], and 1.41 [1.32, 1.52], respectively). Results elucidate the need for disaster planning, land-use decision-making, as well as mitigation strategies that address the inequitable hazards and potential health threats posed by SLR.

Global sea level has risen more than 11 cm over the last three decades and that rate is accelerating1, leading to an increase in coastal flooding due to high tides, waves, storm surge, El Niño events and other factors. Extreme coastal flooding is projected to more than double by 2050 across much of the world2. By 2100, nearly all of the coastal United States (U.S.) is expected to experience elevated water levels on a daily basis that today occur only twice per century3, with a rapid increase in the frequency of high tide flooding projected to begin in multiple cities during the next decade4.

Extreme flood events result in the release of toxic substances into the environment. For example, over 200 contaminant releases were reported in the Texas Gulf Coast after flooding resulting from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Over 10 million pounds of regulated air pollutants were released from refineries, petrochemical, and other industrial facilities5, and the catastrophic explosion of a chemical plant due to the loss of power for refrigeration necessitated the evacuation of 40,000 people6. Around the world, industrial facilities are disproportionately located along coastlines due to the historical importance of maritime trade to the establishment of industrial port cities, strategic access to global trade routes for raw materials and finished products via ports, and need for sea water for cooling and wastewater disposal. Marginalized racial and ethnic groups are more likely to live near hazardous waste sites and industrial facilities, and fenceline communities are typically subject to multiple forms of discrimination resulting in limited financial, political, and social capital to mitigate contaminant exposures7. Moreover, longitudinal analyses show that disproportionate hazard burdens faced by racially and economically marginalized groups are largely due to discriminatory land-use, permitting, and facility siting decisions8,9,10,11. Racial residential segregation and the inequitable distribution of stormwater infrastructure further contribute to racialized patterns of flood risk across U.S. cities12.

Building upon a prior California analysis13, we conducted a nationwide equity assessment of flood risk at hazardous sites in the U.S. due to sea level rise (SLR). We derived probabilistic estimates of flood risk in 2050 and 2100 across an expanded range of legacy contamination sites and facilities that contain, handle, produce or emit hazardous substances. We then assessed the geographic distribution of at-risk sites with respect to multiple present-day measures of social marginalization, including race/ethnicity, poverty (household income below twice the federal poverty line), voter turnout, housing tenure, and linguistic isolation. Our objectives were to characterize inequities in residential proximity to hazardous sites at risk of future flooding due to sea-level rise and identify communities where additional resources are needed to prevent exposure to toxic substances and enhance climate resilience.

We first assessed the annual probability of at least one flood exceeding the land elevation of over 47,646 coastal hazardous site locations compiled from one proprietary and four publicly available administrative data sources (Supplemental Table S1). We considered all sites within counties with land area below the 18 m elevation above current mean higher high water line across all coastal U.S. states and Puerto Rico. We defined sites as at risk if their projected annual probabilities exceeded 0.01 (i.e., they were threatened by a 1-in-100-year flood event) integrated across the full distribution of SLR projections using the law of total probability for one low (Reference Concentration Pathway [RCP] 4.5) and one high (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas emissions scenario (see “Methods”).

We found that over 11% of coastal sites in our analysis are at risk of SLR-related flooding by 2100 under the high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) (Table 1). Figure 1 shows the distribution of at-risk sites by state or territory under RCP 8.5 in 2050 and 2100. Seven states (Louisiana, Florida, New Jersey, Texas, California, New York, and Massachusetts) account for nearly 80% of projected at-risk sites in 2100 (Fig. 1). Restricting greenhouse gas emissions to the low emissions scenario makes little difference in terms of the number of projected sites at risk in the near term (2050) but would reduce the number of at-risk sites from 5500 to 5138 (a reduction of 362 or 7% of sites) in the long term (2100) (Table 1). Oil and gas wells and industrial facilities that emit quantities of hazardous substances that require reporting to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory (hereafter “TRI sites”) make up the largest proportion of sites we considered and sites at risk (Table 1). Under the high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), over a fifth of coastal sewage treatment facilities, refineries and formerly used defense sites, roughly a third of power plants, and over 40% fossil fuel ports and terminals are projected to be at risk by 2100 (Table 1).

States are shaded by the total number of at-risk sites, with darker colors representing a higher number of sites at risk (maps). The number of sites at risk in each state is broken down by type, with each facility type represented by a unique color (bar chart).

We next considered the distribution of at-risk sites with respect to community demographics and indicators of social marginalization derived from three secondary datasets: the American Community Survey, a proprietary data source on recent voter turnout, and the federal Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool14. We utilized census block groups as the geographic unit of analysis (hereafter “neighborhoods”) and considered block groups with at least one at-risk site located within 1 km of a populated area as being potentially affected (see “Methods”). Given the prominence of racial discrimination as a means of establishing and maintaining social inequality in the U.S.15, we considered measures of racial and ethnic makeup, as well as indicators of socioeconomic status, civic engagement (voter turnout), and vulnerability that relate to communities' ability to anticipate, mitigate, and cope with flooding, such as age, linguistic isolation (% of households where no one 14 years or older speaks English “very well”), and vehicle ownership.

Table 2 summarizes the population characteristics of neighborhoods near versus far from hazardous sites at risk of flooding due to SLR in 2100 under a high emissions scenario. Figure 2 shows the increase in the likelihood of an at-risk site within 1 km per one standard deviation increase in each demographic and social vulnerability measure, which we estimated using logistic regression models controlling for population density and county to minimize bias related to the higher concentration of people of color and renters in urban areas and demographic variation across U.S. regions.

Black circles are adjusted odds ratios from models that considered one population characteristic at a time and controlled for population density and county fixed effects. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals and were calculated using robust standard errors. The dashed line indicates no association. Disadvantaged status (as defined by the federal Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool [CEJST]) is a binary variable; all other variables are continuous and were scaled by unit standard deviation to facilitate comparisons between effect estimates.

Compared to other coastal neighborhoods, neighborhoods with one or more at-risk site nearby have lower voter turnout, proportions of residents identifying as Asian/Pacific Islander, and individuals under the age of 18, and higher present-day proportions of renters, households living in poverty, residents identifying as Hispanic and Black, linguistically isolated households, households without a vehicle, single-parent households, and individuals over the age of 65 (Table 2). In the multivariable regression models, all these bivariate associations remained statistically significant with the exception of the proportion of Black and Asian/Pacific Islander residents (Fig. 2). Neighborhoods designated as disadvantaged by the federal Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, a nationwide composite assessment of cumulative impact associated with multiple measures of social vulnerability (e.g., poverty) and the presence of climatic and environmental hazardous, had a 50% higher odds of having an at-risk site within 1 km, compared to other coastal, non-disadvantaged neighborhoods (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.50 [1.23, 1.83], Fig. 2). A one standard-deviation increase in the proportion of residents over age 65, linguistically isolated households, residents identifying as Hispanic, households in poverty, households without a vehicle, non-voters, and renters was associated with 15–41% higher likelihood of an at-risk site within 1 km (ORs and 95% CIs shown in Fig. 2). Associations were similar when we considered the presence of at-risk sites within 3 km instead of 1 km of neighborhoods (Supplementary Table S2).

Among neighborhoods within 1 km of an at-risk site, social marginalization was also associated with an increase in the number of at-risk sites nearby and the severity of flood risk across those sites (Supplementary Fig. S1). Here we quantify flood risk severity by estimating the neighborhood expected annual exposure (EAE), calculated by summing the annual probabilities of at least one flood occurring at all hazardous sites within 1 km of populated portions of census block groups. This expected value reflects the total number of sites likely to be exposed to flooding in a given year—either 2050 or 2100 (see “Methods”). Among neighborhoods with an at-risk site within 1 km, a one standard deviation increase in the proportion of Hispanic residents, households in poverty, households without a vehicle, non-voters, and renters was associated with a 7–13% higher number of at-risk sites in 2100 under RCP 8.5 and a 0.10–0.21 unit increase in EAE (see Incidence Rate Ratios, mean differences and corresponding 95% CIs in Supplemental Fig S1). These estimates again control for population density and county to minimize bias.

Figure 3 presents concentration indices and 95% confidence intervals summarizing the degree of inequality in the distribution of at-risk sites with respect to demographic and social marginalization indicators. We utilized concentration indices to identify the categories of facilities that were the most inequitably distributed for particular populations. Similar to the Gini coefficient commonly used to characterize income inequality, a concentration index ranges from −1 to 1, with negative values (in orange) indicating that the burden of at-risk sites is disproportionately higher for more marginalized groups and positive values (in blue) indicating that the burden is disproportionately lower for marginalized groups. Values are shaded white when confidence intervals include the null, indicating no significant evidence of a disparity. Concentration curves corresponding to the indices given in Fig. 3 are included in Fig. 4. These display the distribution of at-risk sites with respect to demographic and social marginalization measures, with the area between the curve and diagonal line of equality being equivalent to the concentration index (e.g. between −1 and 1). To increase the legibility of Fig. 4, for each demographic and social marginalization measure we display only the five site categories with the strongest concentration indices, while the full set of concentration indices is shown in Fig. 3.

Negative values (in orange) indicate a disproportionately higher burden of at-risk sites for marginalized groups, while positive values (in blue) indicate that the burden is disproportionately lower for these groups. White values indicate a lack of statistical significance at P > 0.05. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons.

The X-axis gives the cumulative share of block groups in descending order of each of the demographic and social marginalization variables. Curves above the equality line indicate a disproportionately higher burden of at-risk sites for marginalized groups, while a curve below the equality line indicate that the burden is disproportionately lower for these groups. For example, the top left panel shows that the 50% of low-lying block groups with the highest proportion of renters (indicated by the x-axis value of 0.5) host roughly 80% of at-risk fossil fuel ports and terminals and industrial facilities (indicated by y-axis values of 0.8), whereas if these sites were equitably distributed, the y-axis value would be close to 0.5 and the curves would fall closer to the bolded diagonal line of equality. For legibility, the top 5 facility categories with the strongest concentration indices for each measure are shown.

At-risk power plants, industrial TRI sites, clean-up sites, and fossil fuel ports and terminals disproportionately burdened neighborhoods with higher proportions of renters, non-voters, households without a vehicle, households living in poverty, and linguistically isolated households, as indicated by negative concentration index values in Fig. 3 and curves above the line of equality in Fig. 4. In contrast, at-risk concentrated animal feeding operations and active oil and gas wells more often did not disproportionately burden marginalized groups, as indicated by mostly positive concentration index values in Fig. 3 and curves below the line of equality for many panels in Fig. 4, although there were exceptions. At-risk refineries disproportionately burden neighborhoods with higher proportions of non-voters, households in poverty, and Black residents, and at-risk TRI facilities disproportionately burden neighborhoods with higher proportions of Black, Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander residents. In contrast, neighborhoods with a higher proportion of Native American residents are projected to be disproportionately burdened by at-risk active oil and gas wells, hazardous waste sites, landfills, and formerly used defense sites (Figs. 3,  4).

Conclusions about which at-risk site types are inequitably distributed are largely but not entirely consistent across different metrics of flood risk (number of at-risk sites, which is presented in Fig. 3 vs. EAE across sites which is presented in Supplementary Fig S2). For example, neighborhoods with higher proportions of renters, linguistically isolated households, and households without a vehicle were not burdened by a disproportionate share of at-risk refineries (Fig. 3), but when assessing EAE, they were disproportionately burdened (Supplementary Fig S2 and S3). Similarly, Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islanders were not burdened by a disproportionate share of at-risk refineries (Fig. 3), but are disproportionately burdened when considering EAE (Supplementary Fig S2 and S3). This may be because although the number of at-risk refineries tends to be higher near neighborhoods with smaller proportions of these residents, the severity of projected flooding at those refineries is higher than it is near other neighborhoods.

We present a national assessment of projected SLR-related flooding threats to multiple categories of coastal sites and facilities that contain, use or produce hazardous materials. Our results show that of the more than 47,600 coastal facilities in the U.S. included in our analysis, over 11% (5500 facilities) are projected to be at risk of a 1-in-100-year or more frequent flood event by the end of the 21st century (2100) under a high (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenario. A handful of states, including Louisiana, Florida, New Jersey, Texas, California, New York, and Massachusetts account for nearly 80% of projected at-risk sites.

Facilities at risk include 22% of coastal sewage treatment facilities, 24% of refineries, 44% of fossil fuel ports and terminals, 12% of industrial facilities, 21% of formerly used defense sites and 30% of fossil fuel and nuclear power plants. A prior study estimated the number of wastewater treatment plants and service populations across the U.S. that could be exposed to SLR scenarios from 1 to 6 ft, with projections ranging from 60 impacted treatment plants serving 4 million people to 394 plants serving over 31 million people16. That analysis did not incorporate elevated water levels due to tides, waves, and storm surge, which likely explains why we projected a larger number of sewage treatment facilities to be at risk of SLR-related flooding in the RCP 8.5 scenario. Another prior assessment of how unmitigated greenhouse gas emissions could affect U.S. power-generating capacity in 2100 among power plants in coastal areas estimated a similar number of power plants at risk as we did in our analysis. That study additionally considered the generation capacity of at-risk power plants. The authors found significant variation across states with exposed power capacities relative to current generation capacities being highest in Delaware, New Jersey and Florida (80%, 63% and 43%, respectively)17.

Our analysis shows that industrial facilities that are part of the Toxic Release Inventory make up nearly a third (34%) of the total sites at risk of SLR-related flooding (N = 1870), second to fossil fuel infrastructure (41%), including refineries, fossil fuel ports and terminals and active oil and gas wells. Because we did not include pipelines in our analysis, our projections of the extent to which the nation's fossil fuel infrastructure may threaten coastal communities due to SLR-related flooding and associated contaminant releases are likely an underestimate. Indeed, extreme weather events such as Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Harvey, while very different from the slower moving, incremental flooding related to SLR, have dramatically revealed the vulnerability of industrial facilities and oil and gas infrastructure. Flooding following these hurricanes led to oil and chemical spills, pipeline ruptures, as well as excess air pollutant emissions due to incidental releases as well as intentional shutdowns, flaring, and subsequent restarting of operations at petrochemical facilities18,19,20,21,22,23. Our prior equity analysis of contaminant releases related to Hurricanes Harvey, Rita and Ike found that these natural-technological (natech) disasters disproportionately impacted Hispanic, renter, low-income, and rural populations5. Similarly, results in this study show significant inequities in projected SLR flooding threats to potentially hazardous facilities; communities defined as disadvantaged by the federal Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) have a 50% higher odds of having an at-risk site within 1 km, and a one standard deviation increase in the proportion of linguistically isolated households, neighborhood residents identifying as Hispanic, households in poverty, households without a vehicle, non-voters, and renters is associated with 19–41% higher likelihood of an at-risk site.

Our findings align with prior equity studies of current and projected distributional burdens of flood risk among diverse populations in the U.S. A national study using Federal Emergency Management Agency maps from 2001–2019 in urban areas along with National Land Cover Data and county-level Census data found that 100-year flood zones, particularly in coastal counties, are often occupied by a higher proportion of disadvantaged populations24. Another study of coastal and inland areas estimated an average increase of 26.4% (24.1–29.1%) in climate change related flooding by 2050 under an RCP4.5 scenario, with the future increase in flooding risk concentrated on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and disproportionately affecting Black communities25; although this study examined flooding and economic losses related to residential and non-residential properties, it did not consider risks to potentially hazardous sites. Other studies have examined flooding threats to active and legacy sites containing hazardous material. For example, a report found low-income communities were disproportionately represented among the populations living in proximity to clean-up sites (listed or candidate sites for the Superfund program) at risk of coastal flooding under low, medium, and high SLR scenarios in the East and Gulf Coasts26. A follow-up study identified coastal land below 10 m of elevation as potentially exposed to rising groundwater and identified 326 Superfund sites in these coastal areas that could experience mobilization of toxic compounds from contaminated soil due to groundwater inundation driven by SLR; results also showed that socially marginalized groups in several states would be disproportionately affected by this groundwater rise scenario27. Another analysis of former hazardous manufacturing facilities in six U.S. cities identified more than 6000 relic industrial sites with elevated flood risk over the next 30 years (2050), with socially vulnerable groups, including people of color and low income, disproportionately likely to live in these areas28. Studies outside of the U.S., for example in coastal regions in India, Copenhagen, Vietnam and Italy have investigated the risks posed by climate change-driven SLR and storm surge on infrastructure and vulnerable sites29,30,31,32, but none to our knowledge have evaluated these risks using an environmental justice framework.

Strengths of our study include the use of tax parcel data to characterize the extent of facility boundaries, a probabilistic approach to estimating SLR-related flood risk, and the application of dasymetric mapping techniques to estimate populations and community demographics near at-risk sites. Limitations of our analysis include the fact that our flood models assume that the frequency and magnitude of flood events will remain static over the next century. However, studies indicate that tropical cyclone activity is likely to intensify due to the acceleration of climate change33,34,35, which would result in more damaging impacts to coastal communities36. Additionally, our estimations of annual probabilities of flood level exceedance, based on a modified “bathtub” approach, do not consider scenarios of groundwater intrusion and upwelling or nonlinear interactions between extreme flood events and local topography. These dynamics could cause increased flood levels at inland locations, especially where marshlands shrink, and land becomes more developed37. Our analysis also does not account for floodwater level attenuation particularly in areas where land is wide and flat, which may overestimate exposure during extreme storm events38. Locational errors for hazardous sites may have also led to over- or under-estimates of the number of at-risk sites, and data limitations precluded inclusion of other facility types, including underground storage tanks, brownfields, and non-National Priority List Superfund sites that could experience contaminant releases due to SLR-related flooding. Inaccuracies in the delineation of coastline boundaries may have resulted in the inclusion of offshore drilling sites and the overestimation of flood risk. Finally, we did not account for future flood risk mitigation efforts or population and demographic shifts, given the high degree of uncertainty in predicting these scenarios. Therefore, future actions to mitigate flood risk near hazardous sites, gentrification, displacement, migration, and other factors could change the associations we observed between demographics, measures of social marginalization, and proximity to at-risk sites.

Our analysis highlights the disproportionate burden of projected SLR-related flooding threats to hazardous sites on marginalized racial and socioeconomic groups and elevates the importance of centering environmental justice in future climate change adaptation and land-use planning strategies to protect vulnerable coastal communities from natech disasters. Given that nearly 80% of projected at-risk sites are in seven states, future in-depth work can target these areas and more precisely characterize the potential hazards posed by these facilities to nearby communities with the goal of mitigating and preventing future harmful exposures and health risks. With over 30% of nuclear and fossil fuel power plants, 23% of refineries, and 44% of fossil fuel ports and terminals in coastal areas projected to be at risk, federal reporting requirements for these facilities could be expanded to include the forecasting of SLR-related flooding threats and preventive plans for mitigation, including future relocation, to avoid catastrophic contamination. Critical to these efforts will be ensuring that federal and state agencies provide publicly available, accessible, and continually updated data on projections of SLR-related flooding threats to hazardous sites for diverse end-users, in particular at-risk communities, planners, regulatory agencies, scientists, and decision-makers39. Future research focusing on a smaller subset of facilities and more localized regions or municipalities could further elucidate and potentially untangle the extent to which place-based trends in industrial, economic, labor market, and housing development trajectories, demographic churning, changes in land-use decision-making as well as other shifting structural factors account for the origins and persistence of inequities in exposures to at-risk sites that disproportionately affect marginalized populations.

Finally, many other climate-related phenomena, such as groundwater rise, wildfires, landslides, major storms, and extreme heat, also threaten clean-up sites and active facilities that use and store hazardous materials27,40,41. To achieve a fuller picture, information on these threats should be integrated with projected SLR flood risk data. Risks may be reduced through enhanced regulatory requirements (1) for at-risk facilities to mitigate and prevent contamination threats and (2) for more robust assessment of clean-up sites to inform abatement activities and decisions about future land reuse. Action-oriented partnerships between communities living near at-risk sites and government agencies at local, state, and federal levels may increase the chances for success of these strategies by marshalling much-needed resources aimed at preventing contamination from acute natech disasters and slower-moving threats, including SLR-related flooding.

Our analytic approach entailed four steps: 1) the identification of coastal hazardous site locations and the cleaning of associated descriptive data; 2) the estimation of future flood risk due to sea level rise at each site location; 3) the compilation of measures of demographics and social marginalization; and 4) a neighborhood-level analysis of the relationship between these measures and residential proximity to at-risk sites. We co-developed these methods with an advisory committee comprised of staff members from environmental justice and public health organizations with whom we collectively decided on greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, timeframes (2050 and 2100), flood risk metrics, categorization of sites, and the demographic and social vulnerability metrics to include13.

The spatial extent of our analysis was U.S counties and county equivalents with any land area below 18 meters elevation above current mean higher high water line across all coastal U.S. states and Puerto Rico (see Supplementary Fig S4). Areas farther inland are at no conceivable risk of flooding due to sea level rise this century and were therefore excluded. We scaled up an approach for a prior analysis of California13 to compile a national dataset of active industrial facilities and other potentially hazardous sites. To achieve this, we sourced data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Facility Registry Service (FRS)42, the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Energy Atlas43 (petroleum refineries and terminals), the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers' (USACE) Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center44 (petroleum ports) and Formerly Used Defense Sites database45, and a proprietary dataset of active oil and gas production and stimulation wells from EnverusTM 46. For the FRS, we chose to exclude remediated and closed facilities and facilities with inaccurate or imprecise locational information (e.g. latitude and longitude values derived from zip codes only or with inaccuracy >50 m). This included sites with environmental interest “end dates” indicating they would no longer be regulated after 2020 or where records indicated contamination had been addressed or the site was permanently closed. We retained inactive facilities and facilities with expired permits because residual hazardous materials may remain at these sites. We organized the remaining sites into one of seven categories using (1) environmental permits or regulatory programs; (2) the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code; and/or (3) keyword filters (see Cushing et al. 13 for further detail). We made sure that each category was mutually exclusive and without duplicate entries, as sites can have more than one environmental permit and/or NAICS code and appear in more than one database. We manually removed FRS entries for refineries using refinery names and coordinates from the EIA Energy Atlas dataset.

For oil and gas wells, we utilized latitude and longitude point locations to represent sites due to the small size of well pads compared to other site categories. We identified offshore oil and gas wells as those that were beyond the boundaries of 2010 Census block groups, and excluded them from the analysis to focus on wells located on land. Block group boundaries from the National Historical Geographic Information System do not include coastal water areas and terminate at the coastline. All other site types were represented as polygons in our analysis to better approximate a site's extent. For FRS, EIA, and USACE petroleum port sites, we used the Google API47 to (re)geo-code addresses, then joined the resulting coordinates to tax parcels obtained from Loveland Technologies (now Regrid)48 to approximate their spatial boundaries. Wherever a site's geocoded location overlapped with a tax parcel, we used that parcel to approximate that site's spatial extent for the purposes of projecting flood risk. Around 79% of our geocoded site locations fell within tax parcel boundaries. For sites that did not intersect tax parcels, we approximated boundaries by drawing a buffer equal to the median parcel area of intersected parcels for each site category (See Supplementary Material Table S1 for median areas applied for each category). For formerly used defense sites (FUDS), spatial data were available in both point and polygon format. Not all sites had a point or polygon, while some sites had both. To ensure we included all FUDS in our dataset, we (i) first included all facilities with polygon data, then (ii) identified facilities with point locations falling outside of these provided polygon boundaries, and (iii) drew a buffer around these point facilities using a circular radius that would result in the median area observed among facilities in (i). Wherever a polygon boundary overlapped with a buffered point, we clipped the latter based on the physical extent of the former (n = 25). For overlaps between two polygon boundaries, we used an overlap ratio (calculated as the area of the overlap divided by the area of the smaller polygon) to determine whether to split the overlapping area evenly between two facilities with minimal overlap (≤45%, n = 33), or to merge substantially overlapping facilities together into one (>45% overlap, n = 42). We resolved 13 complex cases involving three or more overlapping facilities manually on a case-by-case basis. The result of this process was a dataset of FUDS boundaries derived from original point locations or polygon boundary extents that contained no spatial overlaps between sites. For all sites, we then clipped parcels and circular buffer areas at the coast if they extended past the mean high tide line.

As a final cleaning step, we flagged and subsequently consolidated duplicate sites (n = 656) if they met three criteria: they were assigned to the same category, had identical geo-coded coordinates, and were associated with the same or similar addresses (we quantified similarity using a fuzzy text match). We retained facilities with identical coordinates and similar addresses if they had been assigned to different categories (n = 232). We dropped facilities with matching coordinates but dissimilar addresses (n = 30) if their geocoded coordinates appeared inaccurate or implausible via manual visual inspection (e.g., located in the middle of a forest far away from any established roads).

We used the same approach to assess flood risk at individual site locations as detailed in Cushing et al. (see Supplementary Fig S5)13,49,50. In brief, we considered probabilistic sea level rise projections51 for two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (Reference Concentration Pathway [RCP] 4.5 and 8.5) and 2 years (2050, 2100)51. For each site, year, and emissions scenario, we estimated the total annual probability of at least one flood event exceeding, in height, the 25th percentile of land elevation for a given site's parcel or buffer boundary. Projections account for vertical land movement and coastal flood height return level curves using methods from Tebaldi et al. and updated tide station data from across the United States52. We derived elevation profiles from NOAA's Coastal Topographic Lidar digital elevation model53, and estimated the annual flooding probabilities using Equation (1) from Buchanan et al.50 We considered sites to be at risk if their projected annual probabilities exceeded 0.01 (i.e., threatened by a 1-in-100 year flood event). We also summed these probabilities across sites to derive a total expected annual exposure (EAE) across all at-risk sites within a given distance of neighborhood (block group) boundaries.

We used 2010 U.S. Census block group boundaries as our definition of geographic neighborhoods. Census block groups are generally contiguous geographic areas that contain between 600 and 3000 people and are the smallest unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau reports a full range of demographic statistics. We used the U.S. Census American Community Survey's (ACS) 2015–2019 five-year estimates54 to approximate demographic characteristics at the block group level: age (% under 18 and % 65 and older), race/ethnicity (% people of color, defined as the inverse of % non-Hispanic White and disaggregated into % Hispanic, and % non-Hispanic [NH] Black, NH Asian or Pacific Islander, NH Native American, and NH other including multiracial), poverty (% below twice the federal poverty line), housing tenure (% renter-occupied units), vehicle ownership (% of households without a vehicle), family structure (% single parent-headed households), linguistic isolation (% of households where no one 14 years or older speaks English “very well”). We used voter turnout data from the 2016 and 2020 general elections from Catalist's National Database to approximate civic engagement (% of registered voters that did not vote averaged across the two elections). Finally, we used the federal Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) that identifies disadvantaged communities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Territories55. Developed as part of the Justice40 Initiative, CEJST was used by federal agencies to identify disadvantaged communities facing disproportionate climate and environmental burdens as well as economic marginalization. CEJST identifies disadvantaged communities through eight categories of vulnerability metrics related to climate change, energy, health, housing, legacy pollution, transportation, water and wastewater, and workforce development. Census tracts are identified as disadvantaged if they meet 90th percentile thresholds for indicators within any of the eight categories and are at or above the 65th percentile for low-income.

We began by identifying and including only counties in our study area with at least one site at risk under RCP 8.5 by 2100. We then further restricted the geographic extent of our analysis to “coastal” block groups in these counties within 3-km Euclidean distance of the 10-m elevation line above mean higher high water line. Our primary outcome of interest was the presence of at least one at-risk site within 1 km. We considered block groups to have this outcome if they contained populated areas within a kilometer of at least one at-risk site (see Supplementary Fig S4). Because block groups can be quite large in rural areas, we utilized gridded population estimates at a 30 × 30 m resolution56 to define populated portions of block groups with the exception of Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico for which these estimates were not available and where we therefore relied on block group boundaries alone. We secondarily considered (1) the total number of at-risk sites within 1 km, and (2) the sum of annual flood event probabilities (total “expected annual exposure”, EAE) across all at-risk sites within 1 km. We conducted sensitivity analyses considering alternate versions of these outcomes using a 3 km rather than 1 km buffer distance.

We examined descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients between our demographic measures and indicators of social marginalization and compared the distribution of neighborhood characteristics between exposed and unexposed block groups using Mann-Whitney U test because variables were not normally distributed. We then ran multivariable regression models for each outcome variable and vulnerability indicator pair, with block-group population density (people per square kilometer), and county fixed effects as additional independent variables. We did not include multiple demographic or social marginalization indicators in the same model due to multicollinearity. We chose to include population density as a potential confounder due to known associations between race/ethnicity, population density, and proximity to industrial facilities57,58. We included county fixed effects to control for regional demographic differences and in effect compare block groups with and without at-risk sites within the same county. We scaled continuous variables by unit standard deviation (SD), using the mean and SD from all block groups in our universe to allow for easier comparisons between effect estimates. In our primary analysis, we used a logistic model to estimate the odds of proximity to an at-risk site (yes/no variable). Restricting to exposed block groups, we used a negative binomial model to estimate associations with the number of sites nearby (count variable) and a linear model to estimate associations with EAE (continuous variable). We used county-clustered robust standard errors to control for the spatial autocorrelation.

Finally, we used concentration curves to visualize the cumulative distribution of the number of exposed facilities and EAE with respect to each indicator of social marginalization. We also derived the concentration index (C) equal to the area beneath the curve and line of equality in our concentration plots to quantify the cumulative distributions. C ranges between −1 and 1, with negative values indicating that block groups with higher proportions of residents from socially marginalized groups have a greater number of at-risk facilities and EAE, and positive values indicating they have a smaller burden of at-risk sites and EAE. A C value with a confidence interval that includes the null value of 0 indicates that the number of exposed facilities and EAE are similar between more and less marginalized populations. We calculated C using all coastal block groups, and we calculated separate indices for each facility category focusing on year 2100 under RCP 8.5. Concentration curves and indices were computed using R (version 4.5.0). All other statistical analyses were conducted using Python (version 3.13.7).

Brain implant developer Paradromics has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to test its device in an early-stage human trial, the company announced Thursday.

The Austin-based company is aiming to give a digital voice to people who have lost the ability to speak due to severe motor impairment. The trial will assess the long-term safety of the Paradromics device, as well as its ability to enable synthesized speech and text communication.

Paradromics is one of several companies—which include Neuralink, Synchron, Precision Neuroscience, and Cognixion—working on technology to control computers and other devices using brain waves. Known as brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, these systems capture brain signals associated with movement intention and translate them into commands.

The Paradromics study is slated to begin early next year and include two individuals. After collecting data on the first two participants for six months, the company plans to ask the FDA to expand the study to include more volunteers.

“It's reasonable to think that someone will be communicating at 60 words per minute and be able to really sustain the conversation,” says Matt Angle, Paradromics' CEO and founder, referring to a rate achieved by previous BCI trials led by academic groups. Normal speaking speed is between 120 and 150 words per minute.

BCIs for speech restoration do not read a person's inner thoughts. Rather, they decode certain signals from the brain's motor cortex that are generated when a person tries to move their muscles to speak. Users are asked to attempt to say sentences out loud so that the BCI learns how to recognize those brain patterns associated with speaking.

“They will just try to say words, and those words will appear very quickly on a screen. They'll press play, and the words will be read in their own voice,” Angle says. Assuming that there is an existing recording of the participant's voice, Angle says the company plans to generate a voice clone of that person using AI.

Earlier this year, Paradromics briefly implanted its device in a person who was already undergoing brain surgery. Surgeons used an EpiPen-like instrument to insert and remove the implant. In that procedure, the device stayed in the brain for just 10 minutes and wasn't used to restore speech. In the trial slated for next year, the device will be implanted long-term.

Paradromics' implant, called the Connexus, is a metal disk smaller than the size of a dime with 421 microwire electrodes that rest in the brain tissue and record from individual neurons. By comparison, Neuralink's implant is a quarter-sized chip that sits in the skull and has more than 1,000 electrodes across 64 tiny wires that are “threaded” into the brain by a custom-built robot. Neuralink has implanted at least 12 people around the world with its device.

Other BCI companies are taking a less invasive approach by attempting to decode signals from the brain's surface or outside of the brain entirely. The trade-off is a lower signal quality and data transfer rate because these devices sit away from the neurons they're reading.

“Individual neurons are the information carriers in the brain. So the more individual neurons you can record from, the more data you have,” Angle says.

Paradromics' goal is to develop an extremely high-bandwidth BCI—one that can transfer a large amount of neural data between the brain and a computer. A high data rate usually allows for faster performance and a shorter lag time between a user's intent and the system's reaction.

In sheep, the company has achieved a 200-bits-per-second data transfer rate, according to a recent scientific preprint. Neuralink previously claimed a record for BCI cursor control at eight bits per second.

Jacob Robinson, the cofounder and CEO of Motif Neurotech, a BCI company aiming to treat mood disorders, says that the two data points can't exactly be compared side by side. Notably, the sheep implanted with the Paradromics device were not being asked to control a cursor. In those experiments, the sheep were listening to sounds and their implanted BCIs were interpreting them. But he says the Paradromics data hints at an impressive bandwidth.

“In the same way that Neuralink broke the record for bandwidth with their device, I expect Paradromics to break it yet again,” Robinson says. “That's the kind of shift we're seeing, where we had these academic prototypes, and now that we're on an industrial track, we should expect performance improvements in the same way we see iPhones released every few years.”

Wanting to get rid of paper in your life is easy. Following through with that promise to yourself is hard.

I've been mostly paperless for close to 15 years, and the trick to it for me was to think about it the same way I think about taking care of my teeth.

Staying organized is a kind of hygiene. It's almost never a one-and-done clean-up job. So think about dental hygiene. We learn to brush our teeth twice a day, floss once a day, and see a dentist every six months to catch problems before they get worse. However, if you don't follow that schedule precisely, you can still have good dental hygiene. You just have to do enough. If you do almost everything you're supposed to, but you miss two days of flossing or are a few months late scheduling your next cleaning, your teeth won't suddenly fall out.

With hygiene (or any kind of maintenance), you don't have to be perfect; you just have to be good enough.

Going paperless is very much like that. Here, I want to share with you the plan I used to remove most paper from my life. It should help you get started, but know in advance that you don't have to stick to it exactly every moment of every day. You can mess up. You can forget. So long as you get into the habit most of the time, you'll find yourself mostly paperless in a couple of months.

Decide where to keep digitized papers. A natural choice is to save them in a cloud storage service, such as Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, etc. By saving them in a cloud storage service, you always have a backup. If you save files locally to your device, you could lose them all if your device is destroyed, lost, or stolen.

Create an inbox. An inbox is nothing more than a folder where you will save newly scanned papers by default. If you are highly organized, you might have specific folders where you want to sort each paper you scan. That's great. But where will the files go when you're feeling lazy or strapped for time? By creating an inbox, you have a catch-all place where scanned files remain until you're able to sort them.

Pick a scanning app, and don't overthink it. At this point in time, the majority of scanning apps are all perfectly suitable for digitizing paper. (Scanning photos is another story and requires a specialized app or a scanner.) If your cloud storage service has a mobile app, chances are the app has a built-in scanner. Use that. For example, the one included in the Dropbox app works great. It turns your phone's camera into a scanner, with auto focus, auto edge-detection, cropping tools, and everything else you'd want in a basic scanner.

Scan only new papers. Every time you receive a new piece of paper that you can scan, do it right away. Get into the habit of doing this. Ignore any backlog you have for now.

Name your file. As you scan a new paper, rename the file. If you need help, use this formula: YEAR_description_detail (the underscores are optional). Let's say I received a letter from the IRS in September 2025 related to my 2024 taxes. When I scan it, I will change the file name to 2025_IRS letter_2024 taxes.PDF. If you have more than one letter from the IRS that year, add a two-digit month to the beginning of the file name, for example: 2025 09_IRS letter_2024 taxes.PDF, where 09 means September.

Sort the file or save it to the inbox. Do you have an extra 15 seconds? If yes, immediately sort the file into a folder where you can find it easily later. If not, save it to the default inbox you created in step 2.

For papers you must keep, write ""Scanned"" and the date. Sometimes we have to keep physical papers in addition to having a scanned copy. When that happens, write ""Scanned"" on the top of the paper and add the date so when you see the paper again, you know you already scanned it. If it's an official paper that you can't write on, a sticky note will do. Store papers you must keep in a folder, accordion binder, or filing cabinet.

Shred, compost, or recycle. For all papers you don't need to keep, get rid of them quickly, whether by shredding, composting, or recycling.

When ready, tackle the backlog, but not all at once. The very last step that you should do only after you get into the habit of scanning new papers, is to start digitizing your backlog. Begin with the most important documents. You should have digitized copies of titles and deeds, mortgage paperwork, the last seven years (to play it safe) of your tax returns, birth certificates, marriage certificates, and so forth. Don't do it all at once! Focus on the most important papers first. I like doing this type of chore on New Year's Day, when it's quiet and I'm motivated to be more organized.

If you think about going paperless as like brushing your teeth, you can give yourself grace and leeway in those moments when you don't follow through perfectly. It's totally OK. As long as you do it most of the time, you're in great shape.

I was settling into one of those airport activity tables with high stools and electric outlets at my flight's gate, waiting for the agent to announce boarding, when I felt a gathering storm at the apex of my butt cheeks. This was my last flight after being away from home on a book tour in May. For the past two weeks, I hadn't left my chair much, due to all the posting, podcasting, writing, and tense, nervous scrolling that releasing a book involves. But I'd moved just fine from plane to hotel to bookstore. I'd even made a point of walking to the bookstores from hotels and back, to indulge some kind of Walt Whitman–esque fantasy.

But now, at the last moment, alarm bells were going off. The pain felt as if I'd taken a hard hit to my tailbone, as I'd once done after going off a jump in an inner tube and landing ass-first on hard-packed snow. But there was no incident to ascribe the pain to. It had arrived unbidden. And now it not only hurt to sit down as I faced two hours of compulsory sitting, but the pain was growing with every minute.

I spent the flight lurched forward in my seat, weight shifted all the way onto one leg, rocking back and forth as much as I could without looking like I was experiencing a religious hallucination. By the time I had to stand up, it was all I could do to not cry out—as bad as the pain was sitting down, standing up sent a radical guitar solo through my coccyx.

At that time, I was about four months postpartum from delivering my first baby, and had had a blissful recovery, all things considered. I had pelvic muscles of steel, thanks to over a decade of lifting heavy weights, a practice I continued until two weeks before giving birth. I had only been back to lifting for a couple of months—deadlifts, squats, bench, overhead press, here and there some rows or lat pull-downs—but everything had been going well.

At first I thought maybe the pain would disappear as quickly and mysteriously as it came. I knew that, just as the body goes through a loosening and expanding process to get ready for birth, it re-compacts itself slowly over several months after the baby is born. I figured that maybe my sudden sedentariness had healed my body too tight, like in Rookie of the Year. I began doing stretches I found online to try and pull my bones apart again—ankle crossed over knee and knee pulled to chest; sitting upright with legs splayed on the floor at right angles; knees crossed over each other like an overzealous lotus pose. Again, it seemed to help a little, but the pain persisted, and worsened enough to make me cry out every time I tried to sit for more than 10 minutes. This was a problem, because sitting was, in some sense, my livelihood—as a writer, I couldn't get words down or read unless I could be still. Eventually, after weeks of lying around the house, I made an appointment with a physical therapist, who, after hearing about my problems, forwarded me on to a pelvic floor specialist.

Pelvic floors are not a part of the body that I grew up hearing about. And it wasn't terribly long before my own pelvic floor episode that I learned we've all got one—old people, children, women, men. Most people's familiarity with pelvic floor activity extends only as far as “Kegels,” a semimystical gripping motion that women are encouraged to practice in order to be good at sex, and more wrongly, to get a baby out of one's birth canal. But Kegels only capture one small aspect of what the pelvic floor is capable of.

Many, many, many people do not have even this basic ability to intentionally engage their pelvic floor, even people who are otherwise healthy. This often means they don't have the ability to engage it while picking things up, shifting their weight, laughing, or, for birthing people, when they have to maneuver a baby out of their vaginal canal. These are very core tasks for human bodies, which means pelvic floor issues can lead to a whole host of problems.

But first: a primer. Imagine looking down into your own pelvis as if it were a big bowl with no bottom. The pelvic floor is a set of muscles that span the bottom of that bowl, attaching various parts of the pelvis, as well as the spine and legs, to each other. You may have heard at some point in high school biology that the diaphragm, the muscle that controls our breathing, is relaxed and unengaged when our lungs are empty, and when we draw a breath, we are flexing and engaging it. The trampoline-like pelvic floor is designed to, among other things, move in parallel with the diaphragm: When we inhale, it relaxes as all our organs move downward into it to make room for the breath. When we exhale, it flexes again. There are additional muscles that control our bowel movements, even the ones that help maintain an erection, for men.

But what I just described is a functioning pelvic floor. When we get stressed out, overburdened, fevered in the soul, traumatized, betrayed, bamboozled, run amok, or, say, forced to bear witness to constant atrocities, daily mayhem, senseless violence, and destruction—these problems can manifest as pelvic dysfunction, no matter who you are. As health-adjacent trend chasers have realized that pelvic floor problems represent fresh, untrammeled marketing earth, they have rushed in with purported treatments, products, solutions, and quick fixes. And there is nothing I understand better, now, than the abject need to drink directly from the garden hose of social media infomercials, unable to afford concern that its plastics and heavy metals will rot my brain.

The laconic physical therapist clad in a white coat trained her eyes up the barrel of my nether regions, cueing me to tense my pelvic floor and relax it again. She affirmed it was strong and responsive before indicating she would have to examine me from the other side. She went back in, so to speak, and had me repeat the exercise. “I don't feel that your tailbone is actually out of position,” she said. “OK,” I said. I imagined that it was possible to feel shortchanged by an exam like this, that if she did not take her time, people might feel dismissed or examined too perfunctorily when it came to entrenched pelvic pain. We sat there as the sun and moon rose and set, glaciers melted and the sea rose, all life turned to dust and mountains crumbled into the ocean and several ice ages came and went until finally I could feel new life being born again in some primordial cradle. Finally, she spoke. “If your tailbone were out of place, I would be able to feel it, but it is in a good position where it is,” she said. I flailed internally with impatience. And then—“Do you hold your breath?” she said.

This caught my attention. For my entire life, I've habitually, unconsciously struggled to breathe steadily, for reasons connected to my unbearably tense family life growing up. “Yes,” I said.

“I can feel it,” she said, “you never fully relax your pelvic floor. There is always 20, 30 percent of tension you are still holding, even when you think you are relaxed.” It was the amount of tension that I associate with what I would call “polite fart prevention,” the same way I'd learned to hold my abdomen in an inconspicuous sucked-in position after one high school friend slapped my hanging stomach enough times as she passed me in the hall. The physical therapist told me that I had a seeming panoply of problems that could all be minorly adding up to this one big issue. The rearrangement of my body parts had me still standing in pregnancy stance; I had weak lower abdominals that were still separated, as was the joint at the front of my pelvis, which had caused me intense pain toward the end of my third trimester and would benefit from more core exercise.

“Like dead bugs?' I said.

“No,” she said, shaking her head, mildly revolted. “No, no. No no no no. Like planks.”

She had me lie on my stomach and prodded at my sacrum at the base of my spine, noting that it was misaligned, tilted outward on the left side but inward on the right—a side effect of playing sports when I was younger, where, as a leftie, I stabilized on my right side and threw or kicked with my left arm or leg. She put the heels of her palms at the top of my left butt cheek and steadily leaned her weight on my hip until I felt a gentle pop.

When I sat up again, in addition to the planks, she told me that I needed to develop the habit of letting go of all of my pelvic floor tension when I was sitting down. While I was frustrated that there didn't seem to be one easy answer to my pain, I was fascinated that my pelvic floor dysfunction seemed to potentially exist at the intersection point of multiple running timelines: family trauma, recreational sports, pregnancy, a writing career, unrelenting ongoing unforgivable atrocities all around, all of it coming together to yank on my tailbone like an insistent toddler. It had gracefully tolerated one injustice after another, until the straw of a book tour broke its back.

John De Lancey, the director of pelvic floor research at the University of Michigan Medical School, is nattily dressed in a black polo buttoned to the neck, with neatly combed hair. Behind him hangs an illustration of an anatomical cross section: In the 19th century, a pregnant woman's cadaver was cut in half and the glass was pressed up against the cut side, so an artist could draw it. De Lancey said that this is one of the most accurate anatomical illustrations that exists, but no one other than him had sought it out to actually see it in the last 50 years.

There is hardly a body part that lends itself less to a 2D rendering. In most images of the pelvis, it's difficult to impossible to tell what cross section you are looking at, whether the spine is pointed down or at your face, whether it's at the front or the back. Anytime I look at a pelvis picture, I get an overwhelming need to just hold a 3D model that I can turn over in my hands and open up. It's almost worse the more detailed the images are. It doesn't help that, according to De Lancey, most of the diagrams of pelvises on the internet are wrong.

In fact, “virtually all the drawings are wrong,” he said, because they all copy one another and replicate the errors. Most of the correct ones, he said, derive from the early 20th century, when artists would draw the pelvic floor from life. Because of its orientation, its placement, and its functionality deep inside the body, De Lancey said, it was the one area that even medical professionals working on living patients would never, could never, see.

Even as the anatomical renderings got more accurate, the pelvic floor and its functions were a straight-up mystery. But it was, at least in part, for lack of trying: When cadavers were studied for pelvic floor anatomy, it wouldn't be a matter of record whether the living person had ever given birth, De Lancey said. Kristi Kliebert, a board member of the Academy of Pelvic Health, referred to it as a once—“mystical area.” We used to believe that when a person gave birth, everything down there just sort of gave out, like so many pieces of chewing gum. Postpartum people took it as a matter of course that their pelvic area was shot, and they would forever after pee a little when they laughed or otherwise physically exerted themselves.

There are three main reasons that, no matter how much we ever know about the pelvic floor, it won't make good party conversation: sex, pee, and poop.

But the medical world was missing an absolutely massive piece of the well-being puzzle for a lot of people: According to one paper, more than 25 percent of reproductive-age females globally have some form of pelvic floor dysfunction, including chronic pain, pain during sex, incontinence, organ prolapse, and a host of other poorly understood conditions. And as in so much science, especially science that covers a part of the body we are continuously embarrassed by and prefer not to acknowledge, that's only the cases we know about.

There are three main reasons that, no matter how much we ever know about the pelvic floor, it won't make good party conversation: sex, pee, and poop. The pelvic floor contains all the doorways for excrement, however they may end up being used, as well as those for reproductive functions, however those may also end up being used.

It wasn't until the late '70s that doctors and researchers started to look more closely, and found that the pelvic floor's thin sheets of muscle could be conditioned, strengthened, even rehabilitated like any of the other muscles in the human body. In 1977, the American Physical Therapy Association established the Academy of Pelvic Health Physical Therapy. According to De Lancey, MRIs plus healthy women volunteers in the 1990s and 2000s changed everything. It was suddenly much more possible to study a pelvic floor they could confirm was currently healthy.

“Healthy” in pelvic-floor terms means, first and foremost, that the person doesn't unintentionally urinate or defecate, and that none of their pelvic organs are prolapsed (meaning, sagging out of their openings, a fate that can befall them when overly intense strain meets a weak pelvic floor). It also means that the pelvic floor muscles are strong, that they don't lose tension when challenged; and that they are coordinated, meaning the person can engage them as a unit. Weakness and lack of coordination is what can lead to incontinence, and no one likes to get up there in years and pee themselves while they are trying to move the couch. As the profile of the pelvic floor continued to increase from the 2000s, this was the driving force behind a lot of pelvic floor research. Even still, the shame issue, plus the genderedness of pelvic-floor-related prolapse and incontinence, meant that we tended to accept that women who have given birth may just pee a little when they laugh for the rest of their lives—until the cause was taken up by brands like Goop, who likely saw opportunity for profit.

The innate skill of pelvic floor functionality seems, for now, to be somewhat random. Even elite athletes do not consistently have possession of their pelvic floors. In other words, you'd be shocked to know how many of our finest specimens of the human race are out there on the court, floor, platform, or field, peeing their pants a little as they perform some of their most difficult maneuvers. I am not kidding. Studies of athletes ranging from Olympic trampoline jumpers to triathletes to indoor football players to basketball players find that they are about as likely to experience urinary incontinence, or what is called “stress incontinence”—when a pelvic floor yields to strain and involuntarily releases some pee—as the general population. Sometimes more.

One of the specific things researchers have learned through more pelvic floor study was that the levator ani, the muscle sheets that run from the front of the pelvis and attach at the very tip of our coccyx, or our tailbone, get particularly stressed during childbirth, and can be torn or even ruptured. I seem to recall being told over and over throughout my life that the tailbone was a vestigial body part, one that symbolized our evolution from deep into the mammalian tree. It does not seem so vestigial to me anymore, holding together as it does the very cradle of life.

Over the next few weeks, I became very aware of where my pelvis was sitting in relation to my body. I found myself bent into a strange shape when I walked, upper body cranked forward and hips cranked all the way back. I tried to pull myself into more of a regular human shape. I stopped my stretches and committed to my planks, even though I have always hated planks. I tried to release my held pelvic floor tension when I could remember, which was admittedly not often.

I realized that while I was holding my son to rock him to sleep, I was cranking my lower back forward, turning my spine into a question mark, like sitting up straight but too much, to give him more of an incline to rest on, putting a lot of strain on my pelvic floor. I tried slouching in the other direction. Similarly, the lack of frontal tension meant my butt was skating out from under me in the bottom of my heavy squats. I started making more of an effort to keep it underneath me.

At my next PT session, the physical therapist asked how my pain was. Better, I said, it came on less quickly and hurt less, though going from sitting to standing still gave me a surge of pain. I proudly told her I had been dutifully doing my planks, that I could hold them for a minute at a time.

She made an indifferent expression and shrugged. “Sure,” she said, clicking on her computer. She laid me down on the table and probed my sacrum again, and then pronounced it less stiff, though still misaligned. She pressed on it again gently, hoping for the same pop as before, but none came. She moved her hands up toward my shoulder blades, pressing to the left of my spine. “You are tense,” she said thoughtfully.

“Does it have to do with what's going on in my sacrum?”

“Maybe,” she said. I had looked up the sacrum between appointments—a big triangular bone at the base of the spine where one side of the pelvis meets the other, where the upper body meets the lower. Sacrum is either from the Latin for “sacred,” or maybe just a mistranslation for “strong bone.” If you've heard of the “SI joint,” that is where the sacrum meets the ilium, the pelvic bone on either side. Important nerves pass through this joint, such that if my sacrum problems were to get worse, I could look forward to sciatica and even incontinence.

As I waited for the PT to give me some advice, I noticed that across from a corkboard buried in effusive thank-you notes from past clients, she had a poster of chakras hanging high on the wall above the cot. My pelvic floor was in the sacral chakra, associated with the color orange, the element of water, emotions, desires, relationships, and creativity, and governed by Parvati, the goddess of fidelity, fertility, and power.

The PT suggested I do bench presses, overhead presses. “And this,” she said, extending her arms fully to the side, thumbs pointed to the ceiling, and bringing them together over her head. This was about the last thing I expected to be told to do for my pelvis.

The issue that spans across demographics is the mysterious world of pelvic dysfunction. (The set of pelvic muscles that enable erections, in both penises and clitorises, is called the ischiocavernosus, for those taking notes at home.) In the same way that a tense experience, like someone jumping out from behind a wall and scaring us, triggers certain physical responses—racing heart, shallow breath—acute or chronic traumatic experiences can cause people to unwittingly create and hold tension in their pelvic muscles. When that tension becomes habitual, they may become incapable of fully relaxing their pelvic floor without conscious, and sometimes sustained and dedicated, effort. Ironically, this tension can also lead to symptoms like incontinence and organ prolapse, just like trying to hold a full beer stein out in front of you with every last bit of energy you have may result in you dropping and shattering the stein on the floor.

Now might be a good time to try and detect your own pelvic floor. Sit on the corner of your chair, or more ideally the corner of a table, so that the area between your legs is in full contact with the surface. (If you're in a public place or office, try to be … a little bit subtle about this.) Now imagine you are trying to lift that area away from the surface by contracting it, and hold it there. Now, relax and try taking a deep breath, and try to breathe all the way down into your abdominal cavity, all the way into where you are making contact with the chair or table, which will create gentle downward pressure. If you can do all that, at will, and hold your contractions and flexions for at least a few seconds, your pelvic floor function is likely pretty good. If you can't feel anything at all happening, or there is tension and you can't either release it or create it, you and your pelvic floor might be long overdue for a conversation.

The pelvis and its many ligaments and muscles and tendons are something like the puppet master of the rest of the body: Tension or dysfunction within the pelvis can manifest in symptoms as wide-ranging as dull lower back pain, shoulder tightness, shooting thigh pain, butt pins and needles, and more. This is to say nothing of issues that occur in the pelvis's many organs—IBS, constipation, painful urination. Inability to relax the pelvic floor can cause problems, too, just as overly loose or unengageable pelvic floor muscles can.

So if athleticism isn't the key to a functional pelvic floor, what is? For the last couple of decades, researchers have been circling the muscles of the pelvic floor, wondering how it can be helped. They were beginning to understand that pelvic floor function was not a matter of random fate, or even medical history. Pelvic floor functionality was teachable. But how?

Kari Bø, a professor emeritus for the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, has been researching pelvic floor functionality especially as it relates to incontinence for more than 30 years. The facts are plain to Bø: Everyone can, and should, know how to engage their pelvic floor.

I felt like I was chasing a mischievous ghost haunting my pelvis, always opening and shutting cabinets and doors and giggling from down the hall.

In the 2000s, Bø collaborated with the Swedish company TENA (maker of incontinence pads) to record a training video for exactly this purpose. They even stylized the video so it would blend in with at-home workout DVDs of the day, with the exercises led by Bø flanked by two backup instructors, all clad in aerobics gear. The DVD was sent for free to half a million women and, eventually, ended up online. When asked about the kinds of pelvic-floor training videos one might find on social media, Bø laughed. She cited so-called “experts” that prescribe exercises like glute bridges. “That has nothing to do with pelvic floor muscles,” she said. (She and De Lancey both scoffed mightily at the idea of Kegels, characterizing them as a borderline useless concept that has been repeated mindlessly by people who don't know what they are talking about.)

Bø's method is called “pelvic floor muscle training,” or PFMT. The full complement of exercises, including a general warm-up, runs about 24 minutes. As Bø sweeps her body gently through one movement after another, I can sense the frustration that comes with dealing with a body part we cannot really see, that someone can't effectively show another person what they mean by tensing or relaxing a set of muscles without giving them the most graphic possible view of our bodies. As the video runs, Bø instructs the viewer to lift up the pelvic floor, using her hands in front of her pelvis to mime the motion that should take place. But clothed and upright as she is, the viewer cannot really view what she is doing during a lot of the exercises. I sought out another video from the UK National Health Service which featured, finally, a 3D rendering of pelvic floor muscle exercises—which, at long last, showed the whole thing in action.

That all said, it's difficult to teach any body movements, no matter how much “showing” another person can do. It's one thing to mimic the motion of, say, a dead lift and another to use all the right muscles to do it. Going from motion-mimicking to true bodily engagement takes some deliberate practice and internal attunement to how one's body is moving. Sometimes, just pointing our attention to the right place within ourselves can build connection and function, and provide relief. But as the 24-minute length of the video reflects, this takes time and patience. If we'd had time and patience afforded us in the first place, we might not have pelvic dysfunction at all.

At my third PT session, I reported that I was feeling much less passive pain, though still sharp twinges when I stood up from sitting. Now instead of it feeling as if it was squarely in my tailbone, it had shifted to the left, deep in my butt cheek. I was also feeling some kind of tendon plucking against a bone in there whenever I took a step with my right foot. I'd spent some time before my appointment rocking my hips back and forth while resting a hand on one cheek, playing Marco Polo with the pop, only to find I couldn't feel it from the outside. I felt like I was chasing a mischievous ghost haunting my pelvis, always opening and shutting cabinets and doors and giggling from down the hall. Here I was, living proof that even with the full faculties of one's pelvic floor, it was possible to be undone by old habits and entrenched reflexes. Despite this, the physical therapist seemed to be zeroing in more on the problem every time.

The physical therapist pulled up a diagram of the many tendons, ligaments, and muscles that densely crisscross the pelvis. It looked like one of those obstacle-course set pieces that is a forest of bungee cords. I pointed to one that seemed like it was in the right spot: the iliococcygeus, a muscle that runs from the tailbone to a set of connective tissues toward the front, and just under a spiny edge of my sacrum, which, if shifted out of place, could feasibly be plucking on my ilicoccygeus deep inside my hip. But how to access this incredibly specific muscle we could not even see or probe, much less move intentionally?

The physical therapist thought a minute, chin in hand, gazing at her computer screen, before she had me lie down on the cot again and hold my left leg up, bent at a right angle, and then gently, almost imperceptibly, lift my right buttock off the cot. I could barely hold this position for a count of five. I released, and then about two seconds later she said “again,” seven more times. She pointed me outside to walk down the hallway. The popping was gone. Who was this witch?

“Twice a day, eight reps,” she said, turning back to her computer.

The thing about pelvic floor functionality is, you can have the most beautiful, responsive, strong pelvic floor in the world, and no amount of pelvic brains or brawn will prevent it from getting a little bent out of shape in the process of giving birth. In every birth, De Lancey noted, the connection between the left and right perineal membrane ruptures a bit. De Lancey, a master of mechanical analogies in the way a rarefied few science teachers are, likened this to a button popping on a too-small vest against a large stomach. Structurally, everything still works, but the abdomen sits a little different than before.

De Lancey was careful to note that only about 20 percent of women have impactful and lasting pelvic floor damage. And some of them won't see those issues come to bear for a very long time; for instance, a muscle tear during labor may mean that, 20 years later, that person is susceptible to organ prolapse or incontinence. But when it comes to preventing or mitigating those issues, half a well-functioning pelvic floor is better than a whole pelvic floor that can't be controlled.

A very large contingent of pelvic floor rehab is focused on helping people post-delivery. In European countries where the health care system treats women like human beings—France, for instance—women receive pelvic floor physical therapy as a matter of course after having a baby. But De Lancey noted it's likely that we may be overtreating problems that resolve on their own, or do not benefit from treatment, all while we are still trying to nail down appropriate treatments for problems we actually do have.

A systematic review just published this summer made a wide-ranging analysis of virtually all accepted treatments for pelvic floor dysfunction. An inexhaustive list: physiotherapy at home and in-office; antidepressants; electrical stimulation; shockwave therapy; dietary modifications; sexology advice; hormone therapy; NSAIDs; mindfulness-based therapy; intravaginal valium; respiratory and pelvic floor muscle coordination; heat; muscle relaxing postures. The main finding was that multiple treatment types tended to be more effective than any single treatment. To a normal like myself, this feels not unlike reading a list of possible medieval medical treatments for a now-mundane condition like scurvy, before we figured out it just means you need vitamin C: drowning a cat in a river that flows north, drinking a tincture of wolfsbane under a full moon, visiting the local leper, hitting oneself with sage bows, something to do with the four humors. It also feels very likely that, eventually, we will develop a more nuanced and detailed understanding of various pelvic floor conditions, which will sharpen our treatment approaches. For now, we are throwing in the kitchen sink. And it works—if, again, time and patience to complete multiple treatments are in supply.

We are encouraged to ignore our lifestyle problems until they slap us in the face. But this approach is proving more and more worthless.

In the United States, we use a biomedical approach, where medical systems identify medical problems that get medical solutions like drugs and surgery. But these are two treatments that have proven uniquely ineffective for most kinds of chronic pain. Pain relief drugs are generally either not powerful enough to relieve pain reliably, or not safe enough to take in significant doses over a long period of time. Surgery requires a physical defect to correct, which is often not present in chronic pain. Even in the event that it is in the case of pelvic floors, as with rupture, De Lancey noted that surgeries have not been successful.

In more developed countries—Canada, Australia, a lot of Europe—medical care for chronic pain, pelvic pain included, is moving toward a cross-disciplinary “biopsychosocial” approach, which helps pare down the sea of treatment options by assessing family circumstances, mental health, and social relationships in order to evaluate how appropriate treatments like exercise (the number one effective treatment in pelvic pain and many types of chronic body pain), massage, mindfulness techniques, or psychological treatment may be, in order to not medicalize a problem that may have a nonmedical solution.

Another way of putting this might be that lifestyle problems require lifestyle solutions. In America, our medical model is based almost entirely around acute problems and acute solutions—instead of a health care system and culture that provide for time and energy to go outside and exercise, or to eat a well-rounded diet, in order to prevent heart attacks, we just wait for the heart attack to happen, and then receive emergency quadruple-bypass surgery, for which the hospital bills our health insurance hundreds of thousands of dollars. We are encouraged to ignore our lifestyle problems until they slap us in the face. But this approach is proving more and more worthless when it comes to issues like chronic pain and body dysfunction, which cannot be disappeared with a pill or a surgical procedure. It also ignores the enormity of distress that accumulates when it's not a medical emergency, but wakes up alongside you every single day.

Helena Frawley, a professor at the University of Melbourne and a coauthor of the systematic review, said that the future of pelvic pain treatment will be person-centered, similar to the one we take for other complex conditions, like cancer. Rather than throwing the book at a cancer case, doctors now avoid (or are ethically supposed to avoid) prescribing complex courses of aggressive radiation and chemo to a person who wants to preserve their quality of life, and may only live a few extra months even with the most involved treatments. Similarly, in our theoretically glorious pelvic-pain treatment future, doctors will (or should) listen carefully to the patient about their needs and capacity to execute various treatments, and prescribe accordingly. In other words, the more we listen to and try to understand each other, the better things will get. We just have to then, you know, do the hard part.

My physical therapy treatments continued to improve things. The one-foot-up exercise reliably popped my hip and stopped the plucking feeling inside, but I would still feel twinges of pain standing from sitting. In an act of exercise desperation, I signed up for a shift working construction for Habitat for Humanity.

I got a ride from the meeting spot to the construction site with a young man in his twenties who planned to become a doctor, and who told me he eats the same food for lunch and dinner every day (beef and sweet potatoes) because it is the perfect meal, and also he has one-fifth the tastebuds of a normal person. (When he later opened his lunch: beef and sweet potatoes.) Our group of 10-ish people set about painting and nailing trim to a shed in the backyard. The sun was mirror-bright and hot, and I splattered paint all over my clothes, shoes, and hat. Sweat soaked my hair. The foreman let us take turns practicing with the palm nailer and the miter saw. We worked for five hours.

Later that day, as I sat on a curb waiting for my husband to pick me up, I noticed that, despite the fact that I was sitting down on a hard surface, my backside was not hurting for the first time in months. Was it the exercise, the bending up and down to sweep the paint roller? The heat? The biopsychosociality of working together on a project with a bunch of other people I didn't know? The mindfulness of having my brain fully occupied only by thoughts of construction? The specious dietary modeling from the aspiring doctor? Maybe all. Maybe some. Maybe none. Maybe something else entirely.

After that, I started volunteering to garden in a nearby park. Eventually, the pain became duller and more occasional, better than it's ever been. I had developed a tendency to sit stiffly to prevent the worst of the pain that I didn't have anymore, a new set of reflexes that I now had to unlearn. I cannot be sure now if the pain will ever fully go away, if doctors and researchers will manage, will bother, even, to fully chart the constellations of pelvic problems the human body is capable of in my lifetime. This makes me desperately angry if I think too much about it. The uneasy and uncertain journey of pursuing a solution that may never come spools out before me. But perhaps the true task is learning instead—metaphorically, if nothing else—to sit down where I am.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","With the Rise of AI, Cisco Sounds an Urgent Alarm About the Risks of Aging Tech","https://www.wired.com/story/cisco-aging-technical-infrastructure/","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Aging digital infrastructure equipment like routers, network switches, and network-attached storage—has long posed a silent risk to organizations. In the short term, it's cheaper and easier to just leave those boxes running in a forgotten closet. But this infrastructure may have old, insecure configurations, and legacy tech is often no longer supported by vendors for software patches and other protections. As generative AI platforms make it easier for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities in targets' systems, the network tech company Cisco is launching an effort to raise awareness about the issue and promote improvements—both for ancient Cisco devices and products from other companies that are still in use.

Dubbed “Resilient Infrastructure,” the initiative includes research and industry outreach as well as technical shifts in how Cisco manages its own legacy products. The company says that it is launching new warnings for its products that are approaching end of life, so if customers are running known insecure configurations or attempt to add them, they will receive a clear and explicit prompt when they update a device. Eventually, Cisco will go a step further to completely remove historic settings and interoperability options that are no longer considered safe.

“Infrastructure globally is aging, and that creates a ton of risk,” says Anthony Grieco, Cisco's chief security and trust officer. “The thing we've got to get across is this aging infrastructure wasn't designed for today's threat environments. And by not updating it, it's fostering opportunities for adversaries.”

Research conducted for Cisco by the British advisory firm WPI Strategy looked at the prevalence and impact of end-of-life technology in the “critical national infrastructure” of five countries: the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. The study found that the UK (followed closely by the US) faces the biggest relative risk of the group from widespread use of outmoded, legacy technology in key sectors. Japan had the lowest relative risk—thanks, the report says, to more emphasis on consistent upgrades, decentralization in critical infrastructure, and “a stronger, more consistent national focus on digital resilience.”

In general, the research also emphasizes that breaches and other cybersecurity incidents around the world regularly involve attackers exploiting known vulnerabilities that could be avoided through patching or upgrading end-of-life technology.

“The status quo is not free—there is actually a cost, it's just not being accounted for,” says Eric Wenger, Cisco's senior director for technology policy. “If we can help elevate this risk to something that is treated as a board-level concern, then hopefully that will help to underscore the importance of making an investment here.” As an industry, he adds, “we're not making it hard enough for the attackers.”

Founded in 1984, Cisco has been a titan of network computing for decades, and its devices are deeply embedded in digital infrastructure around the world. To the extent that it may feel self-serving, then, for such a company to champion renewed spending on network equipment, Wenger points out that whether customers will choose to buy Cisco equipment again is a different question from whether they should upgrade at all.

“Look, we don't make money on the stuff that we sold two decades ago. When we convince somebody that they need to move off of the old technology—what we're selling now is innovative, it's cost effective, but we're not going to win everyone over,” he says. “But we need to start the conversation either way.""

Cisco's Grieco points out, too, that he and his colleagues have been attempting to highlight the risks posed by end-of-life technology for years. In an August 2016 Cisco blog post, for example, he wrote, “Systems that were designed, built and deployed in decades past didn't anticipate the hostile security environment of today. Until now, very few have thought about securing infrastructure because they didn't think adversaries would target these systems and devices, or they had ‘higher priorities' to fix. This must change.”

While generative AI platforms still can't devise and execute layered digital attacks on their own, evidence is mounting that AI tools are already making it quicker and easier for attackers to launch social engineering attacks, identify and exploit vulnerabilities, and refine malware. For attackers with little technical expertise, this can give them a crucial leg up, and for teams of highly skilled, well-resourced hackers, AI tools are helping to streamline some of the most labor-intensive aspects of attacks.

“It's time to give people a jolt about the silent risk of aging infrastructure,” Grieco says. ""We're going to make it loud.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Trump Takes Aim at State AI Laws in Draft Executive Order","https://www.wired.com/story/trump-prepares-executive-order-challenging-state-ai-laws/","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 01:50:00 GMT","

US President Donald Trump is considering signing an executive order that would seek to challenge state efforts to regulate artificial intelligence through lawsuits and the withholding of federal funding, WIRED has learned.

A draft of the order viewed by WIRED directs US attorney general Pam Bondi to create an “AI Litigation Task Force,” whose purpose is to sue states in court for passing AI regulations that allegedly violate federal laws governing things like free speech and interstate commerce.

Trump could sign the order, which is currently titled “Eliminating State Law Obstruction of National AI Policy,” as early as this week, according to four sources familiar with the matter. A White House spokesperson told WIRED that “discussion about potential executive orders is speculation.”

The order says that the AI Litigation Task Force will work with several White House technology advisors, including the special adviser for AI and crypto, David Sacks, to determine which states are violating federal laws detailed in the order. It points to state regulations that “require AI models to alter their truthful outputs” or compel AI developers to “report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution,” according to the draft.

The order specifically cites recently enacted AI safety laws in California and Colorado that require AI developers to publish transparency reports about how they train models, among other provisions. Big Tech trade groups, including Chamber of Progress—which is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Google, and OpenAI—have vigorously lobbied against these efforts, which they describe as a “patchwork” approach to AI regulation that hampers innovation. These groups are lobbying instead for a light-touch set of federal laws to guide AI progress.

“If the president wants to win the AI race, the American people need to know that AI is safe and trustworthy,"" says Cody Venzke, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. “This draft only undermines that trust.”

The order comes as Silicon Valley has been upping the pressure on proponents of state AI regulations. For example, a super PAC funded by Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman, and Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale recently announced a campaign against New York Assembly member Alex Bores, the author of a state AI safety bill.

House Republicans have also renewed their effort to pass a blanket moratorium on states introducing laws regulating AI after an earlier version of the measure failed.

The draft order gives the White House authority to challenge state AI laws that violate the Commerce Clause, a provision of the Constitution that gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states. Andreessen Horowitz's head of AI policy and chief legal and policy officer published a letter in September arguing that several state AI laws raise concerns under the Commerce Clause.

The order also instructs the Department of Commerce to craft guidelines that could make states ineligible for funding intended to expand access to high-speed internet. The Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program, which is run out of the Commerce Department, is valued at more than $42 billion. In addition, the order calls on White House senior AI advisers to draft legislation establishing a federal regulatory framework to govern AI.

“Both the law and the Constitution prevent the President from unilaterally attaching strings to federal funds, especially when the stakes are this high,” says Venzke.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump posted a statement on Truth Social deriding the “overregulation” of AI and accusing some states of embedding “DEI ideology into AI models, producing ‘Woke AI.'” The draft order seems to tackle these allegations, calling on the Federal Trade Commission to declare that states cannot pass laws that manipulate AI outputs.

“To win, American AI companies must be free to innovate without cumbersome regulation. But State legislatures have introduced over 1,000 AI bills that threaten to undermine that innovative culture,” the draft order reads. “My Administration will act to ensure that there is a minimally burdensome national standard – not 50 discordant State ones.”

The Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) released a new generation of its flagship large language models, designed to compete more squarely with industry and academic heavyweights.

The Seattle-based nonprofit unveiled Olmo 3, a collection of open language models that it says outperforms fully open models such as Stanford's Marin and commercial open-weight models like Meta's Llama 3.1.

Earlier versions of Olmo were framed mainly as scientific tools for understanding how AI models are built. With Olmo 3, Ai2 is expanding its focus, positioning the models as powerful, efficient, and transparent systems suitable for real-world use, including commercial applications.

“Olmo 3 proves that openness and performance can advance together,” said Ali Farhadi, the Ai2 CEO, in a press release Thursday morning announcing the new models.

It's part of a broader evolution in the AI world. Over the past year, increasingly powerful open models from companies and universities — including Meta, DeepSeek, Qwen, and Stanford — have started to rival the performance of proprietary systems from big tech companies.

Many of the latest open models are designed to show their reasoning step-by-step — commonly called “thinking” models — which has become a key benchmark in the field.

Ai2 is releasing Olmo 3 in multiple versions: Olmo 3 Base (the core foundation model); Olmo 3 Instruct (tuned to follow user directions); Olmo 3 Think (designed to show more explicit reasoning); and Olmo 3 RL Zero (an experimental model trained with reinforcement learning).

Open models have been gaining traction with startups and businesses that want more control over costs and data, along with clearer visibility into how the technology works. 

Ai2 is going further by releasing the full “model flow” behind Olmo 3 — a set of snapshots showing how the model progressed through each stage of training. In addition, an updated OlmoTrace tool will let researchers link a model's reasoning steps back to the specific data and training decisions that influenced them.

In terms of energy and cost efficiency, Ai2 says the new Olmo base model is 2.5 times more efficient to train than Meta's Llama 3.1 (based on GPU-hours per token, comparing Olmo 3 Base to Meta's 8B post-trained model). Much of this gain comes from training Olmo 3 on far fewer tokens than comparable systems, in some cases six times fewer than rival models.

Among other improvements, Ai2 says Olmo 3 can read or analyze much longer documents at once, with support for inputs up to 65,000 tokens, about the length of a short book chapter.

Founded in 2014 by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Ai2 has long operated as a research-focused nonprofit, developing open-source tools and models while bigger commercial labs dominated the spotlight. The institute has made a series of moves this year to elevate its profile while preserving its mission of developing AI to solve the world's biggest problems.

In August, Ai2 was selected by the National Science Foundation and Nvidia for a landmark $152 million initiative to build fully open multimodal AI models for scientific research, positioning the institute to serve as a key contributor to the nation's AI backbone. 

It also serves as the key technical partner for the Cancer AI Alliance, helping Fred Hutch and other top U.S. cancer centers train AI models on clinical data without exposing patient records.

Olmo 3 is available now on Hugging Face and Ai2's model playground.

Reports emerged Wednesday that the White House is preparing an executive order directing federal agencies to challenge or block state-level AI regulations. 

Seattle entrepreneur Joe Braidwood sees the news as a major opportunity. 

Braidwood is CEO and co-founder of Glacis, a new startup backed by the AI2 Incubator that is building software to help companies prove that their AI safety measures are executed as intended. Glacis creates tamper-proof “receipts” for every AI decision, allowing companies to prove their safety systems actually ran.

“Think of it as a flight recorder for enterprise AI,” Braidwood said.

Braidwood said the potential White House order to block state AI laws transforms Glacis from a startup just getting off the ground into “infrastructure necessity.” In an environment where the Justice Department would sue states that pass AI rules, a neutral, platform-agnostic trust layer could become increasingly relevant.

Glacis' origins are rooted in regulatory complexity.

Braidwood, a longtime tech marketing leader, recently shuttered Yara, his year-old startup that aimed to use AI to improve mental wellness. He cited Illinois regulations that made AI therapy “effectively uninsurable.”

In a LinkedIn post that has since gone viral, Braidwood explained the decision to close Yara and open-source a set of safety prompts he had developed.

He wrote that Yara closed after he realized AI became “dangerous” when interacting with people facing deep trauma or suicidal ideation — not just inadequate. The experience, he said, showed “where the boundaries need to be,” and demonstrated how startups working in high-risk AI categories face unmanageable liability and regulatory pressure.

After the post, regulators, clinicians, engineers, founders and insurance executives reached out — many pointing the same problem: when AI systems make decisions, no one can independently verify whether safety policies actually fired.

That clarity became the seed for Glacis.

Every time an AI model answers a question or takes an action, Glacis creates a signed record showing the input, the safety checks that ran, and the final decision. The record can't be altered and takes less than 50 milliseconds to generate. Regulators and insurers can verify these receipts without seeing any personal data, and Braidwood said insurers believe this could finally make it possible to insure AI systems that can prove they followed the rules.

Braidwood co-founded Glacis with Dr. Jennifer Shannon, a psychiatrist and adjunct professor at the University of Washington. 

The company is currently in private beta with digital health customers, including nVoq, and is targeting healthcare, fintech, and insurance sectors. It's also part of Cloudflare's Launchpad program.

Braidwood was previously chief strategy officer of Vektor Medical. He also co-founded social TV platform Scener and was chief marketing officer at SwiftKey.

Shannon has been a psychiatrist for nearly two decades. She was also a medical director at Cognoa and serves on the AI Resource Committee for the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

Cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks announced Wednesday it will acquire Chronosphere in a deal valued at $3.35 billion.

Founded in 2019, Chronosphere sells observability software that helps engineering teams spot problems quickly and keep cloud applications running. Palo Alto Networks said the acquisition will help it meet the massive data demands created by modern AI workloads.

Chronosphere CEO Martin Mao and CTO Rob Skillington first met in the Seattle area at Microsoft, where they worked on migrating Office to the cloud-based Office 365 format. They both later joined Uber's engineering teams. 

The company describes itself as a “distributed team” with major hubs in New York City, Seattle, and Vilnius. Mao is based in the Seattle region, along with several Chronosphere employees. The team, including Mao and Skillington, will join Palo Alto once the acquisition closes. Chronosphere has more than 250 employees.

On the company's earnings call with analysts Wednesday, Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora described Chronosphere as “one of the fastest-growing software companies in history.” It counts two of the “premier LLMs” as customers.

Arora said existing observability tools were not built for the AI era and that full observability has become cost prohibitive for many organizations. Chronosphere, he said, can deliver observability at one-third the cost of other leading solutions. 

He added that Chronosphere has “changed the observability model” with its combination of open source and architectural techniques.

When Palo Alto evaluated observability and data-pipeline vendors, Arora said the team was struck by Chronosphere's engineering chops. “Generally, engineers have too much pride to tell you that somebody else is good,” he said. “But our team came back and said, ‘these guys are the best engineers we've run into.'”

Chronosphere reports more than $160 million in annual recurring revenue, growing at triple-digit rates, according to Palo Alto. 

Chronosphere will remain “largely standalone” after the deal closes next year. “They are basically a bunch of really smart engineers and forward-deployed engineers, as well as a few salespeople,” Arora said. “So, we're going to give them some support by introducing the right customers in very targeted fashion.”

The company's investors include General Atlantic; Greylock Partners; Lux Capital; Addition; Founders Fund; Spark Capital; and Glynn Capital.

“When Rob Skillington and I started Chronosphere six years ago, we set out to build a next-generation observability platform capable of handling the most complex cloud native workloads,” Mao wrote on LinkedIn. “Today, we are the observability leader trusted by the world's top AI and digital-native innovators.”

Earlier this year Palo Alto Networks also acquired Protect AI, a Seattle startup that helps companies monitor machine learning systems.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused content monetization startup Curastory of overstating revenue to investors and misrepresenting true client numbers, according to paperwork seen by TechCrunch.  

As a result of a settlement with the SEC, Curastory's founder and CEO, Tiffany Kelly, has resigned from the role and replaced herself with Dave Dickman, former CEO of the influencer marketing platform Tagger. 

Under Dickman's leadership, the company has begun fundraising, international expansion plans, and product updates, Kelly and Dickman tell TechCrunch. 

The settlement agreement specifically barred Kelly for 10 years from serving on the board of directors or as an executive at any company that would, essentially, fundraise. TechCrunch saw a version of this agreement that had not yet been finalized. It stated that Kelly agreed to these stipulations without admitting to or denying the allegations.  

Although Kelly remains a major shareholder and will remain an adviser, she told TechCrunch that “stepping aside was truly the only decision that I could make just to keep the company alive and thriving,” she said. 

Kelly founded the company in 2021. Curastory is a platform that helps content creators monetize their videos and has grown to about 400,000 creators using it, she said. It lets advertisers buy in-video ads from creators, while tracking metrics and supporting other features, like video editing.  

It has raised around $3 million to date from investors, including Lightspeed's Scout Fund, Feld Ventures, and Mindspring Capital, according to PitchBook, which also listed it as having participated in a few accelerator programs like Techstars and the SPARK Program, held by AMEX Ventures and Project W, according to PitchBook. 

“It's been a wild ride,” she admitted. As part of the settlement, Kelly also agreed to pay a fine. She told TechCrunch that she did not know what triggered the SEC investigation. She said she received a subpoena in June and in January was issued the violations notice from the SEC.  

She hopes for time and grace. “It's interesting having and being forced to step down,” she said. She still has majority ownership in the company but said she's happy that fundraising and finances are off her plate.  

She said she's also happy she was able to pick her successor, finding Dickman through an executive recruiter. Many other ousted founders are not able to do so. She asked the recruiter to find someone who was a good person, who wouldn't strip and sell the company for quick cash, and who would understand the technology.  

“Early-stage companies have all kinds of challenges across the board. In the end, it happened. It's been resolved,” Dickman told TechCrunch. He compared him and Kelly to yin and yang, as he spent decades in the creator space and has worked at a few early-stage startups. She is analytical, he said, and very product-focused, while he likes having more of a leadership role.  

“I feel like we're a good combo and complementary to drive this forward,” he said.  

Kelly, meanwhile, is already seeing some changes, as Dickman has been CEO for a few weeks already. She said his fundraising deck made it to the desk of a VC fund, and they forwarded it to someone else, nudging them to take a look at the product.  

“I have not had that experience with fundraising, as you could probably imagine,” she said, referring to the experience that women, especially Black women, often face when raising venture money. “So that has been eye-opening.”  

Under Dickman, she hopes for a bright future for the company. Curastory already has plans to expand into Canada, Australia, and the U.K. soon.   The company is working on new features to target creators on other platforms like Spotify video and to add AI to the product to make their advertising technology a bit more agentic, she said. Its current video enablement tools include YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook Watch. 

It also plans to add a more enhanced attribution model for advertisers that would eliminate the need for influencer promo codes.  

“Those are the immediate, near-term product, sales, globalization things,” Kelly said.  

Despite this shocking end to her run as the CEO of her company, she told TechCrunch, “Being a founder and CEO is one of the most humbling and rewarding experiences I think anyone can have.” She hopes to share her lessons learned and experiences with others, “especially women and people of color.”

Another fire has broken out at the Novelis aluminum plant in Oswego, New York that supplies sheet metal for Ford's trucks, including its all-electric F-150 Lightning.

The four-alarm fire started Thursday morning but is still burning. “Everyone who was working at the plant was safely evacuated,” Novelis told TechCrunch. “The fire is under control but crews are on site to make sure it's fully extinguished.” Local news outlet CNY Central was the first to report the new blaze.

The Novelis plant suffered a major fire in September that stopped operations, and Ford has said the disruption would likely cost the automaker around $2 billion. Despite a second, smaller fire in October, the aluminum supplier had planned to restart production at the New York facility in December. (Stellantis and Nissan have also taken smaller hits to production as a result of the September fire.)

Ford had to scale back production of essentially all of its F-150 trucks following the September fire, as they have used aluminum body panels for years now. The automaker slowly started building those trucks again in October. But it was prioritizing the gas and hybrid versions over the F-150 Lightning, which executives are reportedly discussing discontinuing.

It's not clear what impact the new fire will have on Ford's plans. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Oswego Fire Department also did not immediately return requests for comment.

This story has been updated with new information from Novelis.

Spotify is making it easier for users to make the switch from other streaming services. On Thursday, the company announced an integration with TuneMyMusic, a tool that can transfer playlists from other streaming services into users' Spotify libraries.

The new feature, which is rolling out now to all Spotify users, will be found in the “Your Library” section of the Spotify mobile app. To use TuneMyMusic, you'll scroll to the bottom of the page, then tap on the new option to “Import your music” and follow the prompts to connect with the service.

You can then choose the platform you'd like to transfer playlists from, and they'll appear in your Spotify library. 

To be clear, this process doesn't delete the original playlists — it only copies them over to Spotify. At launch, TuneMyMusic supports transferring playlists from services like Amazon Music, Apple Music, Deezer, Pandora, SoundCloud, Tidal, YouTube Music, and others.

The addition of the new feature ramps up the competition in the streaming wars, while also serving as a win for data portability. 

One of Spotify's top competitors, Apple Music, already offers a way for iPhone and iPad users to transfer their saved music and playlists from other services to their Apple Music library via a feature that's built directly into the iOS and iPadOS Settings app. That option is also available within the Android version of the Apple Music app.

YouTube Music Premium users can import their playlists from other services, including Spotify, as well.

For customers thinking of switching to Spotify, having the transfer feature built into Spotify could push them to make the jump. It's a nice perk, too, since the online version of TuneMyMusic only offers to transfer 500 tracks for free. For unlimited transfers, users would have to upgrade to a paid plan. 

Spotify isn't sharing the terms of its deal with TuneMyMusic, but it's likely a win for both companies, as it could bring more customers to Spotify while TuneMyMusic snags a large client.

Google is upgrading its image-generation model with new editing chops, higher resolutions, more accurate text rendering, and the ability to search the web.

Dubbed Nano Banana Pro, the new model is built on Google's latest large language model, Gemini 3, released earlier this week. The company claims Nano Banana Pro improves on its predecessor, Nano Banana, with the ability to create more detailed images and accurate text, and generate text in different styles, fonts, and languages.

The model also has web-searching capabilities, so you can do things like ask it to look up a recipe and generate flash cards.

Google says Nano Banana Pro is geared toward giving professionals more control over images, and lets users control aspects like camera angles, scene lighting, depth of field, focus, and color grading. And compared to Nano Banana's resolution cap of 1024 x 1024px, users can generate 2K or 4K images with Nano Banana Pro.

The company noted that while Nano Banana Pro can generate images at a higher quality, it is slower and costlier than the original model, which cost $0.039 per 1024px image. Comparatively, the new model costs $0.139 for each 1080p or 2K image, and $0.24 for every 4K image.

The new model can use six high-fidelity shots or blend up to 14 objects within an image. It can also maintain consistency and resemblance of up to five people. The company has released a demo app where you can try some of these capabilities.

Nano Banana Pro is being rolled out across many of Google's existing AI tools. The Gemini app will now use the new model to generate images by default, though users on the free subscription tier will be able to use the model to generate a limited number of images, after which they will be defaulted to the original Nano Banana model. 

Google AI Plus, Pro, and Ultra subscribers will get higher-generation thresholds, though the company did not disclose the exact limits. These subscribers will also get access to the model within NotebookLM.

Google is also making the model available in search through AI mode for AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the U.S. Ultra subscribers can access the model in the company's video tool, Flow, and it is available to Workspace customers in Google Slides and Vids, too.

Developers can tap Nano Banana Pro through the Gemini API, Google AI Studio, and the company's new IDE, Antigravity.

The company is also baking SynthID, its tech to watermark and detect AI-generated images, into the Gemini app. Users can upload an image, and the chatbot will tell them if the image has been created or modified by the company's image models.

Google said that over time, it will include support for C2PA content credential detection for content verification. 

The story has been updated to reflect Google's approach to support C2PA.

When it comes to recycling, few materials can match aluminum. It can be reused an infinite number of times, and it's often cheaper to recycle than to produce new aluminum because it requires so much less energy. Yet only about a third of the aluminum used in the U.S. gets recycled.

The problem lies in sorting mixed aluminum scrap — a challenge that has long stumped the recycling industry.

Michael Siemer, CEO of Sortera, thinks his company has found the key, though. Sortera says it has developed a system that can separate aluminum grades with over 95% accuracy — a breakthrough that could unlock a massive untapped resource in the recycling industry.

Here's how it works: The company uses an AI model that identifies different grades of aluminum based on data from lasers, X-ray fluorescence, and high-speed cameras. The system has to classify each chip — about the size of a large potato chip — in a fraction of a second. “Ten milliseconds is a long time,” Siemer says. Once the vision system identifies the grade, a series of nozzles blow precise puffs of air to flip the chip off the belt and into the correct bin.

That speed and accuracy matters because other recycling operations must melt the aluminum first before they can tell which type of alloy it is. And if alloys aren't sorted properly, the mixed heap is worth far less because customers can't be confident it will have the properties they need.

“People have been wanting to go after [this unsorted aluminum], and nobody's been able to unlock it,” says Siemer.

Sortera's sorting accuracy has further helped the company unlock something else many startups seek: profitability. “The margin is exponential above 90%, [while] 92% gets you a nice little margin, 95% gets you a big margin, [and] 98% is a really big margin.”

That's helped the company become cash flow positive since August, he says, all based on the operation of a single plant in Indiana. To build a second plant in Tennessee, Sortera recently raised $20 million in equity and $25 million in debt in a round led by VXI Capital and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price, with participation from Overlay Capital and Yamaha Motor Ventures, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Trinity Capital is providing additional equipment funding.

The new plant, which is being built near Nashville, will come online in April or May. “It's a replica of our Indiana plant,” Siemer says. At the Indiana facility, he says, “we run full-tilt, 24-7, and we're running millions of pounds a month.”

So where does all that aluminum come from? The scrap aluminum that Sortera receives tends to come from shredded automobiles. Each aluminum grade fractures differently when shredded, and those visual differences help the AI classify the metal. “The chemical differences manifest themselves in the shredding,” Siemer says. Different alloys produce distinctive tears and folds that give the system clues. “You gain these little insights so that in about a 10-millisecond time window, you go, ‘I'm pretty darn sure that's 356 [grade aluminum],” Siemer says.

As Sortera expands, much of its aluminum will likely end up back on automotive assembly lines. Automotive manufacturers have been using increasing amounts of the metal to reduce vehicle weight and improve fuel efficiency. “Every auto OEM on the planet has been to Indiana at least twice,” Siemer says.

Sortera is currently working on ways to process other metals like copper and titanium, but for the near future, the company remains focused on aluminum. “We could instantly sort the 18 billion tons of aluminum made annually in the U.S. Every piece of that, every pound would be sold at a profit in the U.S.”

Waymo has three new cities in its sights as it continues to expand around the United States: Minneapolis, New Orleans, and Tampa.

The company said on Thursday that it will start manually driving its vehicles in those cities “in the coming days,” ahead of testing and validating its driverless tech, before eventually launching a commercial robotaxi service in each.

These cities join a growing list of locations where Waymo has launched or plans to launch its robotaxis. The Alphabet-owned company is already offering rides on surface streets and highways in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix, and is live in Austin and Atlanta as well.

In 2026, Waymo plans to expand to Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. It's also testing in New York City, and plans to offer commercial rides internationally starting with London and Tokyo.

The new cities announced Thursday could present some unique challenges for Waymo, though. Minneapolis has perhaps the harshest winters of the cities Waymo has chosen to date. Snow could challenge Waymo's perception stack, and the lack of traction will give its automated driving system some extra work to do. New Orleans, meanwhile, has a lot of tight, one-way streets that are heavily used by pedestrians — especially in the French Quarter.

As Waymo has expanded, it's been working with partners in a number of cities to help operate its fleets. Its vehicles are on Uber's app in Austin and Atlanta, African mobility and fintech company Moove took over operations in Phoenix (and will do the same in Miami), and Avis Budget Group will manage the fleet in Dallas. It's not immediately clear if Waymo will lean on similar partnerships in the new cities.

Waymo's so far outpacing other players when it comes to expanding to new cities. Amazon-owned Zoox is offering free rides in its custom-built robotaxi in Las Vegas, and letting members of its early-rider program take trips in San Francisco while it awaits a necessary exemption from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to launch full commercial operations. 

Tesla, meanwhile, is trying to expand its nascent robotaxi service, which still has safety monitors in the driver's seat. This week, the company received a permit to start offering rides in Arizona, in addition to Austin and San Francisco.

> Rust shouted about safety. Zig just built it — without the ceremony, the sermons, or the 15-minute compile times.Which I interpret as meaning that zig delivers memory safety in a simpler way than rust.

It has a very weird feeling complaining about build.rs when any semi-serious Zig project comes with a build.zig that's always more complex than any build.rs.

reply

But to address the serious question: We can't have all three of: a simple language, zero-cost abstractions, and memory safety.Most interpreted language pick simplicity and memory safety, at a runtime cost. Rust picks zero-cost abstractions and memory safety, at an increasingly high language complexity cost. C and Zig choose zero-cost abstractions in a simple language, but as a consequence, there's no language-enforced memory safety.(Also, having a simple language doesn't mean that any particular piece of code is short. Often, quite the opposite.)

    pub fn main() !void {
        std.debug.print(""Hello, World!\n"", .{});
    }

The only difference is this writes to stderr and does not fail (and explicitly says it is meant for debug), while their example writes to stdout. In zig if you want to write to stdout you need to explicitly pick the std and handle all the details (like error handling).He gave the possible worst example, this article is nonsense.

This makes it sound like Zig built Rust equivalent safety but its manual memory model suggests otherwise?

reply

Exactly. That's what Rust defends us from. It makes breaking things way harder. Rust forces you to think differently, you cannot just do what you want, but that's it's selling point. The article focuses mainly on feelings not facts and that's ok, but I don't feel exhausted writing Rust. I like that it's safe and I'm happy to sacrifice some freedom if I get safety in return.That's a weird article. Rust wanted to be safe systems language and it is. Where's the issue? Zig has different goals. That's ok. What are actually discussing here?

As in: we're using a safe language, it's not our fault.

reply

In addition, there's almost always something more going on than using a particular tool and you're generally still going to be responsible for that other stuff anyways. For example, if you're working on something critical and high-integrity you're responsible for the end product functioning as intended no matter how exactly you go about doing that. Using something like SPARK might be a smart way to go about that, but you still need to have processes before using SPARK (e.g., verifying the specifications you're going to implement are what you intend) and processes after using SPARK (e.g., verifying what you implemented is actually what you intended, that the product is indeed working as expected, etc.). If a bug in SPARK results in something unintended happening, you may not be responsible for the faulty proof itself but that's only one failure out of multiple in the entire pipeline - for example, you can't pin a failure to catch the error in testing on SPARK.

Not all examples they gave were like this.  The example they gave of the word ""Typography"" would have fooled me as human-made.  The infographics stood out though.  I would have immediately noticed that the String of Turtles infographic was AI generated because of the stylistic choices.  Same for the guide on how to make chai.  I would be ""suspicious"" of the example they gave of the weather forecast but wouldn't immediately flag at as AI generated.Similar note, earlier I was able to tell if something was AI generated right off the bat by noticing that it had a ""Deviant Art"" quality to it.  My immediate guess is that certain sources of training data are over-represented.

Nano Banana Pro should work with my gemimg package (https://github.com/minimaxir/gemimg) without pushing a new version by passing:    g = GemImg(model=""gemini-3-pro-image-preview"")

I'll add the new output resolutions and other features ASAP. However, looking at the pricing (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing#standard_1), I'm definitely not changing the default model to Pro as $0.13 per 1k/2k output will make it a tougher sell.EDIT: Something interesting in the docs: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation#think...> The model generates up to two interim images to test composition and logic. The last image within Thinking is also the final rendered image.Maybe that's partially why the cost is higher: it's hard to tell if intermediate images are billed in addition to the output. However, this could cause an issue with the base gemimg and have it return an intermediate image instead of the final image depending on how the output is constructed, so will need to double-check.

My experience is that ChatGPT is very good at iterating on text (prose, code) but fairly bad at iterating on images. It struggles to integrate small changes, choosing instead to start over from scratch, with wildly different results.

I've used Claude to generate fairly simple icons and launch images for an iOS game and I make sure to have it start with SVG files since those can be defined as code first. This way it's easier to iterate on specific elements of the image (certain shapes need to be moved to a different position, color needs to be changed, text needs an update, etc.).FWIW not sure how Nano Banana Pro works though.

Whenever these discussions happen, I feel like they descend into a general viewpoint, ""if we could technically solve any possible crime, we should do everything in our power to solve it.""I'm against this viewpoint, and acknowledge that that means _some crime_ occurs. That's acceptable to me. I don't feel that society is correctly structured to ""treat"" crime appropriately, and technology has outpaced our ability to holistically address it.Generally, I don't see (speaking for the US) the highest incarceration rate in the world to be a good thing, or being generally effective, and I don't believe that increasing that number will change outcomes.

I bet it will be called ""Real Photos"" or something like that, and the pictures will be signed by the camera hardware. Then iMessage will put a special border around it or something, so that when people share the photos with other Apple users they can prove that it was a real photo taken with their phone's camera.

reply

How ""real"" are iPhone photos? They're also computationally generated, not just the light that came through the lens.Even without any other post-processing, iPhones generate gibberish text when attempting to sharpen blurry images, they delete actual textures and replace them with smooth, smeared surfaces that look like a watercolor or oil paintings, and combine data from multiple frames to give dogs five legs.

There used to be a joke about people who did slideshows (on an actual slide projector) of their vacation photos at parties.

You're right that there will existed generated content without these watermarks, but you can bet that all the commercial providers burning $$$$ on state of the art models will gradually coalesce around some means of widespread by-default/non-optional watermarking for content they let the public generate so that they can all avoid drowning in their own filth.

For example, it's trivial to post an advertisement without disclosure. Yet it's illegal, so large players mostly comply and harm is less likely on the whole.

It still won't prevent it, but it would prevent large players from doing it.

Plus, any service good at reverse-image search (like Google) can basically apply that to determine whether they generated it.There will always be a way to defeat anything, but I don't see why this won't work for like 90% of cases.

No, but model training technology is out in the open, so it will continue to be possible to train models and build model toolchains that just don't incorporate watermarking at all, which is what any motivated actor seeking to mislead will do; the only thing watermarking will do is train people to accept its absence as a sign of reliability, increasing the effectiveness of fakes by motivated bad actors.

It may be easier if you have an oracle on your end to say ""yes, this image has/does not have the watermark,"" which could be the case for some proposed implementations of an AI watermark.  (Often the use-case for digital watermarks assumes that the watermarker keeps the evaluation tool secret - this lets them find, e.g, people who leak early screenings of movies.)

Always has been so far. You add noise until the signal gets swamped. In order to remain imperceptible it's a tiny signal, so it's easy to swamp.

So, you exploit real people, but run your images through a realtime AI video transformation model doing either a close-to-noop transformation or something like changing the background so that it can't be used to identify the actual location if people do figure out you are exploiting real people, and then you have your real exploitation watermarked as AI fakery.I don't think this is solving a problem, unless you mean a problem for the would-be exploiter.

If watermarking becomes a legal mandate, it will inevitably include a prohibition on distributing (and using and maybe even possessing, but the distribution ban is the thing that will have the most impact, since it is the part that is most policable, and most people aren't going to be training their own models, except, of course, the most motivated bad actors) open models that do not include watermarking as a baked-in model feature. So, for most users, it'll be much less accessible (and, at the same time, it won't solve the problem.)

reply

If social media platforms are required by law to categorize content as AI generated, this means they need to check with the public ""AI generation"" providers. And since there is no agreed upon (public) standard for imperceptible watermarks hashing that means the content (image, video, audio) in its entirety needs to be uploaded to the various providers to check if it's AI generated.Yes, it sounds crazy, but that's the plan; imagine every image you post on Facebook/X/Reddit/Whatsapp/whatever gets uploaded to Google / Microsoft / OpenAI / UnnamedGovernmentEntity / etc. to ""check if it's AI"". That's what the current law in Korea and the upcoming laws in California and EU (for August 2026) require :(

Careful with that kind of thing.Here, it mostly poisons your test, because that exact photo probably exists in the underlying training data and the trained network will be more or less optimized on working with it. It's really the same consideration you'd want to make when testing classifiers or other ML techs 10 years ago.Most people taking to a task like this will be using an original photo -- missing entirely from any training date, poorly framed, unevenly lit, etc -- and you need to be careful to capture as much of that as possible when trying to evaluate how a model will work in that kind of use case.The failure and stress points for AI tools are generally kind of alien and unfamiliar because the way they operate is totally different than the way a human operates, and if you're not especially attentive to their weird failure shapes and biases when you want to test them, or you'll easily get false positives (and false negatives) that lead you to misleading conclusions.

I had trouble reliably getting it to...* produce just two lanes of traffic* have all the cars facing the same way—sometimes even within one lane they'd be facing in opposite directions.* contain the construction within the blocked-off area. I think similarly it wouldn't understand which side was supposed to be blocked off. It'd also put the lane closure sign in lanes that were supposed to be open.* have the cars be in proportion to the lane and road instead of two side-by-side within a lane.* have the arrows go in the correct direction instead of veering into the shoulder or U-turning back into oncoming traffic* use each number once, much less on the correct carThis is consistent with my understanding of how LLMs work, but I don't understand how you can ""visualize real-time information like weather or sports"" accurately with these failings.Below is one of the prompts I tried to go from scratch to an image:> You are an illustrator for a drivers' education handbook. You are an expert on US road signage and traffic laws. We need to prepare a diagram of a ""zipper merge"". It should clearly show what drivers are expected to do, without distracting elements.> First, draw two lanes representing a single direction of travel from the bottom to the top of the image (not an entire two-way road), with a dotted white line dividing them. Make sure there's enough space for the several car-lengths approaching a construction site. Include only the illustration; no title or legend.> Add the construction in the right lane only near the top (far side). It should have the correct signage for lane closure and merging to the left as drivers approach a demolished section. The left lane should be clear. The sign should be in the closed lane or right shoulder.> Add cars in the unclosed sections of the road. Each car should be almost as wide as its lane.> Add numbered arrows #1–#5 indicating the next cars to pass to the left of the ""lane closed"" sign. They should be in the direction the cars will move: from the bottom of the illustration to the top. One car should proceed straight in the left lane, then one should merge from the right to the left (indicate this with a curved arrow), another should proceed straight in the left, another should merge, and so on.I did have a bit better luck starting from a simple image and adding an element to it with each prompt. But on the other hand, when I did that it wouldn't do as well at keeping space for things. And sometimes it just didn't make any changes to the image at all. A lot of dead ends.I also tried sketching myself and having it change the illustration style. But it didn't do it completely. It turned some of my boxes into cars but not necessarily all of them. It drew a ""proper"" lane divider over my thin dotted line but still kept the original line. etc.

Make sure there's enough space for the several car-lengths approaching a construction site. Include only the illustration; no title or legend.> Add the construction in the right lane only near the top (far side). It should have the correct signage for lane closure and merging to the left as drivers approach a demolished section. The left lane should be clear. The sign should be in the closed lane or right shoulder.> Add cars in the unclosed sections of the road. Each car should be almost as wide as its lane.> Add numbered arrows #1–#5 indicating the next cars to pass to the left of the ""lane closed"" sign. They should be in the direction the cars will move: from the bottom of the illustration to the top. One car should proceed straight in the left lane, then one should merge from the right to the left (indicate this with a curved arrow), another should proceed straight in the left, another should merge, and so on.I did have a bit better luck starting from a simple image and adding an element to it with each prompt. But on the other hand, when I did that it wouldn't do as well at keeping space for things. And sometimes it just didn't make any changes to the image at all.

The inline verification of images following the prompt is awesome, and you can do some _amazing_ stuff with it.It's probably not as fun anymore though (in the early access program, it doesn't have censoring!)

In the past, I've deliberately stuck a Vision-language model in a REPL with a loop running against generative models to try to have it verify/try again because of this exact issue.EDIT: Just tested it in Gemini - it either didn't use a VLM to actually look at the finished image or the VLM itself failed.Output:  I have finished cross-referencing the image against the user's specific requests. The primary focus was on confirming that the number of points on the star precisely matched the requested nine. I observed a clear visual representation of a gold-colored star with the exact point count that the user specified, confirming a complete and precise match.


Result:  Bog standard star with *TEN POINTS*.

To me the AI revolution is making visual media (and music) catch up with the text-based revolution we've had since the dawn of computing.Computers accelerated typing and text almost immediately, but we've had really crude tools for images, video, and 3D despite graphics and image processing algorithms.AI really pushes the envelope here.I think images/media alone could save AI from ""the bubble"" as these tools enable everyone to make incredible content if you put the work into it.Everyone now has the ingredients of Pixar and a music production studio in their hands. You just need to learn the tools and put the hours in and you can make chart-topping songs and Hollywood grade VFX. The models won't get you there by themselves, but using them in conjunction with other tools and understanding as to what makes good art - that can and will do it.Screw ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and the rest. This is the exciting part of AI.

AI for images, video, music - these tools can already make movies, games, and music today with just a little bit of effort by domain experts. They're 10,000x time and cost savers. The models and tools are continuing to get better on an obvious trend line.

For example, I'm currently vibe coding an app that will be specific to our company, that helps me run all the aspects of our business and integrates with our systems (so it'll integrate with quickbooks for invoicing, etc), and help us track whether we have the right insurance across multiple contracts, will remind me about contract deadlines coming up, etc.It's going to combine the information that's currently in about 10 different slightly out of sync spreadsheets, about 2 dozen google docs/drive files, and multiple external systems (Gusto, Quickbooks, email, etc).Even though I could build all this manually (as a software developer), I'd never take the time to do it, because it takes away from client work. But now I can actually do it because the pace is 100x faster, and in the background while I'm doing client work.

“Generate an image of an african elephant painted in the New England flag, doing a backflip in front of the russian federal assembly.”OpenAI made the biggest step change towards compositionality in image generation when they started directly generating image tokens for decoders from foundation llms, and it worked very well (openais images were better in this regard than nano banana 1, but struggled with some OOD images like elephants doing backflips), but banana 2 nails this stuff in a way I haven't seen anywhere elseif video follows the same trends as images in terms of prompt adherence, that will be very valuable... and interesting

Assuming that this new model works as advertised, it's interesting to me that it took this long to get an image generation model that can reliably generate text. Why is text generation in images so hard?

reply

- It requires an AI that actually understands English, I.e. an LLM. Older, diffusion-only models were naturally terrible at that, because they weren't trained on it.- It requires the AI to make no mistakes on image rendering, and that's a high bar. Mistakes in image generation are so common we have memes about it, and for all that hands generally work fine now, the rest of the picture is full of mistakes you can't tell are mistakes. Entirely impossible with text.Nano Banana Pro seems to somewhat reliably produce entire pictures without any mistakes at all.

Having this knowledge early on made me less afraid of my computer, made it feel less like a magical black box, and gave me the confidence to learn more complex topics on my own.Computers become way more capable when the people using them understand fundamentals like directory structures and command line usage. I don't think either of these things are as difficult to learn as reading, writing, and arithmetic (especially if you already have a base level education in those three things).If more ""everyday people"" just had a little bit more knowledge about these things, they would be able to do way more with their computers with less of a reliance on proprietary solutions that funnel them down whatever path makes someone else the most money.

I know that read/write conflict concerns are what got USB Mass Storage mode removed from Android, but surely there's some way to resolve that.

We did backup our photos in our own private cloud but guess how we had to quick exchange photos while in the wild (no wifi and sometimes no network)? We couldn't. Because Google and Apple did everything so we couldn't.Google wants to your data and fought for the cloud. Apple don't want Android users to easily partake in some data exchange with iOS users (you gotta buy your ticket to their jail). So sad you don't realize how backward that is.

From my limited (non-lawyer) reading of this, they didn't actually offer any evidence. I'm not sure if they had any evidence or not. But it appears that they represented themselves and didn't go through the proper procedures for offering evidence or witnesses. So all they could do was cross-examine.My reading (from just the judgement posted) is that it is a sad thing that it came to a legal dispute at all.

Taken literally it's accusing someone of a specific depraved act, but it's also clearly a term of abuse. My guess (not a lawyer!) is that once a term becomes more associated with abuse the more you're protected.Hustler basically called Jerry Falwell a motherf!cker but attributed to him a specific act, which they highlighted was satire and not to be taken seriously. Hustler lost in a jury trial and also on an appeal to the 4th circuit. The Supreme Court eventually ruled in Hustler's favor [0].

Meanwhile, a pedophile is something that a person capable of bringing a defamation suit could also literally be, and where a reasonable member of the audience for a description of them as such might (given the right other circumstances) view the description as a literal fact claim.

""That diver is a pedophile"" is pretty clearly a factual statement, implying that the person abuses kids, or has been convicted of such. (I know that, uh, the original statement was basically just an insult, but: it does posit a fact.)

reply

The former has objective meaning and can be associated with crimes against minor victims. The latter just means you don't like someone.

Merely adjudicating truthfulness with injunctive relief might be understandable in this day and age of persistent shameless lying. But the hefty monetary damages for what seems to be good faith (though seemingly entirely unsupported and possibly even delusional [0]) speech is a tough pill to swallow.[0] I took a quick scan through Techrights's wiki page ""documenting"" all this and the only thing substantiating the connection I could find was Garrett and the IRC harasser ping-timing-out at the same time. But there are many different ways that could happen. Yet every screenshot is captioned as if it was definitely Garrett saying those things.

> Dr Garrett is chiefly accused of an online campaign of material which is (variously) criminal, illegal or offensive. The criminal matters alleged include cybercrime, hate crime, blackmail, issuing threats of violence or death, and matters adjacent to terrorism. Other illegal matters alleged include defamation, harassment and online abuse. Offensive matters alleged include material that is variously racist, antisemitic, misogynist, homophobic or otherwise hateful or discriminatory, sexually incontinent, or drugs-related. Dr Garrett is alleged to have waged this campaign through the medium of IRC ‘sockpuppet' accounts – accounts under pseudonymous user nicknames intended to be a vehicle for distributing material anonymously and deniably. Many posts from these accounts are reproduced in the articles complained of. Dr Garrett is also repeatedly alleged to be an uncontrolled user of illegal class A drugs, principally crack cocaine.The evidence for the allegations was apparently very thin (¶¶59–60):> First, the defence relies on an incident a few years prior to the sockpuppet campaign, in which Dr Garrett admittedly registered himself online in two borrowed names for the purpose of making a rhetorical or satirical point about the owner of those names. Dr Garrett's evidence is that he did so openly, and with the knowledge of the owner (who had himself vacated the names in order to borrow another user's nickname – which was in part Dr Garrett's point in also doing so). Dr Schestowitz clearly takes exception to that particular piece of theatricality as a major breach of netiquette in its own right, and regards it as a sign or symptom of propensity for sockpuppetry. But the incident in question, on its face, is plainly something quite different from the covert use of sockpuppet accounts to publish illegal or offensive material, and is not in my judgment capable of indicating any sort of propensity to do that.> Second, it is said there was an incident in which Dr Garrett's own named account and one of the sockpuppet accounts experienced simultaneous dropped connections. If established, that could indicate dual operation by a single individual. The evidence from the Claimant is that the dropped connections were not in fact simultaneous. I have no evidential basis for doing otherwise than proceeding on that basis. This pleading cannot in the circumstances support an inference of Dr Garrett's authorship of the sockpuppet posts.¶¶61–75 have further, even weaker evidence.

>This is a dispute between prominent ‘free software movement' activists. The free software movement advances a philosophy and practice which values the freedom of users to create and share software enabling internet access, and challenges the dominance of ‘big tech' software and systems over the online experience. That includes a preference for internet relay chat (‘IRC'), an online instant messaging system dating in origin from the 1990s, over the big social media platforms. The challenge the free software movement makes is not only of a technical, but also of a social, economic or ethical nature, and it espouses some wider sets of values accordingly

In turn, they countersued me for harassment. The case was heard last month and I'm pleased to say that the counterclaim was dismissed and I prevailed in my case. The court awarded me £70,000 in damages.I've never heard of any of these people before, so for now I'm taking that as true at face value, given that he won.

Oh, please. Half the damn signage in Texas hasn't been updated from 75, and if you weren't a Texas resident to read when the State updated the daytime speed limit to 80 in the newspapers, you wouldn't know that signs notwithstanding, 80 is the speed you should be going in the day. If you're just passing through the state, speed limit signs on parts of the interstate that haven't been updated still tell you 75. If anything it was a masterful move by Texas LE to engineer probable cause to do a traffic stop on anyone who wasn't a local, which would tend to select for non-resident traffickers.I say this as someone who was a resident in the state when that change happened and is disgusted every time I go through and see unupdated signs. It is disingenuous, yet effective, profiling of the worst sort that seems to be ignored by most in favor of thinking like quoted poster's.I seem to be of a minority that believe that a State has an obligation to clearly and consistently communicate the actual state of their traffic management regime to drivers from in and out of state via signage. Not play games to manufacture justification to surveil subpopulations that aren't likely to be represented/incapable of voting.

How AI and renewables are shifting the energy landscape.

One of the dominant storylines I've been following through 2025 is electricity—where and how demand is going up, how much it costs, and how this all intersects with that topic everyone is talking about: AI.

Last week, the International Energy Agency released the latest version of the World Energy Outlook, the annual report that takes stock of the current state of global energy and looks toward the future. It contains some interesting insights and a few surprising figures about electricity, grids, and the state of climate change. So let's dig into some numbers, shall we?

Energy demand in general is going up around the world as populations increase and economies grow. But electricity is the star of the show, with demand projected to grow by 40% in the next 10 years.

China has accounted for the bulk of electricity growth for the past 10 years, and that's going to continue. But emerging economies outside China will be a much bigger piece of the pie going forward. And while advanced economies, including the US and Europe, have seen flat demand in the past decade, the rise of AI and data centers will cause demand to climb there as well.

Air-conditioning is a major source of rising demand. Growing economies will give more people access to air-conditioning; income-driven AC growth will add about 330 gigawatts to global peak demand by 2035. Rising temperatures will tack on another 170 GW in that time. Together, that's an increase of over 10% from 2024 levels.  

This year, AI has been the story that none of us can get away from. One number that jumped out at me from this report: In 2025, investment in data centers is expected to top $580 billion. That's more than the $540 billion spent on the global oil supply. 

It's no wonder, then, that the energy demands of AI are in the spotlight. One key takeaway is that these demands are vastly different in different parts of the world.

Data centers still make up less than 10% of the projected increase in total electricity demand between now and 2035. It's not nothing, but it's far outweighed by sectors like industry and appliances, including air conditioners. Even electric vehicles will add more demand to the grid than data centers.

But AI will be the factor for the grid in some parts of the world. In the US, data centers will account for half the growth in total electricity demand between now and 2030.

And as we've covered in this newsletter before, data centers present a unique challenge, because they tend to be clustered together, so the demand tends to be concentrated around specific communities and on specific grids. Half the data center capacity that's in the pipeline is close to large cities.

As we ask more from our grid, the key factor that's going to determine what all this means for climate change is what's supplying the electricity we're using.

As it stands, the world's grids still primarily run on fossil fuels, so every bit of electricity growth comes with planet-warming greenhouse-gas emissions attached. That's slowly changing, though.

Together, solar and wind were the leading source of electricity in the first half of this year, overtaking coal for the first time. Coal use could peak and begin to fall by the end of this decade.

Nuclear could play a role in replacing fossil fuels: After two decades of stagnation, the global nuclear fleet could increase by a third in the next 10 years. Solar is set to continue its meteoric rise, too. Of all the electricity demand growth we're expecting in the next decade, 80% is in places with high-quality solar irradiation—meaning they're good spots for solar power.

Ultimately, there are a lot of ways in which the world is moving in the right direction on energy. But we're far from moving fast enough. Global emissions are, once again, going to hit a record high this year. To limit warming and prevent the worst effects of climate change, we need to remake our energy system, including electricity, and we need to do it faster.

The U.S. and its global partners have sunk trillions of dollars into the AI arms race, with Silicon Valley's prime movers swearing that the technology is destined to transform our world for the better. Now, a new study joins a growing chorus that seek to highlight an inconvenient truth: so far, a vast majority of companies that adopt AI are making no money from it at all.

The new study comes from KPMG, a British accounting and professional services firm. The study, published Wednesday, looked at businesses in Canada, surveying them for evidence that AI was providing anything in the way of a ROI. Sadly, the study found that, no, pretty much nobody who is using AI has managed to find its financial upside yet. Indeed, the survey found that, while more and more businesses are using AI, only about 2 percent of respondents claimed that they had seen a “return on their generative AI investments.”

The survey, which involved 753 business leaders from across the nation, found that the slim amount of respondents who did report positive results from AI were from very large companies that reported at least $1 billion in annual revenue. A lot of companies have yet to fully integrate AI into their workflows, and many of them are still merely experimenting with the technology, the report adds.

AI is seeing the largest rates of adoption in IT and sales and marketing, the study shows. Other areas where it has seen broad adoption include research and development, finance and accounting, and engineering, it says.

Canadian Managing Partner of Digital and Transformation at KPMG Canada Stephanie Terrill laid it out the general outlook like this:

“Only a small sliver of Canadian businesses are generating growth from their AI investments today, and that's understandable – new technologies take time to be adopted and demonstrate identifiable return on investment,” Terrill said. “However, Canada is facing near-term threats to its economic competitiveness and grappling with declining productivity and prosperity, so waiting years for AI investments to create value isn't realistic in this environment – in fact, it's downright risky.”

Despite that fairly negative outlook, Terrill's takeaway isn't what you might think—that AI just isn't very helpful and that companies should ditch it. Instead, she says that Canadian companies should turbocharge their AI investments so as to increase national “competitiveness” and see that elusive ROI that is currently eluding them:

Canadian organizations need to accelerate AI implementation into core operations to start achieving near- to medium-term productivity gains if we hope to become more economically competitive as a country,” she added.

How long do companies have to wait until AI starts doing what it's supposed to do? Many business leaders expect to wait a number of years before AI has its intended effect, the study reports. Despite the fact that it's currently useless, a certain portion of companies (3 in 10) expect to start seeing a return on their AI investment within a year, it adds. A greater portion (6 in 10) said they expect to see that ROI in one to five years. Hope springs eternal, I guess.

After the Hunger Games franchise returned with Suzanne Collins' 2020 prequel book The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, it didn't take much time before Lionsgate decided to bring it to film. That ended up being a hit, so, to no one's surprise, they've decided to also adapt Sunrise on the Reaping, the second prequel that was released earlier this year.

Set decades after Ballad, the new film focuses on a young Haymitch Abernathy, played first by Woody Harrelson in the original movies and here by Joseph Zada. As a candidate in the 50th Hunger Games, Haymitch is fighting against 47 other kids handpicked by the Capital. “Twice the number of tributes, twice the glory,” beams Glenn Close's Drusilla Sickle.

Longtime fans of the books will recognize young versions of series characters like Effie Trinket (Elle Fanning) and President Snow (Jesse Plemons), alongside other young players Haymitch encounters, played by the likes of Mckenna Grace and Ben Wang. It's not going to be a good time for Haymitch and the other kids, but Lionsgate is hoping it'll be a good time for the audience when The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping hits theaters one year from today—November 20, 2026.

A new music streaming service created with the cooperation of all the major record labels will soon debut, with generative AI functionality as its centerpiece, Bloomberg's Lucas Shaw reports. The labels in question are Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group, and Sony Music.

That report says the service is called “Klay,” a fun misspelling of a word for a mushy, formless substance. Incidentally, another word for a mushy, formless substance is “slop.”

About a year ago, Klay struck a deal with Universal to team up on an AI music project touting itself as “ethical,” but reports at the time didn't make it clear what kind of product or service that partnership might produce. 

Someone named Ary Attie is listed on LinkedIn as the founder of Klay. Klay has a website, klay.vision, where users can join a waitlist, and see the slogan “Music set free,” but there's no other information.   

On the same day as Bloomberg's report, news also broke that Warner, one of the companies involved in this deal, had settled a lawsuit with the AI music generation company Udio, and was preparing to join forces with Udio on a song creation platform—presumably a separate venture from Klay, although that's not totally clear yet. (Gizmodo reached out to Warner for clarity, and will update if we hear back). Universal settled a similar suit against Udio on October 30.

Assuming the Bloomberg report is correct, it's clear that these record companies have now fully evolved into a new form in which they see themselves as AI companies too. They never seemed especially hostile to the technology. Even with lawsuits against companies like Udio ongoing, Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement in June of last year, “The music community has embraced AI.” But Glazier and his allies would “only succeed,” he said, “if developers are willing to work together with us. Unlicensed services like Suno and Udio that claim it's ‘fair' to copy an artist's life's work and exploit it for their own profit without consent or pay set back the promise of genuinely innovative AI for us all.” 

This new service apparently resolves all these concerns to the labels' satisfaction, coming with “assurances that the artists and labels will have some control over how their work is used,” Shaw writes.

Details about how Klay would work are scant. Shaw indicates that it will resemble Spotify, but that AI functions will be available so the user can “remake” songs “in different styles.” By partnering with all the major labels, Klay was able to license “thousands” of hit songs for apparently legal training purposes. 

Reading between the lines, it sounds like there will probably be some sort of text input. Perhaps you'll be able to fire up Queen's “Bohemian Rhapsody,” and type “make this a polka.” Presumably after some processing, Klay will spit out something that sounds a little like “Weird Al” Yankovic's brilliant, faithful uptempo reconstruction of “Bohemian Rhapsody” with a new arrangement and a virtuosic polka performance, minus all the joy, spontaneity, and palpable love for the original material that such a feat of artistry entails. 

And since artists typically own their sheet music and their voice likenesses, if not their actual recordings, it stands to reason that they might have some legal say, which explains why there would be controls in place for the artist. For instance, while I'm not a copyright lawyer, it seems like the label probably wouldn't be legally allowed to let the user create, say, a realistic Alicia Keys voice singing one of her actual melodies, but with words about poop and farts. 

And if Klay's audio outputs are up to the standard set by the existing AI music generators, it will probably sound tolerable. A recent survey fairly convincingly showed that people can't really distinguish AI-generated music from human-generated music at all. But 51% of respondents to that survey also said they think AI-generated music will lead to the existence of more generic, low-quality music in the world. 

Gizmodo reached out to Klay for confirmation and details, and will update if we hear back.

A Meta spokesperson confirmed to Bloomberg Wednesday that AI legend Yann LeCun is exiting Zuckland and striking out on his own. According to a Memo from LeCun himself that Bloomberg claims to have read, LeCun's new endeavor is meant to “bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.”

Sources apparently told Bloomberg that LeCun “clashed with others internally.” Meta had recently constructed a fully separate AI research department focused on generative AI, and in its latest story, Bloomberg now claims that Meta had begun to hide LeCun from view in favor of high-profile recent hires. Recent hires have invluded ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao.As previously discussed here at Gizmodo, LeCun is fascinated by an area of AI called “world models.” He has spent more than a year saying he thinks LLM research, the backbone of systems like ChatGPT, is no longer a worthy area of pursuit—at least as far as hypothetical advanced AI functions with terms like “AGI” and “superintelligence” are concerned. LeCun, who was born and raised in France, is among the handful of researchers often referred to as the “godfathers of AI,” or more specifically the godfathers of deep learning, and shared a Turing Award in 2019 with fellow godfathers Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio. The influential cognitive scientist and AI researcher Gary Marcus is a longtime critic of LeCun, and their public disagreements go back years.LeCun joined Meta in 2013, when it was still called Facebook, as the head of what at the time was a research operation with a location in New York that LeCun could walk to from his office at NYU, where he works as a professor. At the time, it wasn't totally clear what a company like Facebook even wanted from a scientist who worked with deep neural networks. Another major AI researcher, Andrew Ng, explained Facebook's hiring decision to Wired in terms that now seem sort of quaint and social media-centric:

“Machine learning is already used in hundreds of places throughout Facebook, ranging from photo tagging to ranking articles to your news feed. Better machine learning will be able to help improve all of these features, as well as help Facebook create new applications that none of us have dreamed of yet.”

After the 2022 release of ChatGPT led to AI's rise to domination of all priorities in the tech world, LeCun became notable for his skepticism about the need for AI safety. He told the Wall Street Journal last year that the idea that AI poses a threat to humanity is “complete B.S.”

But LLMs aren't LeCun's cup of tea anyway. He clarified last month that he had almost no involvement with Meta's Llama models, and that such generative AI-related work happened way off in another department at Meta. LeCun worked, he explained, in Meta's Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) department, and was attempting to go “beyond LLMs.” 

LeCun believes AI models are needed that can comprehensively understand the physical world through sensory inputs like vision, and how to reason its way through interactions with, and changes to, that world. He thinks the current crop of AI systems can't do anything even close to this, and that they are in fact dumber than cats. 

You can already see the start of LeCun's world model research under the aegis of Meta in V-JEPA-2. That model is trained not on text, but on videos of the physical world, and designed not simply to replicate all that video, like Sora, but to model the causes and effects of actions in the world when things move around and interact. That's the theory anyway.

Bloomberg writes that Meta “plans to partner with LeCun on his startup, though details are still being finalized.” In LeCun's memo, he wrote that his former company “will be a partner of the new company and will have access to its innovations.”

It's not at all clear yet how the partnership between LeCun's new company and Meta will be structured, but tech companies are famous for being near inextricable from one another where AI is concerned. Microsoft owns about 27% of OpenAI, and has special rights to use its technology. Google similarly owns 14% of Anthropic. The way interdependent investments in the AI world lead to higher valuations has been compared to “circular dealmaking.“

LeCun's memo says his new technology “will have far-ranging applications in many sectors of the economy, some of which overlap with Meta's commercial interests, but many of which do not.”

LeCun famously favors the term Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI) in place of something like AGI (nota bene: “ami” is French for “friend”). In his memo, he reportedly wrote that “Pursuing the goal of AMI in an independent entity is a way to maximize its broad impact.” It's an appropriately ambiguous turn of phrase. Presumably the “independent entity” is the new, non-Meta company, not an intelligent entity. Though he may mean that too.

The White House and European leaders rarely see eye-to-eye on much, but they are gradually finding common ground on the issue of deregulating AI companies to spur even more unfettered development.

The EU's executive branch, the European Commission, announced on Wednesday that it wants to “simplify” its AI and privacy laws. The move is impacting two major pieces of European tech regulation that have had a global impact: the first-of-its-kind AI Act of 2024 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a comprehensive online privacy law that reshaped the internet when it passed in 2018.

For the GDPR, that's going to look like slashing data privacy laws for the sake of AI. Under the proposed changes, tech companies will have more leeway to use anonymized user data to train their AI models.

“Artificial intelligence is becoming a driving force of our economies, both in the tech sector and beyond, as it provides new solutions across industries. To be able to compete in this new global market, the EU must be able to fuel AI with high-quality data,” the Commission wrote while explaining the new changes.

The bloc's sweeping cookie laws will also get a revamp. That set of regulations was to blame for the global influx of cookie pop-ups, as many companies found it easier to switch their systems completely rather than create a Europe-specific version of their websites. If the new proposals are accepted, the EU will reduce the pop-ups by allowing users to save their cookie preferences in browsers, in a move that was largely expected for some time now.

For the landmark AI Act, that simplification would include delaying the enforcement of some key facets. Although it went into law in 2024, the act's stricter rules on AI systems that have been deemed “high-risk” were going to be applied after a grace period ending in August 2026. The latest proposal wants to delay that until “standards, specifications and guidelines are in place,” the Commission's executive vice-president Henna Virkkunen said in remarks. High-risk AI includes technology that is used to profile people in use cases like biometrics, job applications, border control, and more.

These proposals are not law yet. They will first be submitted to the European Parliament, where they need the approval of a qualified majority.

The main objective of this regulatory loosening is to boost European tech competitiveness, the Commission said, and Wednesday's proposals are apparently only “the first step.”

While it's not certain how much the Trump administration's pro-tech anti-regulation push has impacted the European Commission's thinking, one official wasn't afraid to make the connection.

“No one is fooled over the transatlantic origin of these attempts,” the EU's former commissioner for the internal market Thierry Breton wrote in an op-ed published by the Guardian. “We can't let ourselves be intimidated.”

President Trump has defined the EU's attempts to regulate American tech as “overseas extortion,” and made fighting it a central point of his trade offensive against the EU. Standing ten toes behind him in this fight are Silicon Valley giants.

“Europe has an ever-increasing number of laws institutionalizing censorship and making it difficult to build anything innovative there,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January ahead of Trump's inauguration. “We're going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies.”

Meanwhile, it's been a good day for AI companies stateside as well.

Republicans are gunning for a moratorium on state AI laws, either as a standalone bill or to be added to the National Defense Authorization Act, which is likely to be finalized soon and voted on next month. Trump posted in support of that in his Truth Social account on Tuesday night, saying that “we MUST have one Federal Standard instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.”

It's not clear, though, if that moratorium request would pass. A similar Republican attempt to add a moratorium in the Big Beautiful Bill fell through, mostly because of worries that it would help AI companies evade regulation on child safety laws.

But in his second term, Trump has been no fan of waiting for Congress to advise and consent. On Wednesday, The Verge obtained a draft of an executive order that the President is reportedly expected to sign as soon as Friday. The order would create an “AI Litigation Task Force” that would be charged with suing states over laws that are determined to obstruct the progress of Big Tech's AI development.

But this time around, while Congress ponders that moratorium, a pro-AI group is forming on the sidelines. According to Axios, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema will be co-chairing a new group that wants to “push back” on scrutiny of the AI industry. Called the AI Infrastructure Coalition, the organization will officially launch on Wednesday evening. The members allegedly include the usual pro-AI suspects like Andreessen Horowitz, Cisco, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and some energy companies.

Embattled drone maker DJI has reportedly invested in 3D printer manufacturing, helping diversify its business as it faces challenges in the U.S. According to TechNode, 3D printing brand Elegoo's parent company, Shenzhen Zhinengpai Technology, added DJI as one of its shareholders following an update to its business registration on November 18. It has also reported a capital of CNY 6.44 million, or around US$900,000, which should be a small amount given the company's standing as the world's largest drone maker.

This move can be seen as the company hedging its bets and diversifying its business, especially as it's currently targeted by Washington, D.C. There have been security concerns with DJI drones since 2016, with the authorities growing more concerned in 2017 when Beijing passed its National Intelligence Law, which requires companies to cooperate with state intelligence when asked. By 2020, the company was added to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Entity List, which prohibited it from buying from U.S. firms. Despite that, it was still allowed to sell its drones to the American public.

2024 saw significant action in the U.S. House of Representatives, where a provision that would have banned all DJI sales in the U.S. was dropped at the last moment from the 2025 NDAA. Despite that, the company was given one year to prove that it is not a national security risk. The company received another blow earlier this year when a U.S. court ruled that the Department of Defense could designate it as a “Chinese military company.” Even though the court rejected the DoD's justifications for adding DJI to its list, it still upheld the move, saying that its products have “substantial dual-use applications.” The drone maker is not taking this lying down, though, and it's currently appealing this ruling.

However, the deadline to clear itself is quickly approaching, especially as we only have a few days left until December of this year. So, it seems that its investment in 3D printing is a way for the company to diversify its business and move away from drones. Elegoo has been manufacturing affordable 3D printers, like the Elegoo Centauri Carbon, and it has a massive Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale with a lot of great deals.

Although DJI is unlikely to step away from drone manufacturing, it makes sense for it to invest in 3D printer manufacturing, especially as the industry is burgeoning.

As Blackwell Ultra ramps, Nvidia gets even more money.

Nvidia on Wednesday announced its financial results for the third quarter of its fiscal year 2025, once again beating its own sales records as all its data center GPUs were sold out during the quarter. The company's earnings totaled $57 billion, as sales of all its products — except gaming GPUs — were up. Nvidia does not expect its revenue growth to stop, so it models that its revenue will hit $65 billion in Q4 FY2026, and the company expects sales of its Blackwell and Rubin GPU platforms to hit $0.5 trillion by the end of calendar 2026.

Nvidia's GAAP revenue reached $57.006 billion, up 62% year-over-year and 22% quarter-over-quarter, in the third quarter of the company's fiscal year 2026. The company's net income hit $31.91 billion, a 65% increase compared to Q3 FY2025, while its gross margin totaled 73.4%, up 1% sequentially, but down 1.2% YoY.

 




Nvidia's data center business delivered a rather whopping $51.215 billion revenue in Q3 FY2026, rising 66% year-over-year and 25% sequentially. Within the segment, compute revenue — comprising CPU and GPU sales — reached $43 billion, as the Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra platforms were adopted by all major clients, including cloud hyperscalers, enterprise AI, sovereign AI projects, and industrial. Networking revenue totaled $8.2 billion, up an extraordinary 162% year-over-year, as customers purchased more networking hardware while switching from individual AI servers to rack-scale solutions.

""Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,"" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia. ""Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We have entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.""

 




Nvidia's gaming segment generated $4.265 billion in the third quarter of the fiscal year, rising 30% YoY but slipping 1% sequentially, which was a surprise. Nvidia said channel inventories normalized ahead of the holiday season, though GPUs are normally strongest in the third quarter, so it looks like other factors were affecting sales of graphics cards. Nonetheless, at $4.265 billion, Nvidia's Q3 of FY2025 is the company's second-best quarter for consumer GPUs ever, suggesting the market has peaked for the company at this time.

While sales of GeForce RTX graphics cards were so strong in Q2 and Q3 that they could no longer grow, sales of professional visualization solutions increased to $760 million, rising 56% year-over-year and 26% sequentially, setting an all-time record for Nvidia and likely the whole industry. The improvement was driven primarily by the launch and ramp of the DGX Spark AI workstation platform and increased demand for Blackwell-based professional GPUs used in CAD, CAM, DCC, and various emerging creative workflows.

Nvidia's Automotive and Robotics revenue reached $592 million in Q3 FY2026, increasing 32% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, which was driven by continued adoption of the company's self-driving platforms. During the quarter, Nvidia announced that its next-generation Drive AGX Hyperion 10 Level 4-capable vehicle platform has been adopted by major partners, including Uber, so expect this segment to become even more important for the company going forward.

The OEM and Other segment recorded $174 million in revenue for the third quarter, up 79% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.

 




Nvidia expects another quarter of strong growth, so it guides revenue to $65 billion ±2% and GAAP gross margin of 74.8%. These results will be primarily driven by continued adoption of Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra platforms by various customers in the West. It is noteworthy that the company said nothing about sales of its AI GPUs to China, perhaps reflecting sentiment that this market has largely been lost for now.

Prices have gone through the roof, surging from $8 to $126 per kilogram in under 12 months.

The price of the rare earth element Yttrium has jumped through the roof, with a kilogram of the material currently sitting at $126 per kilogram. According to Bloomberg, this resource cost less than $8 at the end of 2024, meaning its price has increased by nearly 1, 500% in the past 12 months. This is an all-time high for Yttrium, with the trade war between the U.S. and China fueling the price hikes. This material is crucial for semiconductor manufacturing, where it's used in various processes, including thin-film deposition and wafer polishing.

While there has already been some brewing rivalry between Washington, D.C., and Beijing, it came to a head in April when U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on all of the U.S.'s trading partners. This has led to an escalation between the East and the West, culminating in a 145% tariff on Chinese goods entering the United States and a reciprocal 125% import levy for American products landing on China's shores.

The two parties eventually started trade negotiations, which resulted in the lifting of these threats. It seemed that progress was being made at the negotiating table, but China suddenly put strict export controls on rare-earth materials in early October. This move could gravely impact the global semiconductor supply chain, and Trump responded by threatening a 100% tariff on all Chinese goods and a far more devastating critical software ban. The two parties eventually realized that such a move would not do anyone good, so they agreed to a one-year tariff truce, resulting in China suspending its more recent rare-earth export control measures. However, the April ban on some rare earth exports to the U.S. remains, meaning supply remains tight.

Because of this, Yttrium prices continue to creep higher, even as the U.S. and its allies seek alternative sources. At the moment, more than 90% of the rare earth metals that the U.S. needs are sourced from China, but it's working on expanding its own domestic source from the Mountain Pass project in California. Trump is also considering allocating $2 billion in CHIPS Act funds to the critical minerals supply chain to help bolster its resiliency. Australia is also working on extracting more rare earths from its mining waste, while Canada is looking to open a new rare earths mine in its Critical Mineral Strategy Annual Report 2024.

Fix one thing, but break two others.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia just released the GeForce Hotfix Display Driver 581.94, which it says fixes performance issues seen in some games after Microsoft released KB5066835. The problematic mandatory patch was released in October and affected systems that ran Windows 11 25H2 and 24H2, which introduced a bug that reduced game FPS in some instances, according to Windows Latest. Since this is a mandatory cumulative update, future Windows patches are also expected to experience the same problem, so it's highly recommended that you download and apply the latest GPU driver if you experience some performance loss while gaming after installing the update.

While Nvidia says that only some games were affected by the bug, it seems to have been significant enough for it to release a hotfix instead of waiting for its regular driver update release schedule. Team Green says that GPU drivers are incredibly complex, especially as it has to deal with a potentially infinite number of hardware and software configurations. Because of this, it usually releases driver updates in line with major hardware and game launches after extensive testing.

However, this means that major issues could remain unaddressed as existing users wait for Nvidia's regular release cadence. Because of this, the company drops hotfixes, which are released in advance to resolve major issues as soon as possible. For example, when the newly-launched 50-series GPUs started crashing and producing black screens, Nvidia dropped a hotfix outside of its usual release cadence to address the problem. When some issues remained unsolved, the company dropped another hotfix just a week after that to further address crashes and clock speeds.

Windows Updates have recently been breaking a lot of stuff, including one that made USB keyboards and mice unusable in the Windows Recovery Environment and another that triggers BitLocker and encrypts your hard drive without warning. Thankfully, Nvidia stepped up relatively quickly and released an update to fix what the Windows Update broke. It's unclear if Intel and AMD will release driver updates of their own to deal with KB5066835, especially as neither company has acknowledged any Windows Update-related problems so far, but Windows Latest said that GPUs from Intel and AMD are also suffering from performance issues brought about by this particular patch.

In recent years, GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Mounjaro have helped transform the way experts treat type 2 diabetes and manage weight. However, they have also offered new insights into the power of our own gut hormones. 

These insights include the understanding that signals from the gut to the brain suppress the appetite and help to control blood sugar levels.

This has led researchers to dive further into drug-free alternatives that may trigger the same things. 

Researchers from Heliopolis University in Cairo, Egypt, recently published a review of the existing evidence in the journal Toxicology Reports, assessing how the natural hormone that is produced in the gut, called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) might be affected by natural compounds from diet.

This is the same hormone targeted by GLP-1 drugs. At this time, experts have identified no natural compounds found that can exactly replicate the effects of GLP-1 injections.

However, early research suggests that certain foods and the timing of meals may be useful in regulating GLP-1 hormone activity in the body, and thus potentially “rewiring” hunger and satiety cues.

The researchers who conducted this review noted that one of the reasons they are searching for natural alternatives to the GLP-1 injections is because of cost and accessibility.

Many people who may benefit from these injections may not be able to afford them. Natural alternatives may prove to be more accessible and less expensive. 

Another reason this research is important is because of the potential adverse effects of the GLP-1 injections. While these injections are generally well tolerated, there are certain gastrointestinal side effects that may occur, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea.

These side effects may cause some people to not take the medications as prescribed. 

Some people may also believe that natural remedies are better suited to a more holistic view of their health. This may mean they would be more likely to choose them over conventional medicines. 

The researchers also note that searching for natural alternatives to GLP-1 injections is not about giving up on medications that have been successful.

“It's about increasing treatment options and personalizing it to each patient's preferences and needs,” the researchers wrote. 

The review notes that the natural compounds preliminary research is focusing on as potentially mimicking the effects of GLP-1 drugs include cinnamon, wheat, ginger, fermented green tea, and berberine.

All of these compounds could modulate GLP-1 secretion and expression, research cited in the review has suggested.

Mir Ali, MD, a bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center noted that there are caveats to natural alternatives to GLP-1 injections. He told Medical News Today:

“Natural ingredients may help boost metabolism. However, it is a mild effect. These [compounds] should not be considered an alternative to the GLP-1 medications like Ozempic.”

Ali advised people to keep in mind that the naturally occurring ingredients may help with weight management to a mild degree, but only if combined with proper nutrition and exercise. There is no substitute for a healthy diet and lifestyle whether someone is using natural ingredients or taking the GLP-1 medications.

That being said, there is some evidence that certain natural substances like caffeine, green tea extract, capsaicin — found in chilli peppers — and berberine may boost metabolism to an extent, Ali allowed. 

According to him, these natural ingredients work in different ways, “either by stimulating the central nervous system to boost metabolism (caffeine), promote fat burning (green tea extract, capsaicin), or activating other enzymes (berberine).” 

Recent research has found that certain foods may have an effect on diet-induced thermogenesis, which can help boost resting metabolism.

Foods that may have this effect include:

Speaking to MNT, Ali emphasized that this effect is minor in comparison to the GLP-1 medications and it is important to modify your diet and lifestyle to experience consistent weight loss results.

In older adults with depression that was unresponsive to treatment, overall cognitive functioning did not differ with antidepressant strategies; however, adding aripiprazole or switching to nortriptyline modestly improved inhibitory control. 

“Our study has important clinical implications and, in particular, provides some reassurance regarding the use of aripiprazole augmentation or nortriptyline monotherapy in treatment-resistant late-life depression,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Hanadi A. Oughli, MD, of University of California in Los Angeles. It was published online on November 11, 2025, in The Lancet Healthy Longevity.

This study lacked a placebo group. The mean age of patients was less than 70 years, limiting generalizability. Not all antidepressant strategies were evaluated.

This study received funding from the National Institute of Mental Health and Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. Several authors reported financial relationships such as receiving salaries, consulting fees, research grants, and royalty income from multiple sources, including the National Center for Translational Sciences, universities, or pharmaceutical and healthcare companies.

Many of the researchers who are now working to find treatments and a cure for long COVID spent many years working on treatments for HIV/AIDS. And while the viruses are very different from one another, there are a number of similarities that experts hope may lead to new diagnostic tests and treatments for long COVID.

Those new research efforts have already yielded some promising advances. For instance, much of scientists' understanding of long COVID — specifically in researching biomarkers, viral persistence, chronic inflammation, and antiviral treatments — came from years of prior research into HIV. However, it took many years to get from HIV being a death sentence four decades ago to the chronic but manageable condition that it has become today.

“Our hope is that it won't take as long as it did with long COVID because of what we learned from HIV, but these things don't just happen instantly, it takes a lot of work,” said Igho Ofotokun, MD, a professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, and a researcher in both HIV and long COVID.

Five years after long COVID was first identified, the single biggest roadblock in treating patients with the condition remains uncovering a biomarker that can be used to diagnose it. Without a clear tool for confirming positive diagnoses in patients, pharmaceutical companies are hesitant to fund clinical trials.

Still, finding a diagnostic blood test and then treatments for HIV also took time. The first blood test for HIV was approved by the FDA on March 2, 1985, nearly 5 years after the CDC reported the earliest deaths from AIDS. Reliable and safe treatments for HIV took much longer, with the first major antiviral breakthrough treatments developed in 1996.

Findings from 2023 found that certain biomarkers may identify long COVID with 80% accuracy. Researchers revealed that long COVID was associated with inflammation of the immune system in proteins such as C3, C4, and C5. But since then, a definite biomarker has not been identified.

At this point, we know that HIV spreads to organs and tissues in the deepest recesses of the body, called viral reservoirs, said Ofotokun. Researchers can also see that, similar to HIV, long-COVID symptoms result from multiple system organ damage. For example, people may have brain fog because there's damage to the brain or shortness of breath because of damage to the heart and lungs.

“Long COVID seems to persist in the tissue of certain patients, meaning that some of us aren't able to clear the virus,” said Grace McComsey, MD, an HIV researcher who leads one of the 15 nationwide long-COVID centers funded by the federal Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery Initiative in Cleveland. “HIV seems to hang out in the brain and gut, and we're seeing the same patterns with long COVID.”

A study published last May in The Lancet Infectious Diseases points to treatments that target viral reservoirs in patients with long COVID.

“Recommendations are informed by knowledge gained from trials targeting the HIV reservoir,” which shared many of the same hurdles facing today's long-COVID trials, wrote the study authors.

Powerful antivirals reduce the viral load in the body enough to make HIV nontransmittable. But because the virus integrates into host DNA, it can't be eliminated completely. That's why researchers are yet to find a cure. Still, understanding HIV viral persistence has led to effective antiviral treatments, and researchers and experts hope this will also be true for long COVID.

“A lot of the lessons from HIV are that antivirals need to be a combination of the right dose to penetrate the affected tissue and also to prevent viral replication,” said W. Michael Brode, MD, an internal medicine specialist and assistant professor at Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at Austin.

He contended that these lessons are proving really important for how to design long-COVID clinical trials. For example, patients with HIV often take three antivirals each day at the same time to suppress the virus. Something similar may also be true for long COVID.

Researchers initially found that Paxlovid was an ineffective medication for the treatment of long COVID. Then, another study found that it was effective when it was used for longer periods. It's about finding the right dose, interval, and drug combination.

“It could take higher doses and antiviral combinations to target viral reservoirs in patients with long COVID,” said David Putrino, PhD, director of rehabilitation innovation at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City and a national leader in the treatment of long COVID.

HIV researchers know that the virus remains in a viral reservoir in the body, and they think this may be true for long COVID. In the case of HIV, low-level replication causes continuous stimulation of the immune system, which leads to chronic inflammation in patients with HIV, said Ofotokun.

What's more, one result of chronic inflammation may be the early onset of disease. Patients with HIV may have shorter lifespans as a result of diseases related to chronic inflammation, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, liver disease, and cancer.

This understanding of inflammatory-related disease in patients with HIV can also help researchers address similar conditions in patients with long COVID. For example, diabetes often occurs in patients with HIV, and research has shown that this is also true of patients with long COVID.

A recent study found that COVID-related inflammation may induce diabetes in some patients. Other research also found that the risk for type 2 diabetes went up based on the severity of an acute COVID.

Treatments for long COVID-related inflammation may include new trials for the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, used to combat obesity.

“RECOVER TLC is looking at GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic and others to walk back some of this vascular inflammation,” said Brode.

Another class of drugs, called JAK inhibitors, may also help block the activity of enzymes called JAKs and reduce long COVID-related inflammation in some patients, according to research published recently in BMC Neurology.

But in the end, without a long-COVID biomarker, it's difficult to know how effective antivirals and anti-inflammatory medications are beyond what physicians hear from patient-reported outcomes, which don't tell the whole story. To make progress like researchers did for HIV, they need to be able to test for the virus.

“If you want to measure the underlying activity of the disease and see what treatments are working, you have to have biomarkers,” said Brode.

Only 55.9% of parents and caregivers received guidance from healthcare providers on when to introduce allergenic foods to infants. Cultural practices, physician advice, and the presence of a family member with food allergies emerged as key barriers to the early introduction of allergenic foods.

“[Our] study advocates for integrating additional allied health professionals such as registered dietitians into pediatric healthcare teams to provide clear and consistent guidance on allergenic food introduction,” the authors wrote. 

Wan Shen, PhD, with Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on November 17 in Pediatric Allergy and Immunology.

This study lacked racial, ethnic, and sex-based diversity, thus limiting generalizability. People without internet access may have been excluded due to online recruitment. The reliance on self‑reported data may have introduced recall bias, and the lack of standardized criteria for immunoglobulin E‑mediated food allergy may have affected the accuracy of reported diagnoses.

The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

A 1-year, multipart lifestyle intervention helped improve glycemic control and kidney function and reduce dependence on medication in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD), new data suggested. CKD is a common complication of T2D.

The intervention, delivered both individually and in groups, included a whole food, plant-based diet; progressive intermittent fasting and water fasting; targeted muscle activation; yoga; stamina-building exercises; psychological positive-mindset practice; and regular physician consultations and was conducted at the Freedom from Diabetes Clinic in India.

“The psychological component included stress release with journal writing and meditations. Individual counseling was given by trained psychologists,” said Nidhi Kadam, PhD, MSc, Head of Research for the Freedom from Diabetes Research Foundation in Pune, India. Kadam presented the study Monday at American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) 2025.

“While drugs are standard treatment, lifestyle interventions can improve metabolic and kidney health,” Kadam said. She said the program included having a dedicated physician for drug dose adjustments. She added that adherence to diet was the easiest part of the intervention for patients because of the preponderance of vegetarians in India; exercise was the more difficult component.

This retrospective study analyzed data from 1131 adults with T2D recruited from the Freedom from Diabetes clinic between June 2020 and March 2024. Those eligible had a urine albumin-creatinine ratio (uACR) greater than 30 mg/g and varying estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR).

Medical history and biochemical data were collected at baseline and after the intervention. Patients were grouped into CKD risk groups based on the KDIGO 2012 guidelines: moderate risk (uACR, 30-300 mg/g) and high risk (> 300 mg/g), with eGFR ranging from normal (≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m²) to severely reduced (15 mL/min/1.73m²).

The median age of participants was 56 years (63% men), and the average duration of disease was 13.8 years. BMI average was 26.7 kg/m2; A1c average was 8.2%.

At baseline, almost all patients (95%) were taking oral hypoglycemic agents, and 27% of the patients were taking insulin. Among those on comorbidity-related medications, 67% (n = 756) used statins and 77% (n = 867) took CKD-related medications.

After the intervention, more than one fifth (22%) discontinued their statins and 50% discontinued their CKD-related medications, the researchers reported.

Additionally, A1c levels dropped from 8.2% to 6.9%, BMI decreased from 26.7 to 24.9 kg/m², uACR dropped from 73.1 to 33.9 mg/g, and eGFR improved significantly (97 vs 96 mL/min/1.73m²; P < .001 for all).

At baseline, 79% (n = 894) were at moderate CKD risk, with 52.9% transitioning to low risk (uACR < 30 mg/g with a normal eGFR) post-intervention. Among high-risk patients (21%, n = 237), 10.5% improved to low risk (P < .001). 

“Notably, 85% of those who transitioned to low risk also eliminated the need for CKD medication,” the researchers wrote. “Among the 261 patients not on CKD medication at baseline, 89% were at moderate risk and 11% were at high risk, with 55.1% improving to low-risk post-intervention (P < .001).

Kadam said her team plans to test the intervention against a control group in a coming study.

“This intervention, Freedom from Diabetes, happens to be a Lifestyle Medicine Certified Program, meaning they have previously published outcome data showing health improvements among their patients,” Micaela Karlsen, PhD, MSPH, senior director of research for ACLM told Medscape Medical News. “They use a comprehensive lifestyle approach of nutrition, physical activity, and psychological components, and they have amazing results, both clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in a variety of metrics.”

The mean drop in A1c was a big drop, Karlsen noted, and likewise, the BMI drop represents a substantial change in category from overweight to normal weight. “There were also reductions and discontinuation of CKD medication. These are the kind of outcomes that inspire both clinicians and other patients,” she said.

The authors and Karlsen reported having no relevant financial disclosures.

Throughout medical school and into residency, Edward “Donnell” Ivy, MD, MPH, wanted to become a pediatrician, so he could help children avoid the suffering he'd experienced as a child with sickle cell disease (SCD). But the training didn't quite match up with his expectations.

“It's not enough to have all these good therapies to treat a disease if you're not able to actually deliver those therapies to the patients who need them,” Ivy, the chief medical officer of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America (SCDAA), told Medscape Medical News. “As an individual with sickle cell disease, I decided to dedicate my life to improving sickle cell care that goes beyond only working in the lab or the clinic. There's so much systemic work to be done.”

The more Ivy learned about the US medical system, the more he realized that public health was his true calling. After switching from clinical medicine, he earned a master's degree in public health, then did a stint at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, where he worked on the agency's 2014 SCD guidelines. “There are newer guidelines from ASH [American Society of Hematology] and others, but I'm still proud of what we accomplished with that guideline,” he said in an interview at the SCDAA annual convention in Chicago in October. “The goal was to increase the number of providers that were available to assist in the treatment of individuals with sickle cell disease.”

Then came Ivy's time spent at the National Health Research Services Administration, where he continued his work to improve life for people with SCD and other diseases. “We moved to a regional approach, where we tried to decentralize the knowledge around treating sickle cell disease and get more providers involved in that.” 

Ivy's childhood experiences always loomed large. Along with multiple pain crises each year, he experienced avascular necrosis (AVN) in both hips, starting at around age 8. He soldiered on through adolescence. While he was in college, a pain crisis with symptoms of acute chest syndrome (ACS) changed everything.

The treating physician recognized that ACS requires treatment by a specialist and transferred Ivy to The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he received hydroxyurea for the first time. “Hydroxyurea has literally been life-changing for me,” he said. “I went from having three or four crises requiring hospitalization each year to not having any crises at all.” 

After starting hydroxyurea, Ivy went from being an inconsistent student to making the dean's list every semester, then attending medical school at East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina. “I was able to go to medical school in large part because of hydroxyurea,” he said. “That and coordinated care for SCD transformed my life.”

While in medical school, Ivy realized he could no longer postpone the dual total hip replacement surgeries that he'd needed for more than 10 years. “I'd had a severe limp for years, but the pain became too much during my surgery rotation, when I had to stand all day on bad hips,” he said. “I couldn't help but take pain medicine because it was excruciating. Restful sleep was impossible.” 

For Ivy, his lived experience shows the challenges of improving care for people with SCD. “It's not enough for us to just prescribe medicine and call it a day. We must figure out how we address those social determinants of health,” he said. “That means figuring out how to build a system that addresses the needs of a population that has historically had to deal with racism, underfunding, poverty, and unequal access to care.” 

That means hematologists should work to increase uptake of clinical guidelines and proven therapies like hydroxyurea where appropriate, Ivy said. He encourages hematologists to look for ways to partner with primary care clinicians. For example: By forging ties so that, once the hematologist prescribes and titrates hydroxyurea, the primary care provider can gain confidence with routine management of the patients.

“Every sickle cell patient should see a hematologist at least once a year. If they're well managed, then maybe that annual visit is enough, and their primary provider can manage things the rest of the year,” Ivy said. “If they're not well managed, that's going to include seeing the hematologist more frequently. But we also need a care coordination effort that involves the hematologist, primary care, social workers, other allied health professionals, and even community health workers to help with transportation issues and other barriers in the community.” 

Ivy added, “We need hematologists to step up and take the lead with coordination where needed.”

Ivy sat down with Medscape Medical News recently. The following interview has been edited for clarity.

We know that training programs tend to emphasize hematology-oncology as opposed to classical hematology. We also know that reimbursement is better in hematology-oncology. But there aren't enough classical hematologists to adequately treat the 100,000 Americans with SCD. As a field, we need to approach this creatively to ensure patients get the care they need.

I can appreciate that there are hematologist-oncologists who prefer to avoid treating sickle cell patients. They can be difficult, time-consuming patients. But I encourage hematologist-oncologists to be open to connecting with a sickle cell specialist. Ideally, that sickle cell specialist would take the complicated cases — the ones where the patient is not well controlled, and the case may be very time-consuming or challenging to manage. But the majority of patients with sickle cell, particularly if we can get them into coordinated care, are going to become much less complicated to manage over time. If hematologist-oncologists could add these patients to their panels, everyone would benefit, and care would improve.

The reality is that there are still too many SCD patients using the emergency room as their primary source of care, which means they're not getting the comprehensive care they should be getting. And that might include hydroxyurea, the lack of which might be setting them up for end organ damage or early mortality.

Some patients are also put off by the fact that hydroxyurea is a chemotherapy drug, even though it is safe and well-studied.

It's also fair to note that hydroxyurea is a big reason why we need more hematologist-oncologists to be willing to treat patients with SCD. As long as patients with SCD see a hematologist once a year, it's possible that an experienced pediatrician, internist, or family practitioner can also prescribe hydroxyurea, as long as they feel supported, especially in a care-team setting.

It's impossible to overstate the importance of coordinated care. I'm a good example of that. Even though I'm very stable on hydroxyurea, I'm still a 54-year-old Black man with SCD and am subject to higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and renal failure than my white counterparts. In addition to problems from AVN, I also have arthritis now. I know how to function within the system to get the care I need from both my primary doctor and my hematologist, but what about others who don't?

I would also like to call out closer adherence to the guidelines. For example, we know that penicillin prophylaxis in children protects against severe pneumococcal infections and improves outcomes, but not enough children with SCD are getting it. Similarly, transcranial Doppler ultrasound in children accurately predicts those at risk for stroke, allowing for prompt preventive treatment. 

Getting involved with the SCDAA is a good option. We have an active advocacy effort, a clinical trial finder, community health worker training, and a variety of initiatives that work on large-scale change. We also work closely with the National Alliance of Sickle Cell Centers which provides consensus recommendations for infant, pediatric and adult patients, as well as acute pain crises. They also offer a variety of toolkits and resources for providers, including guidance on how to start a sickle cell center. Membership is at the institutional level, meaning that hematologists may be able to influence policy at their institution. We need more hematologists that are willing to join the NASCC and learn more about the treatment and management of SCD so that they can be a resource.

Ivy reported having paid consulting relationships with Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, and Sickle Cell Awareness Group of Ontario. He is an unpaid consultant with the Global Action Network for Sickle cell and Other Inherited Blood Disorders.

Intermittent intravenous methylprednisolone pulse (IVMP) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) led to a complete clinical response in 93% of patients with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), with manageable adverse effects over a median of 61 months.

“This study suggests that the regimen, especially the use of MMF, is a therapeutic option for JDM,” the study authors wrote, noting that the adverse effects of treatment were “mild and manageable.”

The study was led by Lishuang Guo, MM, Department of Pediatric Rheumatology, Immunology, & Allergy, Children's Medical Center, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China, and was published online on November 19 in JAMA Dermatology.

The study was limited by its retrospective design, absence of a control group, and small sample size. Additionally, the concurrent use of intravenous immunoglobulin and hydroxychloroquine could interfere with the interpretation of the treatment responses.

The study was funded by a grant from the Clinical Research Project of the First Hospital of Jilin University and the Department of Science and Technology of Jilin Province. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

People with type 1 diabetes (previously called juvenile diabetes) are 4.29 times more likely to develop bladder cancer, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis by researchers at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. The new analysis is the first to control for the effects of tobacco smoking, a factor that likely obscured the heightened risk in earlier studies. The results were just published in the journal Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice.

Bladder cancer is a relatively common disease, affecting about 2% of the U.S. population. Cigarette smoking accounts for about half of all bladder cancer in the United States and Europe, but causes of the remaining half are poorly understood. Recent data suggest that type 2 diabetes may play a role, but years of epidemiological studies found no link between type 1 diabetes and bladder cancer.

Now, a new analysis reveals why a possible link may have been missed. Because smoking is a strong contributor to bladder cancer, research designed to identify other risk factors must control for-or separate out-the influences of smoking from influences of other proposed causes. But no prior studies on type 1 diabetes and cancer had done so.

Of nine original studies and one meta-analysis published before ours, none had adequately controlled for smoking. When we evaluated the vulnerabilities of these studies and addressed them, we found a very clear pattern indicating substantially elevated risk for bladder cancer in people with type 1 diabetes.""

Victoria K. Cortessis, PhD, clinical professor of population and public health sciences, Keck School of Medicine and study's senior author

The new findings provide important clues about causes of bladder cancer and may help guide decision making by patients with type 1 diabetes and their providers. For example, avoiding or quitting smoking may be especially important for this group, Cortessis said.

For years, studies that tracked people with type 1 diabetes found no increased risk of bladder cancer-and a closer look reveals why. Most datasets on type 1 diabetes began as studies that followed patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes over time. The initial goal was to learn how the condition impacted patients by tracking events like hospitalizations and early complications. Data on smoking, however, were either not collected or asked about once and not updated.

Years later, researchers used those same datasets to ask a different question: Does type 1 diabetes raise the risk of other diseases, such as bladder cancer, in adulthood? To find out, they compared disease rates among people with type 1 diabetes to rates in the general population. Those analyses found no increased risk for bladder cancer.

The problem with this method: Smoking is a major contributor to bladder cancer. Without accurate data on smoking in the diabetes group or the general population, it was impossible to know how much risk of bladder cancer was linked to smoking versus type 1 diabetes itself.

The Keck School of Medicine team suspected that people with type 1 diabetes may smoke less than the general population. After managing a serious health condition starting early in life, these individuals may have been more health conscious as adolescents and adults. If true, lower smoking rates could skew the comparisons and mask any increased bladder cancer risk tied to diabetes itself.

To investigate that idea, first author Helena Oskoui Bennett, MPH, a student at the Keck School when the research was conducted, gathered data from authoritative sources such as the World Health Organization to estimate smoking prevalence in populations where the original studies were conducted. The patterns the team found using a technique called meta-regression supported the team's hypothesis, helping explain why earlier analyses failed to detect a connection. After accounting for patterns of smoking, they estimated that people with type 1 diabetes were 4.29 times more likely to get bladder cancer.

The reason for the link between type 1 diabetes and bladder cancer is not yet clear, but researchers suspect the disease may trigger biological changes that contribute to the cancer's development. For that reason, careful management of diabetes-including maintaining healthy blood sugar levels-could be key for reducing bladder cancer risk. Those biological changes may also interact with the effects of smoking to further raise risk.

""More work is needed to understand the mechanisms at play, but it's possible that there is a biological synergy between diabetes and smoking that increases risk more than either factor alone,"" Cortessis said.

The study emerged from the team's larger analysis of type 2 diabetes, another condition linked to bladder cancer. They are now reviewing nearly 100 studies on type 2 diabetes and its treatments to pinpoint what drives the increased risk.

In addition to Cortessis and Bennett, the study's other authors are David Bogumil and Kimberly D. Siegmund from the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine of USC, University of Southern California; Richard M. Watanabe from the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, the Department of Physiology & Neuroscience, and the Diabetes and Obesity Research Center, Keck School of Medicine of USC, University of Southern California; Lynn Kysh from the University of California at Davis; and Piet van den Brandt from Maastricht University Medical Center, Netherlands.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study reveals the long-lasting health impacts of eating disorders","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251119/Study-reveals-the-long-lasting-health-impacts-of-eating-disorders.aspx","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:57:00 GMT","

The health impacts of eating disorders, such as anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating, are not only complex, affecting many different organ systems, but long-lasting, finds a large tracking study, published in the open access journal BMJ Medicine.

The risks of serious conditions, such as diabetes, renal and liver failure, fractures, and premature death, are particularly high within the first 12 months of diagnosis. But these heightened risks persist for years, highlighting the need for timely integrated multidisciplinary health services and continued monitoring to improve outcomes, conclude the researchers.

UK rates of eating disorders have risen significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, note the researchers. But while the detrimental mental and physical consequences are well known, the long term effects are less well understood, they add.

To strengthen the evidence base, the researchers scrutinised anonymised medical records in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to Hospital Episode Statistics and death certification data for people across England over a 20 year period (1998 to 2018 inclusive).

Some 24,709 people, aged 10-44, with a diagnosed eating disorder, were matched for age, sex, and GP practice with up to 20 others without these disorders (493,001 in total), and their mental and physical health tracked for 10 years.

Most (89%) of the entire sample was female. And among those with eating disorders, 14.5% (3577) had anorexia; 20.5% (5085) had bulimia; 5% (1215) had a binge eating disorder; and in 60% (14,832), the eating disorder was unspecified.

Analysis of the data revealed that eating disorders were associated with substantially higher risks of poor physical and mental health, and premature death.

Within the first year of diagnosis, people with eating disorders were 6 times more likely to be diagnosed with renal failure and nearly 7 times more likely to be diagnosed with liver disease, as well as being at significantly heightened risks of osteoporosis (6 times as high), heart failure (twice as high), and diabetes (3 times as high).

The risks of renal failure and liver disease were still 2.5 to nearly 4 times higher after 5 years, with 110 and 26 more cases than would be expected, respectively, per 10,000 people at 10 years.

Similarly, the risks of poor mental health were significantly higher 12 months after an eating disorder diagnosis: the risks of depression were 7 times higher, with 596 additional cases per 10,000 people, while those of self-harm were more than 9 times as high, with an additional 309 cases/10,000. And although they were lower, these heightened risks persisted after 5 years.

The risk of death from any cause within the first 12 months of diagnosis was also more than 4 times as high, and for unnatural deaths, including suicide, it was 5 times as high. After 5 years, these risks were still 2 and 3 times higher, corresponding to 43/10,000 extra deaths from all causes and 184/100,000 extra deaths from unnatural causes.

And 10 years after diagnosis, the equivalent figures for additional deaths amounted to 95/10,000 and 341/100,000, respectively. The risk of suicide was nearly 14 times higher in the first year but was still nearly 3 times higher after 10 years, accounting for 169 additional deaths/100,000 people.

The researchers acknowledge that the medical records data didn't include the severity of the eating disorder, making it impossible to link severity to worse outcomes.

But they say: ""Our data describe the substantial long term effects of eating disorders and emphasize the potential opportunity for primary care to have a greater role in offering support and long term monitoring for individuals who are recovering from an eating disorder.""

They suggest: ""A closer and more cohesive management approach in primary and specialist care may also be needed, for both physical (nephrology, cardiology, and endocrinology) and mental health services to provide this support.""

They add: ""A potential gap exists in provision where patients' difficulties are too complex for low intensity brief interventions, but not complex enough for specialist teams.""

And they conclude:""Raising awareness among healthcare providers about the lasting effects of eating disorders and the need for ongoing support in managing current symptoms and recovery is essential.""

In a linked editorial, Dr Jennifer Couturier and Ethan Nella of McMaster University, Ontario, Canada, point out that despite the high prevalence of eating disorders, ""their consequences are under-recognised.""

They add: ""Earlier studies have illustrated the limited education given during medical training on the topic of eating disorders, and the current study emphasises the importance of disseminating this knowledge to all healthcare professionals.

""Medical education should place greater emphasis on the recognition and management of eating disorders, to equip primary care providers, specialists, and allied health professionals with the tools to identify early warning signs and monitor ongoing risks associated with eating disorders.""

They conclude: ""Multiple organ systems are affected by eating disorders, which then requires an integration of care to adequately treat patients. This situation places primary care providers in an ideal position for leading and coordinating [their] care, and suggests that primary care settings would be apt for early and ongoing intervention.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Focused ultrasound can be safely used in children being treated for brain cancer","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251119/Focused-ultrasound-can-be-safely-used-in-children-being-treated-for-brain-cancer.aspx","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 01:03:00 GMT","

Columbia University researchers are the first to show that focused ultrasound - a non-invasive technique that uses sound waves to enhance the delivery of drugs into the brain - can be safely used in children being treated for brain cancer. 

The focused ultrasound technique, developed by Columbia engineers, was tested in combination with chemotherapy in three children with diffuse midline glioma, a rare and aggressive brain cancer that is universally fatal. 

The study found that focused ultrasound successfully opened the blood-brain barrier in all three patients, allowing the chemotherapy drug to reach the tumors and leading to some improvement in patient mobility. (All three patients eventually died from their disease or complications of COVID.

""Now that we've established the safety and feasibility of focused ultrasound in children, we've opened the door for more trials to try the technique earlier in the course of the disease and with lower systemic but higher brain doses. Our hope is that the technology will improve survival for children with brain cancer,"" says study leader Stergios Zacharoulis, associate professor of pediatrics at Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and a pediatric oncologist at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of Children's Hospital of New York. 

Columbia has already launched a follow-up trial using focused ultrasound with etoposide, an FDA-approved chemotherapy drug that has shown activity against brain cancer cells. 

Though new therapies are transforming the lives of patients with aggressive tumors such as pancreatic cancer and melanoma, the prognosis for brain cancer has remained stubbornly unchanged for decades. Survival for children with midline glioma, which begins deep within the brainstem, is usually less than one year after diagnosis. 

A major impediment to improving survival for brain cancer patients is physical: The blood-brain barrier, which protects the brain from viruses, bacteria, and toxins in the bloodstream, also prevents almost all chemotherapies from reaching brain tumors in sufficient concentration. In the lab, Elisa Konofagou, a professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia, has consistently shown that the barrier can be relaxed safely to allow drugs to permeate the brain and then reinstated. 

Many cancer drugs are capable of killing brain cancer cells, suggesting that techniques that permit more drug molecules to pass through the barrier and target the tumor cells have the potential to transform treatment. 

Focused ultrasound opens the blood brain barrier by using sound waves to vibrate tiny lipid-coated gas bubbles within the barrier. As the vibrating bubbles expand and contract, they pry open pathways in the barrier that drugs can pass through. 

Most focused ultrasound techniques require the use of MRI machines to guide the sound waves to specific locations in the brain. 

""MRIs can be stressful experiences for some of us, but especially for children who find it really difficult to stay still in the machine during the procedure,"" says Konofagou, who developed the technique. ""At Columbia, our innovation was to move the focused ultrasound treatment outside of the MRI machine and perform the treatment in a friendly environment for the child with their family in the room during the procedure."" 

With the Columbia-designed device, MRI images for navigation planning are obtained before the focused ultrasound treatment with a hand-guided device. 

Patients can rest their heads on a massage table and play on a tablet or read a book during treatment, and the procedure is entirely noninvasive and painless and only lasts for a few minutes.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study evaluates effectiveness of indoor vaccine mandates in US cities during COVID-19","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251120/Study-evaluates-effectiveness-of-indoor-vaccine-mandates-in-US-cities-during-COVID-19.aspx","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 14:48:00 GMT","

Research published in Contemporary Economic Policy reveals that despite widespread adoption of indoor vaccine mandates in major US cities during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no consistent evidence that these policies significantly increased vaccination rates or reduced COVID-19–related outcomes. The findings contrast with those from other countries, as national mandates abroad boosted vaccine uptake.

For the study, investigators estimated how mandates that restricted access to indoor venues for unvaccinated individuals impacted first-dose uptake, COVID-19 cases, and deaths across 9 US cities through what's called the synthetic difference-in-differences method. The method estimates the effect of a city's indoor vaccine mandate by constructing a ""synthetic"" control for the city using a weighted average of untreated metropolitan areas that closely matched pre-mandate trends in the outcome of interest.

The scientists found no consistent pattern of statistically significant impacts of the mandates on first-dose vaccine uptake, COVID-19 cases, or deaths across the 9 cities. The results challenge assumptions about the effectiveness of local public health interventions and suggest that local mandates may be less impactful when vaccine coverage is already high, when people can sidestep restrictions by traveling to nearby cities, and when the political environment is highly polarized. The findings could be useful for developing future public health strategies and policies.

We wanted to take a careful, data-driven look at what these policies actually accomplished in the US context. By the time most cities introduced indoor vaccine mandates, vaccination rates were already high, and many unvaccinated individuals were deeply hesitant or resistant, leaving limited room for further gains. Our findings don't suggest that mandates can't work-only that their effectiveness depends on timing, context, and how easily people can sidestep local restrictions.""

A new synthesis of randomized trials reveals that a carefully supervised very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet can improve weight, insulin control, and androgen levels in women with PCOS, offering short-term clinical gains while underscoring the need for longer-term safety data.

In a recent study published in the British Journal of Nutrition, a group of researchers synthesized randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on the effects of the very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), covering anthropometric, hormonal, and metabolic outcomes.

One in ten women of reproductive age lives with PCOS, a condition tightly linked to insulin resistance (IR), weight gain, and low-grade inflammation, which are factors that ripple into everyday life through irregular cycles, fertility worries, and cardiometabolic risk. Small, strategic weight loss can normalize periods and improve chances of conception, yet many diets feel impractical for busy households. VLCKD induces nutritional ketosis and may lower insulin levels, reduce visceral fat, and rebalance androgen levels, offering a potentially practical, food-based approach. However, because VLCKD trials are short, highly variable, and often restrictive, long-term safety, adherence, and comparative effectiveness versus other eating patterns remain uncertain, and hence further research is needed.

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance and a protocol registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), investigators searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) via PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, and Web of Science for RCTs through July 2025. Eligible participants were adult women with PCOS assigned to a VLCKD.

Outcomes included anthropometric measures such as weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), fat body mass (FBM), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR); hormonal markers such as sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), free and total testosterone, and the LH/FSH ratio; and metabolic endpoints such as fasting glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and total cholesterol.

Data were extracted in duplicate with disagreements resolved by a reviewer. Meta-analyses used weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs). Random-effects models, Hartung-Knapp adjustments, Cochran's Q, and I² quantified uncertainty and heterogeneity, and funnel plots screened publication bias. Certainty of evidence was graded using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).

Across the evidence base, 12 trials were included qualitatively and 11 in meta-analyses, enrolling more than 800 women with PCOS from Italy, China, Pakistan, and the United States, and using parallel and crossover designs over approximately 4 to 24 weeks. Diet protocols ranged from VLCKD (~750–800 kcal/day) to energy-restricted VLCKD (~1300–1500 kcal/day), consistently restricting carbohydrates sufficiently to induce ketosis while providing adequate protein. Several outcomes exhibited very high statistical heterogeneity, reflecting differences in caloric levels, carbohydrate thresholds, lipid composition, adherence monitoring, and concurrent treatments.

Anthropometry showed clinically meaningful improvements that map to real-life wins, such as looser waistbands, better sleep, and easier movement. Body weight fell substantially (WMD −9.57 kg), alongside reductions in WC (WMD −7.75 cm) and FBM (WMD −7.44 kg). BMI decreased (WMD −3.45 kg/m²), and WHR modestly improved (WMD −0.02). Sensitivity analyses supported the direction of these effects, despite I² values often exceeding 90%, and there was no consistent sign of publication bias in the funnel plots.

Hormonal profiles moved in a direction consistent with reduced hyperandrogenism and improved ovulatory potential, outcomes that matter to women tracking cycles at home or planning pregnancy. Free testosterone decreased (WMD −0.31 ng/dL) and total testosterone decreased (WMD −7.21 ng/dL), while SHBG increased (WMD +15.22 nmol/L). LH fell (WMD −3.97 U/L), the LH/FSH ratio declined (WMD −1.04), and FSH showed no significant change, an overall pattern compatible with easing androgen excess and better follicular dynamics.

Glucose-insulin outcomes echoed the anthropometric and hormonal shifts. Fasting glucose dropped (WMD −9.65 mg/dL), fasting insulin declined (WMD −2.41), and HOMA-IR improved (WMD −2.46). These shifts translate to fewer “sugar crashes,” steadier energy, and potentially lower long-term risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In lipid outcomes, triglycerides were reduced (WMD −29.95 mg/dL), whereas total cholesterol, LDL-c, and HDL-c showed no significant pooled changes during the short-to-intermediate follow-up.

Risk-of-bias assessments rated most domains low or with some concerns, but three trials were explicitly judged to have high risk of bias due to non-true randomization or missing outcome data. Importantly, the certainty of evidence by GRADE was generally moderate across key outcomes, reflecting both consistent directionality and substantial heterogeneity, variability in dietary protocols, and limitations in adherence reporting. While adverse effects were not the primary focus of the pooled analyses, reported issues in the broader ketogenic literature, such as transient gastrointestinal discomfort, nutrient gaps without supplementation, and lipid shifts, underscore the need for clinical supervision, a staged reintroduction of carbohydrates, and attention to overall dietary quality. Additionally, none of the included trials stratified results by PCOS phenotype, which may limit interpretability because phenotypes differ markedly in hyperandrogenism, metabolic risk, and potential dietary responsiveness.

Across RCTs, the VLCKD meaningfully improves weight, WC, FBM, BMI, and selected reproductive hormones in women with PCOS, while enhancing glucose-insulin control and lowering triglycerides. These changes support practical, near-term benefits such as more regular cycles, greater comfort, and potentially improved fertility when VLCKD is professionally supervised. However, most trials are short, heterogeneous, and not designed to test long-term safety, lipid trajectories, phenotype-specific responses, or real-world adherence.

Future work should compare VLCKD with other evidence-based patterns over longer periods, track phenotypes, and integrate behavioral support to sustain gains. More consistent protocol standardization and improved adverse-event reporting would further strengthen the evidence base.

New research shows that declining rainfall heightens encounters between people and wildlife, especially carnivores, revealing how drought reshapes ecological and human behaviour across California.



Study: Human-wildlife conflict is amplified during periods of drought. Image Credit: JoeFotos / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers examined the influence of drought on human-wildlife conflict. Interactions between humans and wildlife have become more prevalent, representing a fundamental challenge for conservation programs. As antagonistic human-wildlife interactions persist, a deeper understanding of how climate change affects resource availability and human-wildlife conflict dynamics is crucial for characterizing future changes in socioecological systems.

Drought is a common manifestation of climate change that strains both wildlife and human populations. While drought may limit resource availability for wildlife in wildlands, human infrastructure often buffers its effects, attracting wildlife to anthropogenic subsidies. As such, opportunities for human-wildlife conflict can intensify due to increased overlap and competition for shared resources. However, the precise behavioral and ecological mechanisms linking drought to increased conflict remain uncertain, and the study emphasizes that these associations do not establish causation because they reflect correlations rather than demonstrated behavioral shifts.

In the present study, researchers investigated the effects of drought on human-wildlife conflict. They leveraged the Wildlife Incident Reporting (WIR) database of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which comprises human-wildlife incident reports from 2017 to 2023. Reported incidents encompass a wide range of interactions within four main categories: depredation, general nuisance, potential human conflict, and sightings.

“Climate change will increase human-wildlife interactions, and as droughts and wildfires become more extreme, we have to plan ways to coexist with wildlife,” said lead author Kendall Calhoun, a member of Justine Smith's lab at UC Davis and of UCLA's Tingley lab on ecology and conservation. “Animals coming into human spaces are generally framed as wildlife trying to take resources from humans, but it's often because we've taken the resources away from the wild areas.”

The team primarily focused on two categories most likely associated with negative interactions, general nuisance, and depredation. The state of California was divided into 50 km by 50 km grid cells for analysis, and reported conflicts within each cell and month were compared with environmental covariates. Environmental covariates included seasonality (month), precipitation, human population density, median household income, and habitat structure (tree cover).

A hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework was adopted to investigate how changes in precipitation and other covariates affect incident frequency. In one model, incident reports for all species were treated agnostically and modeled together. Further, a separate set of diet-specific models was developed to explore whether these effects varied by species and diet guilds, where species were modeled under a shared diet-group hyperparameter.

The influence of each environmental covariate on the frequency of conflict reporting across the four categories was also compared. In addition, three models investigated species-specific responses and the impact of diet on trends in reported conflicts, one for each diet group: carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores. In these species analyses, reports of species with more than 40 reported conflicts were included. The authors also noted that reporting patterns are partly shaped by human behavior and perceptions, which may influence how often conflicts are reported rather than how frequently they actually occur, because shifts in human activity, visibility, and willingness to report can contribute to observed trends.

The WIR database comprised 31,904 incident reports in California between 2017 and 2023. Most reports (57.2%) were related to depredation. The researchers found a significant increase in the number of wildlife conflicts associated with reductions in precipitation. Every 25 mm decrease in annual precipitation increased the frequency of reported incidents by 2.11%.

Further, higher tree cover, higher human population density, and higher median household income, as well as areas with both higher human population density and tree cover, were associated with increased conflict reporting. Independently, depredation, general nuisance, and potential human conflict were negatively associated with precipitation. Notably, reported incidents showed the highest increase with decreased precipitation for carnivores.

Importantly, decreased precipitation was a strong predictor of conflict reporting for carnivores, but not for herbivores or omnivores at the diet-guild level, clarifying that the earlier effects for carnivores remained robust at the species level rather than the guild-level aggregate. Species-specific analyses revealed significant increases in reported conflicts, accompanied by reduced precipitation, for three carnivores (mountain lions, bobcats, and coyotes) and one omnivore (American black bears). This distinction highlights that drought sensitivity is strongest for particular species rather than all members of a diet group.

The number of conflicts increased for every 25 mm reduction in precipitation by 2.97 percent for bobcats, 2.56 percent for American black bears, 2.21 percent for coyotes, and 2.11 percent for mountain lions. Finally, the team investigated whether the frequency of conflict reporting varied with intra-annual drought periods and found that trends in reported incidents sharply increased during the driest and warmest months of the year (May to October) for eight species. These seasonal increases occurred independently of year-to-year precipitation trends, reflecting both ecological and human behavioral patterns, such as greater outdoor activity and higher wildlife detectability during summer months, as well as reduced water availability during peak drought periods.

Taken together, the results underscore that climate change may have significant ramifications for the future of conservation and human-wildlife conflict. The finding that lower precipitation is associated with conflict warrants investigations into how exactly drought affects space use and behavior for human and wildlife communities. The results also showed that carnivores experienced nearly three times the effect of drought as herbivores.

Further, season was a robust determinant of conflict reporting, and this effect is likely replicable in regions where intra-annual water availability influences human-wildlife interactions. While the impact of ongoing droughts may perturb animal behavior year-round, their effects are likely to be most pronounced when precipitation is at its seasonal low. The study also emphasizes that reporting patterns may be influenced by socioeconomic factors, cultural norms, and willingness to report conflicts, suggesting that the observed increases may reflect both ecological responses and human behavioral changes during drought conditions, including shifts in recreation timing, resource use, and opportunities for human-wildlife encounters. Overall, the study provides crucial empirical evidence on the amplification of human-wildlife conflict by climate change.

“I look at ways to improve human-wildlife interactions, and climate change is going to make that path more difficult,” Calhoun said. “But if we can make it worse, then we can make it better. People just need to be invested in their local environment to make conservation work.”

A new patch developed by Texas A&M University researcher Dr. Ke Huang may offer a way to help the heart heal after a heart attack. The patch uses a unique microneedle system to deliver a therapeutic molecule directly to damaged heart tissue, promoting repair and improving heart function without affecting the rest of the body.

Each tiny needle in this biodegradable patch contains microscopic particles loaded with interleukin-4 (IL-4), a molecule known to help regulate the immune system. When applied to the surface of the heart, the needles dissolve and release IL-4 directly into the injured area, creating a healing-friendly environment.

Huang and team published their findings in Cell Biomaterials, supported by the National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association.

""This patch acts like a bridge,"" said Huang, assistant professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences. ""The microneedles penetrate the outer layer of the heart and allow the drug to reach the damaged muscle underneath, which is normally very hard to access.""

After a heart attack, the heart muscle loses oxygen and nutrients, causing cells to die. The body responds by forming scar tissue, which helps stabilize the heart but cannot contract like healthy muscle. Over time, the remaining heart muscle has to work harder to compensate, often leading to heart failure.

Huang's patch aims to interrupt that cycle. By delivering IL-4 directly to the site of injury, the patch encourages immune cells called ""macrophages"" to switch from a pro-inflammatory state to a healing state. This shift helps reduce scar formation and promotes the final prognosis.

Macrophages are the key. They can either make inflammation worse or help the heart heal. IL-4 helps turn them into helpers.""

Dr. Ke Huang, Assistant Professor, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Texas A&M University

Previous attempts to use IL-4 for heart repair involved injecting it into the bloodstream, but that approach caused unwanted side effects in other organs. Huang's patch solves that problem by keeping the treatment local.

""Systemic delivery affects the whole body,"" he said. ""We wanted to target just the heart.""

One of the most surprising findings was a change in the ""state"" of heart muscle cells after treatment. Huang said the cells became more communicative and responsive to signals from surrounding tissues, especially endothelial cells, which line blood vessels. This enhanced communication may be key to long-term healing. ""The cardiomyocytes weren't just surviving, they were interacting with other cells in ways that support recovery,"" he said.

The patch also quieted inflammatory signals from endothelial cells, which can otherwise worsen damage after a heart attack. Huang's team observed increased signaling through a pathway called NPR1, which helps maintain blood vessel health and supports heart function.

While the current version of the patch requires open-chest surgery, Huang hopes to develop a minimally invasive delivery method in the future. He envisions a version that could be inserted through a small tube, making it more practical for clinical use.

""This is just the beginning,"" he said. ""We've proven the concept. Now we want to optimize the design and delivery.""

Huang is collaborating with Xiaoqing (Jade) Wang, assistant professor of statistics in the College of Arts and Sciences, to develop an AI model aimed at mapping immune responses and guiding future immunomodulatory therapeutic delivery.

New evidence from six European countries and the US reveals that simple, achievable hospital improvements, such as adequate nurse staffing and stronger interdisciplinary teamwork, are strongly linked to better physician well-being and reduced turnover.

Study: Informing Hospital Physician Well-Being Interventions in Europe and the US. Image credit: PeopleImages/Shutterstock.com

An international study published in JAMA Network Open finds that better nurse staffing and work environments in hospitals are associated with improved physicians' wellbeing and job satisfaction.

A high level of work-related physical and mental exhaustion is significantly increasing the likelihood of physicians leaving hospitals worldwide. This global crisis of a physician shortage can potentially compromise patient care and safety, as well as restrict access to hospital and emergency care.

Many studies on physician wellbeing have primarily focused on problems unrelated to work environments within hospitals, such as income concerns. However, designing effective interventions for physician well-being requires an in-depth analysis of internal issues, such as excessive workloads, unresponsive administration, job dissatisfaction, inadequate resources and infrastructure, and a lack of supporting staff.    

The current study, led by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, aimed to address these internal issues and provide evidence to inform interventions for improving physician well-being and reducing turnover.

The researchers surveyed 56 U.S. hospitals in 2021 and 49 hospitals in six European countries in 2023. The survey population consisted of 1,149 European physicians, 5,334 US physicians, 3,044 European nurses, and 11,869 US nurses.

In the survey, nurses reported on hospital environments, including nurse staffing adequacy, quality of the clinical care environment, and interdisciplinary teamwork between nurses and physicians.

Physicians, on the other hand, reported on their well-being and job outcomes, including work-related exhaustion, job dissatisfaction, intention to leave, and willingness to recommend their hospital.

The survey findings revealed poor physician well-being in hospitals across Europe and the US. Among enrolled physicians, approximately 17 % to 45 % reported high-level exhaustion, 16 % to 40 % reported job dissatisfaction, and 20 % to 44 % expressed an intent to leave their hospital within the next year.

Notably, the survey indicated that physician job satisfaction in European and US hospitals was higher in hospitals with better nurse staffing, a more favorable clinical care environment, and effective physician-nurse teamwork.

Specifically, the findings revealed that in US hospitals, a 10% improvement in the clinical care environment was associated with a 22 % lower risk of physicians intending to leave, a 25 % lower risk of not recommending their hospital, and a 10 % lower risk of work-related exhaustion.

In European hospitals, a 10 % increase in nurse staffing adequacy was similarly associated with a lower risk of exhaustion and job dissatisfaction.

The study identifies several crucial factors that can potentially challenge the retention of enough physicians in European and US hospitals to ensure adequate access to healthcare services.

The study also identifies modifiable organizational features of hospitals that can be considered as potential intervention targets for improving physician wellbeing and retention.

Previous studies on physician well-being and preventive interventions have primarily focused on individual physicians rather than the institution. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have highlighted that interventions such as coaching, mindfulness practices, or discussion groups have a minimal or no meaningful impact on physician outcomes.

Hospitals operating with too few nurses and unfavorable work environments have been found to have higher rates of physician burnout and turnover. The present study's findings are consistent with this literature.

The current study design involved two distinct groups of healthcare professionals: nurses, who reported on hospital environments, and physicians, who reported on their well-being and job outcomes. This helped avoid bias where the same healthcare professionals provide information on two interconnected variables.

Overall, the study's evidence highlights the significance of organizational interventions, specifically adequate nurse staffing, supportive care environments, and strong interdisciplinary teamwork, in improving physician well-being and addressing the physician shortage.

The study collected data in two phases. The US data was collected during the peak phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2021, while the European data was collected in 2023. This variation in data collection timing may have some influence on the findings.

The US hospitals included in the study are Magnet-recognized, meaning that these hospitals provide a supportive work environment that attracts and retains skilled nurses. The European hospitals, on the other hand, had agreed to participate in the study to improve their work environment. These hospitals are not necessarily representative of all hospitals in European countries.

Such country-level differences in health systems may have impacted the findings. However, the study found significant variations in physician well-being across hospitals within the same countries. This variation further supports the significance of organizational interventions in improving physician well-being regardless of country-level differences in health systems.

Mayo Clinic researchers have developed a new, personalized approach to deep brain stimulation (DBS) for people with drug-resistant epilepsy. By mapping each patient's unique brain wave patterns, the method allows physicians to target the precise area in the brain where stimulation is most effective, moving beyond the traditional one-size-fits-all approach.

DBS involves implanting electrodes in the brain to deliver electrical pulses that help prevent and control seizures. While effective, DBS is typically administered with electrodes placed in the same brain region across most patients. Mayo Clinic physician-scientists are now tailoring the treatment to an individual's seizure network before DBS placement.

""Our unique approach aims to tailor neuromodulation for each patient,"" says Nick Gregg, M.D., a Mayo Clinic neurologist and lead author of a paper published in the Annals of Neurology. ""We're moving away from one-size-fits-all to an individualized approach that maximizes seizure network engagement to better modulate abnormal brain wave activity.""

Once researchers identify the specific area in the thalamus - a small relay hub deep within the brain - that connects to a patient's seizure network, they can fine-tune stimulation settings for that individual. Because seizures occur infrequently, clinicians analyze erratic brain wave patterns that signal abnormal activity.

We're trying to disrupt the pathological hypersynchrony and reduce network excitability to lower seizure risk."" 

Dr. Nick Gregg, M.D., Mayo Clinic neurologist

Ten patients received this personalized approach while being evaluated for epilepsy surgery. The next phase of research will follow those who have since received permanent DBS implants using this personalized approach.

""The long-term goal is to quiet the seizure network, so it is eventually forgotten. Reorganizing the neuronal network could move us beyond controlling seizures to actually curing epilepsy,"" says Dr. Gregg.

This research is part of Mayo Clinic's Bioelectronic Neuromodulation Innovation to Cure (BIONIC) initiative, which unites clinical insight with cutting-edge engineering to deliver novel diagnostics and therapies. Through intellectual property development, strategic partnerships and patient-centered trials, BIONIC transforms innovation into impact - advancing care for complex neurological conditions.

A landmark multi-country clinical trial has shown that a structured, sustainable approach to infection prevention and treatment can save women's lives, cutting severe maternal infections and deaths by about one-third (32%) compared to usual care. The maternal program of prevention and treatment (APT-Sepsis) was developed by researchers at the University of Liverpool, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN's Special Programme in Human Reproduction (HRP).Maternal infection and sepsis remain among the leading causes of maternal death worldwide. Every 30 minutes a mother dies from a sepsis-related cause somewhere in the world, with the greatest burden borne by women in low and income countries. The Active Prevention and Treatment of Maternal Sepsis (APT-Sepsis) intervention tackles this challenge through an integrated program focused on three areas: improving hand hygiene, strengthening infection prevention and management, and enhancing sepsis care with the FAST-M sepsis bundle.The trial, conducted across 59 hospitals in Malawi and Uganda and involving more than 430,000 women, assessed whether structured improvements in infection prevention, early recognition, and timely treatment of maternal sepsis could save lives. Findings from the trial show that even within a very resource-limited environment this innovative approach made it possible to support healthcare workers to improve maternal outcomes and can be sustained in resource-limited health systems.

The study report revealed that the APT-Sepsis intervention not only reduced the incidence of maternal infection-related mortality or severe morbidity by 32%, but that the program was equally effective in both Uganda and Malawi. The effectiveness was sustained over time, increasing steadily from the first month of the intervention to the final month, when a 47% reduction was achieved.The program supported healthcare providers to:

Professor David Lissauer, NIHR Professor of Global Maternal and Fetal Health at the University of Liverpool, said: ""These results are hugely significant. For too long, maternal sepsis has been a leading but neglected cause of preventable maternal deaths worldwide. Our findings demonstrate that APT-Sepsis provides a practical, sustainable, and effective solution. With a 32% reduction in infection-related maternal deaths and life-threatening complications, this program has the potential to transform care. Policymakers now have compelling evidence to scale up these interventions so that fewer women die from preventable infections during pregnancy and childbirth.""Jeremy Farrar, Assistant Director-General, WHO, said: ""The APT-Sepsis programme is a testament to what can be achieved when science, policy and frontline care come together. Reducing maternal infections and deaths by over 30% is not just a clinical success - it's a call to action for global health systems to prioritize infection prevention in maternal care. We must ensure these life-saving practices are scaled and sustained across all settings."" 

Fungaro Lydia, Midwife and APT Champion at Arua Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda said: ""I want to thank APT-Sepsis for coming to our rescue. Previously, we had no reliable way of monitoring mothers. We used to do things in our own way, but now, with the intervention, we can detect danger early.""

Henry Mwandumba, Programme Director at the Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Research Programme, MLW, said: ""We are immensely proud that MLW contributed to a project that has delivered such a significant reduction in maternal infections and deaths. This is a testament to our commitment to improving the health and wellbeing of women in Malawi and reflects the dedication of our team and partners, and look forward to seeing how this intervention pioneered in Malawi can be scaled-up to help mothers worldwide""

The trial demonstrates that structured, system-level interventions can overcome long-standing barriers such as inconsistent adherence to infection-prevention practices and delays in the recognition and treatment of sepsis.

By embedding improved practices within existing health systems - and without relying on costly additional resources - APT-Sepsis is designed to offer a low-cost, sustainable and rapidly scalable model for national and international health programmes seeking to improve maternal survival globally.

The trial was managed by the Department of Women's and Childrens Health and the Liverpool Clinical Trials Centre at the University of Liverpool and the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome

Research Programme, Malawi and Infectious Diseases Institute, Makereke University, Uganda.

This work was funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), UK AID, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and MSD for Mothers through the Joint Global Health Trials Scheme.

The work of Professor David Lissauer and Professor Catriona Waitt (University of Liverpool and the Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere University) is supported by NIHR Global Health Research Professorships.

A new study has uncovered promising therapeutic strategies against one of the deadliest forms of prostate cancer.

McGill University researchers at the Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Institute (GCI) identified a mechanism driving neuroendocrine prostate cancer, a rare and highly aggressive subtype for which there currently are no effective treatment options.

Findings published in Genes & Development show that prostate tumors in mice became more aggressive when the protein ERRγ was lost, while restoring its production in human cancer cells reversed this effect.

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in Canada. tumors that stop responding to hormone therapy evolve into neuroendocrine prostate cancer in about 15 per cent of patients, according to past research. After this shift, life expectancy typically falls below 18 months.

Therapy resistance remains one of the biggest challenges in cancer treatment, and prostate cancer is no exception. Our findings highlight ERRγ as a promising new therapeutic target.""

Vincent Giguère, Lead Author, Professor, McGill's Department of Biochemistry and GCI researcher

The researchers used advanced genetic and metabolic analysis to understand how losing ERRγ drives tumor growth. Their investigation revealed that two genes linked to cancer become overactive when ERRγ is missing.

As drugs that block these genes already exist for other cancers, the team tested two of them in mouse and human prostate cancer cells. When combined, the two drugs slowed the cancerous growth far more effectively than either drug alone.

""These findings have major clinical implications,"" said Giguère. ""By targeting the genes that take over when ERRγ activity is low or lost, we open the door to new treatment strategies for patients who currently have few options.""

Understanding why ERRγ function becomes impaired in the first place is still being investigated, he added.

ERRγ, previously known for its role in energy metabolism, appears to act as a brake that prevents prostate cancer from advancing.

Preclinical findings led by first author Ting Li, a post-doctoral fellow in Giguère's lab, have revealed that neuroendocrine prostate cancers have much lower levels of ERRγ than other types of prostate tumors. Removing the protein in mice sped up tumor progression, while reactivating the protein in human prostate cancer cells reversed the process, confirming its protective effect.

Smoking even 2-5 cigarettes a day can more than double your risk of any type of heart disease and raise your risk of death from any cause by 60% compared to people who never smoked, according to new research supported by the American Heart Association's Tobacco Center for Regulatory Science and published in PLOS Medicine. The study found that even after you stop smoking, it could take up to 30 years or more to achieve the same level of health of someone who never smoked.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while cigarette smoking in the U.S. is on the decline, tobacco product use, which includes cigarettes, remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death. Cigarettes continue to be the most commonly used tobacco product in adults.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of people who still smoke, but smoke less. As smoking patterns shift with more people smoking fewer cigarettes, it's important to understand the cardiovascular risks of low-intensity smoking and the long-term benefits of quitting. We could not clearly answer these questions in the past, but the scope of this study, reflecting more than 320,000 U.S. adults over 20 years, gives us the statistical power to see relationships that other smaller studies cannot.""

Michael J. Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., study author, lead investigator for the American Heart Association's Tobacco Center for Regulatory Science grant-funded research initiatives

The Cross Cohort Collaboration-Tobacco research group harmonized information (meaning they integrated and standardized studies to make them comparable) from 22 long-term studies of predominately U.S. adults who smoked and those who did not. Researchers used the collective data in their analysis of more than 320,000 adults followed over 20 years. They looked at the relationships among smoking burden, intensity and cessation duration across cardiovascular results, including heart attack, stroke, heart disease, cardiovascular disease (including heart disease and stroke), heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AFib), as well as deaths from coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease and all causes.

Defining cigarette use as a lifetime use of at least 100 cigarettes, the researchers documented more than 125,000 deaths and 54,000 cardiovascular events.

They found:

""Collectively, the findings suggest that no level of smoking is without risk. Smoking one or fewer cigarettes a day was linked to elevated risks for all heart diseases and reasons for death studied, except for stroke and AFib. Smoking a little more - two to five cigarettes daily - was associated with increases for all risks in the study,"" said Blaha, a professor of cardiology and epidemiology and director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, Baltimore, Maryland. ""Even we were surprised by the strength of harm from even a low quantity of cigarettes, and the incredible importance that and quitting early had on long-term heart health.""

""The message here is clear - don't smoke - and for those who do, quit early in life and strive to quit entirely versus smoking less, because even occasional use of tobacco has substantial health consequences,"" said Stacey E. Rosen, M.D., FAHA, volunteer president of the American Heart Association and senior vice president of women's health and executive director of the Katz Institute for Women's Health of Northwell Health in New York City. ""This study provides clear evidence of the harmful impact of smoking on individuals. It offers a framework for future research to delve into the complex dynamics among smoking habits, various population subgroups and their associations with cardiovascular health outcomes.""

Among the study's limitations, it did not include specific other causes of death, such as cancer, for a comparison. And while researchers considered the baseline smoking status for participants' smoking behaviors, they did not analyze potential smoking behavior changes over time. Information was also lacking about participants' use of other tobacco products.

Research from the American Heart Association's Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science is jointly funded by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health. Through the Center, the Association works closely with investigators at institutions across the country to pursue research that adds to the existing knowledge about the health impacts of smoking and nicotine-related products including e-cigarettes, findings that can help inform public health and the regulation of tobacco products.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Scientists uncover genetic components linked to bone density in young people","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251119/Scientists-uncover-genetic-components-linked-to-bone-density-in-young-people.aspx","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 01:21:00 GMT","

Researchers at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) revealed important genetic components that affect bone density in children and adolescents. This information could help identify pediatric patients who may benefit from strategies to help improve their bone health at an early age, helping them maintain healthy bones and prevent fractures in adulthood.

Many children experience fractures due to accidents and recover quickly, but there are many reasons why children may have weak bones or be at risk for developing fragile bones. Chronic health conditions, dietary restrictions and steroid use all impact bone mineral metabolism. Genetics plays an additional role, and while most studies have been conducted on adults for whom a fracture could be life-threatening, the role that genetics plays in affecting bone mineral density during childhood has historically been much less understood. Two recent studies from researchers at CHOP explored the importance of genetic and genomic information when it comes to understanding pediatric bone development.

The first study, published in the journal Genome Biology, looked at genetic signals associated with bone mineral density that had been previously identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) across adults and children. Prior studies had not been able to identify a causal gene linked to those signals.

Understanding the causal gene was related to the dynamic between osteoblasts, which form new bone tissue, and osteoclasts, which break down old bone tissue. When children are growing, osteoblasts are far more active to help achieve proper bone growth.

The researchers used CRISPRi – which helps silence gene expression without cutting the DNA like CRISPR-based therapies – and identified four genes (ARID5B, CC2D1B, EIF4G2, and NCOA3) that are linked to osteoblasts and their ability to mature. Additionally, the researchers found that many genetic signals associated with bone mineral density also exhibit their effects on other tissues, indicating that bone density might signify other potential health issues.

""With this information, our hope is to further study these signals specifically in pediatrics and help identify which children are more likely to get a fracture to optimize their bone health for life,"" said senior study author Struan F.A. Grant, PhD, Director of the Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics and the Daniel B. Burke Endowed Chair for Diabetes Research at CHOP.

The second study, published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, used a polygenic risk score called genetic quantitative ultrasound speed of sound (gSOS). gSOS had been previously used to study the risk of fracture in adults, and CHOP researchers sought to determine whether it was associated with bone health in children. This study utilized two observational studies and associated genetic data, the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) as well as data from CHOP's Center for Applied Genomics spanning more than two decades.

The study found that a higher gSOS score was associated with higher bone mineral density at multiple skeletal sites and reduced odds of fracture across both observational studies. This is particularly important since the researchers' investigation accounted for a wide range of factors, including sex, puberty stage, levels of calcium in the diet, height, weight and BMI, as well as accidents that could have resulted in fractures.

Our study found that genetics represent a powerful component of bone density across the entire lifespan. We were very surprised to see that the polygenic risk score could accurately predict which patients were more likely to experience a fracture, even accounting for the normal childhood activities we most closely associate with broken bones.""

Babette S. Zemel, PhD, Senior Study Author, Professor of Pediatrics at CHOP

Both methods could potentially be utilized to enhance bone health earlier in life. While a good diet and regular weight bearing physical activity, particularly sports like volleyball and basketball, are important for bone health, Zemel said, these remain particularly helpful for improving bone health even if genetic risk of fracture is high.

The first study was supported by the University of Colorado Gates Grubstake Award, the National Science Foundation grants DMS 2113072 and DMS 2310654, National Institutes of Health grants R01AI154773, R01DK122586, UL1 TR001878, R01 HD100406, R01 AG072705, and UM1 DK126194, the Henry Ruppenthal Family Professorship for Bioengineering and Orthopaedic Surgery and the Daniel B. Burke Endowed Chair for Diabetes Research.

The second study was supported by the National Institutes of Health grants R01HD100406, R01HD58886 and UL1TR000077, and the Daniel B. Burke Endowed Chair for Diabetes Research. The Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) was also supported by Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development contracts N01-HD-1-3228, -3329, -3330, -3331, -3332, -3333.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Global experts map out the practical steps that help extend life expectancy","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251119/Global-experts-map-out-the-practical-steps-that-help-extend-life-expectancy.aspx","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 02:01:00 GMT","

A global panel of scientists and community leaders shows how biology, lifestyle, and culture can work together to help people live longer, healthier, and more purposeful lives.



The illustration conceptualizes how fostering bonds and communication, plant-based communal dining rich in dietary fiber, daily routines with physical activity, and living with gratitude and “Ikigai” collectively support the vision of healthy longevity. 

The first global summit on longevity was recently held in Japan, where experts discussed advances in research, lifestyle interventions, and community-based strategies. The meeting report has been published in the journal npj Aging.

A joint declaration was an outcome of the conference, highlighting four critical components for healthy aging. These included maintaining meaningful social bonds, having a sense of gratitude, being physically active, and following a healthy diet centered on plant-based protein and dietary fiber.

The world is aging at an unprecedented pace, with rising life expectancy and falling fertility reshaping countries' demographic structures across all income levels. While people today live longer than previous generations, many spend their later years managing illness or disability.

The challenge of ensuring that added years are lived with independence and well-being framed the first World Longevity Summit, held in Kyotango, Japan. Japan, where nearly one in three citizens is aged 65 or older, embodies the pressures and possibilities of aging societies.

Within the country, the Kyotango region stands out for its unusually high concentration of centenarians, a phenomenon attributed to strong social ties, plant-forward diets with dietary fiber, daily activity, and cultural continuity.

With these regional strengths as a backdrop, the summit convened researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and community leaders to explore cutting-edge science and practical models for healthy aging. Twenty-eight presentations covered fields ranging from molecular geroscience to public health and community initiatives.

A central theme of the summit was deciphering the biological mechanisms that shape aging. Steve Horvath introduced epigenetic clocks used to estimate biological age and showed how these tools capture organ-specific aging, familial longevity, and environmental influences.

These models show that centenarians' families tend to have slower epigenetic aging. Organs such as the cerebellum and retina age more slowly than tissues like blood or bone. Lifestyle factors produce very modest shifts in biological age, though certain interventions, such as omega-3 supplementation, show small but measurable benefits. Conversely, obesity was highlighted as accelerating liver-specific epigenetic aging. Horvath also noted examples such as the Hispanic paradox and the Tsimane people, whose biological age appears unexpectedly low relative to health risk factors.

Complementing this perspective, Tamotsu Yoshimori highlighted autophagy as a core mechanism of cellular maintenance. He outlined how autophagosomes recycle damaged components, maintaining energy balance and proteostasis.

Suppressing the protein Rubicon, an age-associated inhibitor of autophagy, can extend lifespan and improve neurological function in model systems. Early exploratory interventions, such as fermented tea extracts and lifestyle programs designed to stimulate autophagy, point to possible translational pathways but require rigorous evaluation. Rubicon's role in promoting exosome-mediated spread of senescence signals was also noted as an emerging mechanistic insight. Yoshimori's work has also led to the establishment of a research-oriented company and the Japan Autophagy Consortium, illustrating early efforts to translate autophagy science into public-facing initiatives.

Francis Chan shifted focus to the gut microbiome as a driver of systemic aging. He showed that microbial diversity, metabolite production, and gut barrier integrity decline with age, contributing to inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and cognitive changes. Intriguingly, centenarians exhibit not a young microbiome, but a distinct one characterized by fewer dominant species and greater representation of minor beneficial taxa.

Early-life microbial disruptions can shape long-term health. Recent clinical trials using synbiotics showed promise for improving fatigue and cognitive symptoms in long coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), illustrating how microbiome-targeted interventions may support neurological and systemic health. Chan also described four categories of microbiome-based aging biomarkers: diversity, taxonomic composition, metabolite profile, and functional output.

A second major focus of the summit was designing social systems that enable older adults to thrive. Tomoo Matsuda advocated for the idea of a “Platinum Society.” Such a community views aging not as societal decline but as an opportunity to empower older adults as contributors.

Community-based models such as Exadon, a program combining exercise and taiko drumming, or multi-use centers that facilitate intergenerational engagement, were presented as effective ways to maintain social connection, daily activity, and purpose. However, the summit emphasized that evidence for these initiatives is often observational, and formal evaluation remains limited. Matsuda also proposed policy innovations such as care credits and “second compulsory education” for seniors.

Stefania Bandini expanded the discussion to rural aging, emphasizing that vast regions in Italy, known as “inner areas,” and Japan face population decline, loss of traditional knowledge, and limited access to services. She illustrated how digital tools can identify vulnerabilities such as poor walkability, inadequate access to health facilities, and insufficient caregiving networks. Integrating such technologies with local cultural practices, she argued, is essential for building age-friendly environments that align innovation with human dignity and community needs.

The summit produced four clear principles for healthy longevity: prioritize social connection, share meals centered on plant-based protein and dietary fiber, sustain regular routines and physical activity, and foster gratitude alongside a strong sense of purpose (Ikigai). The declaration affirmed that achieving healthy aging requires a science-based, culturally sensitive, and collective approach.

In synthesizing four days of presentations, the summit underscored that extending healthy life expectancy requires action at multiple levels, namely molecular research, clinical translation, early-life interventions, community design, and policymaking.

In conclusion, the World Longevity Summit emphasized that embracing aging as an opportunity, fostering global partnerships, and integrating science with cultural values are crucial steps toward enabling people worldwide to enjoy longer, healthier, and more meaningful lives.

Planarians are flatworms that have a simple central nervous system (CNS) but an extraordinary ability to regenerate neural tissue. Their CNS is divided into distinct molecular and functional domains defined by specific neural gene expressions 1.

Remarkably, planarians can regenerate functional brains from small body fragments, thanks to pluripotent stem cells known as neoblasts, which can differentiate into various cell types, including neurons. As a result, planarians have become a model organism for studying neural regeneration 2-3.

However, exploring the complex coordination of neural networks in planarian growth and regeneration has always been a challenge, primarily due to the difficulties in capturing high-resolution, three-dimensional images of their central nervous system (CNS) within a practical timeframe.

To overcome these obstacles, researchers from Zhejiang and Westlake University and Tottori University 4 used advanced imaging techniques combining tissue expansion with tiling light-sheet microscopy, enabling nanoscale resolution and significant linear expansion.

Central to this success was Thermo Scientific's Amira Software, which served as the primary environment for image processing and analysis, particularly for segmentation, quantification, and 3D visualization.

By implementing an automated 3D cell segmentation process, researchers mapped neurons and muscle fibers at the single-cell level in over 400 wild-type planarians, both during their normal state and throughout regeneration.

They revealed the complex distribution of neurons across the planarian nervous system, including the brain, ventral nerve cords, optic nerves, and pharyngeal nerve complex. This innovative approach promises to shed new light on the intricate processes underlying planarian biology.

By creating recipes in Amira Software, researchers were able to quantify neurons and nuclei and to collect volumetric parameters such as length and volume.

The recipe solution in Amira Software provides a powerful tool that significantly enhances the efficiency and consistency of image analysis workflows. By allowing users to create, save, and reuse analysis recipes, it ensures that complex image processing tasks can be replicated across different samples with minimal effort.

Using Amira Software capabilities in image analysis and processing, researchers identified differences between a control sample and one where β-catenin, which is crucial for maintaining structural integrity and functional interactions between neurons and muscle fibers, was interfered with (as shown in the figure below).

Specifically, they observed that neural structures have a clear and organized pattern in the control, highlighting the distinct pathways and connections within the sample. In contrast, in β-catenin RNAi planarian, muscle fibers show a more complex and cobweb-like structure, indicating a different or more intricate arrangement of neural connections.

To support open science and reproducibility, the research team released all Amira Software segmentation and quantification recipes via Zenodo.

Lu et al.'s work clearly demonstrates how Amira Software can bridge advanced microscopy and data science, delivering quantitative, reproducible workflows that illuminate how cells, neurons, and tissues organize in three dimensions.

From robust nuclei counting to fiber tracing and 3D rendering, Amira Software enabled the researchers to uncover structural principles of regeneration previously unseen in living systems. This workflow now serves as a model for future imaging studies seeking reproducibility, scalability, and cross-modality integration.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Most pregnancies involve weight gain outside healthy ranges with major health impacts","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251119/Most-pregnancies-involve-weight-gain-outside-healthy-ranges-with-major-health-impacts.aspx","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 01:28:00 GMT","

Around two-thirds of pregnancies have weight gain that is more or less than recommended and is associated with complications such as preterm birth, large birth weight, and admission to intensive care.

The findings are part of a Monash University-led systematic review of data from 1.6 million women, published by The BMJ.

Gaining too much or too little weight during pregnancy, known as gestational weight gain or GWG, represents combined growth of mother and baby, and is associated with increased risks to both mother and child.

Each year 130 million births occur globally in total, in the context of increasingly unhealthy and processed food supply and environmental drivers, causing an epidemic of excess GWG.

First author Dr. Rebecca Goldstein, from the Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation (MCHRI), said the study's results underlined the need for international action.

""These findings reinforce the need for international reference standards for healthy GWG alongside lifestyle support and public health measures to improve outcomes for mothers and babies worldwide,"" Dr Goldstein said.

Most countries rely on Institute of Medicine GWG guidelines*, but these are based on data from predominantly Caucasian women in high income countries in the 1980s, so they don't reflect ethnically diverse populations across low, middle and high-income settings, or changes in food supply and environment that are driving global trends such as rising weight (BMI).

In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched an initiative to develop global healthy GWG standards aimed at defining optimal GWG recommendations across diverse settings.

To support this initiative, Monash University researchers and collaborators from the WHO analyzed data from 40 observational studies involving 1.6 million women aged 18 and over from five of the six WHO defined world regions that reported pregnancy outcomes according to BMI and GWG from 2009 to 2024. Of these 40 studies, 36 were considered to be high quality.

Around half (53 per cent) of study participants had a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI, with others classified as below (6 per cent), above (19 per cent), or well above healthy weight (obese) (22 per cent). Only a third (32 per cent) had GWG within recommended ranges, with 23 per cent gaining below and 45 per cent gaining above recommended.

Based on WHO BMI criteria, the research study found that GWG below the recommended range was associated with: lower risk of caesarean delivery; a large for gestational age infant; and high birth weight (macrosomia) but higher risk of preterm birth; a small for gestational age infant; low birth weight; and respiratory distress.

Conversely, GWG above the recommended range was associated with: a higher birth weight and a higher risk of caesarean delivery; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; a large for gestational age infant (macrosomia), and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit; and a lower risk of preterm birth and a small for gestational age infant.

Similar patterns were apparent when Asian BMI categories were used in studies conducted in this world region.

The researchers point to some limitations, such as variations in BMI and GWG classifications, and note that few studies from low income countries met their inclusion criteria, limiting diversity. Nor can they rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors, such as smoking status, age and ethnicity, may have influenced their results.

However, Senior author Professor Helena Teede, who is Director of the Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, and an Endocrinologist at Monash Health, said the study supported the need for a global approach.

Our findings inform and support the need for optimised, evidence-based WHO international GWG reference standards based on individual patient data, applicable to contemporary and diverse global populations. This work builds on and improves current recommendations and highlights the need for multi-level support to improve the health of mothers and babies worldwide.

Whilst this work supports guidance on healthy GWG, it will need to be incorporated into individualised care to meet the needs of those in pregnancy, limiting stigma and optimizing healthy outcomes for women and the next generation. Ultimately, the burden of health impacts shown here mandate action to support women across policy, healthcare and individual level solutions for the health of mothers and babies.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","USWNT to face Paraguay in January Camp friendly","https://www.starsandstripesfc.com/football-frenzy-2025/41440/uswnt-to-face-paraguay-in-january-camp-friendly","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:27:00 GMT","

It will be the first of two matches during the annual January Camp.

The United States Women's National Team will head to Southern California to begin 2026. Today, U.S. Soccer announced that the USWNT will hold its annual January Camp January 17-27 and will face Paraguay in the first of two friendlies on January 24th at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California.

“January camp is a vitally important part of our yearly schedule, especially with 2026 being a year that will host World Cup qualifying,” said USWNT head coach Emma Hayes in U.S. Soccer's press release. “We don't get many training days together during any given year, so there is a high value in getting a whole week of training as well as two matches. I was pleased with the progress we made as a team in 2025, but we still have a ways to go to get to where we want to be heading into the Concacaf W Championship in the fall.”

The January 24th match against Paraguay will also serve as a tribute match for Christen Press, who recently retired from professional soccer. The two-time Women's World Cup champion will be honored before the match before her hometown fans. No venue has hosted more USWNT matches than Dignity Health Sports Park, which sits 10 miles from Press's hometown of Palos Verdes Estates. Christen Press bobbleheads will be given out to the first 2,000 fans through the gates for the match.

In Paraguay, it's just the third time the USWNT has faced the current 41st ranked team in the world. The teams last faced in two friendlies in Cleveland and Cincinnati in September 2021, and the United States won 9-0 and 8-0 in those matches.

Unlike the USMNT, the USWNT is continuing the January Camp tradition. However, Emma Hayes had indicated back in January that it was unlikely that the team would have matches during the camp moving forward. Hayes believed that with most of the NWSL-based players in preseason mode, it made more sense to have stepped up training camps and combine it with youth national team camps. However, with 2026 being a pivotal year with Women's World Cup qualifying beginning in the fall, it makes sense to get ssome match experience for the players who can be released from their clubs outside of an international window.

The Paraguay match will be the first of two friendlies during January Camp. A second match will be held on January 27th, with the opponent and venue to be announced at a later date. The first international window of the year for the women will be February 24-March 7, where it is expected that they will host their annual SheBelieves Cup with three invited teams.

In an interview with The Athletic, U.S. Soccer chief executive JT Batson revealed the “Pathway Strategy” has buy-in from key components of the country's soccer ecosystem, including MLS, NWSL, USL, youth soccer organizations, key sponsors and community organizations. While many details and methods are still to be publicly disclosed, he said that early-stage memorandums of understanding have been signed, with timelines and deadlines for actions to come into effect.

Batson said the landmark moment of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, provided impetus for key stakeholders to work together.

He said: “We're all here because we want to win World Cups and we want millions of kids to be able to play soccer. We want people to believe that U.S. Soccer is supporting them in their soccer journey, whether it's a fan, a player, coach or a family member. We know we have more work to do on that on the men's side.

“At the Women's World Cup in New Zealand and Australia, we did not achieve what we wanted (the U.S. women's national team went out in the round of 16). We did the hard work to understand what actually needs to be done, so that we are the No. 1 played sport in the country and so tens of millions of people are in love with our teams.

“We have talked to anyone we could learn from. We did research, we took data, we had thousands of conversations with people within the U.S. and outside the U.S. to understand our environments, opportunities or challenges, and to ultimately put forward a real plan that we think can be successful.

“It is not the one you slap on a bumper sticker. We're committed to doing the long, hard work here.”

The research undertaken by U.S. Soccer included consultations with soccer experts around the world. Batson says the legendary former Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, now in a role as FIFA's chief of global development, “deserves a lot of credit” for the generosity of time and insights provided by him and his team in outlining ideas and practices. The U.S. Soccer sporting director, Matt Crocker, has also brought insights from his extensive time with the English Football Association and Premier League.

The federation has also enlisted the support of the Twenty First Group, a sports intelligence consultancy. They are working to benchmark how many players out of the top 1,000 in the world would, on average, be required in a squad at a World Cup for a team to go to the quarter-finals or beyond in the competition, providing the federation with one method of benchmarking its future talent development.

Batson said the objective is to get U.S. teams, at all levels, into a position to win major tournaments. “On the women's side, we have proven we are there,” he added. “But the rest of the world is not sitting around hanging, so we have to keep pressing. On the men's side, we have ambitions of proving we are there too.”

One of the previous challenges has soccer stakeholders disagreeing about the issues and solutions for the game. Batson says the consensus has moved closer.

“We agree we need to work together,” he said. “We agree we need to make soccer more accessible. We agree we need easy, simple-to-understand pathways for kids to decide what journey they should go on. We agree that we need to get some of the funding and resourcing models right. There's a belief that there needs to be a whole lot more opportunities for kids to play soccer close to home, and local models and regional models that provide an opportunity for kids to play much longer, much easier and much cheaper than what exists today.

“There's buy-in around the U.S. way: a sporting strategy around player-centric development and best practices. Clubs can have different playing styles, but it is about having a core philosophy around how we make sure that every kid is put in a position to be successful.”

Batson warned that the size and geography of the U.S. mean there is no “copy and paste” solution from other countries. The federation has taken learnings from outside of the soccer and sports world to understand how to bring greater agreement and uniformity.

The federation has studied the smoking cessation efforts within the United States, which drastically reduced the number of smokers in the country, as well as public information campaigns that persuaded many people of the risks of driving under the influence of alcohol.

That level of buy-in will be required to smooth access and participation, particularly costs, for children to play soccer in the country. Many current and former U.S. national team players have bemoaned the financial risks taken by their families in pursuit of their soccer dreams.

Batson said, “This is going to be a long-term journey. But for a country as wealthy as we are, with the resources that we have, beyond monetary, these are solvable things. With people in the room, working together, it's possible.

“Our task is to use the big moments of '26, '28 (Olympic Games in Los Angeles) and '31 (bid to host the Women's World Cup) to get governments to invest in fields, to get schools to put soccer in, because it's not just one thing, it's all of the things. You've got this incredible base of strength and support.

“The commercial market of soccer in this country is growing. MLS owners now spend nine figures a year on free-to-play youth soccer opportunities as part of their player development efforts. Ten years ago, that was essentially nothing. That alone is massive. Part of what we will be calling out is how soccer is a more affordable way to impact way more kids than, say, baseball or football, where equipment is way more expensive.”

In 2024, 31.9 million Americans over the age of six participated in basketball versus 17.3 million in baseball, according to the Sports and Fitness Industry Association (SFIA). In football, across flag, tackle, touch and 7-on-7, the combined participation was 18.8 million. Soccer's participation across indoor and outdoor in 2024 was 20.5 million, which is a rise of more than three million since 2019.

The plan has major backing. MLS Commissioner Don Garber has said the Pathway Strategy “represents an important step toward a more unified development system in this country.”

Emma Hayes, head coach of USWNT, told The Athletic: “We want to be the most inclusive sport in the U.S. and give players opportunities to have the most fun and enjoy maximum growth, as people and players, regardless of their background or where they live.”

Her men's team counterpart, Mauricio Pochettino, added that he is “so happy to see that U.S. Soccer is taking the right steps forward in this process.”

Plenty will ask where the money will come from to bring the strategy to fruition. Batson said, “Part of this is realizing the soccer market in the U.S. is actually really big. There are already billions of dollars being spent. Taking the existing market and resourcing it more effectively frees up a lot of resources.

“Additionally, there are big untapped dollars from school districts and local governments that today still are spending way more on football than they should be based on participation numbers. There are continued opportunities as Major League Soccer, USL and NWSL grow for this to flow back into youth development.

“Look at the revenue growth of U.S. soccer over the last few years — we've more than doubled in that time period — and have opportunities to continue to grow. There's a lot of money that, if organized, we'll be able to unlock a lot of opportunity.”

As the World Cup edges into view, FIFA received one concession this week from the Donald Trump administration when it was announced that ticket holders for the tournament next summer will be granted expedited visa appointments. This is important due to lengthy wait times for nationals of several countries, such as Colombia, Ecuador and Morocco, who have qualified already for the tournament.

Another plan to reassure fans is to use “FIFA legends” (famous ex-players) to put out videos to their local markets back home to tell supporters the U.S. remains a cuddly and welcoming place to visit.

The Republican congressman Darin LaHood, who attended the Oval Office news conference on Monday in which FIFA president Gianni Infantino and President Trump unveiled the expedited visa appointments plan, recently spoke at the “Going for Gold: America's Tourism Opportunity in the Mega Decade of Sports” conference in Washington, D.C.

While speaking on a panel event, Rep. LaHood, co-chair of the Congressional Soccer Caucus, said, “We have to have a strong welcoming message to the United States — we are going to partner with our FIFA legends in all the countries around the world to have messaging that will go out probably in December or January, welcoming people to the United States for soccer, for sport, for the World Cup. And that will be an important PR, communications mechanism that we're working on in the White House now.”

On Monday, President Trump again reiterated his threats to relocate World Cup games — this time from Los Angeles and Seattle — to other cities he deems to be “safer.” In the same news conference, he also did not rule out launching strikes in World Cup co-hosts Mexico against drug cartels. FIFA president Infantino stood behind him throughout.

While host city executives are by now accustomed to the United States president's broadsides, several, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships, are growing exasperated with FIFA's refusal to stand up for host cities, with Infantino once again deferring to the Trump administration on Monday.

Trump said, “If we think there is going to be a sign of any trouble, I would ask Gianni to move that to a different city. We have a lot of cities who would love to have it and would do it very safely. If we think there is a problem in Seattle, where there is a liberal, communist mayor. I watched her (Katie Wilson) over the weekend, wow, that is another ‘beauty' we have got there. Gianni, can I say we will move the event to some place it will be appreciated and safe?”

Infantino answered: “Safety and security are the No. 1 priority for a successful World Cup. We can see people have trust in the United States because we have record-breaking ticket sales. Tickets are almost two million sold already. People know they will be coming here to experience a safe and secure World Cup. This, of course, is the responsibility of the government and obviously we will discuss, we are working together, we must ensure all fans coming from abroad can experience a celebration of coming together of the sport and with 100 per cent safety.”

Host cities, which are seeking to sell sponsorship packages for fan festivals around the tournament, are hoping for more backing from FIFA, particularly because the governing body's contracts are directly with host cities, rather than the federal government. Some host city executives are even privately questioning why they should bother continuing to invest money into FIFA's events when the sporting body's officials appear so reluctant to defend them publicly, according to people familiar with discussions.

In a recent statement to Sky News, FIFA reiterated that “safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety.”

FIFA declined to comment for this story, but did point to comments made at the Global Citizen Festival in September shortly after Trump first discussed the possibility of relocating games, where Infantino said there are “16 beautiful host cities” across the three countries hosting the World Cup.

The pre-World Cup schedule is reportedly taking shape.

The United States Men's National Team has finished up matches for 2025, and they are reportedly lining up a major slate ahead of the 2026 World Cup. According to a report by The Athletic's Henry Bushnell and Paul Tenorio, U.S. Soccer is finalizing friendlies against Portugal and Belgium in March and Germany in June.

There will be two international windows before the 2026 World Cup begins: March 23-31 and June 1-9. In both of those windows, the USMNT are trying to finalize friendlies against major opponents to help the team with final preparations. It had already been reported that the team was looking to face Portugal and Belgium during the March window, with both matches to take place in Atlanta at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The Athletic reports that now that both teams are in the top 10 in the rankings, they will likely be in the seeded Pot 1 alongside the United States when the World Cup draw takes place on December 5th. That clears the way for the matches to be confirmed.

The June international window will reportedly begin with a match against an opponent to be confirmed after the World Cup draw and will take place in Charlotte. The team would then have their World Cup sendoff match in Chicago against Germany a few days later. The dates have yet to be worked out, but the idea is that the USMNT would play the matches before heading out to California to train for their opening match on June 12th.

The June matches would be played with the roster that will represent the United States at the World Cup. Save for injury concerns, USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino is not expected to bring in additional players for that window. “I think it's difficult when you bring more than 26 [players], and then you need to tell [a player], on the last day, ‘you are out,'” Pochettino said to The Athletic. “I prefer…to bring the 26 that you believe are going to be in the squad, and if something happens, you call someone (else).”

The USMNT will not hold its annual January Camp, as the future plans for that camp have been eliminated in favor of a December Camp, which will be held beginning in December 2026. So, the March international window will be the final one before Mauricio Pochettino names his World Cup squad in May. The likely matches against Portugal and Belgium represent the final two chances players will have to directly impress Pochettino in a national team camp. The real separation will likely be through club play, where players hope to be healthy and playing at a consistently high level. Then, the tests will come before the United States welcomes the world to the biggest World Cup ever.

TAMPA, Fla. — It feels like a lifetime ago, but it was just June 10 that a heavily-rotated U.S. men's national team squad was played off the field against Switzerland.

So when Mauricio Pochettino named a starting lineup for Tuesday night's friendly against Uruguay that featured nine new starters from the team that beat Paraguay three days before, it was understandable why some might have braced for a similar outcome. Uruguay, after all, was probably the most talented team the U.S. had seen since South Korea in September — and was playing some of its most important players.

Advertisement

Instead, the U.S. overwhelmed and steamrolled Uruguay at Raymond James Stadium, scoring three goals in the first 30 minutes en route to a decisive and signature 5-1 victory.

It spoke to the sheer amount of progress Pochettino had made in a short time with this U.S. team, not just in building out depth in the pool, but in building belief within that expanded pool of players. That he could field one team that looked like by far the better side against Paraguay, then change out so many players and get an even more impressive performance was a testament to that progress.

After the game, Pochettino's press conference started with a surprisingly combative and fiery response to a question about what it meant to get such a positive result despite, “a lot of regulars rested.” Pochettino took it as an attack on the identity he was trying to build in the team; the identity that the result in question was meant to reinforce.

“I don't want to be negative, no, but I hate the ‘no regular players' (question). What does this mean? It's (the) USA playing, it's the national team,” he said. “Stop with that mindset. Every time our decision to pick a starting XI, it's the U.S. men's national team playing. If you know me, I hate to talk this way. It's so disrespectful. We need to give credit to all of the guys.”

The focus on that word — ”regulars” — cut to the core of what Pochettino feels he has had to overcome. It has been a theme of his for months now. He has worked to cut the legs out from any sort of complacency or entitlement within the group. And to change the mentality outside of the group, as well. The talk about a “golden generation” had to end.

It was a journey that he said truly started after March's Nations League, when losses to Panama and Canada sent this U.S. team reeling, but one he hopes ends with this team taking its chance and making a dream run to the decisive stages of next summer's World Cup.

The defeats to the pair of Concacaf rivals in March's Nations League felt like a sobering moment for a U.S. team that may have been hoping that changing the coach would be like pushing a fix-it button.

There had been so much hope and optimism around the U.S. team going into the 2024 Copa América only for them to fall in the group stage. After firing Gregg Berhalter and hiring Pochettino, the belief was that things would get back on track immediately.

The problems ran deeper than that. Pochettino felt the focus wasn't there in camp. He could sense contentment and laxity.

“I think that March (was the turning point). I think with all that negativity, (comes) positive things, because with all this negativity we used (it) to build that journey,” Pochettino said. “Sometimes this type of thing can happen, for changing things. Maybe you see things in a different way. Sometimes our perception, sometimes can be wrong. Even being inside. And that I think when the reality touch, I think that's important.”

It was, in other words, a moment for the U.S. team to come back down to reality.

Whatever the U.S. and its players thought they were — it wasn't and they weren't that. If Pochettino was going to change the mentality of the group, he was going to have to manufacture competition that hadn't existed to a high enough degree in the first years of this cycle.

The ensuing months were spent breaking things down and building them back up again.

“I think that was good for us to see the reality,” Pochettino said. “When you really touch the reality, and it's not the reality that you perceive, or you were convinced was different, I think this is a good point to be.”

The revamp started in the Gold Cup camp with players who mostly had everything to prove.

Going into the Gold Cup, the absence of players like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Yunus Musah – “regulars,” if you will, even though Pochettino won't – opened the door for others to step through. Pochettino leaned into the opportunity. He threw the players onto the field and challenged them to prove they belonged.

Even after the Switzerland loss, Pochettino didn't lose faith in the group he believed could deliver an important message: that there was more talent in this U.S. pool than was being given credit. They just needed the chance. While just two players — Mark McKenzie and Sebastian Berhalter — were in the starting lineup for both the Switzerland loss and Uruguay triumph, a number of other players who featured in two big wins this window were a part of that game, against the Swiss, including Max Arfsten, John Tolkin, Diego Luna, Tim Ream and Brenden Aaronson.

Other players, like Malik Tillman, Matt Freese and Alex Freeman turned the Gold Cup — where the U.S. made a run to the final before falling to Mexico — into important jobs with the U.S.

“We know exactly the big group of players that we can rely on,” Pochettino's assistant Jesús Pérez said. “Depending on the circumstances, now it's a matter of state and injuries. But we know (for example), if we call Alex Freeman, what Alex can give us. When we gave him the opportunity, we saw the potential. And now (he is) just getting better for the national team, for his club.”

It was, Pochettino said, simply a matter of providing the platform and the belief.

The results weren't perfect. But the tournament was less about the results and more about building a different mentality within the pool at large: No one's job was secured. Everyone had a chance to book a ticket to the World Cup.

“At the end of the day, the principles of the games are there. … But none of them are going to be right if you are not fully committed,” Pérez said. “Fully committed with no doubts. And that's the basics. So before we talk (about) other things, we [must] feel that we have a group really committed. And if (there) was some noise around those circumstances, I think everything (is now) clear.”

And it was that clarity — that commitment — that Pochettino felt he had to defend after the decisive victory that closed out 2025 on an enormously positive note for this U.S. team.

On Tuesday night, it was some of the new faces that emerged over the last few months that reignited belief that this U.S. team might be capable of making noise at next summer's World Cup.

Berhalter stung a beautiful finish into the upper corner to start the scoring. Freeman netted the next two. Luna added the fourth.

This is what Pochettino aimed for when he built out his Gold Cup roster. Whether it was Pulisic, McKennie and Weah, or Berhalter, Freeman and Luna, Pochettino was convinced the results could be the same. And that the belief in the team should be the same, too. There are no regulars.

In part because of that depth that has been built out, the U.S. is unbeaten in its last five games against FIFA top-40 opponents for the first time since 2013. It feels like a completely different world than it did less than half a year ago.

“It's a testament to the culture that we're building,” McKenzie said. “It shows, again, the faith that Mauricio has in this team and that the collective have in one another. We're building something special. We have a real brotherhood, a band of guys who are going to go out there and not only play with pride to represent our country, but play for the guys next to us.”

It has been a steady drumbeat of positivity around this U.S. team since it downed Japan in September. Players have looked more confident on the field. There seems to be a strong understanding of how they want to play and what the staff is looking for in the team's approach to games. There has also been less concern or talk about intensity or desire. The complacency that Pochettino was combatting is gone.

Two days before taking the field against Uruguay, Pochettino weaponized the idea of “reality” differently. He could sense the confidence building in front of him. In camp, Pochettino contrasted this team to what it looked like in March, calling it the epitome of “professional.” There was no “silly or stupid” things that happened away from the field.

“The focus, the concentration to perform, to train, to do everything that we propose (was there),” he said.

The reality now, he said, is better than what we might even think. And it's forever away from where it was in March. Sensing that change, in a meeting with the team on Sunday, he reintroduced the goals going into the World Cup.

“Let's be realistic,” Pochettino told the team. “And do the impossible.”

It was about reaching for big goals again. To compete against the best. The team's reality could again be linked to its ambition.

With their heads now out of the clouds, and with the results coming and things clicking on and off the field, the focus could start to once again shift toward next summer and the task at hand. This U.S. team has a chance to do something special in the biggest sports event of all time. To do so, it'll have to make a run deep into the knockout phase — to the quarterfinals or semifinals. The type of performance that would galvanize the nation.

“We're starting to feel the World Cup and the excitement,” Pochettino said. “I think it's important for our fans, this type of victory and the result, because I think it's to push them to really believe in the team. We never doubted, because we saw the quality of the players. It was only to trust in them and to give the possibility to find a way to perform, to behave in the way that we feel in football, what it means to be professional. In all the areas I think we need to improve, because we are very ambitious and we want to win. We want to challenge all the teams. … Of course, the World Cup is going to be different, but I think we need to prepare ourselves to be there and to and to really believe in our chance.”

The further this U.S. team goes in the World Cup, the greater the impact on the sport in this country. If it can continue to build the way it has over the last five months, then the influence of this team and the 2026 World Cup could be as transformational as people hope.

The U.S. men's national team schedule for 2026 is taking shape as the FIFA World Cup host nation prepares for the tournament.

Mauricio Pochettino's side are unbeaten in their last five games, ending 2025 on a high note with a 5–1 rout of Uruguay. A formation shift has paid dividends with the team looking more resolute and tactically mature against opponents. The USMNT were offensively and defensively superior to Uruguay despite nine changes to the starting XI. 

The Argentine manager has successfully instilled belief and confidence heading into a World Cup year. They'll learn their group stage opponents on Dec. 5, but the USMNT won't play a match for over four months given there won't be a January camp.

Here's the USMNT's remaining schedule as the World Cup draws closer.

Two of the USMNT's four remaining friendlies will reportedly take place in March at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.

Portugal and Belgium are the proposed opponents, according to The Athletic. Both top 10 FIFA-ranked countries qualified for the World Cup at the end of the November window. Avoiding the European playoffs free them up for the window, though confirmation has yet to be announced.

Both countries would provide stern tests for the USMNT given their pedigree. Portugal recently won the UEFA Nations League while Belgium are consistently a knockout stage side at World Cups—excluding their group stage exit in Qatar.

The Portugal friendly, which has been “signed off” on, would mark the first time Cristiano Ronaldo plays a match on U.S. soil since 2014.

Christian Pulisic and co. will travel to Seattle to play a match at Lumen Field between those two matches. If the USMNT win their group they would stay on the West coast for a match at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, C.A. 

If they finish second, they would go to Arlington, T.X., for a clash at AT&T Stadium. A third place finish and advancement would be contingent on their points total and other group results. The eight best third-place teams advance to the knockout stage.

A fourth place finish would result in elimination.

Cup Countdown



 Rich Storry / Getty Images

Emerging from the locker room following his team's huge 5-1 win over Uruguay Tuesday night in Tampa, Fla., U.S. national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino didn't like the first question at his press conference. He didn't like the second, either.

Both queries were meant to indicate the program's depth. Few – if any – of the consensus “regular starters” actually started.

It's that phrase Pochettino dug his feet in on and didn't give an inch.

“I hate the ‘no regular players' (question),” Pochettino said. “What does this mean? It's USA playing, it's the national team. Stop with that mindset. Every time our decision to pick a starting XI, it's the U.S. men's national team playing.”

Pochettino changed nine players from the XI that started in a win over Paraguay on Saturday. This from a squad that is already missing stalwarts Christian Pulisic, Chris Richards, Tyler Adams, Tim Weah, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, Malik Tillman and more.

In their place, goalscorers Sebastian Berhalter, Alex Freeman (two), Diego Luna and Tanner Tessmann led the way for the USMNT.

“If you know me, I hate to talk this way,” Pochettino said when asked about players missing. “It's so disrespectful. We need to give credit to all of the guys.”

Pochettino consistently preaches fight, competitiveness and togetherness from his teams. He has pushed back hard at the notion that any roster spot is guaranteed at any time. Players need to consistently fight to earn their place on the roster and in the starting XI.

And he has put that methodology into practice by creating internal competition. The USMNT has called up 71 players to camps in this calendar year. By next summer, only 26 can make the final roster for the World Cup. It's a huge pool and competition is a feature, not a bug, under Pochettino.

“I am the USA coach. Tell me which ‘regular players' you are talking about?” Pochettino asked indignantly. “I don't understand.”

What was expected to be a joyful press conference given the match that preceded it quickly went off the rails and never got back on track.

“Maybe we need to stop the press conference, I need to go to the dressing room, come back and start the press conference again,” Pochettino said with a laugh, “because it's like we lost 5-1!”

Soon after, Pochettino was asked if Berhalter's exquisite goal from a free kick – which was rolled short and touched back to Berhalter before he curled it into the top corner – was rehearsed in training or improvised in the moment.

Pochettino threw his hands up and sarcastically – we think – said: “No, it happened by coincidence.”

There were few big breakdowns of individual performances, like Berhalter, who boosted his chances of making the World Cup squad in a hugely competitive midfield pool. His set-piece delivery alone turned heads, with a goal and assist, let alone his box-to-box performance in the run of play.

Nor was there another shout out to Gio Reyna, who came off the bench for 30 minutes to add an assist after scoring against Paraguay in his return to the national team.

Pochettino, perhaps feeling a need to fight for and protect the group as a whole, insisted the day was about the group of players as a collective.

“To be honest, maybe I'm tired and don't understand the English (questions), but I'm very disappointed at the first two questions,” he said.

No matter what questions were asked or performances given, the USMNT has now put together a five-game unbeaten run (4-0-1) since a disastrous performance against South Korea in September.

While the national team won't reconvene for four months, the group departs on a hugely positive note, with strong results fueled by strong performances.

Pulisic, Richards, Adams, Weah, McKennie and Robinson could all feasibly be back in frame by the spring, but the coaches don't want to look at that. They are proud of the present group – the one that delivered in November.

“The credit is all to the players,” Pochettino insisted.

World Cup

JT Batson announced U.S. Soccer's new Pathway Strategy. Kevin C Cox / Getty Images

The United States Soccer Federation is launching a new strategy to try to create more world-class players, win World Cups, reduce the cost for young people to play the game and make soccer the highest participation sport in the country.

In an interview with The Athletic, U.S. Soccer chief executive JT Batson revealed the “Pathway Strategy” has buy-in from key components of the country's soccer ecosystem, including MLS, NWSL, USL, youth soccer organizations, key sponsors and community organizations. While many details and methods are still to be publicly disclosed, he said that early-stage memorandums of understanding have been signed, with timelines and deadlines for actions to come into effect.

Batson said the landmark moment of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, provided impetus for key stakeholders to work together.

He said: “We're all here because we want to win World Cups and we want millions of kids to be able to play soccer. We want people to believe that U.S. Soccer is supporting them in their soccer journey, whether it's a fan, a player, coach or a family member. We know we have more work to do on that on the men's side.

“At the Women's World Cup in New Zealand and Australia, we did not achieve what we wanted (the U.S. women's national team went out in the round of 16). We did the hard work to understand what actually needs to be done, so that we are the No. 1 played sport in the country and so tens of millions of people are in love with our teams.

“We have talked to anyone we could learn from. We did research, we took data, we had thousands of conversations with people within the U.S. and outside the U.S. to understand our environments, opportunities or challenges, and to ultimately put forward a real plan that we think can be successful.

“It is not the one you slap on a bumper sticker. We're committed to doing the long, hard work here.”

The research undertaken by U.S. Soccer included consultations with soccer experts around the world. Batson says the legendary former Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, now in a role as FIFA's chief of global development, “deserves a lot of credit” for the generosity of time and insights provided by him and his team in outlining ideas and practices. The U.S. Soccer sporting director, Matt Crocker, has also brought insights from his extensive time with the English Football Association and Premier League.

The federation has also enlisted the support of the Twenty First Group, a sports intelligence consultancy. They are working to benchmark how many players out of the top 1,000 in the world would, on average, be required in a squad at a World Cup for a team to go to the quarter-finals or beyond in the competition, providing the federation with one method of benchmarking its future talent development.

Batson said the objective is to get U.S. teams, at all levels, into a position to win major tournaments. “On the women's side, we have proven we are there,” he added. “But the rest of the world is not sitting around hanging, so we have to keep pressing. On the men's side, we have ambitions of proving we are there too.”

One of the previous challenges has soccer stakeholders disagreeing about the issues and solutions for the game. Batson says the consensus has moved closer.

“We agree we need to work together,” he said. “We agree we need to make soccer more accessible. We agree we need easy, simple-to-understand pathways for kids to decide what journey they should go on. We agree that we need to get some of the funding and resourcing models right. There's a belief that there needs to be a whole lot more opportunities for kids to play soccer close to home, and local models and regional models that provide an opportunity for kids to play much longer, much easier and much cheaper than what exists today.

“There's buy-in around the U.S. way: a sporting strategy around player-centric development and best practices. Clubs can have different playing styles, but it is about having a core philosophy around how we make sure that every kid is put in a position to be successful.”

Batson warned that the size and geography of the U.S. mean there is no “copy and paste” solution from other countries. The federation has taken learnings from outside of the soccer and sports world to understand how to bring greater agreement and uniformity.

The federation has studied the smoking cessation efforts within the United States, which drastically reduced the number of smokers in the country, as well as public information campaigns that persuaded many people of the risks of driving under the influence of alcohol.

That level of buy-in will be required to smooth access and participation, particularly costs, for children to play soccer in the country. Many current and former U.S. national team players have bemoaned the financial risks taken by their families in pursuit of their soccer dreams.

Batson said, “This is going to be a long-term journey. But for a country as wealthy as we are, with the resources that we have, beyond monetary, these are solvable things. With people in the room, working together, it's possible.

“Our task is to use the big moments of '26, '28 (Olympic Games in Los Angeles) and '31 (bid to host the Women's World Cup) to get governments to invest in fields, to get schools to put soccer in, because it's not just one thing, it's all of the things. You've got this incredible base of strength and support.

“The commercial market of soccer in this country is growing. MLS owners now spend nine figures a year on free-to-play youth soccer opportunities as part of their player development efforts. Ten years ago, that was essentially nothing. That alone is massive. Part of what we will be calling out is how soccer is a more affordable way to impact way more kids than, say, baseball or football, where equipment is way more expensive.”

In 2024, 31.9 million Americans over the age of six participated in basketball versus 17.3 million in baseball, according to the Sports and Fitness Industry Association (SFIA). In football, across flag, tackle, touch and 7-on-7, the combined participation was 18.8 million. Soccer's participation across indoor and outdoor in 2024 was 20.5 million, which is a rise of more than three million since 2019.

The plan has major backing. MLS Commissioner Don Garber has said the Pathway Strategy “represents an important step toward a more unified development system in this country.”

Emma Hayes, head coach of USWNT, told The Athletic: “We want to be the most inclusive sport in the U.S. and give players opportunities to have the most fun and enjoy maximum growth, as people and players, regardless of their background or where they live.”

Her men's team counterpart, Mauricio Pochettino, added that he is “so happy to see that U.S. Soccer is taking the right steps forward in this process.”

Plenty will ask where the money will come from to bring the strategy to fruition. Batson said, “Part of this is realizing the soccer market in the U.S. is actually really big. There are already billions of dollars being spent. Taking the existing market and resourcing it more effectively frees up a lot of resources.

“Additionally, there are big untapped dollars from school districts and local governments that today still are spending way more on football than they should be based on participation numbers. There are continued opportunities as Major League Soccer, USL and NWSL grow for this to flow back into youth development.

“Look at the revenue growth of U.S. soccer over the last few years — we've more than doubled in that time period — and have opportunities to continue to grow. There's a lot of money that, if organized, we'll be able to unlock a lot of opportunity.”

As the World Cup edges into view, FIFA received one concession this week from the Donald Trump administration when it was announced that ticket holders for the tournament next summer will be granted expedited visa appointments. This is important due to lengthy wait times for nationals of several countries, such as Colombia, Ecuador and Morocco, who have qualified already for the tournament.

Another plan to reassure fans is to use “FIFA legends” (famous ex-players) to put out videos to their local markets back home to tell supporters the U.S. remains a cuddly and welcoming place to visit.

The Republican congressman Darin LaHood, who attended the Oval Office news conference on Monday in which FIFA president Gianni Infantino and President Trump unveiled the expedited visa appointments plan, recently spoke at the “Going for Gold: America's Tourism Opportunity in the Mega Decade of Sports” conference in Washington, D.C.

While speaking on a panel event, Rep. LaHood, co-chair of the Congressional Soccer Caucus, said, “We have to have a strong welcoming message to the United States — we are going to partner with our FIFA legends in all the countries around the world to have messaging that will go out probably in December or January, welcoming people to the United States for soccer, for sport, for the World Cup. And that will be an important PR, communications mechanism that we're working on in the White House now.”

On Monday, President Trump again reiterated his threats to relocate World Cup games — this time from Los Angeles and Seattle — to other cities he deems to be “safer.” In the same news conference, he also did not rule out launching strikes in World Cup co-hosts Mexico against drug cartels. FIFA president Infantino stood behind him throughout.

While host city executives are by now accustomed to the United States president's broadsides, several, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships, are growing exasperated with FIFA's refusal to stand up for host cities, with Infantino once again deferring to the Trump administration on Monday.

Trump said, “If we think there is going to be a sign of any trouble, I would ask Gianni to move that to a different city. We have a lot of cities who would love to have it and would do it very safely. If we think there is a problem in Seattle, where there is a liberal, communist mayor. I watched her (Katie Wilson) over the weekend, wow, that is another ‘beauty' we have got there. Gianni, can I say we will move the event to some place it will be appreciated and safe?”

Infantino answered: “Safety and security are the No. 1 priority for a successful World Cup. We can see people have trust in the United States because we have record-breaking ticket sales. Tickets are almost two million sold already. People know they will be coming here to experience a safe and secure World Cup. This, of course, is the responsibility of the government and obviously we will discuss, we are working together, we must ensure all fans coming from abroad can experience a celebration of coming together of the sport and with 100 per cent safety.”

Host cities, which are seeking to sell sponsorship packages for fan festivals around the tournament, are hoping for more backing from FIFA, particularly because the governing body's contracts are directly with host cities, rather than the federal government. Some host city executives are even privately questioning why they should bother continuing to invest money into FIFA's events when the sporting body's officials appear so reluctant to defend them publicly, according to people familiar with discussions.

In a recent statement to Sky News, FIFA reiterated that “safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety.”

FIFA declined to comment for this story, but did point to comments made at the Global Citizen Festival in September shortly after Trump first discussed the possibility of relocating games, where Infantino said there are “16 beautiful host cities” across the three countries hosting the World Cup.

World Cup 2026

Countdown

Mexico after winning the CONCACAF Nations League final in March 2025 Luiza Moraes via Getty Images

The 2026 World Cup, which is taking place in the United States, Canada and Mexico, begins on June 11 next year. It will be the 23rd edition of the tournament and the first with 48 countries competing.

Qualification around the globe is nearing completion and 42 teams have secured their place at the world's biggest sporting event.

The final six places will be determined by the results of the European and inter-confederation play-offs, both of which take place in March. The draw for those play-off games takes place on Thursday, November 20.

Which countries have secured their spot in North America next summer? How many places are awarded to each continental confederation?

Here is The Athletic's guide to the state of play, which will be updated as qualification progresses.

Here are the six confederations — which represent every FIFA-recognised country in the world — and how many places each has been allocated at the tournament:

AFC (Asia): Eight direct places and one team will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs.

CAF (Africa): Nine direct places and one team will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs.

CONCACAF (North America, Central America & Caribbean): Three direct places and two teams will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs. This excludes hosts United States, Canada and Mexico, who all automatically qualified as co-hosts.

CONMEBOL (South America): Six direct places and one team will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs.

OFC (Oceania): One direct place and one team will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs.

UEFA (Europe): Sixteen direct places, with four of them being European play-off winners (16 teams are contesting these play-offs).

The inter-confederation play-offs will involve six teams, and two of them will advance to the World Cup. Oceania's New Caledonia, South America's Bolivia, Africa's DR Congo, Asia's Iraq and North America's Jamaica and Suriname are the sides that will be contesting them. (Suriname is in South America but plays its football in the North American section).

AFC (Asia): The five rounds have been completed. Eight sides have qualified automatically while Iraq will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs.

CAF (Africa): The first round finished in October, with the nine group winners qualifying. Gabon, DR Congo, Cameroon and Nigeria then contested the second round in November, with DR Congo triumphing and thus advancing to the inter-confederation play-offs.

CONCACAF (North America): The three rounds have been completed. Three sides have qualified automatically while Jamaica and Suriname will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs.

CONMEBOL (South America): It has finished, with the 10-team group containing all of the confederation's members now completed. All the sides played each other home and away and the top six sides qualified automatically. Bolivia will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs.

OFC (Oceania): It has finished, with New Zealand qualifying. New Caledonia will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs.

UEFA (Europe): The group stage has been completed and 12 sides have qualified automatically. Sixteen teams will now contest the European play-offs in March, with four of them advancing to the World Cup.

Previous World Cup appearances: 11
Best performance: Third place in 1930
Head coach: Mauricio Pochettino

The United States are hosting the World Cup for the second time — the first was in 1994 — and under former Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino will be desperate to perform well. They qualified automatically as co-hosts.

USMNT haven't got past the round of 16 since 2002 and only once have they reached the semi-finals — in the inaugural competition in 1930 when they were knocked out by Argentina.

Previous World Cup appearances: Two
Best performance: Group stage in 1986 & 2022
Head coach: Jesse Marsch

Advertisement

The Canadians are playing at back-to-back World Cups for the first time and under former Leeds United manager Jesse Marsch will be aiming for a maiden appearance in the knockout stage. They qualified automatically as co-hosts.

Previous World Cup appearances: 17
Best performance: Quarter-finals in 1970 & 1986
Head coach: Javier Aguirre

Mexico are hosting the men's World Cup for a record third time, after previously doing so in 1970 and 1986. Like USMNT and Canada, they qualified automatically.

The Mexicans haven't made the quarter-finals of the tournament since 1986 and were knocked out in the round of 16 at seven World Cups in a row from 1994 to 2018.

However, they are the reigning CONCACAF Gold Cup and CONCACAF Nations League champions and, on paper, they are the strongest of the three host nations.

Previous World Cup appearances: Seven
Best performance: Round of 16 in 2002, 2010, 2018 & 2022
Head coach: Hajime Moriyasu

Japan became the first country, other than the three host nations, to qualify for the World Cup with their 2-0 victory over Bahrain on March 20, 2025. It will be their eighth consecutive appearance at the tournament.

Ayase Ueda was Japan's top scorer in qualifying, with the 27-year-old Feyenoord striker finding the net eight times.

Previous World Cup appearances: Two
Best performance: First group stage in 1982 & Group stage in 2010
Head coach: Darren Bazeley

New Zealand are back at the World Cup for the first time since 2010, where they were eliminated in the group stage after drawing all three of their games.

This is the first World Cup where Oceania is guaranteed a spot at the tournament, and given Australia qualify in the Asian section, it was always likely that New Zealand would be in North America next summer.

The ‘All Whites' breezed through qualifying, winning all three of their group games by an aggregate scoreline of 19-1. They then beat Fiji 7-0 in the semi-finals on March 21 before defeating New Caledonia 3-0 in the final on March 24, 2025 to book their place at the World Cup.

Nottingham Forest's Chris Wood, who played at the 2010 World Cup, was New Zealand's top scorer in qualifying with nine goals.

Previous World Cup appearances: Six
Best performance: First group stage in 1978 & Group stage in 1998, 2006, 2014, 2018 & 2022

Iran reached their fourth World Cup in a row with two games to spare after securing their place in North America with a 2-2 draw against Uzbekistan on March 25, 2025.

Olympiacos' Mehdi Taremi was their top scorer with 10 goals.

The defending champions qualified with ease and will be among the favourites next summer. They secured their place at the tournament on March 25, 2025.

Lionel Messi will be confident of playing at a record-breaking sixth World Cup (Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo is also on five) and perhaps of also becoming the tournament's all-time top scorer — he currently trails Germany's Miroslav Klose by three goals.

As well as their triumph in Qatar in 2022, Argentina won Copa America in 2021 and 2024 — meaning the last major tournament they played in and didn't win was the 2019 edition of South America's continental championship.

Only Brazil (22) and Germany/West Germany (20) have played at more World Cups than Argentina.

Uzbekistan became the first team who had never played at the World Cup before to qualify for the 2026 edition with their draw against United Arab Emirates on June 5, 2025.

As well as being the first double-landlocked country to ever reach the World Cup, they are also just the second former Soviet Republic (excluding Russia) to do so; after Ukraine in 2006.



Manchester City defender Abdukodir Khusanov is their star player and though he has played at the back so far in qualifying it would not be a surprise to see him operating higher up the pitch at the tournament next summer.

South Korea have now reached every World Cup from 1986 onwards, with their surprise run to the semi-finals as co-hosts in 2002 the only time they have gone beyond the round of 16 in this time.

Son Heung-min is closing in on the all-time goals record for South Korea and even though he will be almost 34 when the tournament starts, a lot of the Asian nation's hopes will rest on his shoulders. He scored 10 goals in qualifying.

South Korea were knocked out in the round of 16 by Brazil at the 2022 World Cup and will be hoping to improve on this in the United States, Canada and Mexico after qualifying on June 5, 2025 with a game to spare.

After a mixed qualification campaign, the five-time champions secured their place at the tournament with a 1-0 win over Paraguay on June 10, 2025.

The latter of those tournaments was a straight knockout competition and the round of 16 was the first round, hence the country's best performance being listed above as a tie between all three of the editions they have played at.

After Mauricio Pochettino's makeshift United States men's national team beat Uruguay 5-1 in their final fixture of 2025 on Tuesday night, this much is clear: No one's spot on the 2026 World Cup roster should feel secure, not even for those Americans playing for some of the world's most famous European clubs.

With only one more international window to go before the 2025-2026 European club season ends, it may be more important than ever for every player with World Cup hopes to earn regular minutes and make contributions at the club level.

However, that doesn't describe everyone in the current USMNT player pool, including several names who were expected to be cornerstones of the 2026 squad when Pochettino took over just over a year ago.

Here are five USMNT players who desperately need to play more minutes for their club sides to lock down a spot on the final tournament squad.

Reyna was excellent during his 104 minutes across two November matches for Pochettino, scoring one goal, assisting another, and setting up a third.

The problem is that it's nearly equal to his total workload so far during the German Bundesliga campaign with Borussia Mönchengladbach. 

A thigh injury interrupted Reyna's acclimation to his new club after his long-awaited departure from Borussia Dortmund. And while it's clear he can contribute at the international level, he needs to prove his durability.

The World Cup is a lot different from an international window, with the U.S. facing as many as eight matches between June 12 and July 19 if it can make a run to the semifinals as a host nation.

Reyna, 23, hasn't played a World Cup-worth of minutes during a single club season since his age-17 campaign at Dortmund in 2020-2021.

At his best, Robinson is arguably the first name on the USMNT team sheet and one of the world's elite left-backs, a position that carries a premium.

However, the 28-year-old is struggling to regain full fitness after surgery to repair his quadriceps tendon in May. After briefly returning to the pitch, he hasn't played a competitive fixture for Fulham since late September.

Additionally, because Pochettino has switched to playing primarily in a 3-4-3 formation this fall, it may be riskier to wait until June to reintroduce Robinson than it would have been had the U.S. coach kept playing a back-four system.

Robinson has rarely played as a left wing-back for his Premier League club, and the overwhelming majority of his international experience for the USA has also been in a back four.

If he can get back into match fitness, he may have more equity built than anyone else in the program, even Christian Pulisic. But that's looking like a bigger ""if"" with each passing week.

This was always the concern when Cardoso made his big move from Real Betis to Atlético Madrid over the summer. 

While Betis had a phenomenal season in 2024-25, no one can blame the 23-year-old for wanting to join a club that regularly contends for La Liga titles and UEFA Champions League places.

However, the 24-year-old's international performances were generally underwhelming relative to his efforts in La Liga and the UEFA Europa Conference League last year.

And now, after recovering from an ankle sprain early in his first campaign for Atleti, he's been supplanted by veteran captain Koke in his box-to-box midfield role.

At this point, it feels like Cardoso needs a pretty dramatic turn in his club's fortunes to climb back into Pochettino's consideration.

But Koke is 33, and it's a grueling season for Champions League sides, more so than ever with the new format. Things can still change quickly and unexpectedly.

With Weston McKennie spared from Pochettino's November roster and Tyler Adams forced to withdraw with an injury, this felt like a camp where Musah could have earned his way back into Pochettino's good graces.

The call didn't come, though, with the versatile central midfielder still not seeing starting minutes while on loan at Atalanta in Serie A, and having declined an invite to participate with the USMNT at the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup to recover from the previous season.

Musah probably wishes he could get a do-over on that choice. Now, Cristian Roldan's reemergence has made him less essential, even though most think the AC Milan player has a much higher ceiling.

More than anyone else on this list presently, Musah now needs to prove himself capable of approaching that upper limit by winning a more integral role on the club level. He needs to do it soon.

No one's stock has risen more this year than Freeman, who opened his international goal-scoring account with a first-half brace on Tuesday. But the defender faces a potentially pivotal winter for both his club and international futures.

While the 21-year-old became one of coach Oscar Pareja's most reliable players for Orlando City this season, he's well underpaid on his current rookie contract and has yet to agree to a new MLS deal. 

The Lions are also already eliminated from the MLS Cup playoffs, and credible rumors of European interest are circulating. 

You can understand why Freeman might want to take advantage of his rocketing USMNT stock now, similar to how Patrick Agyemang parlayed his into a giant pay raise at Derby County.

However, finding immediate minutes after joining a new club during the winter window can be a daunting task even for seasoned veterans. And if he doesn't, it's certainly the kind of thing that could interrupt the meteoric rise of a player who has only played one full first-division season.

All you need to know about the various World Cup ticketing options that are available

With 42 of the 48 FIFA World Cup 2026 places filled, fans' thoughts are now turning to how they are going to follow their team during their quest for footballing glory in the Americas next summer. 

In total, over six million tickets are on offer for the 104 tournament games. While some of the early sales phases have already passed, there are plenty more opportunities to get your hands on highly-sought after World Cup tickets.

Unsurprisingly, ticket demand is going to be red hot the closer we get to the biggest tournament in sports, which is being hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada and gets underway on June 11. With dynamic pricing in use by FIFA, ticket prices are expected to fluctuate over the coming months.

Let GOAL take you through all the latest World Cup 2026 ticket information, including how dynamic pricing works, where you can buy tickets, how much they cost, and much, much more.

Book World Cup 2026 tickets from $182Buy tickets

FIFA will be using dynamic pricing during World Cup 2026 ticket sales. Dynamic pricing is a system where ticket prices are adjusted in real-time based on supply and demand, similar to airline or hotel pricing. It means seats will tend to vary in price match-to-match. 

The goal of dynamic pricing is to give fans fair and safe access to tickets, that are as close to market value as possible.

As the system is based on demand, the price of tickets does not always increase. We saw this with the FIFA Club World Cup earlier this year, where tickets for some of the knockout games, including the semi-final between Chelsea and Fluminense, were available from as low as $13.

Supporters have many opportunities to purchase World Cup 2026 tickets, via the FIFA website, between now and the big kick-off in June. There are various sales phases, which differ in terms of purchasing processes, payment methods and ticket products.

To buy tickets, you must visit the official FIFA ticketing portal and register for an account. You can then log in to your FIFA account and check out ticket availability.

If you are looking for an official and secure way to resell/exchange your FIFA World Cup 26 tickets, the FIFA Resale/Exchange Marketplace is the official channel for doing so. The Marketplace opened on October 2 and be accessed via FIFA.com/tickets.

The FIFA Resale Marketplace is available to Canadian, American and international residents, while the FIFA Exchange Marketplace (Mercado de Intercambio de la FIFA) is intended for residents of Mexico.

One key point for resale buyers: availability can be very limited, and tickets may appear sporadically, often closer to matchdays. Fans hoping to secure resale tickets should check the platform frequently, act quickly when tickets appear, and have payment details ready in advance.

Secondary marketplaces, such as StubHub, will also have available World Cup 2026 tickets, typically with prices that widely range, especially for bigger matches.

If you're wondering how much World Cup tickets can cost, there's a big range that you'll have to be prepared for when purchasing. 

FIFA previously announced that with dynamic pricing in place, tickets can start as low as $60 for early group-stage matches, but may rise to as high as $6,730 for the Final. Prices are likely to fluctuate throughout the various ticket releases/sales phases. Estimates are shown below:

On resale sites such as StubHub, fans can secure FIFA World Cup 2026 match tickets from $163 upwards.

Tickets will be available for each of the 104 FIFA World Cup 2026 matches during the various sales phases and are categorized as follows:

As well as being able to purchase individual seats at each of the World Cup 2026 matches, ticket packages are also available via the ticket portal on the FIFA site, as follows:

Private Suites and Platinum Access are also available for corporate or VIP groups looking for the most exclusive options.

Supporters have many opportunities to purchase World Cup 2026 tickets, via the FIFA website, between now and the big kick-off in June. The various sales phases, shown below, differ in terms of purchasing processes, payment methods and ticket products.

This was considered the first opportunity to purchase World Cup 2026 tickets and ran from September 10-19. It was only open to those fans who had qualifying Visa cards.

The entry period for the second phase took place between October 27-31. Like the first phase, it involved an application process followed by a randomized selection. Successful applicants received a designated time slot to purchase tickets, which commenced on November 17. Shortly before then, there was a prioritized slot (November 12-15) for residents of the three host nations (the United States, Canada, and Mexico), which allowed them early access to buy tickets for games held in their own countries.

Following the FIFA World Cup 2026 draw on December 5, the next phase of ticket sales commences. During this phase, fans will be able to submit applications for specific matches once the group-stage matchups have been revealed.

Closer to the tournament (Spring 2026), fans will be able to purchase any remaining tickets on a first come, first-served basis. FIFA hasn't said how many tickets will be released or for which games, but you can expect limited availability and quick sellouts.

To purchase tickets, you must visit the official FIFA ticketing portal and register for an account. You can then log in to your FIFA account and check out ticket availability.

The FIFA World Cup 2026 will take place from June 11 to July 19 2026, spanning 16 host cities in Canada, Mexico and the United States. 104 matches will be played over 34 days across North America. For the first time, the tournament will feature 48 teams and be jointly hosted by three nations. The host cities for the FIFA World Cup 2026 are as follows:

Third-party resellers, such as StubHub, will also have available World Cup 2026 tickets, typically with prices that widely range, especially for bigger matches.

No, tickets will not be available for purchase at the stadiums during the FIFA World Cup 26. There will be no over-the-counter ticket sales. FIFA.com/tickets is the official portal for purchasing tickets. 

The World Cup 2026 finals draw will take place at 12pm ET on Friday, December 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.

The 48 teams will be divided into four pots of 12. Pot 1 will consist of the three hosts and the top nine teams in the FIFA World Rankings not including the hosts. Pots 2, 3, and 4 will consist of the remaining teams according to the world rankings. The 12 groups will randomly be formed by selecting one team from each of the four pots. Two teams from the same confederation cannot be placed into the same group, with the exception of UEFA teams, where up to two teams can be in the same group.

The three host nations have been pre-allocated to three groups for scheduling purposes. Mexico has been placed in Group A and will play the opening match of the tournament on June 11. Canada and the United States have been placed in Groups B and D, respectively. They will play the third and fourth matches of the tournament, which both take place on June 12.

The four winners of the UEFA playoffs and the two winners of the inter-confederation playoffs will not be known at the time of the draw, as these matches are scheduled to take place in March 2026.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

JUMP TO:

Qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup is into its final stages.

At the end of the November international break, the identity of 42 of the 48 finalists for the expanded international football showpiece will be known.

The remaining six spots will be filled by the UEFA and inter-confederation playoffs in March.

Argentina will defend their title after Lionel Messi completed his long and occasionally tortuous path to glory at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. La Albiceleste have since retained their Copa America title and finished top of the notoriously gruelling CONMEBOL qualifying section.

Here's everything you need to know about World Cup qualification, who has made it to the finals and how many teams from each continent will take part.

Each confederation has more slots available under the expanded format. The AFC has double the qualification spots it had at Qatar 2022, up from four guaranteed places to eight, while there will be nine African nations instead of five.

CONCACAF will have at least double its 2022 representatives, up from three to six, although half of those slots are accounted for by the United States, Mexico and Canada qualifying automatically as hosts. As was the case at the previous World Cup, two slots will be decided via an inter-continental playoff.

Of note, Uzbekistan and Jordan both qualified for their first-ever World Cup appearances in the summer of 2025. By finishing top two in their group in the third round of AFC qualification, they secured an automatic bid to the competition.

Following them shortly after was Cape Verde, as the tiny island nation of just 600,000 people earned their first-ever World Cup spot by winning their group ahead of Cameroon. Beating that in November was Curacao, who became the smallest-ever nation to qualify for a World Cup with their population of 150,000.

The AFC began its crucial third round of qualification in September 2024. Eighteen teams were split across three six-team groups to contest 10 games in a round-robin format. The top two in each of Groups A, B and C qualified automatically for the World Cup.

The teams placed third and fourth in each group advanced to a fourth round split between two groups of three. Those groups were played out during the October international break, with Qatar and Saudi Arabia - the previous and next World Cup hosts - going through to the finals.

Runners-up the United Arab Emirates and Iraq played a two-legged tie in November to decide the AFC representative at the inter-confederation playoff. Iraq prevailed 3-2 on aggregate.

Nine groups of six teams played each other home and away in Africa. The winner of each section at the end of the 10 games progressed directly to the World Cup.

The four best runners-up from the initial round-robin phase entered into a playoff. DR Congo prevailed to with the playoff on penalties against Nigeria, moving them into March's inter-confederation round.

CONCACAF began the second round of its qualification phase in June 2024, with 30 teams drawn into six groups of five. Each team played every opponent in their group once, with two away games and two home games once the phase concluded in June 2025.

The top two in each group advanced to the 12-team third round, where there were three groups of four. Beginning in September 2025, the nations in each group played one another home and away. The three group winners advance to the World Cup, with the two best-ranked runners-up going into the inter-confederation playoff.

South America retained its celebrated marathon World Cup qualification round, with all 10 of the confederation's countries playing one another home and away in a gruelling league format. 

The expanded World Cup means qualification is a little easier, with the top six advancing automatically. Seventh-placed Bolivia will attempt to return to the World Cup for the first time since USA '94 in the inter-confederation playoff.

Argentina clinched their place at the finals thanks to a memorable 4-1 demolition of arch rivals Brazil. The Selecao ended the campaign in fifth spot, one of four teams to finish the campaign on 28 points.

The 2026 World Cup is the first time the OFC has been guaranteed a representative at the finals. The second round, running across October and November 2024, saw two groups of four playing for the four spots in round three.

The top two in each round-two group advanced to a three-match playoff in March 2025. New Caledonia defeated Tahiti in the first semifinal, with New Zealand thrashing Fiji 7-0 in the other.

New Zealand then claimed the automatic qualifying place by winning the OFC final 3-0. New Caledonia will enter the inter-confederation playoffs, so they have another chance to get there, albeit a slim one.

Twelve of UEFA's 16 spots were taken by the group winners from the initial format of four or five-team groups. The 12 runners-up, along with the four best UEFA Nations League group winners that finished outside of the top two in their World Cup qualifying groups, enter the playoffs.

Those 16 teams were drawn into four paths with two single-game rounds. The seeded teams will be at home in the semifinals, with a home nation for the four finals drawn in advance. The winners from each path advance to the World Cup. UEFA is the only confederation without a representative in the inter-continental playoff.

The full draw and brackets for the UEFA playoffs are detailed here.

The two teams in the six-nation playoff with the highest FIFA ranking are seeded. The four unseeded teams play an effective semifinal, with the two winners progressing to face a seed apiece to decide the final two places at the World Cup.

The four-game playoff will be used as a World Cup test event and played in two venues in Mexico.

The full draw and brackets for the intercontinenal playoffs are detailed here.

Intercontinental Playoff participants

The 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off on June 11, with co-hosts Mexico in action at the Azteca, which hosted the 1970 and 1986 World Cup finals.

It's set to be a jaw-dropping finish to the World Cup 2026 party and you could be there

Who can forget the FIFA World Cup 2022 Final? Definitely not the lucky 88,966 fans who crammed into the Lusail Stadium in Qatar. Those who are booking tickets to the World Cup 2026 Final in New Jersey on July 19, will be hoping for another edge-of-your-seat curtain-closer.

The biggest sporting event in the world is returning to North America for the first time since the United States staged the tournament back in 1994. A South American nation reigned supreme then, too, though it was Brazil who took the honours on that occasion. 

There hasn't been a bigger attendance at a World Cup Final since 1994. Although Canada and Mexico are co-hosting with the United States this time around, the showpiece event, the final, will take place at the impressive MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. 

Demand will obviously be stratospheric, but you shouldn't give up hope just yet. Let GOAL take you through all the latest World Cup 2026 ticket information, including how to get your hands on a Final ticket, how much it will cost, and much, much more.

Book World Cup 2026 Final ticketsBuy tickets

Supporters have many opportunities to purchase World Cup 2026 final tickets via the ticket portal on the FIFA site, between now and the big day next July. 

The various sales phases, shown below, differ in terms of purchasing processes, payment methods, and ticket products.

This was considered the first opportunity to purchase World Cup 2026 tickets and ran from September 10-19. It was only open to those fans who had qualifying Visa cards.

The entry period for the second phase took place between October 27-31. Like the first phase, it involved an application process followed by a randomized selection. 

Successful applicants received a designated time slot to purchase tickets, which commenced on November 17. 

Shortly before then, there was a prioritized slot (November 12-15) for residents of the three host nations (the United States, Canada, and Mexico), which allowed them early access to buy tickets.

Following the FIFA World Cup 2026 draw on December 5, the next phase of ticket sales commences. During this phase, fans will be able to submit further applications.

Closer to the tournament (Spring 2026), fans will be able to purchase any remaining tickets on a first-come, first-served basis. 

FIFA hasn't said how many tickets will be released, but you can expect limited availability and quick sellouts.

To purchase tickets, you must visit the official FIFA ticketing portal and register for an account. You can then log in to your FIFA account and check out ticket availability.

If you are looking for an official and secure way to resell/exchange your FIFA World Cup 26 tickets, the FIFA Resale/Exchange Marketplace is the official channel for doing so. The Marketplace opened on October 2 and be accessed via FIFA.com/tickets.

The FIFA Resale Marketplace is available to Canadian, American and international residents, while the FIFA Exchange Marketplace (Mercado de Intercambio de la FIFA) is intended for residents of Mexico.

One key point for resale buyers: availability can be very limited, and tickets may appear sporadically. Fans hoping to secure resale tickets should check the platform frequently, act quickly when tickets appear, and have payment details ready in advance.

Secondary marketplaces such as StubHub, will also have World Cup 2026 final ticket availability. Ticket prices on secondary platforms are subject to availability and demand.

Book World Cup 2026 Final ticketsBuy tickets

FIFA previously announced that with dynamic pricing in place, tickets may rise to as high as $6,730 for the Final. 

Prices are likely to fluctuate throughout the various ticket releases/sales phases though and estimates for the MetLife Stadium showdown may range from $2,030 - $7,875.

Ticket prices for the World Cup 2026 Final vary by seating category as follows:

On secondary sites such as StubHub, fans can secure FIFA World Cup 2026 match tickets from $5,605 upwards.

MetLife Stadium is a multi-purpose venue at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which is 5 miles west of New York City. 

The stadium opened in 2010, replacing Giants Stadium, and serves as the regular home for the New York Giants and New York Jets of NFL fame.

MetLife Stadium is well versed in hosting football/soccer matches, having staged games during various tournaments in the past, including the CONCACAF Gold Cup (2011 & 2015) and Copa America (2024). 

It prepared for staging the FIFA World Cup 2026 Final, by holding the FIFA Club World Cup Final earlier this year, with Chelsea taking on Paris Saint-Germain in front of a crowd of 81,118.

Third-party resellers, such as StubHub, will also have available World Cup 2026 tickets, typically with prices that widely range, especially for bigger matches.

The World Cup 2026 finals draw will take place at 12pm ET on Friday, December 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.

The 48 teams will be divided into four pots of 12. Pot 1 will consist of the three hosts and the top nine teams in the FIFA World Rankings not including the hosts. Pots 2, 3, and 4 will consist of the remaining teams according to the world rankings. The 12 groups will randomly be formed by selecting one team from each of the four pots. Two teams from the same confederation cannot be placed into the same group, with the exception of UEFA teams, where up to two teams can be in the same group.

The three host nations have been pre-allocated to three groups for scheduling purposes. Mexico has been placed in Group A and will play the opening match of the tournament on June 11. Canada and the United States have been placed in Groups B and D, respectively. They will play the third and fourth matches of the tournament, which both take place on June 12.

The four winners of the UEFA playoffs and the two winners of the inter-confederation playoffs will not be known at the time of the draw, as these matches are scheduled to take place in March 2026.

Securing seats at FIFA World Cup matches can be difficult with millions of fans desperate to get their hands on tickets. This is where FIFA's Right-To-Buy (RTB) option can come in handy. An RTB is an official FIFA allocation for FIFA Collect users that secures them an opportunity to purchase a ticket to a FIFA World Cup 26 match.

Think of an RTB token as a paid reservation. You're not buying the ticket itself. You're buying the right to buy that ticket at full price during a dedicated window, meaning no lottery, no virtual queues, no guessing games. If you hold an RTB token and act within your purchase window, you're guaranteed to get tickets.

Users enter FIFA Collect (collect.fifa.com) and buy packs of collectibles with RTB opportunities included. RTB owners have been able to pay and receive their FIFA World Cup 26 tickets during the Conversion Window which opened on November 13.

FIFA will be using dynamic pricing during World Cup 2026 ticket sales. Dynamic pricing is a system where ticket prices are adjusted in real-time based on supply and demand, similar to airline or hotel pricing. It means seats will tend to vary in price match-to-match. The goal of dynamic pricing is to give fans fair and safe access to tickets, that are as close to market value as possible.

As the system is based on demand, the price of tickets does not always increase. We saw this with the FIFA Club World Cup earlier this year, where tickets for some of the knockout games, including the semi-final between Chelsea and Fluminense, were available from as low as $13.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Gab Marcotti and Mark Ogden discuss the World Cup playoff draw which sees Wales at home to Bosnia & Herzegovina and Northern Ireland travel to Italy. (2:41)

The 2026 FIFA men's World Cup kicks off in just 203 days, but six qualification slots are still up for grabs via the Intercontinental and European playoffs.

Two teams will book a place at the event (to be played in the U.S., Mexico and Canada) via the playoffs, which will be staged in Mexico in March, while 16 European nations, including four-time World Cup winners Italy, are set to battle it out for the final four UEFA qualification berths. The path to the World Cup is now clear for the 22 nations still dreaming of a place at the finals next summer.

Following a draw at FIFA HQ in Zurich on Thursday, the playoffs are now locked in, so which teams can start to plan for North America and who has a nightmare route to football's biggest tournament?

With the ties now confirmed, here are ESPN's predictions.

The final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs.

- Best stories, celebrations from wild World Cup qualifying
- World Cup seeds set with new FIFA rankings release

The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UEFA Nations League who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams will be divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the Nations League group winners assigned to Pot 4 and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup.

Semifinals to be played on March 26; finals to be played on March 31

Semifinal 1, Italy vs. Northern Ireland: The playoff nightmare returns for Italy following elimination at this stage ahead of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, but they will be happy with a home draw against Northern Ireland in the semifinal.

Michael O'Neill's team are huge outsiders, and despite finishing second in their qualifying group behind Norway, Italy should be too strong and more than capable of erasing memories of failures to beat Sweden (2018) and North Macedonia (2022) at home in their last playoff campaigns.

Winner: Italy

Semifinal 2, Wales vs. Bosnia-Herzegovina: Wales coach Craig Bellamy made huge importance of beating North Macedonia in Cardiff in their final group game because that would guarantee a home semifinal, and that advantage should swing the tie in their favor. The Welsh have a formidable record at the Cardiff City Stadium, playing in front of what has been billed as a ""Red Wall"" of passionate supporters; Bellamy's team should win this game to seal another home tie against Italy in the final.

Winner: Wales

Final, Wales vs. Italy: Despite being the highest-ranked nation in the playoffs, sitting 12th in the FIFA Rankings, Italy lack a proven goal scorer, and they struggle to break opponents down.

If key men Sandro Tonali and Giacomo Raspadori are fit and in form, Italy should have enough to shade this tie, but Wales are strong at home, and if these two meet in the final, don't be surprised if Wales inflict yet another playoff heartbreak on the Azzurri.

Prediction: Wales advances

Semifinal 1, Ukraine vs. Sweden: While Ukraine have home advantage, the ongoing conflict in the country means Sergiy Rebrov's team will likely play this tie in neutral Poland, and that could tilt the game in Sweden's favor.

Sweden were dismal in qualification, finishing at the bottom of Group B without a win in six games, but their Nations League success last year sealed a playoff spot, and star forwards Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyökeres will surely see this as a second chance to qualify that they cannot pass up. Sweden are hugely fortunate to be in the playoffs, but they will be too strong for Ukraine.

Winner: Sweden

Semifinal 2, Poland vs. Albania: Poland have become the team that always qualifies for major tournaments but fails to deliver once on the big stage. But this is a tough tie.

Albania, coached by former Barcelona and Brazil defender Sylvinho, are a well-organized, high-energy team, and they will be confident in beating Poland away from home. At 37, this will be Robert Lewandowski's final World Cup campaign. If the Barcelona forward is on form, Poland will win. If not, back Albania.

Winner: Albania

Final, Sweden vs. Albania: Albania are good enough to cause any opponent problems and could quite easily travel to Sweden and win. But if Sweden overcome Ukraine and seal a home game in the final, it would be tough to deny a team with the attacking qualities of Isak, Gyokeres and Anthony Elanga.

Sweden, now coached by Graham Potter, really shouldn't have this opportunity to reach the World Cup, but they are the strongest squad in Path B, so they will qualify.

Prediction: Sweden advances

Semifinal 1, Turkey vs. Romania: Turkey showed their strength by earning a 2-2 draw against Spain in Seville in their final Group E game, a result that restored some pride after a 6-0 home defeat against the European champions in September. Having scored 12 goals in three games against Bulgaria (twice) and Georgia in between the Spain fixtures, Turkey are clearly an attacking force and loaded with top talent, including Arda Güler, Kenan Yildiz, Deniz Gül and midfielder Hakan Çalhanoglu.

Romania, coached by the 80-year-old Mircea Lucescu, are unpredictable but talented. They will be brave and confident in this game, but Turkey should be too strong.

Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).

Winner: Turkey

Semifinal 2, Slovakia vs. Kosovo: Kosovo are the most dangerous outsiders in the European playoffs and much stronger than their FIFA ranking of 80th would suggest. Franco Foda's team lack big names, but their players are based throughout Europe, and Kosovo ran Switzerland close in Group B, beating Sweden home and away before being held at home by the Swiss in the final game.

Slovakia shocked Germany with a 2-0 home win in qualification before losing 6-0 to Julian Nagelsmann's side in Leipzig in the final game. Slovakia are ranked higher (45th) by FIFA, but Kosovo are a better team right now.

Winner: Kosovo

Final, Kosovo vs. Turkey: On paper, Turkey are big favorites to make it through Path C to the finals, but home advantage could be decisive for Kosovo if they eliminate Slovakia.

Having only become a FIFA member in 2015, following a declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, the national fervor for home games in Pristina makes Kosovo a formidable opponent for Turkey. This could be a game in which Turkey's superior talent and depth counts for little against a Kosovo team determined to make history by qualifying for a first World Cup.

Prediction: Kosovo advances 

Mark Ogden backs the Republic of Ireland to make it through the playoffs and end their 24-year World Cup drought.

Semifinal 1, Denmark vs. North Macedonia: Denmark threw away an automatic qualification spot by drawing at home to Belarus and then losing away to Scotland in their final two games having been in control of Group C, so their status as favorites in this tie should be tempered by the scars of their group-stage failure.

North Macedonia's 7-1 defeat away to Wales in their final game should not be taken as a true gauge of their capabilities, though. Blagoja Milevski's team drew home and away with group winners Belgium and they will relish their underdog status, just as they did when eliminating Italy with a 1-0 win in Palermo in the 2018 playoffs. Denmark should be too strong at home, but North Macedonia are primed to record another shocking result.

Winner: North Macedonia

Semifinal 2, Czechia vs. Republic of Ireland: The Czechs were locked in a surprise battle with the Faroe Islands for the runners-up spot in Group L and almost blew it with a 2-1 defeat away to the perennial minnows in Tórshavn in October. But Jaroslav Kostl's squad, which includes West Ham's Tomás Soucek and Bayer Leverkusen forward Patrik Schick, held their nerve to seal second position behind Croatia.

Ireland came from nowhere to claim a playoff place, though, with a shocking 2-0 home win against Portugal before Troy Parrott's hat trick in Budapest, including a 96th-minute winner, denied Hungary and claimed second spot for Heimir Hallgrimsson's team. Ireland have momentum and belief, so they can win this tie and book a home final in Dublin.

Winner: Republic of Ireland

Final, North Macedonia vs. Republic of Ireland: Home advantage in a game to decide a place in the World Cup will be crucial, and Ireland, backed by a crowd of 52,000 in Dublin, might just have enough to make it the World Cup.

North Macedonia are more individually talented, and the same applies to Denmark if they make the final, but Ireland coach Hallgrimsson made his name guiding Iceland to a series of shocking wins, and he can do it again if key players Troy Parrott, Caoimhin Kelleher and Evan Ferguson are fit and in form in March.

Prediction: Republic of Ireland advances 

The playoffs, to be held in March, will determine the final two qualifiers. Six countries will take part. Each of the five confederations (apart from UEFA) will provide one country, while the host confederation (Concacaf) receives a second slot.

The two nations with the best FIFA world ranking will be seeded and go straight into one of the two finals. The four other countries will be drawn to play a semifinal, feeding through to play a seed for one of the two places at the World Cup.

Steve McClaren quits his job as Jamaica boss after their failure to directly qualify for the FIFA World Cup.

Congo DR await the winners of the New Caledonia vs. Jamaica semifinal, and it would be a huge upset if Jamaica fail to book a final clash against the African nation.

New Caledonia are the lowest-ranked team in the playoffs, sitting at 149th in the FIFA rankings, and coach Johann Sidaner told ESPN last month that his team, from an archipelago in the South Pacific, have a ""1 percent chance"" of qualifying for the World Cup.

Jamaica blew their chance of automatic qualification with a 0-0 draw at home to Curacao in the final round of Concacaf qualifiers, and that result forced coach Steve McClaren to quit. Jamaica will be too strong for New Caledonia, and they will face Congo DR as underdogs.

Congo DR have Premier League experience in Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Arthur Masuaku and Axel Tuanzebe, but Jamaica can also rely on Brentford's Rico Henry and Ethan Pinnock. This tie is a close call, but Congo DR look to have just a little bit more quality and will claim the qualification spot.

Prediction: Congo DR advances 

Iraq won a two-legged Asian playoff against United Arab Emirates to clinch their place in the Intercontinental playoffs -- their winning goal was a penalty 17 minutes into stoppage time.

Due to their FIFA ranking of 58th, Iraq are seeded through to the final, where they will expect to face Bolivia. Coached by former Australia coach Graham Arnold, Iraq's squad are largely based in the Middle East, but former Manchester United youngster Zidane Iqbal, now at FC Utrecht, is a player with European experience.

Suriname, ranked 123rd, have a squad of players based in Europe, but while Bolivia's squad is largely drawn from South American leagues, they have a recent win against Brazil on their form guide, so they should be too strong for Suriname. If Bolivia face Iraq in the final, it will be tough to call, but their experience of playing at altitude could be crucial in Mexico, and it should give them the edge.

 Minister of Sports and Recreation, Kofi Adams

The Minister of Sports and Recreation, Kofi Adams believes that the FIFA World Cup can be stagged in West Africa.

According to Kofi Adams who praised FIFA's approach of allowing countries to co-host the expanded World Cup, this new format reduces the significant financial burden on the host nations.

He commended Morocco's bid of co-hosting with Spain and Portugal for the 2030 edition while stating that West African countries can also do same to bring the Mundial closer to home.

Watch how injured Achraf Hakimi received CAF Best Player award

Kofi Adams mentioned Ghana, Nigeria and Ivory Coast can also come together like their peers in other parts of the world to host the biggest sporting event on the planet.

""Previous World Cups that we have participated in were hosted by single country and this is the first time three countries are going to host the tournament. And it looks like FIFA is adapting this style because Morocco, Portugal and Spain are also going to host the 2030 edition."" 

""2034 is also adapting the same style. So maybe the next one will be Ghana, Nigeria and Ivory Coast coming together to host the World Cup and will be good. We together with Nigeria and Ivory Coast who have already invested heavily in infrastructure because they hosted an AFCON recently can also ask for that right,"" Kofi Adams.

BySuzanne Rowan Kelleher,

Forbes Staff.

U.S. tourism is expecting a World Cup boon in 2026—but President Donald Trump's repeated threats to pull games from Democrat-run cities is adding uncertainty for travelers and the economy.

The U.S. tourism industry is counting on the World Cup for a much-needed revenue boost in 2026, following a marked decline of international visitors in 2025.

During an Oval Office press conference Monday, Trump repeated threats to have the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) pull games from Democratic-run cities slated to host World Cup games next summer, saying the governors and mayors “are going to have to behave.”

Trump targeted Seattle's newly elected democratic socialist mayor, asking FIFA president Gianni Infantino, “How close are you going to be watching that city with the crime in the city?”

Seattle Sports Commission president and CEO Beth Knox said the city is “confident the matches will proceed in Seattle as planned” in a statement to The Seattle Times on Wednesday.

The 16 North American host cities—11 in the US, three in Mexico and two in Canada—are contracted with FIFA and are selling sponsorship packages.

As of Wednesday, two of the 12 countries on Trump's travel ban list—Iran and Haiti—have already qualified for the World Cup and one more—the Republic of the Congo—could yet qualify, leaving fans prohibited from traveling to the US to watch their teams.

The World Cup is projected to drive $30.5 billion in economic output and create 185,000 jobs in the U.S. next year, according to an analysis from FIFA and OpenEconomics . According to the report, roughly 40% of the estimated 6.5 million tournament attendees will be international fans who will stay for an average 12 days, buy two tickets per person and spend about $416 daily. FIFA has advised World Cup host cities to expect a 50/50 split between domestic and international visitors, tourism officials from Philadelphia and Kansas City, two World Cup host cities, told Forbes. But Tourism Economics, a division of Oxford Economics, projects the U.S. will see only 1.24 million international visitors for the tournament—less than half of FIFA's projection. Nevertheless, the tourism analytics firm expects the event to help reverse a dramatic 6.3% downturn in inbound international tourism since Trump took office, driven mainly by his tariffs, America First rhetoric and immigration policies. Tourism Economics projects international visitation to rebound 3.7% next year, with nearly one-third of that growth tied directly to the World Cup. While tourism officials are generally optimistic about the potential for a World Cup boon, some have expressed concern that Trump's rhetoric and policies will inevitably turn off some international soccer fans. “The rhetoric from the administration against anything non-U.S. is just pretty prevalent,” Jan Freitag, national director of hospitality analytics at CoStar Group, said last month. “I think some people will say, ‘Look, if I'm from Europe and the next World Cup is in Europe, then maybe I'll sit this one out.'”

It's highly doubtful. With seven months until the tournament kicks off and millions of game tickets already sold, changing host cities would be a legal and logistical nightmare for FIFA. Still, Trump has repeatedly threatened to have Infantino yank the tournament from cities where politicians have opposed his immigration crackdowns. Last month, he singled out Boston when expressing his displeasure with the city's “radical left” mayor, Michelle Wu, saying “we could take [World Cup games] away.” After lambasting Seattle for electing a “communist” mayor, Trump asked Infantino in the Oval Office Monday, “Can I say that we are moving the event to a location where it will be appreciated and safe?” Infantino appeared to appease Trump, saying safety “of course is the responsibility of the government” and “obviously we will discuss, we are working together, we must ensure all fans coming from abroad can experience a celebration of coming together of the sport and with 100 percent safety.” Other FIFA executives have pushed back more definitively on Trump's rhetoric. “At the end of the day it's FIFA's tournament, FIFA makes those decisions,” Victor Montagliani, vice president of FIFA, said at a sports summit in London last month, adding, “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans.” 

Until the tournament groups are announced on Dec. 5, fans who want to see a specific national team play don't know where to plan their travel. It remains to be seen whether FIFA's tournament draw might potentially penalize host cities Trump has criticized by steering countries with the most ardent fanbases to Republican-leaning cities.

“Please do not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle,” Infantino said before the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Since July, FIFA has been a tenant in Manhattan's Trump Tower, which Trump critics have cited as yet another example of the sitting US president co-mingling his role as head of state with his business interests. Infantino was a guest at Trump's inauguration in January and has been an enthusiastic supporter of the president. International soccer organizations, meanwhile, have also criticized Infantino's bromance with Trump. In May, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) excoriated Infantino for arriving late to the FIFA Congress after joining Trump on his Middle East tour, accusing the FIFA chief of putting “private political interests” ahead of his commitment to the world's soccer organization. Earlier this month, Infantino announced Trump will be awarded the new “FIFA Peace Prize” after the president was passed over for the coveted Nobel.

Al Jazeera answers all the key questions around the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The picture for the FIFA World Cup 2026 is nearing completion, as 42 teams have now qualified for the 48-team tournament.

Some European heavyweights booked their spots during this November international break – including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain – alongside some minnows of world football.

Tiny Caribbean island country Curacao will go to the 2026 World Cup as the smallest nation by population ever to qualify for the marquee event in men's football, after a 0-0 draw in Jamaica on Tuesday saw them finish top of a four-team group.

Curacao will be joined by Panama and Haiti, which also booked their World Cup spots on Tuesday, from the region.

Meanwhile, Scotland have qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1998 after a wild 4-2 victory over Denmark.

The remaining six spots will be filled by teams playing in intercontinental and UEFA playoffs.

Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at the next edition of the world's marquee football tournament.

The tournament is being staged across the United States, Canada and Mexico. The first match will be played in Mexico City on June 11, while the final will be staged in New Jersey, the US, on July 19.

Due to the expansion of the tournament – from 32 teams to 48 – the 39-day event is the longest in its history.

FIFA's intercontinental playoffs will be the last chance saloon for teams around the world to reach next year's event. The finale of that route will be on March 31, 2026, less than three months before the World Cup kicks off.

The European qualification process runs until March, but most of the remaining confederations will have finished their continental qualification processes long before then.

Once the respective confederations finish their qualification process, FIFA offers two final spots to be contested by the best-placed team from each of the six continental routes that have not already qualified.

Although we will not know the full list of teams for the event until the end of March 2026, the draw will take place on December 5, 2025.

The draw will take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC in the United States. US President Donald Trump confirmed the location while speaking in the Oval Office at the White House, flanked by Vice President JD Vance and FIFA boss Gianni Infantino. He did not rule out overseeing the draw itself.

With the expansion to 48 teams, the World Cup will now feature 12 four-team groups. That will lead to a round of 32, an extra knockout round compared with previous editions.

Indeed, the tournament has doubled in size since it was staged in the US in 1994, when only 24 teams competed.

Trump has been quite clear and consistent on the staging of games within the US, saying he will move the games from any cities that he deems to be unsafe.

On September 26, when Trump was asked about games being moved, he warned: “Well, that's an interesting question … but we're going to make sure they're safe. [Seattle and San Francisco are] run by radical left lunatics who don't know what they're doing.”

 



 

The US will stage games in 11 places: Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New Jersey/New York (joint host region), Philadelphia, Seattle, and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Canada will host 13 games in total, split between Toronto and Vancouver. Mexico will also get 13 games, which will be played in Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey.

The US will stage the final, which will be played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Who are the defending FIFA World Cup champions?

Argentina won the last edition of the FIFA World Cup, beating France in the final of Qatar 2022.

With the game level at 3-3 after extra time, Argentina won the penalty shootout 4-2.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup was staged in the US, and the heat and resulting thunderstorms proved to be a huge problem for the tournament.

Three stadiums – in Arlington, Atlanta, and Houston – have retractable roofs that are expected to be closed due to the summer heat, while Inglewood and Vancouver have fixed roofs.

After the latest round of qualifying matches, here is a breakdown of the confirmed contenders from each of the six regions:

Hosts: Canada, Mexico, USA

Asia: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Uzbekistan

Africa: Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia

Europe: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, England, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Switzerland

Oceania: New Zealand

Americas: Argentina, Brazil, Curacao, Colombia, Ecuador, Haiti, Panama, Paraguay, Uruguay

Intercontinental playoffs: Six teams will take part in the playoffs in Mexico in March, with two qualifying.

Seeded teams Iraq and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) will receive byes to play in the two playoff finals, awaiting the winners from the semifinals.

Europe: UEFA's playoff competition, also taking place in March, will feature 16 teams, who need to win their semifinal and final to become one of four to qualify.

The draw is as follows:

Path A

Path B

Path C

Path D

World Cup

The United States are confirmed as being in pot one Marcio Machado/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images

With the latest round of World Cup qualification games complete, we have the clearest idea yet of how the group stages could look at next summer's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The World Cup draw will take place in Washington D.C. on December 5, with the 2026 tournament expanded from 32 teams to 48. During the seeded draw, teams will be put into four pots of 12 based on their FIFA rankings as of November/December 2025 and drawn into 12 groups. The latest rankings were released on Wednesday.

There are still six qualifying pots up for grabs — these will be decided by play-off fixtures in March.

Let's take a look at the pots as things stand, what the ‘group of death' could be and possible outcomes for the USMNT, Canada and England.

Based on the new FIFA rankings, this is how the pots are tracking. There is not due to be another ranking update until December 23 — after the draw:





Pot 1: United States, Mexico, Canada, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany

Pot 2:
Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia

Pot 3:
Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa

Pot 4:
Jordan, Cape Verde, Ghana, Curacao, Haiti, New Zealand, UEFA Play-off Qualifier 1, UEFA Play-off Qualifier 2, UEFA Play-off Qualifier 3, UEFA Play-off Qualifier 4, Confed Play-off Qualifier 1, Confed Play-off Qualifier 2

FIFA has not yet confirmed if play-off teams will be placed into pot four or placed in pots based on rankings, so we have worked on the assumption of the former. They will publish further draw criteria before December 5.

Assuming that play-off teams will be placed into pot four, a possible group of death looks like:

Pot 1: Argentina

The World Cup holders, after beating France on penalties in an all-timer final, finished top of CONMEBOL qualifying having won 12 out of 18 games. Lionel Messi finished as the continent's top scorer, with eight goals and three assists from 12 games.

Pot 2: Morocco

Morocco were the giantkillers of the 2022 World Cup. Captained by one of the best right-backs in the world, Achraf Hakimi, they finished top of a group containing Croatia, Belgium and Canada. In the knockouts, they defeated Spain and Portugal before eventually losing to France in the semi-final.

Pot 3: Norway

Norway have only ever qualified for three World Cups, but entering their fourth, they have players with the ability to hurt any team. Erling Haaland is the most fearsome striker in football and led scoring in UEFA qualifying with 16 goals in eight games.

Pot 4: Italy (were they to qualify from the UEFA play-offs)

Four-time World Cup winners Italy may not be at their most formidable, but it would be unfortunate to draw them in pot four over nations making their tournament debut.

They will have to earn their spot at the competition via the play-offs after finishing second in UEFA qualifying group I behind Norway, but could be included in pot four if they do make it via this route.

In pot two, also look out for Japan, who finished above Spain and Germany in the groups at the 2022 World Cup.

Mohamed Salah's Egypt present a threat in pot three, along with the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) winners Ivory Coast. Ghana, who reached the quarter-finals in 2010, are a strong side in pot four.



The worst-case scenario for the USMNT and Canada would be to be part of the group of death highlighted above, drawn with Morocco, Norway and Italy.

Nations from pots two to four may be hoping to draw one of the host nations from pot one, to avoid the highest-ranked FIFA teams.

England would avoid this exact draw as only two UEFA teams can be in each group, with countries from every other confederation not able to meet at this stage.

A worst-case scenario for England could be: Japan from pot two, Egypt or Ivory Coast from pot three and Italy from pot four.

As for best-case scenarios, being drawn against tournament debutants could be beneficial. In pot three, there is Uzbekistan and in pot four these nations are: Jordan, Cape Verde and Curacao. These teams will be riding a high, but have a lack of experience at the elite level.

Born just outside Marseille to Algerian parents, it was always going to be hard for a footballer as silky as Samir Nasri to avoid comparisons with the great Zinedine Zidane. When he was snapped up by Arsenal in the peak of the 'Wenger-ball' years, it made complete sense. Here was this uber-talented attacking midfielder who could glide past opponents for fun, why wouldn't he be the Gunners' next marquee player?

Nasri earned a move to Manchester City in 2011 and was part of the side that won the Premier League title on the final day of that season, hilariously pictured celebrating with fellow Frenchman and QPR opponent Djibril Cisse at full-time. All this happened before the playmaker turned 25, yet this was the apex of a career that went by the wayside afterwards.

Though he fulfilled on his potential early, Nasri never quite hit those same heights during the supposed prime years of his career. Instead, that chapter will be remembered as one of infamy.

This is the story of Nasri, 'Drip Doctors' and one of the craziest online stories football has ever seen...

Nasri managed to stay relatively injury-free for his first three seasons at City before suffering a spate of different issues during the 2014-15 campaign. A hamstring problem then ruled him out for most of the following season, during which he required extensive treatment on what ought to have been a routine recovery.

""The original estimate by the doctors was that I'd be out for between four to six months and the surgeon told me the same, but I've already done two months and I'm targeting the international break in March to be back properly with the squad,"" Nasri said in January 2016. ""With this injury I had to have an operation that resulted in nearly 100 stitches in my thigh. My surgeon told me this was a rare injury as the muscle had detached from the bone and the tendon was also 90 percent detached and had to be stitched back together so it was something that doesn't happen very often.""

By the time he returned to full fitness at the start of 2016-17, a new age had begun. Pep Guardiola had been installed as City manager and Kevin De Bruyne was the team's creator-in-chief, leaving a depleted Nasri to seek opportunities elsewhere.

At the very end of the summer 2016 transfer window, Nasri joined Sevilla on a season-long loan. The Andalusian side had just appointed highly-rated Argentine Jorge Sampaoli as their new head coach, and he was intent on creating a team for the purists. Nasri was perfect for that.

The Spanish media raved over Nasri's debut, during which he covered the second-most distance in a 2-1 win over Las Palmas. The slower style of La Liga football suited Nasri, whose burst of pace had been almost totally nerfed at this point. As long as he was fit, which was more often than not, the playmaker was almost a guaranteed starter, be that as a No.10 or on the wing.

Sampaoli's Sevilla went into La Liga's Christmas break third in the table, one place above Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid. Talk of a surprise title charge didn't sound crazy, either. Los Nervionenses had substance and style, even if keeping up with the powerhouses of Real Madrid and Barcelona would prove too tough a challenge.

That winter, however, Nasri's career changed forever. And not for the better.

Nasri spent his mid-season break in Los Angeles, during which time he visited the 'Drip Doctors' clinic. He was supposedly looking to receive a simple injection of vitamins, later clarifying he even had a prescription for the session after falling ill. Some testimonies claim this was recommended to him by his ex-girlfriend Dr Sarabjit Anand, who was based in Maryland.

Drip Doctors were delighted to welcome a name like Nasri and wanted to shout to the world that he had visited. A tweet from December 27, 2016 from their official account read: ""We provided [Nasri] a concierge Immunity IV Drip to keep him hydrated and in top health during his busy soccer season with Sevilla."" A picture of Nasri with founder and CEO Jamila Sozahdah was attached.

GOAL

It all seemed pretty inconspicuous. If Nasri wanted to go and receive this sort of medical treatment in his spare time, that was his business. But then all hell broke loose.

In a series of tweets that were deleted not too long after they were posted, Nasri - or at least the person with access to his account, later insisting he had been hacked - claimed he was ""also provided a full sexual service too right after"". The account called Sozahdah a ""w****"" that ""comes and f**** the same night"" and wrote in another post: ""Please tell the world as well of the other concierge treatment your girl gave straight after the iv drip.""

GOAL

The absurdity of these posts led people to believe Nasri wasn't actually the person writing these tweets, with some quickly pointing to the possibility of a vengeful lover. Indeed, he had supposedly been in hot water with girlfriend of four years Anara Atanes in the weeks leading up to this episode, and she was the next person to be dragged into the posts.

""Sorry guys I just had to let the world know that my girlfriend Anara who was with me at the time had booked this girl to give me an iv drip,"" and ""On arrival Anara had left the room and this girl had asked for my number and to go out with me that night. She then continued to give me..."" were the tweets that followed, though some of these entries were being destroyed almost as quickly as they went up. ""Unfortunately my twitter keeps deleting tweets. But just letting you boys know if u are in the la area and feeling lonely msg @DripDoctors"" recognised this.

GOAL

There then appeared to be a back-and-forth between the owner of the account and the person who had supposedly hacked into it. In an attempt to prove his innocence, Nasri tweeted: ""Someone hacked my account and tried to spread rumors which is fake I am sorty for all the ppl involved in that i apologies."" This was then followed by: ""Everything i said was 100 percents facts. The girl in the picture jamilah. Came to my hotel room at 3 am and continued other services... That dont come on their menu.""

At that point, the Drip Doctors account thought it would be best to dispel these allegations. ""[Nasri's] account has been HACKED and the recent tweets about @dripdoctors are all FALSE, this will be confirmed shortly. Thanks,"" was their own tweet. But the person behind Nasri's profile had the final say on the matter that fateful evening.

GOAL

""Did jamilah not come to the club and then my hotel room at 3am?"" was the question posed by Nasri's account in response. ""Im just trying to promote the amazing service of @DripDoctors and the services that come after too... And how you f*** all ur clients on the same day as giving them an iv drip,"" was the final post of the saga that night.

And if you don't believe all of these tweets weren't actually posted, you can still view this article from GOAL with actual screenshots from in the moment. This really happened!

To this day, both Nasri and Atanes, whom he officially split with in the aftermath of this tale, deny responsibility for the posts. His former model girlfriend would later say publicly: ""That wasn't me. If I need to say anything it will come from my mouth.""

There were doubts over Atanes' claim, however, given her past discretions. When Nasri was left out of France's 23-man squad for the 2014 World Cup, she wrote on social media: ""F*** France and f*** [Didier] Deschamps! What a s*** manager! Lets just get this straight! Im not mad i get my bf for 2 months…. I just think there's a level of respect to be had!"" The midfielder himself even had to publicly calm her down for this outburst, replying: ""Love you, don't get upset, life sometimes is unfair. You've just got to accept it and deal with it.""

Regardless, no one has ever owned up to causing the storm.

Naturally, Drip Doctors and CEO Sozahdah weren't happy to be in the news for all the wrong reasons. They released an official statement a few days on from the incident.

""Jamila Sozahdah, founder & CEO of Drip Doctors, is Board Certified Physician Assistant with a proven track record of providing healthful immunotherapy boosts to an extensive A-list clientele,"" the statement read, denying the ""false allegations"".

""Ms. Sozahdah founded Drip Doctors with two premier doctors in their field on staff, as well as a team of qualified nurses, and together they deliver professional health services across Southern California in their Downtown Los Angeles clinic. As well, Drip Doctors offer their services via house calls for high profile clients requiring the utmost privacy.

Drip Doctors has developed an exclusive range of boosters for clients with uncompromising demands in health, energy, beauty, and athletic performance. As a proud CEO of a flourishing business, and thriving female entrepreneur, Ms Sozahdah adheres to uncompromising standards for the health of her clients and the success of Drip Doctors.

""This week, Ms Sozahdah was dragged into an unfortunate incident involving libelous accusations sent on the hacked social media account of Samir Nasri, after administering a standard treatment on the soccer star. Ms Sozahdah would like to address head on this unfortunate incident of cyber-bullying: all Drip Doctors services are professional health services, administered by a professional team, and all insinuations otherwise are nothing more than libelous attacks.

""All too often, women are subject to online harassment, and for cyber trolls, insinuations of sexual impropriety are as easy way to ruin a successful woman's career. Jamila Sozahdah and the entire Drip Doctors team stand by their professional medical services and refuse to be bullied. The entire team looks forward to continuing providing cutting edge medical services to its extraordinary clientele.""

While Nasri was having to deal with the fallout of this remarkable story in his personal life, this activity also caught the attention of the Spanish Anti-Doping Agency, who were concerned that his treatment was in breach of World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) rules.

As it turned out, it was. Nasri was hit with a six-month ban in February 2018, which was later extended to 18 months that summer, though was backdated to July 2017 and only kept him out of competitive action until November 2018.

""The player Samir Nasri has been found guilty for using a prohibited method in accordance with sub-section M2, par. 2 of the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) prohibited list,"" UEFA said at the time. ""In this context, the CEDB (control, ethics and disciplinary body) has decided to suspend Samir Nasri for six months for violation of the World Anti-doping Code and the UEFA anti-doping regulations.""

By this point, Nasri's career was already spiralling out of control. He infamously picked up a red card for a supposed head-butt on Jamie Vardy during Sevilla's Champions League elimination at the hands of Leicester City in March 2017, and that was effectively the end of his time at the very top level.

Nasri made his return to football with Turkish side Antalyaspor for the 2017-18 season following the expiry of his Man City contract, while his relationship with Sevilla fell apart and he was not offered a return to Spain. He played only eight times in Turkey before a short-lived stint with West Ham the following campaign, before reuniting with former City team-mate Vincent Kompany at Anderlecht for 2019-20, the final year of his career before retiring a year later aged 34.

On several occasions, Nasri has pointed to the Drip Doctors fiasco as the reason why his playing days became numbered.

""I was on holiday with my family. I became ill, I had a virus. I did not leave my room, I was suffering from vomiting, big headaches, I was empty,"" Nasri said to L'Equipe in 2019. ""I called a friend and told him to find me a doctor. He couldn't. He said to me: 'There is a clinic, it will re-boost you'. Especially as I was going back to Sevilla in two days' time.

""I said OK. I didn't know the rules. And that, by the way, should serve as a lesson to all young players, to properly read the anti-doping rules, to really pay attention, because everything can go in a completely different direction. To be honest, I did not think that anything would come of it. This woman came to give me a drip of vitamins. She asked for a photo, I said yes, for me I hadn't done anything wrong.

""I was of the view that this was not a doping product, it was fine. Can I promise that I have never doped? Yes, I have handed over the files, there was no doping product in it.""

Nasri's exile from Sevilla also deeply upset him, believing his tailing form in the second half of 2016-17 was down to the looming threat of a doping ban.

""I was destroyed because I thought I was going to be banned for two years. I didn't want to play any more after that,"" he said on Instagram in 2020. ""I even told Sampaoli to leave me out, but he always wanted me to play. I was lost, I was anxious and angry with everything. I didn't show it on the pitch but football was over for me.

""Sampaoli liked me so much that he said to me, 'Come to our team, you can drink, go to nightclubs, do what you want and I'll cover your back. All I ask is that you play well on the pitch on the weekend'. In fact, one weekend I wasn't able to play and I wanted to go home and see my family and he offered to watch my house and look after my dog.""

From the new Zidane, to Arsenal's prodigy, to Man City's title-winner, to Sevilla's saviour, to the social media hall of infamy. You can't say Nasri's career was boring.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Premier League entertainment rankings: 'Set Piece FC' Arsenal in the bottom half along with Tottenham while non-Big Six sides prove the most watchable","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/premier-league-entertainment-rankings-set-piece-arsenal-bottom-half-tottenham-non-big-six-sides-most-watchable/blt7ccbf8cfa0336ce7","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

There's been a lot of talk lately about the Premier League as a product. Is modern football actually boring? Are teams now too reliant on set pieces to score goals? Are the mavericks and the willing protagonists being silenced just to preserve their manager's tactics? Have we gone too far in pursuit of sporting perfection?

These are some of the questions we'll be attempting to answer today. Football, as the world's most beloved sport, is supposed to be entertaining. That's why millions and billions tune in. It's not just about glory, but the winding, loop-filled road to it.

That's perhaps even truer in the Premier League, the supposed best competition in the world, the actual incarnation of the failed European Super League. Yet fans, supporters and viewers seem as disinterested as ever.

That's why we at GOAL felt it was imperative to both a) name and shame some of these anti-footballing culprits, and b) praise those who actually seem committed to keeping our attention. We've ranked the 20 top-flight teams based on their style of play, how much fun it usually is to watch them as a neutral, the flair and enjoyability of their best players, and the jeopardy they are constantly battling. You'll understand that last point a little later...

Unsurprisingly, the team that is currently bottom of the real Premier League table is also bottom of these rankings. Unless you're a West Brom fan hungry for a delicious hate-watch, who on this planet is tuning into Wolves games thinking 'ooh yeah that should be a fun one'?

Maybe new manager Rob Edwards will work some magic and get the side he used to play for firing again. Maybe Jorgen Strand Larsen will rediscover his shooting boots. Maybe one of their many South Americans will turn into Pele reincarnated. Don't count on it, though.

Heading into and out of the season's third international break, Burnley sit above the relegation zone. Yeah, go and double-check if you want, it's a little hard to believe, but it's true. Scott Parker has a recent history of his teams getting slaughtered at the top level, yet he's somehow made the Clarets a fairly respectable outfit again in the Premier League. They at least have a chance of survival, unlike the newly-promoted teams of the last few seasons.

Nevertheless, this has come at a cost. Unlike Vincent Kompany's side who tumbled to relegation in 2023-24, this version of Burnley are much more compact. They will earn more points in the real world than style points in this ranking.

From the outside looking in, it would be very easy to assume that Daniel Farke has stuck to his high-octane principles which have served him so well as a Championship manager. However, in an attempt to keep his job in the Premier League, he's had to revert to a much stodgier brand of football.

Elland Road is home to one of the most intimidating crowds in the country, though the team that plays there could do with some more on-ball quality if they are to rise back up this list akin to the days of Marcelo Bielsa.

You have to feel for Marco Silva. He's worked wonders with Fulham but seldom seems to receive the backing he needs in the transfer market to ever take them to that next level.

His sides are largely perceived as defensive - which is quite funny given he was seen as a hopeless, forward-thinking romantic at Hull City, Watford and Everton - but they still do possess some trickery in the form of Alex Iwobi and youth product Josh King. The squad has gone a bit stale, though that's hardly his fault.

It's a minor miracle that West Ham even rank this high. Are they really more entertaining than four other Premier League teams? In isolation, probably not, but they do have a couple of arguments in their favour. Their names are Jarrod Bowen and Lucas Paqueta.

The Irons are facing a scrap to avoid relegation, and new manager Nuno Espirito Santo may have to rely on the star power of this left-footed duo to save them from the Championship. The Portuguese coach has relied on such individual brilliance and attackers in tandem before, so it's a proven system.

It's difficult to pinpoint where exactly Nottingham Forest should rank. They came into the season with a direct, counter-attacking identity under Nuno, binned that off for a failed attempt to play expansively under Ange Postecoglou, and are now hoping Sean Dyche might sh*thouse them to safety.

On paper, Forest still have enough talent, pace and goals to make them a worthwhile watch. We'd just like to see more of them under their third manager of 2025-26 first.

For 2023-24 and 2024-25, Tottenham may have very well topped these rankings. Father Time gets us all in the end, however.

Spurs have swapped the thrills of Postecoglou's flawed tactics for a more sensible approach under Thomas Frank. Unfortunately for the fans who pay among Europe's highest ticket prices, this has made them awfully boring to watch. The one-man show of Mohammed Kudus has saved them at points, and the future returns of James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski ought to help too, but boy it's been quite the change in N17 so far.

Ironically, Frank's former side, Brentford, have become a more enthralling watch, in part due to his departure. The Bees came into 2025-26 with the masses doubting whether they'd be able to survive having lost their manager and two main goal-scorers in Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.

Keith Andrews, their set-piece coach turned gaffer, has gone back to basics. Much like the Brentford side of their first Premier League season, they have relied almost entirely on dead-ball situations, including the hilariously long throw-in of Michael Kayode, and transitions. Their directness, particularly against the division's best sides, has made them a loveable underdog again.

The curious case of Arsenal is partly what inspired this ranking and the chatter that preceded it. The Gunners are at last favourites to win the Premier League and are among the top dogs in the Champions League, though it has cost them their title as one of football's purest teams. The house Arsene Wenger built is now home to 'set piece again, ole ole' chants while the hosts struggle to make meaningful attacks from open play.

Does that matter? Not if the season ends in silverware. It's ramped up the pressure to win something, you could say.

Aston Villa have left their horrendous start to the season in the dust and look like the top-four contenders of old again. But they simply don't pass the eye test in the same way they used to.

During Unai Emery's first two-and-a-half seasons, Villa swarmed all over anyone who came to their patch of the West Midlands. They would launch wave after wave of attacks before their visitors kneeled before their might. Bar the visit of Bournemouth before the November international break, they've lacked that ruthlessness of old. The attacking potential is still in there, which is why they still rank this highly even with their auspicious form this term.

The weird squad-building of Chelsea, featuring many attacking midfielders and wingers of little differential, has arguably stifled their entertainment value. Enzo Maresca's men have been subjected to boos and jeers from their own fans on multiple occasions for building up too slowly, which is in part a tactical issue, but also one down to how bloated both their roster and schedule is.

Maresca's ideal version of the Blues is one of the Premier League's most fun teams, but they need to consistently reach those heights. Fortunately, Cole Palmer's return from injury is right around the corner and Estevao Willian is mustard.

In life and in football, we as humans can be prisoner to the moment. That's fantastic news for Everton, whose dynamic duo of Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye have made them more appealing to the average fan than ever.

The Toffees possess two of the Premier League's best dribblers, two of the players most likely to skin their man and get you off your seat. These are the guys who make the phrase 'worthy of the price of admission' coherent. David Moyes' showtime Blues at Hill Dickinson Stadium. What a world.

Speaking of 'prisoner of the moment', there hasn't been a more heartwarming story so far this season than that of Sunderland's. The club has been to hell and back over the last decade, and they've wasted no time getting themselves reacquainted with the top-flight.

With a cast of young talent and led by the gritty experience of Granit Xhaka, they've undoubtedly been one of the Premier League's best storylines, with plenty of last-minute madness also on their agenda.

Brighton have earned the right to sit this high in our rankings. You might not know which wonderkids they will select from week to week, you might not see a scorer other than the veteran Danny Welbeck, but they are seemingly committed to playing football in a way that will thrill.

Now, that doesn't always mean that they will pop the ball like prime Barcelona. Sometimes they'll find themselves scrambling having over-played at the back or after committing too many men high up the pitch. Regardless, the Seagulls are excellent value regardless of who their manager is. God bless Tony Bloom.

If your team has to go to St James' Park for the final kick-off on a Super Sunday, then you're basically starting the game a goal down already. Eddie Howe has rebuilt Newcastle into an aggressive, nasty team that can completely overwhelm their opponents at the snap of your fingers.

Replacing a guarantee of goals in Alexander Isak for more of a showman in Nick Woltemade hasn't made them any less exciting to watch, especially at home, but the German striker could do with some more support from his fellow forwards. The disparity between the Magpies at home and them on the road is also cause for concern.

Right, so remember at the top when we said the 'jeopardy' a team is facing will factor into their ranking? Well, Manchester United are the best case study for us to analyse. Think about it. United are gargantuan. 'Hated, adored, never ignored' and all that rubbish. If they win, 'Man Yanited are back', and if they lose they're in a relegation fight again. The swing of hysteria means that every game of theirs has everything on the line.

Ruben Amorim, after nearly a whole year of calling his troops the worst team in United history, has got them rolling it seems. The summer acquisitions of Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have rejuvenated an attack that couldn't hit a barn door. They aren't the best side in the Premier League, but certainly among the most compelling.

Whenever Pep Guardiola decides to walk off into the sunset, away from the gloom of Manchester's typical rainy weather, he will probably decree that his most idealistic Man City team were the 'centurions'. Midfield technicians in David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne, Fernandinho guarding the back four like a rabid jackal, Ederson playmaking from his own 18-yard box, two out-and-out wingers in Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane flanking a true marksman in Sergio Aguero.

Nowadays, City have swapped out these intricacies for a more intricate approach - make life as easy as possible for Erling Haaland. The Norwegian machine's relentless pursuit of goals and records is the prevailing narrative at the Etihad Stadium this season as they look to regain their title. Defensive fragilities and a loss of midfield control since Rodri tore his ACL last year have added to their list of imperfections, which bodes well for viewers without any skin in the game.

Arne Slot's first season at Liverpool was, if anything, too simple. They walked to the Premier League title having all but wrapped it up by Christmas. They showed a maturity that was sometimes absent during the rock-and-roll years under Jurgen Klopp.

Their summer reinvention with lavish signings completely reversed that trend. The Reds' high-risk high-reward style is back, now with added comedy and heightened pitfalls. The onus is on Slot to create a new winning formula, and just like United, the consequences can be hilarious.

There's something affable about Crystal Palace and Oliver Glasner. The south London identity, the blue-and-red colour palette, the Holmesdale Fanatics, the Vengabois, the streets-won't-forget cast of stars, their unique playing style that has alerted traditionally bigger sides. Put them all together and you get a team that's worth watching irrespective of your allegiances.

Even after losing Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, the Eagles still have top-drawer talent to feast your eyes upon, from Jean-Philippe Mateta to Adam Wharton, from Ismaila Sarr to Yeremy Pino. It was only fair that this side were immortalised with FA Cup glory at the end of last season, though they will have to settle for the runners-up spot in this list. That's the real quiz. Sorry, Palace fans.

Congratulations, Bournemouth - you are the inaugural winners of GOAL's Premier League entertainment rankings! Andoni Iraola has carved out an identity to die for on the south coast, with his Cherries side playing at a hundred miles-an-hour at all times. His players are instructed to use everything in the tank, at which point they will then be substituted for fresh legs.

Their unabating attitude has withstood the sales of three key defenders in Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Iliya Zabarnyi, while Antoine Semenyo has been the best Premier League player outside the traditional big six so far this season. The football gods had to nerf this Bournemouth side with the smallest stadium in the top-flight. Adding a raucous home-field advantage to Iraola's mix would have been simply too overpowering.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'No chemistry, no desire to fight'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/antonio-conte-napoli-breaking-point-months-after-serie-a-title-success/blt37f2b06e965b493b","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

At one point during the international break, it appeared as if both Napoli and Atalanta would have new coaches in place for this weekend's meeting between the two sides at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. However, while the Bergamaschi inevitably sacked Ivan Juric the day after their shocking 3-0 defeat at home to Sassuolo, Antonio Conte remains in charge of the Partenopei - which is actually something of a surprise. 

Conte may have led Napoli to just their fourth Serie A title six months ago, but his relationship with his players appears to be even worse than their results right now, with the coach comparing his team to a corpse after exhibiting zero signs of life in their latest loss at Bologna.

So, what on earth is going on with the Italian champions? Has Conte really lost the dressing room? Or is he simply trying to provoke a reaction out of his underperforming team by casting doubt on his future?

Conte is obviously no stranger to controversy. The notoriously combustible coach has repeatedly fallen out with his employers - and usually over perceived parsimony in the transfer market. His legendary lament at Juventus that ""You cannot eat at a €100 restaurant with €10 in your pocket"" has become a part of the lexicon of Italian football. Even by Conte's standards, though, it was jarring to hear him bemoaning a lack of investment before he'd even taken charge of his first match as Napoli coach last year.

In that particular instance, though, Conte did have some cause for complaint, as the horribly handled Victor Osimhen affair held up the club's summer recruitment for far longer than it should have done. The equally-outspoken Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis also acknowledged that last season's Scudetto success was made all the more remarkable for the fact that Conte had had to deal with the sale of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia for financial reasons midway through their title challenge.

""He managed through incidents and injuries to make do with what he had, using not one, but four or five different tactical systems,"" De Laurentiis enthused at the trophy parade in May. ""Conte showed the whole world that systems are useless and that all you need is a great knowledge of what football really means. So, for him who took us all the way to win the second Scudetto in three years, I ask for an applause, thank you, thank you, thank you!""

However, in the very same speech that De Laurentiis used to thank Conte, he also wished him ""continuing success in his professional life"" - which appeared to confirm rumours that the coach had already decided to part company with the Partenopei after just one season in charge - and return to Juventus.

Conte insisted all along, though, that he wouldn't make a decision on his future until after he had spoken to De Laurentiis and, after showdown talks with the president, he revealed that he would continue as coach because the club had acknowledged that certain mistakes had been made over the course of the campaign.

""I think everyone is aware of what happened in January,"" Conte told Sky Sport Italia in June. ""During the season, some things didn't really make me happy. New players arrived only in the last week [of the summer window]: (Scott) McTominay, (Billy) Gilmour, (David) Neres and (Romelu) Lukaku. Honestly, I didn't like that.

""But I believe I was good at accepting the situation and not giving excuses to my players and myself. When you sign [a contract], there are honours and duties. But when we spoke, they admitted there had been errors. It happens, though, in the first year of marriage, so once I was reassured on certain things, we agreed to continue and now we must defend the Scudetto.""

Unfortunately, this particular marriage could very easily end in divorce - but not because of any fresh tension over transfers between Conte and the club.

Napoli pretty much gave Conte everything they wanted during the summer, signing eight players for a combined cost of roughly €200 million (when the obligatory fees are taken into account), while at the same time making free agent Kevin De Bruyne their second-highest earner after Lukaku. By Serie A standards, this constituted a colossal spending spree - and yet Conte has used Napoli's recruitment as an excuse for his side's patchy performances so far this season.

""Last year we won a championship where the players pushed themselves to the limit; we had unity in every way,"" Conte told Sky after a shocking 6-2 Champions League loss at PSV. ""In my opinion, nine new players are too many.

""We opened the transfer window because we were forced to do so. We tried to strengthen the squad but it takes time and patience. Bringing nine new players into the dressing room isn't easy. The old guys, myself and those from last year, need to step up our game and find unity again.""

However, while Napoli looked like their old selves in beating Inter four days after being embarrassed in Eindhoven, they've struggled ever since to score goals due to a general lack of cohesion and creativity.

The loss of De Bruyne to a serious hamstring injury sustained while converting a penalty in the Inter game has understandably had a devastating impact on Napoli's attack, and partly explains why the goals have dried up for Rasmus Hojlund in recent weeks - which is a major problem given Lorenzo Lucca is looking like a poor signing and Lukaku is still not back to full fitness. Indeed, Napoli have now failed to score in their last three games in all competitions.

However, what's really troubling Conte is his team's work-rate, as the Partenopei are not playing with anything like the same dynamism as last season. The obvious explanation is that a team unburdened by European football last season is still getting used to the added stress and strain of competing in the Champions League. Some supporters and pundits are pointing the finger at Conte, though.

For all his success in reviving toiling teams and winning championships in his first season in charge, Conte has a dreadful record in continental competition, and the argument has always been that it's simply not possible to play Conte's ""200kmph"" brand of football every three-to-four days. For this very reason, Branislav Jasurek, the agent of Napoli midfielder Stanislav Lobotka, made headlines in Italy for telling a Slovakian podcast that his client might not be physically able to see out the remainder of his contract.

""What Conte requires is brutally demanding,"" Jasurek said. ""In terms of statistics, the coach's running requirements are incomparable to anyone else.""

Jasurek later insisted that his comments were made in jest, but plenty of other observers believe that Conte's reluctance to rotate his key players is a serious problem. Furthermore, in news that won't come as a surprise to Diego Costa, Conte has also effectively been accused of being a poor communicator by Noah Lang, who has started just once since joining from PSV during the summer for €25m.

""I don't know what else to do,"" the winger told Pickx Sports after Napoli were routed by his former club at the Philips Stadion. ""I'm training hard. I don't speak to him (Conte) very often. I think I've spoken to him once. But it's better not to say anything. I have no other choice. I signed a contract here, so I have to accept the situation as it is right now.""

It could change very soon, though. 

After two lifeless displays in the dour draws with Como and Eintracht Frankfurt at the start of the month, Conte implored his players to resuscitate their season by beating Bologna just before the international break. However, after watching Napoli slump to a lame 2-0 loss at the Dall'Ara that saw them slide from first to fourth in the Serie A standings, he unintentionally evoked memories of the comedy 'Weekend at Bernie's' by stating that he had no intention of ""accompanying a corpse"" for the remainder of the season.

""Heart transplants aren't an option,"" Conte told DAZN. ""Each of us needs to rediscover our spirit and our grit. We needed more energy in everything. What's disappointing is that they showed more positivity and desire than us, and that should make us reflect. It's the fifth defeat we've suffered this season. 

""I'll talk to the club, but three or four months have passed and there's no chemistry, no desire to fight together. I don't know if we'll be able to change the situation. One thing is to talk about the pitch, technique and tactics, but when you see other things, I'm sorry, it means I am not doing a good job. Or that someone doesn't want to listen to me...""

At that stage, speculation was rife that Conte was seriously considering quitting. De Laurentiis dismissed such talk as ""nonsense"" and claimed that ""between me and Conte there has always existed a special harmony that unites men who use the 3 C's: character, competence, and courage.""

Conte nonetheless felt compelled to take a break, with the 56-year-old heading north to Turin to spend a week with his family as his assistant Cristian Stellini oversaw training while several members of Napoli's squad were away on international duty. Conte returned on Monday, reportedly revitalised and doubly determined to turn his team's season around. The next week feels vital, though, with Napoli facing two home games, against Atalanta and Qarabag, that they'll be fully expected to win.

In a way, though, the performances will be of greater significance than the results, with Napoli's players having been accused by former striker Roberto Sosa of playing as if they ""want to get rid of the coach"". If they produce another spiritless showing on Saturday, Conte would likely grant them that wish.  ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Lionel Messi has sent another “we'll be back” message to Barcelona after being crowned the “most beloved player” in the club's history. The Argentine superstar has been awarded that honour following a supporter vote. He feels proud to have received such a title, given the calibre of talent that he was up against, and remains determined to head back to Catalunya at some stage.

Messi was recently in that part of the world when taking in a secret visit to Camp Nou, as that iconic venue prepares to throw open its doors again following a stunning redevelopment project.

Eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi became a global icon when gracing that turf - registering 672 goals through 778 appearances. He won 10 La Liga titles and four Champions League crowns with the Blaugrana - helping him to become the most decorated player in history.

He has now been named the GOAT by Barca fans - fending off competition from the likes of Johan Cruyff, Ronaldinho, Xavi and Andres Iniesta. Messi said when being presented with that prize by SPORT: “This award is very special because of what it represents and where it comes from. We've been through a lot together, both good and not so good, but that's normal because not everything in a career is perfect. This is my home, my place, and my people.”

Messi remains untouchable in the eyes of many Barcelona followers, even those of the younger generation that did not get to see much of him before an emotional farewell was taken in when heading to Paris Saint-Germain in 2021.

There is seemingly no end to that sporting love affair, despite the South American forward now plying his trade thousands of miles away in MLS with Inter Miami. Paths will cross again at some point.

Messi reiterated when discussing his future plans, having already admitted that he and wife Antonela intend to set up camp again in Barcelona once his playing days are over: “Obviously, I'm going to come back. I'm going to be at the stadium like any other fan, following the team, the club, and being just another supporter. For now, I'll be here [Miami] for a few more years, most likely, but we'll return to Barcelona because, as I've always said, it's my place, my home. We miss it a lot, so we'll be back there.”

Messi added on his unbreakable connection with Barcelona, having been shown a video in which supporters thanked him for his contribution to the collective cause: “The truth is, we've been through so much together, good and not so good, which is normal in a career of so many years; not everything is rosy, and you go through difficult times. But well, it's my home, my place, my people. I would have liked to spend my whole career there without having to go to another club. And… and, well, to have only played there in Europe.”

He went on to say of heading to PSG when it became apparent that Barca did not have the funds to put a new contract in place: “Unfortunately, things turned out differently, but I'll always have lifelong memories of all the moments we shared. And, well, I'm grateful for that. It's been a long time since I've been to Barcelona, since I've been to the stadium. I had to leave the club without fans because of the pandemic, so it was an unusual year too. And, well, many beautiful memories, so thank you very much to all the people of Barcelona. And, obviously, I also have a very special affection for everyone there.”

Talk of Messi making a playing return to Barcelona has been quietened for now, with a stunning loan agreement during the MLS off-season considered to be unlikely. He has committed to a new three-year deal in South Florida that will take him through 2028. At 38 years of age, he is expected to form part of Argentina's World Cup title defence in the summer of 2026.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

England icon Wayne Rooney has revealed the eye-watering details behind his biggest Manchester United contract - leaving the Stick To Football pundits stunned. The forward will go down as one of the greatest players this country has ever produced and many will argue he deserved to get paid as well as he did. But the disparity between his salary and that of his peers left some in shock.

While Rooney has not had much success in management, following his dismissals at Birmingham City and Plymouth Argyle, few can argue about what he achieved as a player. He won five Premier League titles and a Champions League, along with a host of other silverware. The 40-year-old picked up a hatful of individual accolades, scored 53 goals in 120 games for England, and found the net on 313 occasions in 763 appearances. Across his career, greats of the game waxed lyrical about him.

For instance, former team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo said: ""He was the kid of England, everyone loved him. He was so powerful, I was calling him ‘Pitbull.' The power of Wayne Rooney is his mentality and strength, and he never stops. He's a fantastic team player, and he scores. He's a fantastic boy, and he helped me a lot when he came to join us in Manchester.""

Ronaldo's greatest of all time rival, Lionel Messi, believed that what Rooney could do on a football pitch was ""very special"".

The Argentine admitted: ""There has always been a great deal of respect between myself and Wayne Rooney. For me, he is the great English player of the generation. What he is capable of doing on the field is very special, and he is one of the few players that would improve any squad in Europe.""

And Arsenal great Thierry Henry said the consistently high level Rooney produced in his career was ""extraordinary"".

He added: ""To play well for six months or a season in football is nothing. To do so for over a decade like Rooney is extraordinary. I know what it takes, and it isn't easy. Trust me, people talk about him outside of this country. In Spain and France, he is appreciated as a top, top player.""

In an enlightening chat about how players brokered deals in their playing days, Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher, Ian Wright, and Roy Keane were lost for words when Rooney talked about the biggest contract he signed at United. In 2014, when Rooney was 28 going on 29, the ex-Everton ace signed a five-year deal with reported wages of around £300,000. And on Stick to Football, Rooney said he got £17 million ($22m) a year after that bit of business. With the ex-footballers blown away by this figure, Neville quipped that he wished he had used an agent during his contract negotiations with the Red Devils. The right-back said he earned a basic salary of £1.75m that rose to £2.25m.

He added: ""[Money] was never a focus for me. I never once worried about the money side of it. I just thought that if I can get to the end of my career at 35 or 36 at United then I know I'll be alright. When they offered me seven years on less money, it was better for me than signing for four years on higher money. I always thought in a more cautious way.""

Carragher piped up that his biggest deal was around £3m and Keane said he earned around £5m at his peak. 

Rooney retired from playing in the 2020/21 season with Championship side Derby County, with the veteran then taking up the role of Rams manager. Ergo, many football fans growing up now will not have seen him in his pomp. But the plaudits that came his way give some indication as to how good a player he was. 

Former England and United team-mate Rio Ferdinand once said: ""I laid eyes on him when he was 16 or 17 years old, and I remember after an England game as well, I said to his mum and dad in the players' lounge ‘make sure he signs for Manchester United'. They looked at me and laughed and thought, ‘we have already done that'. What a player. He did it all, he scored a ridiculous amount of goals, scored absolute bangers from anywhere on the pitch, great passer, aggressive, passion, desire, work rate.""

Rooney's former manager, David Moyes, got to see him make the grade at the Toffees, and knew he had something very special on his hands.

""There was a day when we had him in training. He was only a young boy and we had to set up a small-sided game and Wayne chipped a goalkeeper from near the byline. It was a moment when we all looked at each other and said, ‘Did he really do that? Did that happen?'. We knew it before, but when we saw that happen we all thought ‘there is a real special talent here,"" he said.

For the time being, Rooney has put his managerial career on hold and is giving punditry a go once again. He has a podcast with the BBC and is a Match of the Day pundit, along with other gigs. But another foray in the dugout may be at the back of his mind, too.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Wayne Rooney compares Harry Kane to Cristiano Ronaldo as he hails Bayern Munich & England striker's 'incredible evolution'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/wayne-rooney-compares-harry-kane-cristiano-ronaldo-bayern-munich-england-incredible-evolution/blt928a0e723ead753e","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 14:28:13 GMT","

Wayne Rooney has compared Harry Kane's “incredible evolution” into England's GOAT with the development that Cristiano Ronaldo once enjoyed at Manchester United. Kane is already his country's all-time leading goalscorer and appears set to smash records on the appearance front as well. If he could win an international trophy, then it would be difficult to argue against him being the greatest.

At 32 years of age, the former Tottenham striker is showing no sign of slowing down. Remarkable numbers are being posted at Bayern Munich, with the target being found there on 108 occasions through 113 appearances. He has also broken his trophy duck by becoming a Bundesliga title winner.

On the international stage, Kane remains the talismanic captain of England. He is rarely rested, with few alternative No.9 options breathing down his neck, and has helped the Three Lions secure qualification for the 2026 World Cup.

He has reached 78 goals for his nation and boasts 112 caps. Kane needs to reach 126 in order to pass legendary former goalkeeper Peter Shilton. Another shot at major glory will be taken in next summer - having suffered defeat in back-to-back European Championship finals - with the plan being to emulate Bobby Moore when it comes to claiming the most prestigious of prizes.

Explaining why Kane will pass Moore, Bobby Charlton, Kevin Keegan, Bryan Robson, Paul Gascoigne, David Beckham, Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer on the GOAT front, ex-England captain Rooney told The Overlap: “Just the goals he has scored and his performances. He will go on and get the caps record as well, you would imagine - the caps he is on.

“I just think how he has evolved as a player is incredible. He reminds me of Cristiano when we were at United and he was younger. Sometimes he's at a mad angle and he's shooting and you're like ‘what are you doing shooting?' You might say ‘pass it' but it doesn't bother him, he'll try it again and keep going - right and left foot. I think he's, for me, the best England player. The numbers he is getting are incredible.”

Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher agreed with that assessment, suggesting that Kane still does not get the recognition that his stunning exploits deserve. The former England defender said: “I absolutely love him. I think he is a little bit underrated. There was always that thing about trophies.

“Shearer was always the centre-forward of the Premier League when it started - for six or seven years, Shearer was the guy and he was England's guy, most goals in the Premier League. I think if you asked most people up and down the country: Shearer of Kane? I think the majority would go with Shearer.

“I've always been Kane. Shearer was amazing but I don't know what you can say against Kane. He has gone to Bayern Munich and he is like Ronaldo and Messi level. He's going to get more goals and caps than Lineker, Shearer, Jimmy Greaves, Rooney. What hasn't the lad done? What can you throw at him?”

One-time England striker Jermain Defoe, who also graced the books at Spurs, has previously told GOAL when asked if Kane will go down as England's greatest: “I think if he wins something, you have to put him in the conversation. Of course there have been others that are iconic figures and legends in terms of caps – Beckham, Ashley Cole, all the great players. But to be England's leading goalscorer, that's a special achievement. If you go on to win a major tournament and have the most caps, of course you have to put him in the conversation.”

Kane has spoken of his admiration for Rooney, with inspiration being taken from the Manchester United great and fellow frontman that he took England's all-time goal record from. Rooney was unable to win anything during the Three Lions' so-called ‘Golden Generation', but Kane has an opportunity to grab himself a gold medal before hanging up his boots.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Bayern Munich honorary president Uli Hoeness has praised the influence of striker Harry Kane and head coach Vincent Kompany, lauding the English forward as the embodiment of how the team should play. Hoeness also revealed a recent conversation he had with Kompany over dinner, telling the manager that he doesn't want Bayern's matches to end because of how enjoyable the team is to watch at the moment.

It has been a rip-roaring start to the 2025-26 season from Bayern Munich. The reigning Bundesliga champions won 16 consecutive games to begin the campaign, breaking AC Milan's record of 13 wins out of the opening 13 games of the 1992-93 season across all competitions. Kompany's men have dominated and obliterated their opponents. The only game they've not managed to win was their most recent outing, a 2-2 draw against Union Berlin.

It all began with a closely-contested 2-1 win over last season's DFB-Pokal winners Stuttgart in the DFL-Supercup. A statement 6-0 win over RB Leipzig helped them carry early momentum in the Bundesliga. Wins over Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain – last season's Club World Cup and Champions League winners, respectively – have sent a dangerous warning to the rest of Europe, while domestic rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen's efforts have been in vain, too.

Speaking at a health-related event at the FC Bayern Museum on Thursday, honorary president Hoeness expressed his delight over how well Bayern have started the season and revealed what he recently told Kompany over dinner.

""We are, of course, very, very satisfied with what we're seeing,"" he exclaimed in euphoria. ""I've always said that when you have a team you're very happy with, you can finally relax in the stands. I recently met Vincent Kompany for dinner and told him: 'It used to be that in the 80th minute, you hoped the game would end soon.' And now, in the 80th minute, you say: 'I hope they keep playing for a long time, because it's so much fun!' The players are having fun. The fans are having fun. And we in the stands are having fun too. And that's actually the ideal situation right now, the way you want to imagine FC Bayern.""

Hoeness went on to wax lyrical about Kane, who has already scored a staggering 23 goals in 17 games this season. He also became the quickest player in history to reach 100 goals for a single club in Europe's big five leagues, taking just 104 games to achieve the feat.

""What Harry Kane has produced here in the last year or two is absolutely top-notch,"" said Hoeness. ""And what I like best about him: In the beginning, he was a goal scorer who played in his box, who waited for the balls to come. But today he's long since become a playmaker, he's a finisher, and above all, he's a player with a personality who inspires others on the pitch, who sets the direction, and that's exactly what we were looking for.""

Hoeness heaped further praise on Kompany, who has been doing a ridiculously phenomenal job at the Allianz Arena. The honorary president explained what sets the Belgian manager apart from previous Bayern coaches such as Thomas Tuchel. 

""He has two or three advantages. For example, as a journalist, you actually have to work again. The previous coaches here always gave you the go-ahead to discuss for weeks. That's not the case with him, because he wants to talk to them about football, and that's good for the whole of FC Bayern,"" he said.

In a recent interview, the red-hot Englishman claimed that his individual numbers would be worthless as long as he fails to help his team win titles. ""I could score 100 goals this season but if I don't win the Champions League or the World Cup, you're probably not going to win the Ballon d'Or,"" Kane said.

""It's the same with Erling Haaland, it's the same with any player. You have to be winning those major trophies. With the way the season is going as a team with Bayern Munich, it looks like we're in great shape.

""It looks like we're one of the favourites for the Champions League, for sure. So that maybe makes the odds a little bit more in my favour. Same with England. I think we're going to go into the tournament as one of the favourites. Whenever you are going into a year, like a World Cup year, there is a lot of excitement, a lot of talk, a lot of noise around everything. You have to try and stay focused on the now.

""From my point of view, I've got six more weeks before I get a nice break. I am feeling good. And that break will help for us but hopefully if things go my way for club and country then I'm definitely going to be in the conversation for a trophy like the Ballon d'Or.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

 An experienced Spain team dug deep to oust the young talents of Czechia in a thrilling Davis Cup quarter-final tie on Thursday afternoon in Bologna. 

 After Jakub Mensik and Jaume Munar had each earned singles wins for their respective countries to leave the last-eight encounter at 1-1, Marcel Granollers and Pedro Martinez edged Tomas Machac and Mensik 7-6(8), 7-6(8) in an enthralling doubles rubber to seal victory for Spain.

 The 39-year-old Granollers, a former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings, and 28-year-old Martinez saved three set points in the first-set tie-break and two set points in the second-set tie-break for their decisive victory. It was finally sealed when #NextGenATP Mensik fired a double fault under pressure at 8/9 in the second-set tie-break, ensuring Spain advanced to a semi-final clash on Saturday against second seed Germany or Argentina. 

 The stage had been set for the doubles showdown after 20-year-old Mensik eased past Pablo Carreno Busta 7-5, 6-4 in the opening singles rubber, before Jaume Munar downed Jiri Lehecka 6-3, 6-4 to level the tie. A six-time Davis Cup champion, Spain is into the semi-finals for the first time since lifting its most recent title in 2019.

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Leclerc: 'The best thing I can do is keep doing my best'

Check out the odds for this weekend's Las Vegas Grand Prix, from pole position to the Grand Prix victory.

Formula 1 enters the final triple header of the season as the Las Vegas Grand Prix hosts Round 22 of the championship, but what do the odds say about who might come out on top? Read on to find out...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

The Drivers' Championship leader, Lando Norris, has upped his game in recent rounds to win back-to-back races convincingly. In Mexico, he crossed the line 30.324 seconds ahead of runner-up Charles Leclerc, and in Brazil he was 10.388 seconds clear of Kimi Antonelli. The McLaren driver is also developing a reputation for winning from pole, having prevailed five times in six starts from the front row this term.

Recent races would suggest that Norris' biggest threat will come from the RB21 of Max Verstappen. The Dutchman will start in Nevada with seven consecutive rostrums to his name, including three victories in the same period. However, minor placings won't help his cause in the title fight, as he needs to recover 49 points on the leader. Despite the mountain ahead, he holds fond memories of this circuit, taking top honours in 2023.

On the value end of the scale, George Russell is a worthy selection, given his success on street circuits this campaign. The Mercedes racer took victories on the streets of Montreal and Singapore, racking up five podiums in seven races on similar circuits. He'll also arrive in Nevada as the defending race winner.

After the start that Oscar Piastri had to the season, looking at him for the minor podium places is not something that would have been expected at this stage of the campaign.

The Australian registered 14 top-threes in the first 16 rounds, but hasn't joined in the post-race festivities since his third place at Monza. Piastri arrives in the States with three consecutive fifth-place returns to his name, but he knows how to win on the streets, collecting first prize in Jeddah and Miami earlier this year.

Ferrari enter the fray after failing to collect any points in Sao Paulo, the third such occurrence this year. However, they managed to put a driver on the podium in Las Vegas in 2023 and 2024. As it stands, Leclerc is their best chance of that, arriving with two in his past three outings.

Credit is due to the rookie, Antonelli, who snatched his second career top-three down in South America, and his best finish, a runner-up behind Norris. Can he repeat that feat this weekend?

We need to dedicate some space to young Ollie Bearman, who has been nothing short of sensational in the latter part of the calendar. The Haas driver tackles the final street circuit of the year with four straight top-10s under the belt and consecutive top-sixes. He carries the lowest midfield finishing average in the previous five Grands Prix at 8.00. One factor that counts against the rookie, however, is his performance on street tracks this year, where his best return was ninth in Singapore.

Seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton continues his tough maiden season at Ferrari. He failed to cross the line in Brazil for his second DNF of the campaign, but has captured nine top-sixes across the year, making him a serious contender in Nevada. He also enjoyed a successful visit here in 2024, finishing second behind his then-team mate Russell.

Then we get the Williams duo of Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon, who are more than capable of a top-six finish. The issue for them is consistency, both from a driver's standpoint and car performance. If they show up in Las Vegas, you can expect them to challenge for points, but we'll find out which Williams fares better.

Albon leads the midfield in top-10s this season, racking up 11, but he hasn't finished inside the cut since Monza. Next up in this rank in this division is rookie Isack Hadjar, who captured his ninth top-10 in Sao Paulo. Despite his impressive record, he's struggled at the backend of the campaign, falling outside of the threshold in 60% of his past five races.

Moving away from youngsters, we settle on Fernando Alonso, who has driven himself into this category eight times this year, twice in the last five Grands Prix. Sticking with the veterans, Nico Hulkenberg produced his seventh top-10 performance of 2025 last time out. It was the second such result in three races, and still, he offers value for money.

Liam Lawson continues to show grit, despite an uncertain future in the sport's top flight. The Kiwi took off from Brazil after finishing inside the first 10 spots for the sixth time in his rookie season. Finally, Pierre Gasly collected welcome points for Alpine down in South America for his fifth Grand Prix score of the campaign. However, he's struggled with street layouts this year and will likely endure another tough weekend in Las Vegas.

Norris has usurped the power in the past two Qualifying rounds, taking pole position in the subsequent Grand Prix. The McLaren enters Las Vegas with six starts from the front of the grid this season, but only two coming on street circuits. He now trails Verstappen by one in the Pirelli Pole Position Award.

Speaking of the four-time World Champion, he's stopped the clock fastest on Saturday in three out of the seven street races this year, making him the most successful on these set-ups. He is closely followed by Norris, and last year's Grand Prix victor, Russell.

Both of Russell's pole positions this season have occurred on street circuits, that being Canada and Singapore respectively – both races that he went on to win. And while Piastri's form might have seemingly dipped lately, he has qualified fastest on five occasions this term, the last one arriving in the Netherlands.

McLaren find themselves back in the driver's seat after handing over the reins to Red Bull for a few races, with the Woking outfit touching down in Vegas after two consecutive victories. They've produced the winning vehicle in 66.67% of Sunday races this year, but they'll find it challenging in Las Vegas. While the papayas have snatched three street showdowns this year, the last one was in Monaco, courtesy of Norris.

Red Bull have found their groove late in the season and still hold a long shot of producing the Drivers' Champion. The Austrian-owned team have collected five triumphs this campaign, courtesy of Verstappen, and provided the victorious car at this event in 2023.

Mercedes are the value for money offer in the Teams' fight, arriving as the defending champions. They've also enjoyed themselves on the road circuits this year, winning two of the last three.

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Leclerc: 'The best thing I can do is keep doing my best'

A look at the bold, creative special edition helmets hitting the track in Las Vegas, from milestone designs to personal tributes.

Las Vegas has inspired some of the boldest helmet designs of the season, with drivers unveiling their one-off creations for race week. From playful tributes to full neon flair, every helmet tells its own story, so let's take a look at some of the headgear on show...

To mark his 150th Grand Prix, McLaren's Lando Norris unveiled “Art in Motion,” a hand-painted 3D helmet created in collaboration with artist Werner Bronkhorst. Unveiled at his LN × WB concept pop-up in Las Vegas on Tuesday, the piece blends vivid colour, raised textures and plenty of personal nods to some of Lando's biggest moments in F1, turning it into an eye-catching visual timeline of his journey so far.

The lid features miniature depictions of Norris after his first podium at Austria in 2020, his maiden win at Miami in 2024, and his first home win in this year's British Grand Prix.

When Lewis Hamilton brings a special edition helmet to a race weekend, it never disappoints, and his helmet for Las Vegas shows he has no intentions of easing up.

Inspired by the 'City of Lights', Lewis' signature yellow helmet has been drenched in silver glitter, creating a shimmering finish that's guaranteed to look spectacular under the neon glow of the Strip all weekend long. And it's no wonder he's gone all-out for Vegas: after storming from P10 to a stunning P2 here in 2024, this is a circuit he knows how to make sparkle!

Oscar Piastri brings his own twist to the Las Vegas helmet trend with a design inspired by his earliest racing memories, paying tribute to the remote control car that earned him a national title in 2010.

It was the first thing he ever drove – the small but significant stepping stone that led him into karting and eventually paved his path to Formula 1.

The bold helmet mirrors the colours and details of that original RC livery, making it a nostalgic and personal tribute to where his journey began. So, why debut it in Vegas? Piastri pointed out that this week marks exactly 15 years since that fated national title, making this weekend a fitting race to celebrate the very start of his motorsport success as he continues to fight for the title.

George Russell has gone all-out for his Las Vegas lid this year – and with good reason. This weekend marks his 150th race start in Formula 1, and he's celebrating it in style, nodding to both the milestone and his spectacular victory on the Strip last year.

Fittingly for Vegas, he couldn't resist weaving in a bit of casino flair into the details of the helmet – including a set of playing cards decorated with his signature T-pose. It's an eye-catching helmet worthy of this significant achievement, an unforgettable memory, and a race weekend he undoubtedly loves!

With Hollywood only a couple of hours from the Las Vegas Strip, Esteban Ocon proved he understood the assignment with his special edition helmet for the Vegas. As one of Haas' home races – and with Marvel's roots firmly tied to the US – Ocon leaned fully into the theme.

Famously a fan of all things superhero, with his 2023 Deadpool and 2024 Captain America designs proving popular, the Frenchman let his spidey senses guide him to a bold, split design. One half features the infamous Spider-Man print – the other transformed into the inky, sharp-edged look of Venom. No doubt the Haas driver will be wanting to put on a superhuman performance at their home Grand Prix this weekend too!

Yuki Tsunoda never fails to impress with his special-edition helmets, consistently delivering some of the most creative and thought-provoking designs on the grid. For Las Vegas, the Red Bull driver has gone for a beautifully crafted, ceramic-inspired look, merging his usual design with Kintsugi – the Japanese art of repairing pottery with gold to celebrate strength, resilience, and imperfection. Golden seams run across the helmet, giving it a luminous finish that will look incredible under the glow of the Vegas lights.

And there's even more meaning behind it, as Yuki revealed that this special edition will be auctioned off after the race weekend for charity – a stunning piece of art with a purpose too.

He said it himself – Kimi Antonelli is bringing the party to Vegas! The Mercedes rookie is celebrating his first race at the Las Vegas Strip Circuit with a very apt chrome-infused helmet design.

Safe to say you won't be able to miss him as he flies past the iconic Vegas landmarks this weekend – that shiny chrome will reflect the Strip lights like a disco ball, which feels exactly on-brand for the vibe Kimi is bringing!

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Leclerc: 'The best thing I can do is keep doing my best'

There are plenty of talking points ahead of the Las Vegas Grand Prix, with the F1 TV crew here to run through them all.

The Formula 1 paddock reconvenes this weekend for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, with plenty of topics up for discussion during the media day.

Drivers' Championship leader Lando Norris enters this weekend with a healthy 24-point lead over McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri after back-to-back wins in Mexico City and Sao Paulo, but has warned against the same this weekend.

The circuit's unique high-speed, low-downforce configuration along with cold temperatures has not been a happy hunting ground for McLaren since the location was added to the Formula calendar in 2023.

Piastri, meanwhile, says ""there have been some tough lessons to learn"" having failed to reach the podium in the last five Grands Prix which has also seen him lose a 34-point lead over Norris.

Max Verstappen also remains in contention for a fifth back-to-back title, the Red Bull driver 49 points behind Norris, and admitted he was ""proud"" to have closed a gap that once stood as high as 104 points.

Kimi Antonelli enters this weekend off the back of his best result so far in F1, claiming ""a bit of a tough"" meeting earlier in the season has spurred him, while Gabriel Bortoleto revealed the reasons for his huge Sao Paulo Sprint crash.

Join Laura Winter, Lawrence Barretto, James Hinchcliffe and Ruth Buscombe on Weekend Warm-Up for all of the above and much more.

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Leclerc: 'The best thing I can do is keep doing my best'

After a dreadful weekend in Sao Paulo, Gabriel Bortoleto is looking to bounce back in Las Vegas.

Gabriel Bortoleto has revealed the cause of his heavy crash during the Sprint in Sao Paulo, with the Kick Sauber driver looking to bounce back this weekend in the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

The Brazilian endured a torrid weekend in front of his home fans at the previous round, having suffered a massive accident in Saturday's Sprint, which in turn meant he failed to take part in Qualifying before he retired on the opening lap of the Grand Prix because of another accident.

His crash at Turn 1 during the Sprint was one of the biggest accidents of the season, registering 57g but which he was able to walk away from uninjured.

Ahead of this weekend's race in Las Vegas, the Formula 1 rookie admitted that a combination of factors led to the accident as he went for an overtake on Alex Albon's Williams ahead.

“I think it was a mixture of things. Basically, when I hit the brakes, the DRS was still in the closing procedure, so it was not fully closed,"" he said.

""I had big rear locking because of that. It was obviously very bumpy at the end of the straight in Sao Paulo, so when I hit the brakes, I also hit a bump in that specific moment, so my rear locked completely, and the DRS was still closing, so I literally spun to the inside wall.

""So I think it was a mixture of things, and lots of learning of what to do if I need to divebomb to the inside again next year, and we move on.”

Bortoleto has claimed five points finishes in his maiden season of F1 so far, with his most recent coming in Mexico City as Sauber remain in a tight battle in the Constructors' Championship, just 20 points behind Racing Bulls three places ahead in the standings.

Las Vegas poses a unique challenge on the F1 calendar with its track layout and cold conditions, the latter of which Bortoleto believes is the most critical element this weekend.

“Conditions – it's very cold here, so to put the tyres up into the temperature, we saw last year a lot of people doing preparation laps before starting the push laps, even in quali,"" he said.

""I think it's a bit of a special track for this sense. It's very high speed as well, very low downforce, so it's not something that helps to bring the tyres up to temperature.

""It's my first time here, so I have a lot to experience as well and understand what to do, but from my learning looking at the past years, that is the main thing.”

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Leclerc: 'The best thing I can do is keep doing my best'

After taking his best result in F1 so far last time in Sao Paulo, Kimi Antonelli has high hopes this weekend in Las Vegas.

Kimi Antonelli has revealed that ""a bit of a tough"" meeting earlier in the season has spurred him on to a run of strong results recently, with the Mercedes driver eyeing another this weekend in Las Vegas.

The Formula 1 rookie claimed his best result so far last time out in Sao Paulo, finishing second having also finished runner-up in the Sprint as well that weekend.

It meant the Italian has finished in the points five times in the last six races, which is in stark contrast to the barren run he had in the middle of the season, which included six pointless races in seven that was only broken by his maiden podium in Canada.

Ahead of the Las Vegas GP this weekend, Antonelli said that a meeting with Mercedes management allowed him to refocus and put his season back on track.

“After Monza, we had a big meeting – a bit of a tough one – but it was good,"" he said. ""It really helped me to reset and to refocus on the task and on the important things, so I think it was a new beginning after the difficult period.

“Brazil was just a matter of putting the weekend together, doing a good Sprint Quali, a good Sprint race, and then a good Quali and a good race. The main difference was that for the first time this season, I was able to put the full weekend together and to be consistently up there.

He added: ""Obviously, after Monza, after the meeting, I recognised that I needed to change something, and that's why I reset and realised again what to focus on, what task, and also on the basics, trying to drive well and put things together. I know that if I do all of these things right, the result will come by itself.”

Las Vegas has been a strong track for Mercedes since it was added to the calendar in 2023, with the cold conditions suiting the German manufacturer's car as George Russell took victory 12 months ago, leading home team mate Lewis Hamilton.

Despite it being a new venue for Antonelli, the 20-year-old was optimistic on his chances.

“It's another new track, so it's always very exciting coming into a new track,"" he said.

""Obviously, it's very different conditions to what we've been used to recently; it's very cold and unexpectedly wet.

""It looks like it's going to be wet probably as well for FP2 tomorrow, so it's going to be interesting to see. But as always, we're trying to focus on the process, trying to learn the track as quickly as possible and get up to speed.

“Last year was good. It doesn't mean we're going to be good this year as well, but I really hope we can be as strong as last year, and on my side, I'll try to deliver the best result possible and to enjoy it as well.”

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Leclerc: 'The best thing I can do is keep doing my best'

Having fallen 24 points behind Lando Norris in the title battle, Oscar Piastri is looking to bounce back in the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

Oscar Piastri admits that ""there have been some tough lessons to learn"" over recent races as he looks to fight back against McLaren team mate and title rival Lando Norris in the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

The Australian has been on a tough run of form, having seen a 34-point lead over Norris after his last victory in Zandvoort turn into a 24-point deficit, with the 24-year-old only taking one podium in the last six Grands Prix.

Ahead of the Las Vegas Grand Prix this weekend, Piastri refuted claims that Norris was controlling mentality in the team and that his own performances were to blame for falling behind in the title race.

""I think, for me, it's more been that the last few races have been difficult for myself,"" he said.

""There's been different reasons for all of that, but I think in terms of the way I've gone about racing and the way the team has supported me, the way we set up the car and things like that, it has all been identical through the whole season.

“For me, it's just that there have been some tough lessons to learn, some tough moments to have to accept, and nothing more than that.

""For me, I'm trying to do the same things I've done every weekend this season. Some weekends, that has worked better than others, but I feel that as long as I can get the most out of what I'm aiming to achieve, that's all I can ask for.”

With only three Grands Prix and one Sprint remaining this season, just 83 points are available in order for Piastri to overcome Norris in the title battle.

Historically, Las Vegas has been a difficult venue for McLaren since it was introduced to the calendar in 2023, with Norris wary of his chances this weekend due to the street circuit's high-speed, low downforce nature and cold temperatures.

“In terms of driving style, we'll have to see what we get,"" added Piastri.
""Vegas is very specific to – or very unique in conditions, and the downforce level, the temperatures, the track surface, so we'll see what we get.

“But from a mindset point of view, I'm just trying to get the most out of what I can do. Drive as well as I can, adapt as well as I can to whatever it needs, try and get the car in the right place, and do that as often as I can, basically.

""From that side of things, that's what you aim to do every weekend, and this weekend is the same in that.”

The two comedies have pulled in solid audiences so far in their first seasons.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	After solid starts to their inaugural seasons on HBO, The Chair Company and I Love LA will get a chance to go further.


	HBO has renewed both first-year comedies for another season. The pickups come with two episodes remaining in The Chair Company's season and midway through I Love LA's run. HBO and HBO Max chairman and CEO Casey Bloys announced the renewals at a press session Thursday, along with a pickup of first-year drama Task.




	“We're thrilled by the incredible response to The Chair Company and I Love LA debuts,” said Amy Gravitt, executive vp HBO Programming and Head of HBO and HBO Max comedy series. “Both shows confidently carry on the HBO comedy tradition, in their own singular way.  We couldn't be happier to continue collaborating with Tim, Zach, Rachel, and their exceptional teams.”

The Chair Company, co-created by Tim Robinson and Zach Kanin, stars Robinson (I Think You Should Leave) as a guy who, after an embarrassing incident at his job, finds himself investigating a conspiracy. The series had HBO's best comedy premiere in five years and is currently averaging 3.3 million viewers on HBO and HBO Max, a figure that will continue to grow (HBO measures audiences for 90 days after a premiere). 


	Lake Bell, Sophia Lillis, Will Price and Joseph Tudisco also star in The Chair Company, and Lou Diamond Phillips has a recurring role. Robinson and Kanin executive produce with Adam McKay and Todd Schulman for HyperObject Industries, Andrew DeYoung, and Igor Srubshchik. DeYoung and Aaron Schimberg direct.

	











Rachel Sennott created and stars in I Love LA, which centers on a group of friends navigating love and work in Los Angeles; Jordan Firstman, Josh Hutcherson, Odessa A'zion and True Whitaker also star. I Love LA is averaging 2 million cross-platform viewers to date, ranking second to The Chair Company as the highest-rated first-year comedies in platform history (although much of that history, obviously, predates the streaming era and HBO Max).


	Sennott executive produces with Emma Barrie, Aida Rodgers, Max Silvestri, and Lorene Scafaria. Sennott, Scafaria, Bill Benz and Kevin Bray directed the first season.

The Tony winner will portray Bobby Darin in the Broadway show for the last time March 29, 2026.


							By 

	Lexi Carson


Associate Editor


Jonathan Groff‘s time as Bobby Darin is coming to a close.


	Groff is set for his final performance of Just in Time on March 29, 2026. In the Broadway show, which began previews March 31, 2025, Groff portrays the legendary singer-actor throughout his life and rise to fame at the Circle in the Square Theatre that's transformed into a 1950s and '60s-style nightclub. However, even though Groff's run will be over in March, the jukebox musical isn't, as Groff's replacement will be announced at a later date.




	The actor developed the show over eight years, and went to visit the Circle in the Square Theatre the day after he won his first Tony Award in 2024 for Merrily We Roll Along, in which he starred with Daniel Radcliffe, who also took home his first Tony for his role in the musical.

	At the top of the show in Just in Time, the actor introducing himself, saying, “Hi, I'm Jonathan Groff.” He spoke to The Hollywood Reporter earlier this year about how this show has helped him connect with the audience. “It felt like the opportunity to tell the story of Bobby Darin's life in front of a live audience, that's where he was, at the height of his powers. That is the place to tell his story,” he said. “Even removing the artifice of character at the very beginning and really establishing this connection between performer and audience was the most effective way to celebrate what he did to a room when he was in it. So I wanted to start the show as myself, and we spent years trying to figure out how we would make that work and how we would do it.”

	The Mindhunter star also spoke about the extensive training he's had to endure to maintain his stamina, as the show requires a lot of dancing. “Shannon Lewis, our amazing choreographer, she [worked with] me three times a week for 10 weeks before the first day of rehearsal. We were in the studio, and she taught me her physical warm-up, which is a 30-minute warm-up, which I still do every day before the show, to get my body ready,” he said. “It's like training for a marathon physically, this role, and I'm learning a lot about my body, and I'm in the best shape I've ever been in my whole life.”


	The role earned him his fourth Tony nomination and he was nominated alongside his former Glee co-star Darren Criss, who ultimately won.


Just in Time features a book by Warren Leight (Side Man) and Isaac Oliver (Intimacy Idiot). It was developed and directed by Tony Award winner Alex Timbers (Moulin Rouge), and also stars Sarah Hyland, Sadie Dickerson, Michele Pawk, Joe Barbara, Emily Bergl, Lance Roberts, Caesar Samayoa, Claire Camp, Julia Grondin, Valeria Yamin, John Treacy Egan, Tari Kelly, Matt Magnusson, Khori Michelle Petinaud and Larkin Reilly.

	The forthcoming Sony sequel film's team took to Instagram on Wednesday to share the first photo of the franchise stars in costume following the recent start of production. Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black are featured in the image that includes the caption, “Look who's on the loose.”




	Among those posting the photo was Hart, who added the caption, “Back in action and loving it…I missed you Jumanji.… This one will be our biggest!”

	This film follows 2017's Jumanji: The Next Level, which rebooted the franchise after Robin Williams starred in a 1995 feature version adapting Chris Van Allsburg's 1981 children's book. Jake Kasdan, who directed the 2017 movie and its 2019 sequel, returns to helm the untitled third film from a script he co-wrote with Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg. It hits theaters Dec. 11, 2026.

	











	The day prior, Johnson posted a video to Instagram of himself surprising fans on the Universal Studios backlot as he made his way to the set. “A little day one of Jumanji excitement,” the star said in the footage. “So good to be shooting in Los Angeles. I have not shot a film in Los Angeles in…I don't know when, so it feels so good to bring a production back home to Los Angeles.”


	He went on to reveal that his character will be wearing a necklace containing the dice that was used in the 1995 movie. “This is the dice from the original Jumanji with Robin Williams as a show of respect and a way of honoring Robin and this entire franchise that he started as we film our very last Jumanji,” Johnson explained. 

	











	The cast for the forthcoming film includes Nick Jonas, Alex Wolff, Morgan Turner, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman, Lamorne Morris and Danny DeVito.


	Last week, Johnson posted footage and images to Instagram from the new movie's table read. “Amazing to get the whole gang back together, and our jaws were hurting from laughing so hard,” he wrote.


Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle focused on a group of teenage friends getting trapped inside a video game as a collection of adult avatars. It hit theaters in December 2017 and surpassed $950 million at the global box office. The 2019 sequel, subtitled The Next Level, topped $801 million globally.

The president took to his social media platform to renew his feud with the ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' host after an Epstein-focused monologue.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	U.S. President Donald Trump has renewed his beef with late night show host Jimmy Kimmel with a call for ABC to take him off the air, again.


	“Why does ABC Fake News keep Jimmy Kimmel, a man with NO TALENT and VERY POOR TELEVISION RATINGS, on the air? Why do the TV Syndicates put up with it? Also, totally biased coverage. Get the bum off the air!!!” Trump wrote late Wednesday night on his Truth Social platform.




	His social media post followed Kimmel in a late night show monologue suggesting Trump “loses his mind” every time he is asked why he hadn't released the so-called Jeffrey Epstein files. Asking for Kimmel to be yanked also comes two days after Trump called for ABC's broadcast license to be revoked after an ABC News reporter asked again why he had chosen not to release the government's files on the late convicted sex offender Epstein.

	That was followed by successful votes on Capitol Hill to get all government Epstein files released and Trump in a reversal signing the legislation when it came to his desk at the White House. Reigniting the feud with Kimmel also followed Disney's ABC deciding to temporarily preempt its marquee late night show in September following monologue comments he made in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination.


	Kimmel was soon back on the airwaves, however. His benching came in the wake of monologue jokes referencing MAGA Republicans scrambling to distance their politics from the ideologies of conservative pundit Kirk's alleged shooter Tyler Robinson.


	The remarks were interpreted by many on the right as an incorrect classification of Robinson's beliefs and a direct or indirect placement of blame for Kirk's murder on extreme-right politics. Kimmel made an emotional return to hosting his late night show, before getting back to his normal programming that routinely mocks Trump during opening monologues.

The memes that have deepened our relationships with our favorite pop stars for the last two decades and beyond. 


	We think of the iconicity of our favorite 21st century pop stars mostly in terms of the ways we had for long before: smash hits and blockbuster albums, classic music videos and sold-out tours, bold fashion statements and unforgettable TV and film appearances. But in the past 20 years, another crucial way in which these artists enter pop culture immortality has emerged, and it's the one they have close to zero control over.


	Memes have become an essential mode for how very online pop fans — basically all pop fans in 2025 — celebrate, engage with and occasionally even lightly poke fun at their favorite pop stars. But those pop stars don't write, plan or release those memes, and often times they either refuse to interact with them or don't acknowledge them until they've long run their course. They may occasionally drop a video or post or performance with one or more highly memeable moments, but whether or not they hit is still at the mercy of the wild and unpredictable whims of the internet, and what we all choose to latch onto. That's the beauty of pop star memes: They're truly up to us to decide on, and they can't ever be forced.


	But while there have been countless lists over the decades of the greatest pop albums, singles, videos and performances, there have been far fewer celebrating the greatest such internet moments. We at Billboard are hoping to start correcting that, with our list of the 100 greatest pop star memes of all time — collecting all the most legendary memes directly or even indirectly involving pop hitmakers of note.


	By “all time,” of course, we're mostly talking about those past 20 years — when the social media age permanently changed the way we interacted with culture and with one another, and gave these memes multiple global platforms over which to reach ubiquity. But we also threw in a few pre-digital examples to show how these adaptable forms of in-jokey fan-artist interactions may have greater opportunity for mass exposure in the 21st century, but they existed in the culture well before that. And we're also going right up to present day — with 2025 giving us some already-legendary memes from Justin Bieber, Kendrick Lamar, Morgan Wallen and plenty more.


	Check out our list below, enjoy reliving a lifetime in iconic pop star memes, and feel free to let us know about the dozens saved to your phone you can't believe we left out.








Type: Insta-Quotable 


Why It Resonates: Sourced from an instantly viral 2013 clip of Rihanna seemingly pretending to remember a gift a fan gave her in the past, this hilarious quote perfectly captures the feeling of trying to play off almost getting caught in a lie. 


Best Used For: Continuing to contribute to a conversation you know damn well you have no clue about. — KYLE DENIS


Type: Wait What?


Why It Resonates: Nobody really knows why Oscar-nominated actress Juliette Lewis was so inspired by her in-car “Work Bitch” jam session to call on Britney Spears to “save us [from] Satan controlling the universe,” but both her pleading and her bopping remain eminently relateable. (As does her questioning of whether we even merit Britney's grace: “Can we be saved?”)


Best Used For: Reacting to any of the most recent developments with the demonic figures who legitimately are currently controlling the universe. — ANDREW UNTERBERGER


Type: Insta-Quotable 


Why It Resonates: Taken from a 2018 Breakfast Club interview on Power 105.1 AM, Banks uttered this hilarious phrase in response to an awkward exchange between her and hosts Charlamagne tha God and DJ Envy. After Charlamagne mentioned that an intern said Banks “made music for gays,” the rapper responded, “I do,” before pointedly turning to look across the table at DJ Envy. “I'm not the intern, she looked at me like I'm the intern,” Envy nervously chuckled, leading into a brief moment of silence before Banks asked, “So… what now?” 


Best Used For: In response to any stupid/nonsensical question or to move on for the moment of silence that follows humbling somebody. — K.D.


Type: Singular Expression


Why It Resonates: Seven years after Jaden Smith's interview on Big Boy TV, the second-gen star's semi-out of touch attempt to differentiate himself from his peers remains in the internet's lexicon — because, after all, there is a lot to talk about regarding the political and economic state of the world right now.


Best Used For: Ironically cutting through the noise, acknowledging that something is unimportant in the grand scheme of things and demonstrating your intellectual superiority to your peers. — MEGHAN MAHAR


Type: Universal Application


Why It Resonates: Sometimes in life, you show up somewhere in the hopes of having a good time, only to find out that — usually more from the larger universe than from a specific Trent Reznor type — you're seeing the wrong f–king band for that. Hopefully when that happens, you've at least got NIN-like synthesizers to play you out. 


Best Used For: Sports, mostly. — A.U.


Type: Insta-Quotable


Why It Resonates: Meme aside, Tove Lo's name pronunciation isn't so straightforward for non-Swedish speakers. But the randomness of Megan Thee Stallion's attempted pronunciation, in full glam amid Instagram Live chaos, is what makes the clip hilarious. And what a full circle moment when the two linked up for a quick lip-sync to the meme in 2023!


Best Used For: Whenever Swedish dance-pop singer Tove Lo comes up in conversation — or if her 2014 hit “Habits (Stay High)” comes on in the club. “PERIODT!” — DANIELLE PASCUAL


Type: Universal Application  


Why It Resonates: The Grammy-nominated, Hot 100 top 10 hit from Gunna's DS4Ever album entered the zeitgeist at the top of 2022 to represent keeping it real, promoting positivity or getting paper – and countless corporations couldn't stop using the song (and its quickly unavoidable associated emoji) that contagious optimism.  


Best Used For: Responding positively to any given situation. — HERAN MAMO


Type: Classic Reaction


Why It Resonates: It's a pretty great photo of any kid: the little half smirk, lifted eyebrows, hand on the hip and concerned look into the camera. But the fact that it's Cardi B, of all people, is what made this meme go far. X users took the throwback pic to a new level when paired with phrases prefixed with “My momma said […]” — just as kids use their parents to rationalize anything — and now, Bardigang will never let Cardi live it down. 


Best Used For: Commanding attention, needing an excuse to get out of something or knowingly being a know-it-all. — D.P.


Type: Insta-Quotable / Classic Reaction


Why It Resonates: “Did you just say ‘wig?'” Katy Perry asked Noah Davis, a contestant auditioning for American Idol. Her eagerness to return the “wig” and demonstrate allyship to the gay singer translated to viewers as cringeworthy, but the positive intention and confusion it created amongst Perry's fellow judges Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan made the moment go viral.


Best Used For: Any situation in which one would use “wig” as slang, or in response to someone who is doing so, either affirmingly or in playful reference to Perry's viral moment. — M.M.


Type: Proto-Meme 


Why It Resonates: This 1999 Funny or Die clip pre-dates what we now understand to be memes, but Warwick's giggly outburst at the separation of LaToya Jackson's name from “some of the top performers of our day” is still hilarious. 


Best Used For: Shading the odd person/thing out of a group. — K.D. 


Type: Classic Reaction


Why It Resonates: Have you ever listened to music that you're so deeply moved by that it leaves you speechless? This is a seemingly common experience for Addison Rae, who loves music so much that she expressed it across a handful of posts that, when shared together, create a reaction that only Addison herself could create.


Best Used For: Showing appreciation for any music that is powerful, lovable, speaks to you or is “wow.” – M.M.


Type: Classic Reaction


Why It Resonates: The late great Takeoff was riding high on the Migos' incredible Culture-era run in 2017, and it felt reasonable that he wasn't going to let anyone drag him down by pointing out that, technically, he didn't get a verse on the group's biggest hit of the period. (And to be honest, no, he didn't look like it. )


Best Used For: When someone is trying to dull your shine with some needless (if not totally inaccurate) detail-harping. — A.U.


Type: Wait What?


Why It Resonates: In February 2023, pop culture repost account @PopBase posted a photo of North West's incredibly accurate drawing of her grandmother, Kris Jenner. A user replied, saying “Why she ate,” a way of complimenting West. Then, an account called @sexxtbook replied saying “she=Onika ate=burgers,” a nonsensical way of bringing Nicki Minaj, whose real name is Onika, into the conversation. The crazy tweet became an inside joke on the internet for any Barb, or Barb-adjacent person with an insane amount of daily screentime.


Best Used For: Not easy to use in its totality, but one can use the formula and apply it to any simple sentence to add some absurdity into the conversation. For example, one user posted a screenshot of his mother texting him “your father and I are getting a divorce.” And he replied “your father and I = Onika a Divorce=burgers.” — KRISTIN ROBINSON


Type: Wait What? 


Why It Resonates: Because of how ridiculous the accusation was. Let's play it back: Harry Styles, about to take a seat next to Chris Pine for a Don't Worry Darling Venice Film Festival screening, puckers his lips with his head tilted down in his co-star's direction. At the same moment, Pine freezes mid applause and pointedly looks down at his lap. “Spitgate” was the internet debate of 2022 — until it was squashed by Pine's rep, who told Billboard that the viral video was “the result of an odd online illusion that is clearly deceiving and allows for foolish speculation” and clarified: Just to be clear, Harry Styles did NOT spit on Chris Pine.”


Best Used For: Reminiscing about how crazy the Don't Worry Darling press run was. — D.P.


Type: Lore-Builder / Singular Expression 


Why It Resonates: Posed on IG in 2020, Lana Del Rey's question for the culture asked why other female pop stars (notably she named mostly Black women) can get hits singing about non-traditional themes while she gets chastised as “glamorizing abuse.” In between completely ignoring the different reality and reception of Black women pop stars' work and poorly wording the rest of her open letter, Lana had a point about the unique way her music and image have been received and critiqued over the years. Nonetheless, over the past half-decade, the absurdity of the surprise question and the immediate “WTF?!” of it all transformed Lana's inquiry into a deeply ironic meme. 


Best Used For: Posing a question and pretending it's profound or controversial, when it's really not anything of the sort. — K.D.


Type: Universal Application


Why It Resonates: In the never-ending Fan Wars of social media, @KingBeyonceStan added a new arrow to the quiver of pop soldiers everywhere with a 2016 tweet storm against Queen Bey's supposed vocal rivals, ending every critical missive with “She doesn't have the range.” The victims? Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber and even Adele, but Mariah Carey was spared: “She has the range,” they conceded. (Note: This almost enters Proto-Meme territory, since the phrase originated in a sketch on the 2003-06 series Little Britain, but @KingBeyonceStan took it to the moon.)


Best Used For: At this point, vocal critique is too obvious; it's far funnier outside musical context. Case in point. — KATIE ATKINSON 


Type: Calendar Perennial


Why It Resonates: Of course, it's in part because “All I Want for Christmas Is You” continues to dominate the holidays — reaching No. 1 on the Hot 100 for seven straight years and counting! But it's also because, like Mariah herself, “it's tiiiime” is delightfully extra. As is now tradition, Carey kicks off the yuletide season every November 1st by releasing a new video announcing her annual return (last year's featured her emerging from a Han Solo-esque block of ice to sing the now-iconic words), forever ensuring she remains the self-proclaimed Queen of Christmas.


Best Used For: When the clock strikes midnight on Halloween and you're already unpacking your Christmas decorations and trimming your tree, officially commencing the holiday season. Or, you know, any other time you want to channel that giddy anticipation for something you've been eagerly awaiting. — XANDER ZELLNER


Type: Classic Reaction


Why It Resonates: Travis Scott's music in the 2010s often sounded suspended in free-fall, so it was almost too perfect to get a clip of him seemingly stepping right into the abyss while onstage with Drake, with a hauntingly truncated Auto-Tuned warble (“eeyehh“) as his last will and testament. (He was fine.)


Best Used For: When you need to make an abrupt exit from somewhere — preferably from this entire dimension. — A.U. 


Type: Proto-Meme / Universal ApplicationWhy It Resonates: The spoken phrase that opens “Man! I Feel Like a Woman,” Shania Twain's eighth single from her 1997 smash album Come On Over, became a rallying cry of sisterhood as much as an undeniable promise of a good time — one that endured well into the social media era.


Best Used For: Any girls — or gays — night out, but especially for bachelorette parties. — MELINDA NEWMAN


Type: Singular Expression


Why It Resonates: Is it really a scarf? Surely that must be a blanket. Do they even make scarves that big? The paparazzi photo continues to mystify due to its sheer audacity. Kravitz is no stranger to bold fashion statements (see: Kravitz's complicated history with leather pants), but the massive scarf reached new levels of fashion lore. Who else could make a scarf of that size look so effortlessly cool? If anything, it helped solidify Kravitz's place in the pantheon of rock-star fashion legends. You must respect his commitment (both to fashion and methods of staying warm).


Best Used For: The scarf? Best on a brisk autumn day when the last thing you want is to feel the crisp air. As for the meme — maybe as a way of expressing your decision to step out in something bold or slightly ridiculous. — X.Z.


Type: Insta-Quotable


Why It Resonates: Justin Timberlake certainly didn't need one more thing for people to give him crap for in the mid-2020s, but at least this one was gleefully harmless: a young JT, as recalled by his then-girlfriend Britney Spears in her now-memoir, greeting R&B star Ginuwine with unforgettable white-boy try-hard pizzazz. Rounding out the meme's star-powered brilliance: Oscar-nominated actress Michelle Williams, really putting her whole chest into her rendering of the quote for the audio book. 


Best Used For: When your excitement over being in the proximity of a particularly cool celebrity makes you lose all powers of self-consciousness or self-editing. — A.U.


Type: Insta-Quotable / Universal Application


Why It Resonates: The phrase went viral in 2024 after a fan quote tweeted that some of the Katy Perry album covers “might be Clairo shade.” It was quite the stretch… So now, anything and everything can be Clairo shade! A tweet about President Biden talking about Vladimir Putin was virally quote tweeted “this might be Clairo shade” soon after the meme took off, taking it to new heights.


Best Used For: Basically — if you want to use it correctly, ask if something is Clairo shade in any situation that Clairo has absolutely nothing to do with! — K.R.


Type: Lore-Builder 


Why It Resonates: In 2014, Taylor Swift was still seen more or less as pop music's “good girl,” which made it all the more absurd when someone on Tumblr shared a teenage photo of her and claimed that it was their cousin Becky who'd “snorted marijuana” and “died instantly” at a party — after which they famously shot down one commenter's insistence that it was actually a photo of the singer with a curt “no its becky.” What solidified the exchange as a quintessential meme (in the Swiftie community, at least) was when Swift herself stepped out wearing a “no its becky” T-shirt, proving that she, too, was in on the joke. 


Best Used For: As a response to pretty much any photo of Taylor Swift, but it goes especially far in instances where a casual observer in the comments expresses confusion over the identity of the photo's subject (something that's exceedingly rare now that she's the most famous woman in the world). — HANNAH DAILEY


Type: Universal Application


Why It Resonates: In the title track of her studio album, Ari sings about her exes, saying “One taught me love / One taught me patience / One taught me pain” — causing a slew of comedic adaptations of the format online, with people in every world from entertainment to sports and politics getting in on the fun. 


Best Used For: When you want to compare three things and how they make you feel. — DENISE WARNER


Type: Universal Application


Why It Resonates: Because stan Twitter/X loves any excuse to be a hater. People randomly woke up one day and decided to collectively blame Gracie Abrams for anything they don't like — even if it has nothing to do with her. Didn't get tickets to Ariana Grande's upcoming tour? Blocked Gracie Abrams. Phone on 5%? Blocked Gracie Abrams. Forgot a crucial ingredient at the grocery store? Blocked Gracie Abrams.


Best Used For: Rectifying any negative experience. — D.P.


Type: Universal Application


Why It Resonates: Morgan Wallen may or may not have been dissing SNL either when he left the set more abruptly than expected following his March performance, or when he captioned a later Instagram post of himself apparently flying home with “Get me to God's country” But that caption immediately became cultural shorthand for being somewhere you feel you don't belong and needing to get back to your safe place — perhaps a little overdramatically so.


Best Used For: Captioning a vision of your own particular version of paradise — like, say, an announcement of new Hilary Duff live dates. — A.U.


Type: Wait What?Why It Resonates: Meek Mill is one of those artists where anything he does can instantly turn into meme ammo against him. Displaying soggy, chlorine-splattered fries is one of those wtf moments, making you ask yourself — why is Meek trying to flex on us right now?Best Used For: Any situation where two clashing things shouldn't be in the same place or situation, turning our brains into a mental pretzel. — MICHAEL SAPONARA


Type: Singular Expression


Why It Resonates: At her animated '90s peak, Whitney's full-bodied energy was infectious — if occasionally somewhat alarming — and no moment captured that better than this eminently reusable BET Awards clip of the pop and R&B legend getting so into the groove of her acceptance speech's extended thank-yous that she turns it into a little shoulder-shrugging boogie.


Best Used For: When you're feeling yourself and your people to a near-comical extent. — A.U.


Type: Insta-Quotable


Why It Resonates: “When we post our presales, we be surpassing the Bible, and that's crazy,” said Lil' Kim in a 2023 Instagram Live about her The Queen Bee memoir. “And the thing is it's, like, the Bible. I don't take that lightly. Y'all already know that.“ Needless to say, Kim's memoir did not surpass the Bible by any measure of consumption. 


Best Used For: Celebrating a purely delusional win; reminiscing on your favorite off-the-wall celebrity remarks. — K.D. 


Type: Wait What? 


Why It Resonates: Back in the days of novelty social media accounts, Lorde hopped on the train with a secret Instagram account that reviewed different onion rings. “I sort of naively didn't realize it would be like a thing. That I was going to different places and trying the onion rings at each of those places,” she explained to Jimmy Fallon in 2017. “I think it reads like the kind of a thing a pop star would do to look relatable.”


Best Used For: A demonstration of an unlikely secret obsession. Or just a fun fact at parties. — D.W.


Type: Insta-Quotable 


Why It Resonates: Wendy Williams was notorious for mispronouncing celebrity names on her daytime talk show, but there was something instantly iconic about referring to Dua Lipa as “Dula Peep.” Maybe our brains were just collectively fried during the pandemic, but it stuck! 


Best Used For: Lovingly referring to three-time Grammy winning pop star behind “Levitating” and “Dance the Night.” — K.D.


Type: Classic Reaction 


Why It Resonates: Lobbed at red-carpet photographers while Grande was at the Billboard Music Awards in 2016, this phrase is quite possibly the most succinct – and sassiest — way of shutting down anyone who tries to get under your skin. Combine that with the built-in ponytail flip that even just saying these words evokes, and you've got the perfect way of communicating that you don't give a f–k that rivals the classic “I don't think about you at all” moment from Mad Men. 


Best Used For: Anytime someone tries to call you out for something that you simply could not care less about. Observe: Yeah, I licked a donut that I didn't pay for. And what about it? — H.D.


Type: Proto-Meme


Why It Resonates: It was a TV commercial that became a generational rallying cry. The idea was to get fans to call their local cable operators, who were initially reluctant to add this upstart 24-hour video channel, and demand that they do so. MTV enlisted such stars as Mick Jagger, David Bowie and Billy Idol to say the catchphrase on camera. Sting even sang the line in Dire Strait's “Money for Nothing,” a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.


Best Used For: When you want something and you want it now. – PAUL GREIN


Type: Classic ReactionWhy It Resonates: Jay-Z pulled up to a 2008 Coldplay performance of “Lovers in Japan” in London and nodded along, lending his approval, but still displaying a certain level of uneasiness, showing he wasn't fully committed. In the process, Hov became a meme that's long been a staple of music Twitter.Best Used For: When fans want to show they're enjoying a song or a sound that ended up being way better than they originally expected. — M.S.


Type: Lore-Builder


Why It Resonates: Fifth Harmony's attempt to create visual cohesion created buzz (but perhaps not in the way they hoped) as they surrounded a bulldozer to mirror the theme of their music video. Why was Ally Brooke hammering a tire? Why was Lauren drilling the bulldozer? Because they're pop stars, not construction workers. Duh.


Best Used For: Drawing a parallel to visual chaos, nonsensical maneuvering, or demonstrating helplessness humorously as one would say, “I'm just a girl.” — M.M.


Type: Lore-Builder / Singular Expression


Why It Resonates: Pre-“Espresso,” it gave Carpenter runaway Emails I Can't Send hit a life of its own. During her shows following the release of her 2022 album, it became tradition for her to change the final lyrics to her song “Nonsense” — usually by paying tribute to wherever she was performing with a sexual innuendo. For example, opening for Taylor Swift's Eras tour in Mexico City: “Felt so good he made me hit the top note/ Eras tickets, girl you won the lotto!/ Mexico, I kinda think te amo.” 


Best Used For: A key part of the origin story surrounding Sabrina Carpenter's NSFW songwriting – or if you're feeling particularly frisky, some provocative punning of your own. — D.P.


Type: Insta-Quotable / Universal Application


Why It Resonates: There's a reason that on The Tortured Poets Department – Taylor Swift's longest album to date – there was one line that rose above the verbose pack. Whether it was the Glee choir room, the Tumblr log-in page or the perpetual Ticketmaster queue, social media users shared their own “asylums” in droves, aka the corners of the Internet and pop culture that made them who they are today.


Best Used For: The most obscure, now-obsolete video games you ever played, like one based on Disney Channel's The Suite Life of Zack and Cody. — K.A.


Type: Insta-Quotable


Why It Resonates: The moment on the 2022 Oscars when Will Smith strode to the stage and slapped Chris Rock across the face for telling a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, was shocking enough, but just as shocking was what came next. Smith returned to his seat and twice shouted, “Keep my wife's name out [of] your f–king mouth!” The incident was a complete 180 from the genial, nice-guy image Smith had cultivated over the previous 35 years, and instantly entered pop culture immortality.


Best Used For: “I just lost it,” Smith said on The Daily Show With Trevor Noah eight months later, in an attempt to explain his bizarre behavior. So, “The Slap” incident captures that moment when you just lose it – your cool, your temper, and maybe part of your reputation. – P.G.


Type: Lore-Builder


Why It Resonates: It's one of the essential pop star/fan interactions of the 21st century: Before the explosion of online stan culture, “Anthony Cosby-Hypen-Knowles” was the center of a moment from Beyoncé's 2009 I Am… Tour that the BeyHive will never forget. “Are you my cousin?” Bey asked him from the stage after seemingly having read her last name on his drivers license. “I'm your husband!”… “He my husband?!”


Best Used For: Proving your place in the BeyHive. — D.P.


Type: Lore-Builder / Singular Expression 


Why It Resonates: Shared on her official Instagram account to mourn the Notting Hill Carnival the pandemic stole in 2020, this hilarious Adele flick quickly went viral for her Jamaica-tributing outfit and awkward pose. In addition, the island's biggest music stars had her back, so it was a win-win situation.  


Best Used For: Expressing that nothing can stop you from being a baddie. — K.D.


Type: Universal ApplicationWhy It Resonates: If comedy derives from contrast, this 2020 meme had serious legs: LISA's glorious gams are simply unmatched next to the comparatively shabby torsos of Stephen Colbert, Spock and BoJack Horseman.  Best Used For: Lightening the mood during quarantine. — ABBY WEBSTER


Type: Lore-Builder


Why It Resonates: Dopamine finally arrived in 2024, and one dedicated Twitter fan faithfully waited for five years for Normani's debut album. Every year, the user would tweet “[X number of] years… ur sick” in response to a 2018 Normani tweet that read, “I have my album title y'all.” To celebrate the album's release, Normani posed with a cake decorated with a print-out those tweets. 


Best Used For: Recalling the sometimes-unbelievable road to Normani's debut album — or badgering the next exciting new artist who's taking a little longer than you might like for LP1.  — K.D.


Type: Classic Reaction / Lore Builder


Why It Resonates: Much like Mariah Carey's classic reaction to being asked about Jennifer Lopez, although certainly less iconic, Bieber's (possibly unintended?) flippancy about his fellow Canadian hitmaker – already a rising pop star at the time – showed the “Baby” star's indifference to his competition. But don't worry, they worked it out on the remix.


Best Used For: It's an easy way to be dismissive about any person, place or thing you don't believe to quite be on your level. — D.W.


Type: Lore-Builder


Why It Resonates: Chance the Rapper had long been building a reputation as hip-hop's preeminent Wife Guy when Twitter user Charlie Winsmore jumped in — the day before new Chance album The Big Day was released — with a fake Chance song from the new album repeatedly proclaiming his marital devotion (in between “ACHH!” yelps). The meme-song went viral enough that it largely overshadowed the new album, giving Chance no choice but to play along with it on Instagram. 


Best Used For: Gently ribbing music and culture's most unapologetic Wife Guys — a category that sadly no longer includes Chance himself, as he and Kristen Corley officially divorced earlier this year. — A.U.


Type: Insta-Quotable 


Why It Resonates: Uttered at the end of a characteristically hysterical exchange between Carey and Minaj during their time on the 2013 American Idol judges panel, this prime bit of shade — concerning the difficulty and rarity of procuring a Hot 100-topping single— held up until Minaj finally earned her first No. 1 hit in 2020.


Best Used For: Throwing shade at pop stars without Hot 100 chart-toppers, of course! — K.D.


Type: Lore-Builder / Universal ApplicationWhy It Resonates: Because decades after Lady Gaga's NYU classmates (maybe? allegedly?) made a Facebook group proclaiming her inevitable languishing in obscurity — absolute origin-story catnip for Little Monsters — you could be eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and still have to resist the urge to say out loud, “Peanut Butter and Jelly, you will ALWAYS be famous.” Best Used For: Just about any situation where the legacy of a person, place or thing needs to be announced for the record — in either direction, but in no uncertain terms. — A.U.


Type: Singular ExpressionWhy It Resonates: Worlds collided when Future met Nardwuar in 2014, and unexpected gold came out of the interview when Future delivered a one-word reply to describe how he likes his cheesecake, “Sensational.” Best Used For: “Sensational” has stood the test of time as a go-to way to spice up a reply or reaction to something with a positive connotation. — M.S.


Type: Wait What?


Why It Resonates: Because never in a million years would anyone have guessed they'd see Lana Del Rey working at Waffle House in 2023. She'd just released her album Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd a few months prior, so why was she pouring coffees and serving sodas? It wasn't till a few months later that Lana revealed the real story behind her shift at the small town Alabama diner.


Best Used For: Halloween costume inspiration for pop music fans. — D.P.


Type: Proto-Meme / Classic Reaction  


Why It Resonates: When Natalie Cole won the award for favorite adult contemporary artist at the 1992 AMAs over Whitney Houston — whom she was up against in the same category several times — both women showcased the power of camaraderie over competition.  


Best Used For: Gassing up your homegirl. — H.M.


Type: Insta-Quotable 


Why It Resonates: An unserious flex that prompted hundreds of hilarious edits and recreations, Nicki Minaj's catwalk to her private plane is still the gift that keeps on giving. 


Best Used For: Whenever you're in a flexing mood, particularly about travel plans. — K.D.


Type: Lore-Builder


Why It Resonates: Like any pop star, Iggy Azalea was determined to beat the lip-syncing allegations — but perhaps adapting Kendrick Lamar's “Look Out for Detox” to her own freestyle, and doing it a cappella with an Australian accent, was too great of a risk. The performance was mind boggling and borderline indecipherable, and yet somehow it still stuck the way a catchier song could.


Best Used For: A reference point with which to roast someone's rapping or other incomprehensible babbling. — M.M.


Type: Insta-Quotable


Why It Resonates: Before skyrocketing to fame as one of the greatest female MCs of all time, Cardi B was a cast member on Love & Hip Hop: New York from 2015-2017. Her increasingly intense screaming match (with herself) during the show's season 7 reunion in 2017 still makes its rounds on social media, and to this day, we're still wondering what was the reason.


Best Used For: Needing an explanation for anything and everything. Or, getting your point across —whether or not you're ultimately right. — D.P.


Type: Insta-Quotable


Why It Resonates: Sometime in the late 2000s, disliking Nickelback became a meme of its own. The meme culminated with a still from the music video for the band's “Photograph” where frontman Chad Kroeger holds a framed photo and sings “Look at this photograph.” The internet, naturally, ran with it, swapping in silly images, and later, editing the clip so that Kroeger awkwardly declares, “Look at this graaaph,” while wielding a bar chart instead. The meme endures not just because it's funny, but because it captures the internet's long-running love-hate fascination with Nickelback.


Best Used For: Obviously, whenever you're talking about graphs. Just be sure to include your deepest- and gruffest-voiced Kroeger impression to go along with it. — X.Z.


Type: Lore-Builder


Why It Resonates: Fergie is surely not the first singer to face criticism for their delivery of the national anthem, but her performance at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game was.. unique. So much that even fans and players in the venue struggled to hold back laughter. And naturally, the laughs continued when the video went viral, and even moreso when it was remixed by Suede the Remix God.


Best Used For: Sharing an iconic performance of the national anthem that holds the power to heal our nation (with laughter). — M.M.


Type: Classic Reaction


Why It Resonates: This photo of Miley Cyrus attempting to smize (smile with your eyes, of course) but really just looking crazy with piercing blue eyes and smudged eye lined should go down in music meme history. The image was taken at the 2008 Grammy awards when the singer was just 15, and it's intense expression makes it the perfect reaction photo to many situations.


Best Used For: Trying to get the waiter to notice you at dinner? Miley Cyrus meme. Talking about how freaky some people's blue eyes are? Miley Cyrus meme. And hey, if you want to superimpose her eyes on different people's faces, you can do that too. — K.R.


Type: Wait What?


Why It Resonates: Rihanna was certainly known for her larger-than-life fashion statements by the 2015 Met Gala — just not quite this much larger. And certainly not quite this yellow, the kind of yellow that when splayed out like egg running in all directions to fill a frying pan, has you thinking less about high art or charity and more about breakfast-for-dinner. (But if anyone could ever make fantasizing about IHOP feel chic, it's Rihanna.) 


Best Used For: Noting when an artistic statement has gone all the way over the top and ended up somewhere back near the bottom. — A.U.


Type: Classic ReactionWhy It Resonates: Lil Yachty and Drake playing Genius Bar employees makes for a memorable scene from the video to the latter's diamond-certified “Life Is Good” with Future. Drizzy helps Yachty out with something on his computer and it all clicks for the Atlanta rapper after receiving the assist from the 6 God. A relatable feeling.Best Used For: It's been a staple on Twitter/X, used to mock an individual for finally understanding something fairly simple that everyone around them has already long realized. — M.S.


Type: Insta-Quotable / Singular Expression


Why It Resonates: In 2005, the Grammy nominees for best rap album were established acts including Jay-Z and the Beastie Boys — that is, except for new sensation and loudmouthed underdog Kanye West. That night, he took home the award (and two others) for The College Dropout — and in true Kanye fashion, he acknowledged the haters and critics and flexed in one fell swoop. What if he didn't win? I guess we'll never know.


Best Used For: Celebrating a major win, while dunking on the losing party. — M.M.


Type: Wait What?  


Why It Resonates: Whether she was posing for the ‘gram or it truly was a candid shot, Gomez contently peering into the distance became such a hot meme in 2023 that the actual blanket she was bundled in started flying off the shelves.  


Best Used For: Valiantly coming out on the other side of a harrowing situation – or just blissfully taking in one's current moment. — H.M.


Type: Lore Builder 


Why It Resonates: At Katy Perry's 2015 Super Bowl Halftime show, the singer – who has shown a propensity for camp on stage – included two men in shark costumes as part of her performance. The one on the right kept perfectly in time to the choreography. The one on the left did not – leading to an infamous place in social media history. (Sorry to Right Shark.)


Best Used For: Although its popularity has died down, it still makes a great Halloween costume. Just ask Justin Trudeau, who dressed up as his girlfriend's backup dancer this past holiday. “I'm the shark (to his left),” the former prime minister of Canada captioned the post. — D.W.


Type: Classic Reaction


Why It Resonates: The actress went live on Instagram in the beginning of the 2020 COVID outbreak, with a few comments shrugging off the world's attempts to contain and limit the devastation (which she later apologized for): “I'm sorry. But like it's a virus. I get it. I respect it. But at the time, even if everybody gets it, like yeah, people are gonna die, which is terrible but inevitable?”


Best Used For: If you're unbothered or straight-up insensitive about a situation, just show Hudgens' face in gif form. — D.W.


Type: Singular ExpressionWhy It Resonates: Soulja Boy has been the subject of plenty of viral moments and firsts for rappers, and he added another to his resume during a 2019 interview with The Breakfast Club, where he repeatedly said Drake's name in a puzzled tone while arguing he had the biggest comeback in hip-hop and that he taught Drake everything he knows. Best Used For: Whenever Drake's name is thrown into a debate where someone believes it shouldn't be, expect to see a reply with the gif or clip of Soulja Boy standing up in his tan Gucci headband shouting the 6 God's name. — M.S.


Type: Classic ReactionWhy It Resonates: Don't we all feel like SHINee vocalist KEY resignedly putting on a clown wig sometimes? While the K-pop star did happily don the Ronald McDonald costume IRL, this meme communicates a much more long-suffering vibe. His circus? Yup. His monkeys? Unfortunately.Best Used For: When you've found yourself — or others — entertaining the foolishness. — A.W.


Type:Calendar Perennial


Why It Resonates: It's partly the fact that May 1st comes around every year — but also partly because *NSYNC's “It's Gonna Be Me,” with its affected pronunciations, remains an enduring boy band classic. The month-turning meme would not have endured if the song wasn't such a banger. And fans agree, as the anthem now gets a major streaming boost every spring — joining such other calendar-driven staples like Earth, Wind & Fire's “September” and Taylor Swift's “August.”


Best Used For: Perhaps when you're writing a poem on April 30th: “Roses are red / April is grey / when I see you tomorrow / …” You know the rest. — X.Z.


Type: Classic ReactionWhy It Resonates: Justin Bieber had had enough of paparazzi following him and invading his privacy over the summer, so he fired back with a reply that was hilarious but also seriously got his point across. He capitalized on the viral exchange by referencing it on his SWAG album, and even releasing “It's Not Clocking to You” SWAG merch bundles. Best Used For: If you're standing firm in your stance on a certain topic and the opposition refuses to understand your point of view, let them know it's not clocking to them that you're standing on business. — M.S. 


Type: Calendar Perennial 


Why It Resonates: The internet has kept this running inside joke for the last 10 years (and counting) that the mystery, white tuxedo-clad crasher at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival is really Jason Derulo taking a tumble down the red carpeted steps of the Met. Who knows when the jig will be up?  


Best Used For: The first Monday in May, while real-time social media reports are coming in just to (literally) throw off netizens. — H.M.


Type: Insta-Quotable  


Why It Resonates: From its original appearance as a lyric in 2008's “Diva” to its revival thanks to a TikTok meme spawned by the 2023 Renaissance World Tour, this Beyoncé catchphrase — absolutely devastating when throw in your direction — has had quite the lifespan. 


Best Used For: Throwing shade at someone who just can't keep up with you. — K.D.


Type: Insta-Quotable / Lore-BuilderWhy It Resonates: Today, public figures have less privacy than ever – and social media DMs are one of the last refuges they have from prying eyes. But when these private messages leak, they often reaffirm preconceived notions about their sender's character, with gratifying results. Adam Levine's spicy Instagram DMs with the model he had an affair with are a prime example: Comically blunt messages (“It is unreal how f–king hot you are, like it blows my mind,” “Holy f–k, holy fucking f–k, that body of yours is absurd”) reveal the lithe, tattooed Maroon 5 frontman to be every bit the Lothario his internet detractors have long suspected.Best Used For: It's less usable on a regular basis than some other memes – but still gets a lift whenever a public figure's overly excited personal communications find their way out there, or whenever Levine or Maroon 5 is in the news. — ERIC RENNER BROWN


Type: Wait What?


Why It Resonates: There wasn't a lot of levity to be found amid the turmoil of 2020, particularly surrounding the brutal killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police, which started a social reckoning across the U.S. Engaging with the moment — but maybe not grasping its full scope — was French DJ David Guetta, who paid tribute to Floyd the best way he knew how: Shouting out Floyd's family during a build-up moment in his (socially distanced) live set, then sampling Martin Luther King, Jr. from his “I Have a Dream” speech for the drop. The quickly viral bit was well-intentioned but hilariously clumsy, with edits of it on YouTube winkingly titled “David Guetta Ends Racism.” 


Best Used For: Chuckling at a celebrity attempting to do the right thing at a moment of global crisis, but being distractingly themselves in the process. — A.U. 


Type: Insta-Quotable 


Why It Resonates: In a timeless Wall Street Journal interview that included a lightning round of opinions on the 2010s class of pop stars, Aretha Franklin could only muster up “Great gowns, beautiful gowns” when asked for her opinion on Taylor Swift. 


Best Used For: A sly way to dismiss somebody or something you simply don't rate. — K.D.


Type: Calendar Perennial Why It Resonates: After a not-entirely-positive Pitchfork review of her Manic album in 2020, Halsey took to Twitter/X to plead, “Can the basement that they run p*tchfork out of just collapse already” — not realizing, as many users ultimately did, that Pitchfork has its offices at the World Trade Center, which famously collapsed once before back on Sept. 11, 2001. Best Used For: Reminiscing about it every September 11th… never forget (both 9/11 and Halsey's accidentally 9/11 tweet). — K.R.


Type: Calendar Perennial  Why It Resonates: Tracing back to at least 2010 (with who started the trend unclear), Spanish icon Julio Iglesias has become a viral meme in the Latin community during the month of July (July in Spanish is Julio). Similar to “It's Gonna be May,” the organic annual resurgence of Iglesias memes have different expressions alluding to the season that's linked to the artist's name: “Llego Julio” (July is here) is one of the most popular ones, showing the romantic balladeer coming out of a private jet.  Best Used For: Though fans get really creative, and there are many types of expressions and photoshopped photos of the artist, the only time this meme makes sense to use is during the month of July. — J.R.


Type: Insta-Quotable


Why It Resonates: Tyler, the Creator received his first two Video Music Awards nominations for Video of the Year and Best New Artist in 2011, prompting a series of tweets including this timeless gem that perfectly encapsulates the feeling of all-consuming joy in the most Tyler way possible.


Best Used For: Sharing enthusiasm for a highly anticipated announcement or seismic development, whether it's the start of a new era or your fan-made fantasy becoming a reality. — M.M.


Type: Insta-Quotable Why It Resonates: During a lie detector test with Vanity Fair, Keke Palmer greeted a photo of former Vice President Dick Cheney with the following admission: “He could be walking down the street, I wouldn't know a thing. Sorry to this man.” Social media promptly exploded — less with mockery than with collective admiration for how effortlessly funny this singer-actor is even when she's serious. It doesn't even need text — a simple screenshot of her face from this interview will do the trick when you need to wave someone off. Best Used For: The perfect response when you either genuinely don't know this man, or you deeply wished you did not know this man. — JOE LYNCH


Type: Classic Reaction / Universal Application Why It Resonates: A July Coldplay concert launched the biggest infidelity scandal of the year when Astronomer soon-to-be-former-CEO Andy Byron and HR exec Kristin Cabot were seen holding one another on the Gillette Stadium jumbotron. Byron attempted to evade the cameras and Cabot looked as if she'd seen a ghost, causing the clip to go viral and give social media a monocultural moment that just about everyone had an opinion about. “​​Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy,” Coldplay's Chris Martin remarked as it transpired, making it feel like a scene out of a movie.Best Used For: If any sort of juicy infidelity story has hit the timeline, there's a good chance a form of the original photo or clip will be in the replies. It could also be used for people getting exposed at a place they didn't want to be seen. Corporations' social media teams even leaned in to engulf the controversy and sports teams had mascots re-enacting the pose. — M.S.


Type: Singular ExpressionWhy It Resonates: Because for someone as lyrically and musically verbose as Lady Gaga, her use of this one adage about Bradley Cooper believing in her during the press tour for A Star Is Born immediately caught the internet's attention. As she repeated the anecdote over and over and over again, fans immediately turned the story into a running gag about keeping yourself casual and breezy when you've really rehearsed that one turn of phrase you like to death. Best Used For: Did your friend just share the exact same joke in the group chat that they sent you privately 30 minutes ago? “There can be 100 people in a room…” — STEPHEN DAW


Type: Lore-BuilderWhy It Resonates: Dua Lipa broke out the twisting hip dance as part of a 2018 performance, and she was incessantly bullied for years. (One oft-quoted YouTube review of her low-motor dancing at the BRITs later that year commented, “I love her lack of energy, go girl give us nothing!”) But at times, there are some positives to bullying, as she told The Tonight Show that it made her take her live performance more seriously, hiring choreography savant Charm La'Donna and never looking back. Dua even had fun with the “Pencil Sharpener” dance, which she brought back as part of her routine on the Future Nostalgia Tour in 2022. Best Used For: The “Pencil Sharpener” dance clip will go viral from time-to-time on Twitter/X and Instagram, showing how far Lipa's performances have come. People will also throw it out in certain situations that basically insinuate a “go girl, give us nothing” moment. — M.S.


Type: Universal Application


Why It Resonates: For any other artist, a quick dance move and simple phrase likely wouldn't generate much attention. But Usher's quick moment where he's feeling himself while performing “Confessions Part II” during his NPR Tiny Desk concert perfectly captures his charisma and playful swagger. It's continued to resonate because it taps into nostalgia for Usher's peak pop dominance, and also the fact that the meme can easily be repurposed for everything from minor flexes to major glow-ups.


Best Used For: When you're about to hit a sick dance move or flex on somebody (don't worry if the result is successful or not) — or maybe showing a before-and-after glow-up. — X.Z.


Type: Insta-Quotable / Lore-BuilderWhy It Resonates: The pop auteur finally broke through to the mainstream with her Grammy-winning 2024 album Brat – and while the music was a big reason, so was the way the record and its iconic green album cover took over the internet. The phenomenon hit a fever-pitch when Charli declared that Kamala Harris, just named the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nominee, was “brat.” In an era where monoculture is elusive, Brat united the internet, and today it's cultural shorthand for summer 2024.Best Used For: Now, the meme is mostly used to riff on “Brat summer”: “Brat summer is over, now it's [insert artist name here] fall.” But Charli and “Brat” will be forever linked: When Taylor Swift released “Actually Romantic” in October, she compared its subject (heavily rumored to be Charli) to a “toy chihuahua” — leading one X user to declare “being compared to a chihuahua is brat.” — E.R.B.


Type: Calendar Perennial 


Why It Resonates: From the inaudible sigh of relief to the nonchalant shoulder shrug, the James Bond actor's introduction of musical guest The Weeknd during the 45th season of Saturday Night Live reminds us that the simple pleasure of the actual weekend's arrival never gets old.  


Best Used For: 5:00 p.m. on a Friday (or whenever you've decided to tap out for the week). — H.M. 


Type: Singular Expression 


Why It Resonates: Whether she's twirling into a human tornado or hooting and hollering in the bathroom, Britney Spears Instagram performance clips are collectively iconic, and endlessly reusable. 


Best Used For: Expressing a certain joie de vivre that words cannot. — K.D.


Type: Insta-Quotable 


Why It Resonates: Nicki Minaj's 2018 TIDALxCRWN interview is probably her last truly resonant conversation with a journalist to date, and this hilarious moment — which came in response to fans rapping her searing “Make Love” verse — proved one of the most memorable. 


Best Used For: Driving home the fact that you were right all along. — K.D.


Type: Lore-Builder


Why It Resonates: Because it shows the power of fan accounts. Who would've thought a light-hearted tweet featuring a photo of Taylor Swift with a fan in a suite at a Chiefs game could inspire one of 2023's biggest duo Halloween costumes and a new product by one of America's most well-known condiment brands? That's “seemingly ranch” for you.


Best Used For: Referring to a white speckled condiment, usually used as salad dressing, that may or may not be ranch. Bonus points if it's served with chicken tenders. — D.P.


Type: Proto-Meme / Lore-Builder


Why It Resonates: Because the pre-meme targeted the most worshipped band on Earth — and, as is often the case with conspiracy theories, the more absurd they are, the harder it is to resist digging in. Part of the fun was the treasure hunt: combing through album art (the Abbey Road cover is a funeral procession!), lyrics and backwards messages on songs that revealed hidden clues surely proved that McCartney had, in fact, died and been replaced by some lookalike imposter. Even though The Beatles and McCartney himself debunked the theory, it's taken on a life of its own, evolving into pop-culture legend and is now forever cemented in Beatles mythology.


Best Used For: Best used as an example of extreme, mostly harmless, fandom at work. — X.Z.


Type: Universal ApplicationWhy It Resonates: Because Lovato yelling at a self-described “stalker” to “GET A JOB” after posing in a photo with her sister is both pretty justified and objectively funny. It became such an enduring part of the pop culture canon that Demi herself now sells merch with the phrase emblazoned across it. Best Used For: An instance in which two things interact — or could potentially interact — in a way you find even just a little bit objectionable. The more harmless the interaction is, the funnier this meme gets. — S.D.


Type: Singular Expression  


Why It Resonates: Adele deliberately avoided cameras while having the best seat in the house for the 2022 NBA All-Star Game — next to her all-star agent boyfriend (now fiancé) Rich Paul – making for an epic (and fabulous) failure at being low-key. 


Best Used For: Feeling unbothered or actively avoiding a situation. — H.M.


Type: Insta-Quotable / Universal ApplicationWhy It Resonates: Timberlake's reported reaction to a DUI stop six weeks into his Forget Tomorrow World Tour was both deeply relatable (whose stomach hasn't dropped when they've realized the ramifications of a bad decision?) and deeply unrelatable (how many stomachs have dropped from realizing their bad decision might cost them hundreds of millions of dollars?). But the episode, in which the police officer asked Timberlake “What tour?,” also afforded observers a bit of schadenfreude: His celebrity didn't save him from getting booked, or ultimately pleading guilty.Best Used For: For Timberlake's sizable contingent of online haters, the meme was a gift. But beyond its application mocking him specifically, the phrase “This is going to ruin the tour” is often deployed facetiously, for situations that might not, in fact, be tour (or even day) ruining. — E.R.B.


Type: Classic ReactionWhy it Resonates: A fan paused a video of Travis Scott on stage wielding a mic stand over his head. Of course, as with most Travis Scott's performances, he was all-in in the freeze frame, raging to his own music, and looking hilariously (and surreally) cartoonish doing so.  Best Used For: This meme was used often as an expression of aggro-ness when it first came out, but it became even more powerful when it became an “emote” on Fortnite, taking on an even bigger presence online and in the game. — K.R.


Type: Lore Builder / Singular Expression 


Why It Resonates: When things go wrong at the Oscars, one of the glitziest nights in Hollywood, it's sure to make headlines — and such was the case with John Travolta's infamous (and inexplicable) flub of Idina Menzel's name at the 2014 awards ceremony. “Here to perform the Oscar-nominated, gorgeously empowering song ‘Let It Go,' from the Oscar-winning animated movie Frozen,” Travolta intro-ed, “please welcome the wickedly talented, one and only… Adele Dazeem.” Menzel got her revenge the following year, though, when she took the same stage to introduce Travolta as “Glom Gazingo.”


Best Used For: After a mispronunciation of your own, reminding people that yours could never be as embarrassing as Adele Dazeem. — D.P.


Type: Universal ApplicationWhy It Resonates: Hip-hop is serious business, even for a rapper like Young Thug known for his singular warble and off-the-wall lyrics. Thug and Durk specifically heighten the humor of this locked-in meme, but it's their focus that feels universal — and has helped the image spread to corners of the internet that might not even be familiar with either rapper.Best Used For: Virtually any situation – serious or funny – that demands attention or scrutiny. — E.R.B.


Type: Insta-Quotable / Singular Expression 


Why It Resonates: It's rare that the entire world can look at three people in a clip and deduce, that in that specific moment, each person was on a totally different planet from ours — but that's precisely what happened with this instantly viral video from the 2024 Wicked press tour. From the nervous acrylic nail grab and hushed confusion to the still-unclear concept of holding space and “I'm in queer media,” the moment was, and still is, legendary. 


Best Used For: Expressing confusion, overwhelming emotion or employment in queer media. — K.D.


Type: Singular Expression Why It Resonates: The Kendrick Lamar and Drake battle dominated music in 2024, and Kendrick Lamar took a victory lap performing “Not Like Us” for millions of viewers at the 2025 Super Bowl Halftime Show in February. Only Kendrick could crack a demonic smile for the camera mid-”Not Like Us” performance as he figuratively danced on Drake's grave on the biggest stage of them all. Best Used For: If you've successfully prayed on someone's downfall, this meme is for you. Think of it as taking joy in seeing someone else having the worst day of their life. — M.S.


Type: Lore-Builder


Why It Resonates: As 19-year old ascendant country star Taylor Swift was giving her best female video acceptance speech at the 2009 VMAs for “You Belong with Me,” Kanye West went on stage, grabbed the mic from her, and said: “Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!” In a way, the instantly iconic moment served both West (who burnished his reputation as an unvarnished truth-teller) and Swift (who became even more popular and, yes, famous, afterwards), though it came to define both their careers in ways both good and bad for much of the next decade-plus to come. 


Best Used For: West's brief comment can be sliced and diced a few ways: “X is one of the greatest Ys of all time,” the patent insincerity of “I'm really happy for you” and the coarse edge of “I'mma let you finish.” – P.G.


Type: Classic ReactionWhy It Resonates: Because Beyoncé is and always has been a consummate professional in both her music and her public life. So, when she loudly declares that “somebody's getting fired” for a technical mishap in perfect time with her song “Diva” — and does so without missing one beat of her choreography, mind you — you know she means every word of it. Sorry to whoever may or may not have lost their job there, but Beyoncé needs those lighting cues!Best Used For: Literally any situation where you have been inconvenienced by forces beyond your control, and you're ready to find a scapegoat. — S.D.


Type: Universal Application  


Why It Resonates: Stills of Drake's disgruntled-turned-gratified facial expressions and goofy dance moves from the music video for his 2015 Grammy-winning smash “Hotline Bling” began circulating around 4chan, Sheeky Forums and Reddit, snowballing into the phenomenon otherwise known as “Drakeposting.” The contrasting frames of his approval and disapproval have remained unmissable on social media in the years since. 


Best Used For: Preferring one thing over another. — H.M.


Type: Lore-Builder 


Why It Resonates: Poot Lovato is one of the most outlandish memes to come out of the 2010s, which is also why it's one of the most hilarious. To this day, no one knows who edited the original red-carpet picture of Demi in such an unflattering way, nor what possessed one Tumblr user to claim that the doctored snapshot was of the star's fictional twin sister stepping outside for the very first time after being “locked in a basement her whole life.” Regardless, the fake story would quickly take on a life of its own, with Demi's understandable distaste for it only fueling its virality. (“Cool to see a s—ty angle turn into a meme that circulates the Internet to people's amusement ha,” the singer tweeted when Poot first took off in 2015.) 


	In the years since, Poot has become a beloved figure in Demi's history, with the vocalist often referencing her “twin” in good humor online (and even in a recent Halloween costume). But why does Poot's legacy endure? Perhaps it's because Poot — while deeply funny – is also quite an inspirational figure, when you think about it. Despite facing such darkness in her life, she nevertheless chose to embrace the world with resilience, curiosity and a big smile on her face. In a way, we all have a little bit of Poot inside of us, so long as we let her out of that metaphorical basement. 


Best Used For: Whenever you take a bad photo, tell a joke that falls flat or do something remotely cringey, invoke the power of Poot. It wasn't you, it was just your bumbling alter ego — one who spent all of her developmental years trapped in a basement, for crying out loud. — H.D.


Type: Universal Application 


Why It Resonates: Future is synonymous with the toxicity of his music when it comes to his relationship with love and romance — so a simple photo of him looking down at his phone and texting ultimately took on a life of its own, giving guys a boost akin to liquid courage to text their ex. It feels like Future would agree with Wayne Gretzky, who famously once said, “You miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take.” He's even become the face of the unofficial “Text Your Ex” holiday on Oct. 30.


Best Used For: Take any significant cultural event, pop-culture moment, sports game or holiday, and incorporate that into a short paragraph explaining how it inspired you to text that former fling in your life. — M.S.


Type: Universal Application


Why It Resonates: Because two decades ago, it was good harmless fun to get someone to click on a link that they're sure offers one thing and then, all of a sudden, instead pops up Rick Astley doing his little shimmy and singing his 1988 smash, “Never Gonna Give You Up.” The phenomenon soon known as “Rickrolling” was perhaps the first truly great pop star meme of the digital age – and one of the most biggest and most enduring — even if much of its humor was based on how distant Astley's chart-topping days seemed by the mid-'00s. 


Best Used For: Anytime you want to add a little good-spirited jolt into a meeting or someone's day. It's been deployed by everyone from the White House under Obama to the New York Mets, so just roll with it. — M.N.


Type: Insta-Quotable / Lore-BuilderWhy It Resonates: Because Lady Gaga doesn't play when it comes to her schedule. When describing her day-to-day life while making The Fame, Gaga ran an interviewer through her grinding routine that involved various modes of transport and at least three nightclubs. Maybe it's the earnest addition of “no fear, no one believed in me” on the end of her agenda, maybe it's the way that she clapped for emphasis with each successive item of her schedule, maybe it's even the off-kilter hat she wore during the interview that Gaga herself remembers fondly; but when you add all of those pieces together, you get an immediately iconic moment for the terminally online.Best Used For: Whenever someone asks you to add yet another thing to your already packed itinerary, just send them this clip. — S.D.


Type: Insta-Quotable 


Why It Resonates: Coined by Carey in 2003, she uttered the phrase (along with some vociferous head-shaking) in response to a question about her thoughts on Jennifer Lopez, who was propped up as a rival of hers by the media in the early ‘00s and began a working relationship with Carey notorious ex-husband following their separation. Now a crucial element of Carey's cultural brand, she's recycled the phrase several times and wielded it against younger pop stars like Demi Lovato. “I don't know her” encapsulates the witty shade, effortless humor, evergreen timeliness and flat-out ballsiness of the all-time best pop star memes. 


Best Used For: Not knowing somebody or something, of course. — K.D.

In a new blog post, Robert Kyncl shared his list of non-negotiables in licensing talks with AI companies and said the new technology will further democratize music creation.

	Warner Music Group CEO Robert Kyncl has detailed the company's approach to generative AI in a new blog post published Wednesday (Nov. 19). The missive arrived just hours after WMG announced a settlement and licensing deal with Udio, effectively ending its part in a blockbuster copyright infringement lawsuit against the AI music company, which it brought alongside the other two majors.

Frank DiGiacomo 













	In Kyncl's address, he stressed that while it's “early days” for AI, “this is the moment to shape the business models, set the guardrails and pioneer the future for the benefit of artists and songwriters.” The CEO also revealed his thought process when going into meetings with AI companies, saying that his three non-negotiables include “partners who commit to licensed models”; economic terms that benefit and “reflect the value of music”; and giving the company's signees a choice to “opt-in” to any use of their names, images, likenesses or voices in new AI-generated songs.


	Kyncl also stated his belief that AI tools will further democratize music creation, adding that to stand out “in a sea of AI-generated content, real artistry identity and vision” is needed. He additionally stressed that the music industry should focus on engaging fans and getting them to lean in, saying, “the more interactivity users have with the music they love, the more value is created.”


Read the full blog post below.


AI is still in its early days. Investment is surging, talent is pouring in, and a crop of new, ambitious startups are working with music again for the first time in more than a decade. This is the moment to shape the business models, set the guardrails, and pioneer the future for the benefit of our artists and songwriters.


We're approaching this new era with one priority above all else: protecting and empowering the artists and songwriters who are our reason for being. Every decision we make, every partnership we forge, every principle we establish is designed to ensure that they benefit from AI's possibilities.


Every AI deal we make is guided by three non-negotiable principles:


1. We will only make agreements with partners who commit to licensed models;2. The economic terms must properly reflect the value of music;3. And, most importantly, artists and songwriters will have a choice to opt-in to any use of their name, image, likeness, or voice in new AI-generated songs.


WHY THIS MOMENT MATTERS


Over the last 25 years, we've experienced the democratization of music distribution. Many predicted it would lead to the demise of our industry, but the skeptics were proven wrong.


The barriers to entry have fallen, the world has gotten smaller, and artists are global from day one. Fans love having unlimited personalized access, streaming is driving unprecedented growth, and music is more valuable than ever.


Now, we are entering the next phase of innovation. The democratization of music creation.


We believe Generative AI will lead to a new explosion in creative and commercial opportunities, and that authentic talent will be even more in demand for two reasons


OUR APPROACH


Our approach is clear: legislate, litigate, license. We lobby for legislation that sets clear guidelines. We deploy litigation to halt bad actors. And we use licensing as the most powerful way to shape the future. Licensing is how we can safeguard our artists and songwriters, while collaborating with tech partners, to propel new fan experiences that drive additional revenue. 


The partnerships we forge will offer a variety of specific use cases. Each of them adheres to our principles, winning important protections for artists and songwriters, while ensuring that they share in every dollar that's earned. And as the services grow their revenue, so will the pay outs. 


This space is moving lightning fast. Past lessons teach us that delaying only lets others define our future. The music business learned that during the file-sharing era. And the film & TV industries are still regretting not embracing streaming sooner. So for artists and songwriters to win, the music industry needs to be a leading force in the formative stages of AI, not a passive participant. We will steer the course in this new era to deliver greater value for our artists, songwriters, and their music. 


This is only the beginning.

	Based on George R.R. Martin's “Fire & Blood,” House of the Dragon, set 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, tells the story of House Targaryen. The eight-episode Season 2, which wrapped in August 2024, picked up immediately after the death of Lucerys Velaryon, Rhaenyra's son, at the hands of Aemond Targaryen. The season focused on the escalating conflict, moving the story from a cold war into the fiery “Dance of the Dragons” civil war.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	Ahead of the January 18 premiere of HBO‘s A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, the Game of Thrones prequel has been renewed for a second season to debut in 2027. The announcement was made by Casey Bloys, Chairman and CEO, HBO and HBO Max Content, at the network's press presentation Thursday morning in New York. 


	The adaptation of George R.R. Martin's Dunk and Egg novellas was originally slated to premiere in late 2025; the debut was subsequently delayed to January 2026. The slight shift would keep the series out of the HBO-Sky deal, which is coming to an end, and available for the launch of HBO Max in the UK and Ireland.

			Watch on Deadline		







A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms will debut almost three years after the series was greenlighted in April 2023. The second season will cut the gap roughly in half with a 2027 debut.


	The nature of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms allows for a quicker turnaround vs. fellow prequel House of the Dragon, which releases a new season every 2 years. A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms also produces shorter seasons consisting of six half-hour episodes each vs 8-10 hourlong episodes a season for HoD.

	HBO‘s Head of Drama Series and Films Francesca Orsi told Deadline in February that A Knight of Seven Kingdoms is done on a smaller, more “intimate” scale than the other Game of Thrones series. She also confirmed that the show is still on track for a three-season run spanning Martin's three Dunk and Egg books.“You're going be so impressed by Peter Claffey and Dexter Sol Ansell as Dunk and Egg, the two leads,” she said at the time. “So much so that we're already planning on how do we build this for the three seasons in total.”

A Knight of Seven Kingdoms stars Claffey as Ser Duncan “Dunk” the Tall, Ansell as Egg, Daniel Ings, Bertie Carvel, Danny Webb, Sam Spruell, Shaun Thomas, Finn Bennett, Edward Ashley, Tanzyn Crawford, Henry Ashton, Youssef Kerkour, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor and Daniel Monks. Martin and Ira Parker are co-creators/executive produces, with the latter serving as showrunner. Sarah Bradshaw, Owen Harris, Ryan Condal and Vince Gerardis also executive produce; Owen Harris and Sarah Adina Smith direct. 


	Set a century before the events of Game of Thrones and 72 years after House of the Dragon, A Knight of Seven Kingdom follows two unlikely heroes wandering Westeros … a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall (Claffey), and his diminutive squire, Egg (Ansell) … Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends. (You can watch a trailer below, which shows Martin's ambition for the series to feature “the best jousting sequences that were ever done on film.”)


RELATED: ‘Task' Renewed For Season 2 By HBO With Mark Ruffalo Set To Return


	Along with the A Knight of Seven Kingdom renewal, HBO on Thursday also gave an early Season 4 pickup to House of the Dragon to premiere in 2028. Both series will air on HBO and be available to stream on HBO Max.


	“We are thrilled to be able to deliver new seasons of these two series for the next three years, for the legion of fans of the Game of Thrones universe,” Orsi said. “Together, House of the Dragon and A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms reveal just how expansive and richly imagined George R. R. Martin's universe continues to be. In January, I think audiences will be delighted by the inspiring underdog tale of Dunk and Egg that George and Ira Parker have captured so beautifully. And this summer, House of the Dragon is set to ignite once again with some of its most epic battles yet.”

“Real Housewives of Potomac” alum Mia Thornton was arrested in Georgia for allegedly stealing thousands of dollars worth of furniture from a condo she was renting.

Thornton, 40, was booked into the Fulton County Jail Wednesday on felony theft charges, Page Six confirmed.

Police at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport reportedly cuffed the Bravolebrity after they were called to the Customs and Border Protection office where they were informed of a wanted person, reports CBS News.

According to a police report obtained by the local CBS outlet, Thornton is accused of stealing the furniture from a condo she was renting in the area.

The condo's manager claimed in the report that Thornton abruptly “moved out of the unit in the middle of the night” without notice on Oct. 28.

The building manager alleged that Thornton took several furniture items and the television, estimating the total cost of the stolen items to be around $11,000.

Police body camera footage showed Thornton tell police that she was aware she had a warrant out for her arrest. 

Page Six has reached out to a contact for Thornton but did not immediately receive a response. The Fulton County Sheriff's Department did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment. 

Thornton announced her departure from the “Real Housewives of Potomac” and move to Atlanta in April after she starred on the reality series for four seasons.

“With every new season comes a new beginning and I have some news to share,” Thornton said in her April 21 Instagram post.

“My family and I have made the decision to relocate to Atlanta, and with that, I will not be returning to ‘The Real Housewives of Potomac' next season.”

“I don't just make headlines — I make History. Atlanta, brace yourself. The empire has expanded,” she closed.

“Real Housewives of Orange County” alum Kelly Dodd is speaking out in Meghan King's defense.

The 50-year-old took to TikTok on Thursday to defend her former co-star after the latter lost custody of her kids to her ex Jim Edmonds.

“I just got off the phone with Meghan King Edmonds, and, she said that she gave one of her other twins Hayes some Ritalin [used to treat ADHD] and it made her a ‘dangerous mother,'” Dodd alleged in her video, which was shot from her kitchen.

King shares daughter, Aspen, 8, and twins, Hart and Hayes, 7, with Edmonds. 

While Dodd and King have “had a lot of differences and a lot of fights” over the years, she “know[s] for a fact [King is] a good mother.”

Dodd explained, “She stayed at my house … when she got her boobs and nose done — and I can tell you: she loves those babies, she loves those kids.”

She went on to call King, 41, an “excellent” parent before adding that she prays her fellow Bravolebrity “gets her babies back.”

Dodd then urged her fans to pray for King and her family, adding, “Those boys and that daughter need their mom, they need their mother. It's terrible what's going on right now — all we can do is pray for Meghan.”

Page Six has reached out to King's reps for comment, but did not receive any at the time of publication.

On Wednesday, a source told Us Weekly that King lost custody of her three children and was granted supervised visitation following an investigation from Child Protective Services.

The insider noted the arrangement is temporary, with a hearing in December to determine whether it will become permanent.

The investigation was allegedly prompted when a school employee filed a report with CPS about King.

King and Edmonds, 55, welcomed their three children throughout their five-year marriage.

The former couple got married in 2014, but they ultimately split in 2019 after the former MLB star was caught sending lewd messages to another woman. 

Following their divorce, the two agreed to share custody of their children.

However, things soured in May when Jim's now-wife, Kortnie Edmonds, called the cops to complain that King had trespassed on their property after they had made arrangements to drop off her stepdaughter's dress.

According to a police report obtained by PageSix, “Meghan refused to hand Kortnie the dress and ‘pulled away and asked to speak to' [her daughter].”

After being told that Jim and Aspen were at a baseball game, King allegedly yelled for her daughter from inside the house.

Although the former Bravolebrity eventually left the home, she was later confronted by Frontenac Police.

However, no charges were pressed against King, with her rep claiming that the situation had been “mischaracterized.”

“Meghan briefly called to her daughter from the doorway, never stepped inside, had the door slammed in her face, and calmly left her belongings on the porch. Upon leaving, she was unexpectedly blocked by multiple police vehicles and treated in a way that felt unnecessarily hostile,” the rep said.

Body cam footage later surfaced in September, where King could be heard telling authorities that her ex is “incredibly emotionally abusive.”

New body cam footage showing Porsha Williams detailing her Delta flight altercation has been obtained by Page Six.

In the clip, the “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star claims the incident was prompted after another passenger sitting next to her on the flight called her a “bitch.” 

“I was on my phone and the volume was up,” Williams told authorities of the impetus behind the situation after returning from her recent appearance at BravoCon 2025.

“She turned to me out of nowhere and she said, ‘So you gonna make me listen to that the whole flight?'” Williams, 44, claimed.

Williams allegedly replied, “Do you want to?” Then, the woman allegedly told her no. “I said, ‘Well, there's a nicer way to say that.' And she said, ‘Bitch, you don't tell me.”

At one point, one of the other passengers aboard the plane interrupted Williams' interview with police to check on her well-being. 

The passerby revealed she had been sitting near the “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star on the flight and corroborated her story to authorities, describing the ordeal as “reprehensible.”

“She was doing things that were completely chaotic to [Williams],” she told the officer, further emphasizing that Williams was not the aggressor in the situation.

The other woman involved in the altercation later told police that Williams “assaulted” her and that she was “afraid for my life.”

She claimed the incident took place “after about 25 minutes” of Williams scrolling on her Instagram “full blast.” 

“Every time she would flip because it was apparently from a loud place. I jumped because it was so loud,” she said.

Eventually, the situation allegedly escalated to Williams pointing her “fingernail so close to my eye that I thought I was going to be physically attacked.”

“She had her hands in my face, screaming, calling me crazy, on and on,” the woman claimed, adding that she then attempted to protect herself by recording the incident. But, Williams allegedly threw her phone out of her hand. 

“I'm afraid she's going to have me killed,” the woman told the officer.

After the Nov. 16 incident, the FBI announced that an investigation had been launched into the ordeal.

“FBI Atlanta is aware of incident on a Delta flight on November 16th allegedly involving Porsha Williams and/or at least one other person,” a spokesperson for FBI Atlanta told TMZ.

Meghan Markle just divulged the story behind her viral Paris Fashion Week debut at the Balenciaga runway show last month.

The Duchess of Sussex told Harper's Bazaar in an interview published Wednesday that she went to the show to support her pal and designer Pierpaolo Piccioli.

“I was excited for him,” she said. “I reached out and I said, ‘Happy to come and support you.' We kept it a secret, and it was really fun.”

Markle, 44, explained how she “love[s] being able” to live a life where she can sit “front row at a show” and “play in the sandbox with [her] kids.”

She added, “I think the moment that you start making all of your personal decisions based on external judgment, then you lose your authenticity.” 

Markle lives in Montecito, California, with her husband, Prince Harry, and children, Archie, 6, and Lilibet, 4.

The “Suits” alum turned heads when she was spotted arriving at the Balenciaga show, wearing a pristine white long-sleeve button-up shirt and matching flowy trousers.

She accessorized with a dramatic white cape, black pointy-toed heels, a suede clutch with goldtone hardware and diamond stud earrings.

At the time, her spokesperson revealed that she and Piccioli had “worked closely together” over the years, “collaborating on design for key moments on the world stage,” per People magazine.

The rep added that the actress has “long admired his craftsmanship and modern elegance,” saying that her appearance represented a “culmination of many years of artistry and friendship, reflected in her support for his new creative chapter at Balenciaga.”

Piccioli also gushed over his and Markle's friendship, telling The Cut that they had “been texting” ever since they met “some years ago.”

The Italian designer referred to Markle's appearance as a “real, rare and beautiful” surprise.

In a moment that went viral online, the “With Love, Meghan” star was seen taking in the runway show, at one point bursting into giggles while sitting alongside her friend, Markus Anderson, who remained expressionless.

Though some speculated she was reacting to a model who tripped on the catwalk, a rep for Markle told the Daily Mail that she was not laughing at the model. 

The TV actress — who tied the knot with Prince Harry in 2018 — had previously attended Toronto Fashion Week and New York Fashion Week during her years on “Suits,” and made her front-row debut at the spring 2014 Hervé Léger show. 

Her October outing at Paris Fashion Week marked a first for Markle, who recently made a surprising return to acting. 

Markle's winter 2025 cover shoot with the magazine featured her in a number of stunning couture ensembles — including chic ensembles by The Row, Balenciaga, Ferragamo and Dior — with a mix of jewelry by Cartier, Tiffany & Co. and independent designers.

During her interview, the “As Ever” founder confessed she gives herself “grace” when navigating potential missteps amid enormous public scrutiny.

“You learn not to do it again,” she told the outlet. “If it all goes swimmingly, you don't learn from it. If you don't learn anything, you're not going to grow.”

In a move we can only assume came at the tail end of a long, thoughtful process of looking at its own content, personalities, and rampant biases, and concluding, “Nah, not nearly oppressively Christian enough,” Fox News is apparently following in the footsteps of our old pals at the CW and pivoting to Jesus. More. Pivoting to Jesus-er.

This is according to Variety, which reports that the cable news network's subscription VOD service, Fox Nation, is launching a new faith-based vertical for itself—titled, simply enough, “Fox Faith”—that will add even more explicitly Christian material to its offerings, to go with all the implicitly Christian viewpoints it already had on tap. And if you were wondering how the network would launch this new move, and then guessed “a big push into celebrity podcasting with Neal McDonough as Jesus,” well, that's the kind of spooky accuracy that gets people burned as witches 'round these here cable news networks.

Specifically, Fox Faith is launching The Life Of Jesus podcast, a 52-installment series featuring some ridiculously big-name voice talent attached. That includes McDonough—who's talked in the past about how his unwillingness to kiss non-wife women on-screen, a choice rooted in his devout Catholicism, lost him work in Hollywood—plus Kristen Bell as Mary Magdalene, Sean Astin as the apostle Matthew, Malcolm McDowell as Biblical villain Caiaphas, Julia Ormond as Mary, John Rhys-Davies as the narrator, and Brian Cox, Logan Roy himself, as the voice of Da Big Man, God. (Oh, and Fox & Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt will be doing intros for each episode, just to keep things firmly in the Fox News ecosystem.) Interestingly, the 52 episodes will be released in batches of 13 linked to individual Christian holidays, because Fox's data—which, at the end of the day, is what's dictating this stuff—says people get hungrier for Biblical material around the holy days.

In news that's almost certain to increase the number of times that non-gas-station-adjacent sci-fi nerds think the word “chevron” in their day-to-day lives, Amazon MGM has confirmed today that it's bringing the Stargate franchise back to television. This is per Variety, which reports that Blindspot creator Martin Gero, who came up in the business on spin-off series Stargate Atlantis, has been tapped to revive the franchise with a new installment for Prime Video.

Stargate had a good long run on TV in the late '90s, and then through the entirety of the 2000s, with the original Showtime series (eventually transplanted to Syfy) spawning both Atlantis and the later Stargate Universe. (Plus a handful of animated spin-offs and direct-to-video movies that repeatedly attempted to bring the series to some flavor of satisfying conclusion.) Building (and then building, and building some more) on the mythology of the original 1994 Roland Emmerich flick, with its tales of aliens masquerading as gods and big circles that can send you to the far reaches of the universe, the show became a fan-favorite for its blend of sci-fi, action, and a surprising amount of Richard-Dean-Anderson-makes-a-fun-little-quip-based humor.

Amazon has been sniffing around at a revival of the franchise for a couple of years now, but Gero's hiring marks the first serious movement toward getting a new Stargate show back on the digital air. (The show was most recently brought back, briefly, for a web series, Stargate: Origins, in 2018.) A press statement from Gero—in which he called the show a “next phase” for the franchise, and promised that “those that are new to our world” were in for “something extraordinary”—makes it sound like the series will exist in at least some degree of continuity with the old Stargate shows. Gero will serve as showrunner, with long-time Stargate creatives Brad Wright and Joe Mallozzi both attached as consulting producers. There's no word yet on when the revived series might end up landing at Prime Video.

As far as franchises where the people making the TV show have gone on to sue the people releasing the TV show, it's hard to beat the relationship between AMC and its former flagship program, The Walking Dead. Take, for instance, news today, when Variety reported that Dave Erickson—who co-created spin-off series Fear The Walking Dead, which ran for eight seasons on AMC—had lodged a lawsuit against the network claiming that he got screwed out of millions of dollars in profit participation on the spin-off. Erickson has now become the seventh high-level Walking Dead producer to sue the network, as his lawsuit joins a currently pending federal one from his co-creator Robert Kirkman, series executive producer Gale Anne Hurd, and several others, focused on the original series—which, in turn, followed one from original showrunner Frank Darabont that AMC actually settled (to the tune of $200 million) back in 2021. There has been a lot of suing attached to this franchise, is our point.

Erickson's argument will be familiar to anyone who's looked into those other suits: He claims that he was promised 5 percent of the modified adjusted gross receipts from Fear, an amount that has apparently added up to a whopping zero dollars. Indeed, AMC claims that, by its accounting, the show was apparently $185 million in the red—with said accounting, and AMC's ability to allegedly manipulate it by being both the show's producer and its distributor, serving as the crux of Erickson's unhappiness. Or, to put it in legal-ese: “When a vertically integrated conglomerate like AMC both produces a series and licenses it to its various affiliates, domestic and international, cable and streaming, concerns about improper self-dealing abound. Erickson brings this action to rectify AMC's egregious misconduct and to obtain the tens of millions of dollars in profits he is rightfully owed.” (Among other things, Erickson is claiming that AMC's calculations for what count as “modified adjusted gross receipts” didn't line up with industry standards, and were “the worst possible definition for a hit show in the history of television.”)

The network, meanwhile, has already fired back with the same ire (and, indeed, some of the same language) it's been using to fight back against Kirkman's multiple suits—and, before that, Darabont's, which it fought for roughly a decade before ultimately relenting. “The contracts here were negotiated by the most experienced and sophisticated legal talent in Hollywood,” AMC's lawyer said in a statement. “And AMC has fully paid what is owed. This is simply another crass money grab.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Letterboxd is getting into the online movie rental game","https://www.avclub.com/letterboxd-is-getting-into-the-online-movie-rental-game","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 02:21:00 GMT","

Letterboxd—the internet's number one destination for finding out which old movie Martin Scorsese has been watching lately, while also observing your peers attempt to out-do each other by boiling their favorite films down via heavily slangified haiku—is now attempting to go from being a place where you just write about movies to one where you can watch them, too. Specifically, the social cataloguing service announced this week that it'll soon be licensing digital movies for online rental, essentially bolting a video store onto its existing structure.

We'll be honest: Our brains start instinctively playing the “Uma Thurman just saw a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad” sirens any time a previously free service starts finding ways to sell us stuff, so our initial reaction to this news was both knee-jerk and negative. That being said—and after reading Letterboxd's explanation for what it's hoping to do in this space—it is possible to see some sense in the move. The company (which got bought by Canadian investment firm Tiny back in 2023) does, after all, have huge amounts of data about what movies its users are genuinely interested in, including easily harvested access to more than 20 million people's watchlists. Ignoring the ever-pleasant sensation of being reminded that we're really all just loose assemblages of data with an inconvenient human attached to them, the company is promising to use all that information as one of its guiding lights when it decides which films to license for rental. (“Every film is chosen because members want to watch it, not just because it's easy to license.”) Given how random and dire the average streaming library can feel these days, there's something exciting about seeing one purportedly guided by actual enthusiasm.

Along with promising to get early rentals for films making the festival rounds, as well as “restorations and revivals,” the rental service is clearly aiming at the Criterion Channel/MUBI space in terms of targeting die-hard film lovers, with the added bonus that users browsing reviews of some interesting and obscure title their friend just talked up will hypothetically be able to hit a button, pay a bit of money, and watch it themselves. Of course, since Letterboxd is not talking price yet—except to say it'll “depend on your location”—it's not clear how well either the economics, or the actual catalog, will live up to the hype.

The Letterboxd Video Store is expected to launch in early December.

Candace Cameron Bure and her husband, Valerie Bure, have been married since June 22, 1996. The success of their marriage involves having a realistic outlook. The former Hallmark actress and current Great American Family star is aware that, like any relationship, there will be highs and lows, and she has revealed how they navigate any challenges that arise in their marriage. 

In an episode of the “Stay True” podcast on Monday, November 17, the “Full House” actress discussed her marriage to Bure. “We had great years. We had some years I wish we could take back and do over. It's a constant reevaluation,” Cameron Bure said. 

She also discussed how essential it was to have flexibility in marriage and how having children put pressure on the relationship. “You really, I think, year to year you have to re-evaluate what's working, what's not, how are the schedules changing, and you have to continually adapt to what's new to figure out your rhythms,” she said. “And the rhythms are going to keep changing.”

Cameron Bure continued, “So having flexibility not only in schedule but with each other as husband and wife, because that's the first thing that's going to go. Your marriage gets put to the test because first of all, you have kids that come in and they demand all of you. Then they get a little older, and then they pit you against your husband, and you don't even realize it.”

The couple are parents to three children: a daughter, Natasha, and two sons, Lev and Maksim. Cameron Bure discussed what she meant about the children pitting her and her husband against each other by giving a relatable example. “They're going to ask you for a cookie, and you're going to tell them no. And then they're going to go to daddy, and they're going to go, ‘But I'm having the cookie cuz daddy said yes.' And then you're like, ‘Why did you give that to her? I already told her no.' And he's like, ‘Well, I didn't know that.'”

In the interview, Cameron Bure also discussed what she found worked for her and her husband, helping them keep their 29-year marriage strong. She spoke about finding “rhythms” and the importance of spending time together. 

She also stressed how important it is to have “time with you and your husband are going to be regardless, of career, but just in terms of children.” Cameron Bure continued to offer advice. “If I could lend you some advice that would be it is that you have to prioritize the relationship,” she said. “But I'm not talking about in a superficial way of like, ‘Oh, we just have to have a date night once a week.' I'm like, ‘No, you need to figure out what's important to your spouse and they need to figure out what's important to you.”

Kelsea Ballerini shone like the star she is when she stepped onto the red carpet for the 59th Annual Country Music Association Awards in Nashville, Tennessee, on Wednesday, November 19. Standing out in an eye-catching dress that was also totally on-trend, Kelsea opted to wear a sheer dress in a stunning shade of red that showed a bit of skin and boasted a lot of style.

With a large rose-like swirl on the front of the dress, the gown had a romantic touch. Of course, that's not to mention the sheer fabric that swirled around her and opened up at the top like a blooming flower. Stretching down to her mid-calf (with some pieces falling even further), the material around her legs was also see-through.

Wearing her hair down and parted in the middle, Kelsea opted for red shoes that matched her dress and bold scarlet lips.

When Kelsea stepped onto the CMAs red carpet in a sheer dress, she sparked a buzz among her fans. Indeed, when the singer took to Instagram to share her look, her followers were quick to respond.

“THIS DRESS 👏👏👏🔥,” one person wrote.

Another person added, “Slayed per usual ❤️”

“[I]conic as always,” a third person wrote.

Someone else left a comment, writing, “THE RED ON YOU.”

Even Brandi Cyrus (Miley's sister) commented, saying, “BEST DRESSED BEST GLAM 💥”

“When Kelsea Ballerini stepped onto the country music scene in 2014, she became known for her charming and melodious songwriting, as well as her sweet and playful girl-next-door style,” Fashionista noted in February 2024. “Brightly colored mini dresses, princess-y high/low gowns and plenty of glitter defined Ballerini's appearance at the start of her career. Now, 10 years later, the 30-year-old is in an era of rebirth.”

Kelsea herself explained, “I think there's been an evolution of the way I feel about myself and what I'm comfortable in. I feel comfortable enough in myself to explore different looks and fall in love with my body a little bit more.”

“Learning to accept myself and learn the parts of my body that I like has been a really big part of my style evolution,” she added. “Now I can be like, ‘I am digging my legs this week, let's show 'em off.' It's all part of growing up and leaning into my womanhood.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","RHOC Season 20 Cast Buzz: Who's In, Who's Out, and Who's ‘On the Bubble'","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/rhoc-season-20-cast/","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:44:54 GMT","

As “The Real Housewives of Orange County” prepares to celebrate its 20th season, Bravo fans are buzzing about which familiar faces — and potential new ones — will shape the milestone year.

According to a tip sent to Bravo and Cocktails, Vicki Gunvalson is set to join Tamra Judge, Heather Dubrow, Shannon Beador, Gina Kirschenheiter, and Jennifer Pedranti as full-time cast members in season 20. Emily Simpson, Katie Ginella, and Gretchen Rossi are still “on the bubble,” with their returns being evaluated based on storyline direction and chemistry.

The tip also claims Evolution Media is interested in having Rossi return — which would explain the recent effort to help her clean up a social-media scandal storyline — but producers remain uncertain whether she could realistically film alongside Judge after their long-running tension. In addition to determining which veterans will be full-time Housewives, the production team is seeking to introduce one brand-new cast member for the upcoming season.

Several familiar alumni — including Jeana Keough, Jo De La Rosa, Lauri Peterson, Kimberly Bryant, and Alexis Bellino — are reportedly expected to appear in special guest scenes throughout season 20.

Gunvalson's return became official during BravoCon 2025, when Andy Cohen surprised her onstage by officially giving her orange back.

“Yes!” she exclaimed as the crowd erupted. “I love you guys out there. I love Bravo. It's been a great ride.”

Judge — recently back on good terms with Gunvalson — celebrated the moment, signaling fresh potential for a Tres Amigas revival with Beador.

But not all former cast relationships are on the mend. Speaking to Us Weekly at BravoCon, Judge said she sees no path forward with Rossi.

“Unfortunately, no,” Judge said. “She wants to blame everybody for things that she does. She's accused me of things I've never done. I tried my hardest to move forward. She came in and could not move on.”

Meanwhile, Ginella offered a candid look at her own standing with the cast during an Entertainment Tonight interview. Calling BravoCon a “baptism by fire,” Ginella said she's open to reconciliation but uncertain whether the rest of the group feels the same.

“It doesn't seem, right now, that they're open to that,” she admitted. Still, she noted her friendships with Judge and Gunvalson give her hope as season 20 approaches.

I was hoping that neurotic Vicki would never return.
I'm so pissed that Tamrat is back.  How many times is she going to cry wolf?
I never want to see Alexis, Jeana Keough or Joe de la Rosa return.
I've watched this show since day one but due to Tamrat being allowed to return I think I'm done.  Andy & Bravo allowing the bullying from that sewer rat is mind blowing.
Anyone else notice how different Shannon looks in this picture?   I think she looks better here 🤔

I agree – Tamrat needs to go!  I could do without Emily and Gina as well.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Who Got Voted Off On ‘Survivor' 49 Last Night","https://entertainmentnow.com/survivor/tribal-council-survivor-49-tonight-elimination-2/","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 01:51:36 GMT","

Last night's episode of “Survivor” Season 49, titled “If You're Loyal to All, You're Loyal to None,” pushes the competition into a new level of chaos as shifting alliances, surprise twists and high-stakes gameplay reshape the landscape once again. With players trying to juggle loyalty and self-preservation at the same time, this installment highlights exactly why the modern era of “Survivor” thrives on unpredictability. After last week's tribal council resulting in M.C. going home, who is next to follow her?

Immunity is currently airing. In chronological order: Rizo, Kristina, Sage, Alex, Sophia and Jawan dropped. Crowning Steven the first of two individual immunity winners. The women continue to battle it out for their immunity necklace. Ultimately, Savannah wins immunity over Sophie making this her second win back to back. Tribal Council is happening now. The majority is seemingly targeting Rizo, Alex and Sophi. Nobody plays any idols before the votes are revealed. 

The next person sent to the “Survivor” 49 jury is Alex. As he walks over to Jeff Probst for his torch snuff, he candidly says “This is what I get for trying to play both sides.”

This week's action-packed episode delivers a surge of momentum the moment Jeff Probst steps in front of the castaways. As highlighted in Entertainment Now's Week 9 live recap, the game immediately shakes up when players learn they'll compete for two immunity necklaces, forcing everyone to reevaluate who they can afford to trust and who might be plotting a blindside the moment backs are turned. The double immunity twist doesn't just raise the stakes—it flips the entire strategy board sideways.

The live recap also notes a dramatic twist involving a castaway returning from Tribal Council, catching nearly every player off guard and throwing previous plans into disarray. That surprise return doesn't just shift the numbers—it resets the social structure. The moment that player re-enters the game, the tribe instantly fractures into smaller, more desperate factions.

One contestant, Rizo, becomes a focal point of tension after walking into Tribal Council with a hidden immunity idol he chooses to keep tucked away. His decision to hold onto the idol sends a message to the tribe: don't assume anything. Moves like that intensify paranoia at camp as players debate whether they're better off staying loyal to old alliances or jumping ship before their names end up on the parchment.

By the time the votes are cast, someone who believed they were insulated within a majority alliance finds themselves completely blindsided. The episode's title proves true—trying to please everyone often guarantees you'll protect no one, including yourself. Week 9 reinforces that this late in the season, loyalty becomes less about relationships and more about survival instincts, and every whispered conversation carries the risk of ending your game.

While Season 49 barrels toward its endgame, fans already have their eyes on the franchise milestone: “Survivor 50.” CBS confirms the landmark season will debut with a three-hour premiere on February 25, giving viewers an extended kickoff for what promises to be one of the most ambitious seasons in the show's history.

For this installment, producers are handing significant power over to the fans. Viewers will help shape the structure of the season, making decisions on elements like tribe setup, advantage types and certain gameplay mechanics. This marks a major evolution for the series and adds a new layer of tension for returning castaways—because now, they won't just be adapting to the environment, they'll be adapting to fan-made twists designed to keep them guessing.

The season will feature 24 returning players, the biggest returning cast yet, and with fans influencing the format, unpredictability will be baked into every phase of the game. It's clear that “Survivor 50” won't just celebrate the show's legacy—it will reinvent it in real time.

As tonight's episode proves, “Survivor” thrives on reinvention. And if Season 49's intensity is any indication, Season 50 may be the most transformational chapter yet.

After a split Tribal Council on “Survivor” season 49 last week, the castaways are shocked to see who was eliminated. While alliances are becoming clearer for some of the castaways, that may be testing tonight on “Survivor” 2025 when Jeff Probst has them battling it out for two immunity necklaces. It's time for another week of challenges and backstabbing, but who gets voted off “Survivor” 49 tonight? Find out during our “Survivor” season 49 live recap below!

Tonight's episode of “Survivor” 2025 is titled “If You're Loyal to All, You're Loyal to None.” As seen in the sneak peek from CBS, the winning castaways are shocked to see who comes back from Tribal Council. The big question is how does Rizo go to Tribal with an idol, but then come back safe and still with the idol intact? Find out tonight and find out who got eliminated on “Survivor” season 49 tonight during our “Survivor” live recap below.

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD: THIS LIVE RECAP WILL BE UPDATED THROUGHOUT THE EPISODE, SO DO NOT KEEP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ SPOILERS.

KEEP REFRESHING THE PAGE FOR THE LATEST “SURVIVOR” LIVE RECAP UPDATES.

The winning team is still at camp, waiting for the losing team to come back from Tribal Council. They think it will be either Sophie or Rizo voted out. They are shocked when the castaways come back and find out that MC was voted off.

Christina is upset that MC is gone, plus Rizo didn't have to use his idol. She said it was the worst-case scenario. Sophie is upset that everyone was shocked she came back and not MC. She is thinking she can't trust anyone, and is a free agent on “Survivor” season 49.

Rizo, Soph, and Savannah talk, and they feel good about things. Savannah has an extra vote, Rizo has the Immunity Idol, and Soph has the Power is Knowledge advantage, but they don't know about that. They are sitting pretty, though.

Steven feels he lost his partner in MC, so he tries to cement his alliance with Sage. He tells her that they went idol hunting and Christina found one, which he said she said was for the three of them. Sage wants to tell Jawan, but she wants to build trust with Steven.

Now we see Soph, Sophie, and Savannah head out. Sophie is hurt and feeling isolated. Soph wants to work with her and add her to their three and get out some big names.

It seems like there are two groups right now: Sage/Jawan and Soph/Savannah/Rizo. Alex said he's in the middle and trying to figure out which way to go. He tries to cement something with Rizo and Savannah, but Rizo doesn't seem to be falling for it, thinking he is playing both sides.

The nine remaining castaways make their way to see Jeff Probst. For this challenge, they will divide into teams of four. They will then move a big metal cube through a series of obstacles. The teams will then work through more obstacles to get three rings. They will then have to toss those rings onto a pole. Once on the pole, they win. The winning team will get a reward back at camp, which will be fried chicken, French fries, soda and lemonade, cheesecake, and blueberries. They draw for teams:

Soph was not picked, so she got to pick a winner. If they win, she gets the reward too. She chose the Yellow Team as the winner. Both teams get to the rings, and it's a matter of who can hit that pole first. It's the Blue Team that gets all their rings first, so they will get the reward.

Before they leave, Christina offers to trade her spot with Jawan. He hasn't eaten anything all season, so she wants him to eat. A very kind gesture, but he doesn't want to accept it. He says he wants to earn it. They both have to agree to it, which Jawan eventually does, and now he gets to eat!

The four castaways enjoy their reward. Jawan talks about his own life and how he has always had to be a provider. Because of that, he didn't want to accept the reward, but he's glad he did. He is feeling refreshed.

Meanwhile, they then start talking about working together. They all talk about possibly working together and being open to it. They all say they want to do it, but Jawan seems to be thinking he is playing them all.

At camp, the chickens are talking to Steven. Christina and Sage talk, and they said the time has to be now to get either Rizo or Savannah out of the game. They need to flush Rizo's idol. Christina then talks to Soph and tells her the plan to go after Rizo and Savannah. However, she is working with them, and no one knows.

The castaways return to camp, and Soph immediately talks to Savannah and tells her the plan is to split the votes on them. Meanwhile, they haven't even gone to the Immunity Challenge, but are talking about who to vote for!

Savannah and Soph have a moment, as Savannah feels safe with Soph. She tells her that she used to be a reporter, so they are forming a strong alliance. They then tell Rizo the plan and the split vote. He wants to get Alex out, but Savannah said she doesn't trust Jawan and Sage. Rizo then goes around to badmouth Alex, and gets people to vote him out and create a target on his back.

For this challenge, they will use their feet to press against a disc. They have to hold that disc in place. If it falls, they are out. The last woman and the last man to leave their disc in place will win immunity tonight on “Survivor” season 49, so we have two winners tonight.

For the first 10 minutes, the players can hold the structure they are sitting on or their legs. After 10 minutes, they can hold onto nothing. The first 10 minutes are counting down, and we see Rizo drop his disc and then Christina drops hers shortly after.

Things are quiet, so Savannah asks Steven to give them space facts. He starts spitting them out, and the castaways are glad he filled in the space. Sage drops out right before they switch to the second stage, where they can't hold onto anything. 

It comes down to Jawan versus Steven, and a repeat of Savannah versus Sophie. Jawan was struggling and dropped out, so Steven won immunity. The women are still going strong. They made it over 40 minutes, and Savannah said multiple times she wasn't dropping. She was correct, as Sophie dropped first, and Savannah won immunity for the second week in a row.

The plan was to split the vote between Savannah and Rizo, but Savannah won, and that plan can't work. They decide that Soph is collateral damage because of Savannah winning. They want to flush Rizo's idol, regardless.

Rizo thinks he's gotten the majority to vote out Alex. He wants to keep his idol another week, but he thinks he needs to convince Jawan and Sage to do that. Sophie seems to be playing both sides. Jawan is trying to convince Alex to vote out Rizo, so he tells him that Rizo is throwing out his name. Now Alex wants Rizo out.

Sage thinks Alex is playing both sides and is dangerous, so she wants him gone first. It looks like it's going to come down to Rizo or Alex tonight at Tribal.

The castaways say there was a lot of talk at camp after today's Immunity Challenge. Rizo said there is a lot of fluidity going on, as people who haven't worked together before are now seeming to work together. Rizo talks about his idol and how people may want to flush it, since they all know he has it. The talk, like usual, is all over the place, but it's time to vote.

Results: Jeff tallies the votes. Rizo keeps his idol again. The votes are: Soph, Rizo, Alex, Soph, Alex, Alex, Alex, and Alex. That's five votes for Alex, so he has been voted off “Survivor” tonight. He jokes as he leaves that he knew it, and it's what he gets for playing both sides. They all laugh as he asks if they all just talk to each other?

What do you think of the results on “Survivor” season 49 tonight?

Ugh! Savannah again. I'm fresh over her. Her arrogance is so annoying. I find myself checking Facebook during the show because I can't stand watching her any longer.

Agreed she needs to go.  My big complaint about suvivor lately (I've watched since the beginning) is they don' figure out how to make fire without a flint PRIOR TO GOING ON SURVIVOR!!! WTH???

YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!   Been thinking this for years!!

Totally agree.

Rizzo super bugs me, why have they not gotten wise to his lying….

Charli XCX‘s cinephilia has been well documented in recent years, from her viral Letterboxd reviews to her Coachella set that handed the “Brat Summer” baton to some of her favorite indie directors releasing films in 2025. And while she has made several appearances this year in films like “100 Nights of Hero,” “Sacrifice,” and “Erupcja,” 2026 is shaping up to be the year that sees her film career ascend into the stratosphere. In addition to composing songs and releasing a companion album for Emerald Fennel's “Wuthering Heights,” the pop star is set to star in “The Moment,” a new A24 music industry satire based on her own original idea.

“The Moment” marks the feature directorial debut of Aidan Zamiri, a veteran music video and commercial director behind Charli XCX's “360” video and Billie Eilish's video for “Birds of a Feather.” He also directed Timothée Chalamet in a recent commercial for CashApp. Zamiri co-wrote the script with Bertie Brandes, and the cast includes Rosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant, Jamie Demetriou, Hailey Benton Gates, Isaac Powell, Alexander Skarsgård, and Rachel Sennott.

An official synopsis for “The Moment” reads: “A rising pop star navigates the complexities of fame and industry pressure while preparing for her arena tour debut.”

While the film is not explicitly autobiographical, Charli XCX has hinted that its music industry satire reflects her own experiences. “It's fiction, but it's the realest depiction of the music industry that I've ever seen,” she said in an October interview with Vanity Fair.

Music for the film will come from British producer A. G. Cook, who worked on several of the most popular tracks on “Brat” including “Apple,” “Spring Breakers,” and “Von Dutch.” Cook is no stranger to the film world either, having contributed music to the Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri-led comedy “Bottoms.”

Other upcoming projects on Charli XCX's film docket include Gregg Araki's “I Want Your Sex,” which also stars Olivia Wilde, Cooper Hoffman, and Chase Sui Wonders; and an untitled collaboration with “Audition” director Takashi Miike. 

An A24 release, “The Moment” opens in theaters everywhere on Friday, January 30. Watch the teaser below.

Get ready to ruin some more childhood memories. Exclusive to IndieWire, Untouchables Entertainment has just dropped a new teaser for “The Dark Domain: Mickey-vs-Winnie.” The low-budget horror flick is expected from Emmy-nominated choreographer-turned-filmmaker Glenn Douglas Packard sometime  in 2026. The new footage includes a debut glimpse of Dark Winnie (Givanni Gotay), a feral version of the cartoon bear made famous by author A.A. Milne and his beloved books set in the Hundred Acre Wood — better known here as Hell Forest. 

In the next chapter for “The Dark Domain,” Packard's rapidly expanding storytelling universe introduces Pooh as ferocious, enormous, and covered in black(!) blood. That's a lot of teddy to take in at the start, but the actor who plays Pooh, Gotay, is smart enough to wield the baked-in chaos of a public-domain horror set like a psychological shield. Effectively keeping Pooh's presence larger-than-life while still maintaining the self-awareness needed to keep Gotay from steering too goofy, the “Mickey-vs-Winnie” star helps Packard commit to the best and push the IP trend deeper into the film fringes with a nightmare that's gorier, grimier, and still full of glee.

Actress Fayna Sanchez, recently seen in “Abraham's Boys” and “House of Ashes,” co-stars as Clare. She's just a woman trying and, by the looks of the brutal teaser, failing to keep her friends alive in a gnarled maze that's ensnared their childhood trauma to manifest more adult memories sure to last for a lifetime. Drawn by a force they don't understand, this cast makes nostalgia look seriously nasty.

 










“They're turning what we love into nightmares,” says Clare… newly aware… of the bear. Playful yet menacing, Packard punches energy into his latest teaser, effectively conveying the feel of a production that leaned hard into physical intensity without dropping its dark comedic buzz.

“We even brought in a body-piercing suspension artist,” Packard said in a press release. That detail that lands somewhere between dedication to the craft and an OSHA violation in the making — but to butcher a phrase, you catch more flies using unbridled depravity than honey.  

“As a director, I was committed to creating the most authentic and intense atmosphere possible,” the filmmaker continued. “It was an intense experience for the cast, a few even vomited. When it was all said and done, we knew we'd done more than just pay homage to public domain horror, we elevated it. We gave horror fans exactly what they've been craving from this sub-genre.”

Dark Winnie and Dark Mickey endeavor to stand out in an increasingly crowded space as dueling monsters. Per Packar, they were respectively envisioned as “Jason Voorhees [leveling] up into the Predator” and “Pennywise meets Freddy Krueger.” (Hey, look! A win for that needlessly controversial IGN article about “The Running Man,” also born this week.)

 










Billed as the first-ever public-domain crossover, “Mickey-vs-Winnie” promises a devilish fight between its titular mousy manipulator and growling quadruped hungry for destruction. Coming on the heels of Dan Trachtenberg's “Predator: Badlands,” that's one small step for Disney — one giant agonizing limb-from-limb ripping for mankind.

A documentary about iconic rabble-rousing journalist Seymour Hersh makes for an intriguing enough premise, but Laura Poitras and Mark Obenhaus' lauded “Cover-Up” takes that promise and goes much further, using Hersh's own reporting to frame a damning look at the enduring moral crimes of America itself.

Per its official logline: “‘Cover-Up‘ is a political thriller that traces the explosive career of Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Seymour Hersh. Urgent and deeply reported, ‘Cover-Up' is both a portrait of a relentless journalist and an indictment of institutional violence — revealing a cycle of impunity in the U.S. military and intelligence agencies. Drawing on exclusive access to Hersh's notes, and interweaving primary documents and archival footage, ‘Cover-Up' captures the power and process of investigative journalism.”

Poitras and Obenhaus' film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival and went on to play Telluride, TIFF, NYFF, London, and IDFA. It's already been nominated for a variety of awards, including from the IDA Documentary Awards, the Critics Choice Documentary Awards, and the Cinema Eye Honors.

 










In his glowing review out of Venice, IndieWire's David Ehrlich wrote, “Poitras (‘Citizenfour,' ‘All the Beauty and the Bloodshed'), like Hersh, has made a career of unpacking the kind of civil violations and moral atrocities that would have been committed with impunity if not for a dedicated effort to bring the truth to light. In Hersh, whose ongoing body of work represents a chronology of American malfeasance that spans from the Vietnam War to the Gaza genocide, she and her co-director Mark Obenhaus have found the perfect opportunity to step back and see the big picture — to make one film that outlines a historic cycle of obfuscation rather than 10 films that grapple with each of these different subjects in a vacuum.”

Ehrlich also made sure to note that the film, while remarkable as an overarching look at some of the stories Hersh has covered during his career, also works as a film about Hersh himself. Ehrlich wrote, “There's no doubt that Poitras and Obenhaus see Hersh as a hero, but the nature of their work — and of his — refuses to let ‘Cover-Up' tip into hagiography. Poitras has been guilty of presenting her subjects in an overly beatific light in the past … but her latest film is sure to highlight the most egregious missteps of Hersh's career.”

 










In short, it's a must-see for anyone who loves documentary films and the hard truths they can zero in on so fixedly. “Cover-Up” will be released in select theaters in December, with a streaming release on Netflix to follow on Friday, December 26. Check out the film's first trailer below.

Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly” is about a movie star, which is to say it's about how hard it is to be a person — even when you're George Clooney. The film's focus puts a lot of emotional and frankly IMDB-rated baggage on the choices of the people who swirl around Jay's orbit, from his publicist (Laura Dern) and his long-suffering agent (Adam Sandler) to an old mentor (Jim Broadbent) and a former rival who had to get out of the movie game (Billy Crudup). Getting that exact combination of screen presences right required pitch-perfect casting.

 










During IndieWire's recent Crafts Roundtable discussion, presented in partnership with Warner Bros., “Jay Kelly” casting director Nina Gold, who has assembled murderer's row ensembles on everything from “Game of Thrones” and “Andor” to “Conclave” and “Power of the Dog,” spoke about the tradeoffs and the decision making in the casting process as not just its own challenge, but fundamentally part of the film's overall creative process.

“We are doing a very similar creative process to the editor or the costume designer or the cinematographer in that we're assembling the creative possibilities and helping to choose them and [getting to make] the right decisions. It's the same, but just with people,” Gold said.

 










How one establishes a base of knowledge to sort through all those people can take decades. “It's also a kind of ongoing thing, you know. One is — for years, just all the time — trying to amass knowledge and meet new people and have thoughts about who people are, and then when the moment is right that person that you saw, you know, 17 years ago in something, suddenly is in the right place at the right time,” Gold said.

The places where Gold looks for new faces are as varied as the ones that she finds — London theater, a lot of drama school, but also anyone with a phone has almost infinite windows onto the world of actors doing interesting things. “The world is really getting small. We all have so much more access to people from everywhere and more ability to find out who's doing what. It's really good and interesting and diversifying. I think eventually you realize that your intuition and instinct are about all you've really got,” Gold said. “I think it's the same in casting as in the whole of life, probably as luck and timing of everything.”

This conversation is presented in partnership with Netflix.

The final sortie of Summer Walker's Over It trilogy plays with the self-assurance of a certain kind of baddie describing her healing era in a TikTok storytime; put a finger down if you released your breakthrough album when you were 23, then fell in love with the producer who was your primary creative collaborator, discovered while pregnant with your first child that he was a cheater and a “male chauvinist,” flipped that fresh heartbreak into a Grammy-nominated EP, let new love in, became a mother to twin boys, extricated yourself from yet another toxic relationship, survived a couple more entanglements and the attendant Shade Room scrutiny, and now, years later, after definitively earning your spot among contemporary R&B's pantheon of mercurial lovergirls, you're finally over it.

Maybe for the first time, the socially anxious, historically press-averse, and consequently impenetrable Walker has seized on a big-budget album rollout to wrest her narrative from the comment section. Per her own framing, Finally Over It, a double album of polished '90s and early '00s R&B orthodoxy, trumpets the dawn of some kind of happily ever after. Or at least an end to the private torment and public humiliation that, experience suggests, must follow vulnerability, she told Complex's Speedy Morman this fall. Much like her endeavor to secure new emotional terrain, Walker uses Finally Over It to mount a breakaway from the “trap-soul” dictates of her Atlanta origins and the speaker-knocking distortion of early collaborators. Forming a nucleus with David “Dos Dias” Bishop as her primary cowriter and producer, Walker also invites in a corps of A-list writers and producers to help execute a style that is infinitely more legible. Her provocations are tamed, her rasp is sanded down, the limits of her range more strictly enforced. At times, though, Walker herself takes cover in plain sight.

No amount of emotional clarity can substitute for the barbed specificity and desperate rhythmic phrasing of Walker's strongest writing, largely abandoned on Finally Over It in the name of self-restraint. Instead, she disappears, along with guests Anderson .Paak and Bryson Tiller, into a tedious stretch that brings to mind a certain subgenre of YouTube tutorial: How to Make a '90s Slow Jam Type Beat in FL Studio. What Walker has not surrendered in the pursuit of growth is the near-pathological obsession, shared with her contemporaries across genres, with overtly referencing R&B hits of previous decades. “Baby” first samples and later interpolates Mariah Carey's “Always Be My Baby,” sullying the promise of an everlasting duet with a dispassionate performance from Chris Brown, who continues to patronize major-label releases with the enforced ubiquity of a mafia racket. “No,” a midtempo, boundary-setting anthem, begins with a sample of Beyoncé's 2003 song “Yes” and then firmly rejects the gendered domesticity famously pledged on Destiny's Child's “Cater 2 U.”

Walker is at her most effective as a songwriter and memorable as a performer when she makes room for the pistol-toting, drunk-dialling heroine of Over It and Still Over It, the very character she seems to be forsaking on this album. Still, the journey isn't without lessons learned. By disc two, it's clear, for instance, that she fares better when her costars are women. “Robbed You,” a set-up fantasy featuring Atlanta compatriot Mariah the Scientist, is more esprit d'escalier regret than warning: “I should have robbed you/I should have popped you,” Walker sings, crafting a hook from imperfect anaphora. On “Go Girl,” she proffers a clipped self-appraisal that lands more like statement of fact than affirmation, finding natural rhythm with Latto's boastful drawl; true beauty seeks to convince no one. Both handily outrap Doja Cat, who trails with the overworked affect of someone shooting for latter day-Eminem but landing closer to Qveen Herby. On the Kanye-referencing “How Sway” with Sailorr, Walker is at her funniest and most compelling: “You ask me if I'm flexible, I'll do a split/I wanna get your name engraved in pink glitter right on my blick.” When Walker represses that streak, she inevitably shrinks. “Allegedly,” featuring Teddy Swims, is, at best, a bore—a belter whose just-familiar-enough genre fusion and generic flyover-country allusions suggest it may find favor with whomever chooses songs for contestants on The Voice.

In the months preceding the release of Finally Over It, Walker repeatedly selected flashes of aqua that inevitably hinted at Tiffany Blue and the luxury bridal associations of Tiffany & Co. She launched a promotional website whose landing page resembles a wedding invitation. Most recently, she turned up to The Jennifer Hudson Show in a wedding dress, turning the show's familiar “tunnel walk” into a bridal march. If that weren't literal enough, the album's cover—photographed by Richie Talboy—doubles down on Walker's matrimonial third act: The image is a reference to Anna Nicole Smith's 1994 wedding picture, in which a stone-faced Smith clutches a bouquet of flowers in one hand and the sallow hand of octogenarian billionaire J. Howard Marshall in the other. What is less clear is whether Walker intends the cover as a celebration of the transactional nature of love or a critique of its parallels in her chosen industry or a rejection of both. One hopes, as Walker lingers at the altar and at an apparent crossroads of her own, that she has considered what awaited history's most recognizable and maligned sugar baby after she crossed the threshold.

As we become more comfortable in the digital world, our tolerance for any discomfort in the physical world seems to decrease. We stand in the corner at the party looking at our phones to avoid making small talk; we let our eyes flit between screens to smother any thought that we might otherwise have to sit with alone. If this is what we do for fun, then what does work look like? As it turns out, it's often indistinguishable. On Station on the Hill, the debut album from Vancouver noise-rock outfit Computer, alienation exists in nearly every aspect of contemporary life—work and play, it's all the same, all the time. When the world seems like too much, Computer lean into discomfort and add to the noise.

Plenty of heavy bands address the theme of modern overstimulation, but few embody it so tangibly. “I got a new job today/With suits and shoes and socks/And everything paid/It's all been leading up to this,” lead vocalist Ben Lock narrates over a noodling riff on “Weird New Vocation.” His unnamed job and the material pleasures it brings him—a bigger house, “a car with four doors/and four mirrors to see myself”—are supposed to add up to a better quality of life and a stronger sense of self, but they only lead to further disillusionment. He remains stoic as his self worth breaks down, his credo evolving from “I feel better about myself” to “I want to feel better about myself” to just “I want to feel better,” until the song is capped off by a violent outro that sounds like every instrument being thrown down a flight of stairs.

Computer have not been a band for long, but they have already demonstrated striking ambition and a voracious appetite. Station on the Hill is a cinderblock-dense collection of math rock, post-punk, hardcore, and occasional flourishes of klezmer (think early Black Country, New Road). It leaves little room to breathe, and the quieter moments are just as skin-crawling as their earsplitting counterparts. “The Bells” is a haunting, minute-long interlude consisting of reverberating chords and frizzled, incomprehensible chatter; it precedes the last and longest song, whose quiet passage of wavering saxophone and emo guitar twinkling underscore Lock's trembling vocals. After two hard-and-fast rippers, “Now in a Vacuum” and “Concrete Vehicles,” the slow, minimalistic creep of “I'll Follow” is like a hushed talking-to when you're expecting to get yelled at—somehow dead-serious restraint is more grim than outright rage. One riff repeats while the drums grow louder and more metallic, at which point Lock repeats the song's title, the word “follow” morphing into “fall low,” while Jackson Bell's sax drowns him out.

It's one of many instances when Lock makes a death-row meal of an unassuming phrase. On “The Picture,” he repeats the words, “I'll say to myself” like he's muttering under his breath between splashes of cold water during a panic attack, his bandmates descending with fists on the door. Lock treats the title of the glitchiest and catchiest track, “Dissolution Use,” almost as a filler phrase, tossed into a conversation he's half checked out of (“You've been so consumed by the news of your/Uh uh uh/Your dissolution use”). Occasional seconds-long passages of palm-muted guitar amble about until all the other instruments crash down like a divine hammer.

There are seven musicians credited on Station on the Hill, and they all work overtime. Every sound manages to stand out from the mix: the hollow, clanging bongos and screeching strings on “Now in a Vacuum,” the sludgy guitar solo toward the end of “Concrete Vehicles,” the ever-expanding drone that persists throughout the title track's nine-and-a-half minutes. This is not a record to consume passively—it's one to be consumed by. “Numbing is not my intention/Life is what I choose,” Lock sings on “Now in a Vacuum.” These songs embrace overstimulation as a desperate means of self-determination or self-destruction to the point that you can hardly tell the two apart.

Spotify has acquired the sample-sourcing website WhoSampled. The streaming service announced that it's rolling out a new feature called SongDNA, which will aggregate and centralize samples and covers of songs based on the WhoSampled database. According to a statement from WhoSampled, the site will continue to operate “as a standalone platform and brand.”

As of today (November 19), Spotify is also expanding its song credits feature to include all personnel who worked on a given song. The platform first introduced song credits in 2018—a year after Tidal began publicly displaying song and album credits—but previously listed only top-line performers, songwriters, and producers.

“Every song is a collaboration, and every contributor should be seen,” said Spotify's Jacqueline Ankner. “With expanded Song Credits, SongDNA, and About the Song, we're giving fans a deeper look at the people and creative threads behind the music they love and giving creators the recognition they deserve. It's another step in Spotify's work to champion the people, connections, and stories that bring every track to life.”

Recent months have seen an exodus of artists from Spotify, with many citing the military investments made by CEO Daniel Ek through his venture capital fund Prima Materia. (Since 2021, Prima Materia has been investing in Helsing, a defense company that sells AI-using software to inform military decisions.) Among the acts to pull their music from the platform (or signal an intent to pull music) are Massive Attack, Angel Deradoorian, Hotline TNT, Young Widows, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, WU LYF, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Xiu Xiu, and Deerhoof.

At a time when violently distorted, nearly atonal rage rap can scratch the mainstream while avant-garde jazz artists fuse traditional band arrangements with the unearthly sound design of club music's vanguard, it's no small feat that WRENS' “Charlie Parker” manages to be one of the year's strangest singles in either genre. As drummer Jason Nazary sets the Brooklyn band's wounded gait slightly ahead of plucky synths and a flute in hysterics, frontman and trumpeter Ryan Easter starts kicking a verse that recontextualizes boilerplate trap and drill lines into the jazz world. He's pointing Smith & Wessons at the opps; whipping chickens on the stove like they're the roadkill the track's titular saxophonist ate on the day he earned his famous nickname. There are layers to the playfulness. Ikue Mori-esque data chirps, drunken basslines, and mashed drumfills tussle in a cartoon dust cloud as Easter manipulates his identity in the foreground. He dons the masks of the street rap mafioso, jazz virtuoso, and sensitive young man, each of them a character, each of them overlapping to reveal their similarities. Music packed with this many bells, whistles, and in-jokes should read as gimmicky. WRENS, however, have the chops and taste to emerge with their sincerity intact—a trick they pull time and time again on their sophomore effort, Half of What You See.

WRENS' 2023 debut double album, alligator shoes [on flatbush], chronicled two formative sessions that captured their sound before and after the addition of cellist Lester St. Louis. While this rawer early material demonstrated the band's shared taste for musically dense yet texturally weightless improvisation, the record sometimes felt maximalist for eccentricity's sake, as if each member was anxious to one-up the other's IDM-adjacent synth timbre. Half of What You See sounds no less quirky, but it's more intentional and patient. On instrumental cut “Longbow,” the electronics treat the performance's surface without intruding on the tense harmonic conversation between bowed cello and murmuring keys. There's still heavy traffic within the stereo field, but none of the individual parts is in a rush to get its ideas across. The strings pace back and forth in measured loops while Easter and pianist Elias Stemeseder riff on the same ruminant phrases. Each of the individual performers' personalities cuts through the collective unease, as when the initially gorgeous ambient synth progression on “Intro” sours for a few bars, briefly sending the band into panic before Easter's trumpet stabilizes things.

When Easter lowers his instrument to pick up the mic, however, the band truly jells, like on the sinister, punchline-laden “Snake.” Here, he wields Biblical imagery to embody both sides of a rap god/devil dichotomy, adopting a drawn-out, deliberate flow that's a cross between Earl Sweatshirt and Lil B. His casual humor and rootedness in the everyday grounds the band's abstraction. Despite the high-art stylistics and references to New Testament lore, Easter is honest enough to express his vulgar human desires to “sit atop a bag like an audience for Oprah” or “watch you toot that ass.” In blurring the lines between divine and mundane, between highbrow and lowbrow, Easter needles the mysterious, academic veneer of avant-garde jazz, focusing on the raw thrill of the music at its core. As popular forms of hip-hop beat production and club music sound increasingly complex and overstimulating, he acts as a liaison between worlds, making the case that it can all be fun and freaked-out in the same way.

Like electric Miles or Ornette Coleman's flirtations with post-punk on Of Human Feelings, WRENS' electroacoustic jazz-rap is messy and sincere, unafraid to carve out new paths even if it means breaching awkward territory or dissonance. Half of What You See is chaotic and peculiar because it's the product of four talented improvisers pursuing their unconventional interests: Its idiosyncrasies never feel forced, because at the end of the day, their creativity remains grounded in the flesh. As Easter says on “Interlude,” “All I got to say is I hope that for all this work we do…there's some ass when I get back home.”

Last December, Virginia rapper ladé quietly released Flexico, a chest-puffing EP that revitalized a bygone era of SoundCloud. I'm talking classic plugg music: back when there were shades of Zaytoven in every beat and SpaceGhostPurrp in every verse, when Uno and Fauni were inseparable, when MadeinTYO was Ubering everywhere, and when it felt like Digital Nas had more say-so than the one who made Illmatic. ladé first caught my attention with the Flexico cover art—a hand-drawn pair of eyes that looked nearly identical to the ones on D Savage's D Phoenix, a tentpole of that mid-to-late 2010s moment. When I pointed out that similarity online, I got a handful of replies from dudes telling me “get wit da wave or drown #klan #ftw” and “klan shi fa eternity.” All I could think was: Did he just say ‘klan shit'?

I'd come to find out that this klan is a loose collective of artists, including ladé, based in and around Virginia. Exactly two months after my tweet, I watched ladé command a stuffy ass basement in Manhattan with a mic in his hand and no shirt on his back. In true hip-hop fashion, he rocked the crowd with over a dozen dudes mobbing behind him, most of whom I presume are, well, Klan members. As the tone-setter for his compatriots, ladé has been prolifically adapting the triplet flows and bionic melismas that defined the rap he grew up on. Where plugg upstarts a decade ago tended to lean into haphazard spontaneity, ladé's curation yields something sharper and more measured. With LaFlair, the chain-swinging, speaker-knocking full-length he's been building toward all year, ladé makes a case for himself as a blockbuster emcee-to-be.

Take “Park Terrace,” where he comes across as cool, fastidious, and reflective in the face of grandeur. There's tension brewing in the oscillating bells and onomatopoeic gunfire, a mafioso chill to the icy arpeggios and percussive jolts. Flexes come naturally in the lyrics, and so too do allusions to family. “Always had to put my mama first/My folks always told me keep my word,'” ladé spits earnestly. That energy is key to the album as a whole, reminding me of the sink-or-swim urgency that informed Migos' mixtape run in the 2010s. You can envision the weight of street customs and familial expectations gradually being leveled by the pressure of new wealth and fame. “Thank God I made it alive/'Cause they tried to bend me and I ain't break,” ladé reflects on “Jesus Piece.” His laid-back temperament distinguishes him from Migos' in-your-face tenacity, but the hunger is the same. Even rapping with blooshot grit on “Stay Solid,” he never seems pressed to raise his voice.

So much of being a good rapper is conviction: How much you believe in what you rap, how much you can get people to believe in it, and how seamlessly that synergy is relayed. Lyrically, ladé moves in familiar territory, oftentimes leaning on trap clichés. Despite this, I never get the feeling that he's selling a life that isn't his own. What he lacks in clever, colorful songwriting, he makes up for in cutthroat execution. LaFlair finds rhythmic poise and melodic stability in the way his hooks and verses meld into each other, forming a continuous stream of momentum. “Against Me or With Me” is as lush as it is in part because ladé's lullaby-like cadence never changes course. The Brent Rambo-assisted “Corner” isn't as mystifying, but the melody from its startlingly repetitive hook is the type that burrows into your subconscious for days on end.

Even the beats on LaFlair feel plucked from a sleeker, more idyllic version of the 2010s plugg scene. The Hitec-produced “Find Her” feels like a supercharged take on UnoTheActivist's Live.Shyne.Die, a tape marked by mutant hypnagogia. Similarly, the way producer Jimmie builds around the glossy arpeggios of “Against Me or With Me” with plush keys and a spooky synth line brings to mind Heavy Weight Champ by Thouxanbanfauni. At times, the instrumentals border on mimicry: The sound effects and drums on “Believe That” and “Had Dreams” are arranged exactly how BeatPluggz used to, and the piano flourishes of the latter song and “Jesus Piece” sound straight out of Future and Zaytoven's Beast Mode series. That doesn't make LaFlair any less potent, though. ladé's ability to lock into earworms and translate his ambition is exciting. Safe to say his homies were right for popping their shit.

		“We just put our heads down and go to work,” Joe Budden says of his podcast crew.	








							By 

	Jeff Ihaza




F
or more than a decade, Joe Budden, host of The Joe Budden Podcast, has been a fixture on the rap internet, most recognizable for his, uh, passionate commentary about all things hip-hop. Historically, his rants have existed on a gradient of intensity from visibly annoyed to existen­tially pissed off (like in his famous interview with a teenage Lil Yachty, who was unaware of what the term “360 deal” meant). In person, however, Budden has a surprising air of Zen. He speaks in a calm, measured tone, even as he tells me about the rush-hour traffic into Manhattan from his home base in New Jersey.


	Budden first found fame as a rapper in the early 2000s, and is probably best known for his chart-topping hit “Pump It Up.” Today, he and his podcast co-hosts — who currently include Queenzflip, Mona Love, Ice, Ish, Parks, and Marc Lamont Hill — command an audience that sets the zeitgeist, boasting more than 70,000 paid Patreon subscribers. His show is not just among rap's longest-running commentary series, it's also one of the most profitable, on pace to earn $20 million in revenue in 2025. Over the past year, The Joe Budden Podcast has fortified its status as essential listening, covering a whirlwind of news in the hip-hop world — from Kendrick Lamar versus Drake to Young Thug's snitching allegations. With the recent addition of Hill, an academic and former CNN commentator, the show has seamlessly pivoted into more political topics.

	











	“It's been a pretty good year,” Budden says modestly. “We just put our heads down and go to work. The topics have been kind to us, the energy is good, and we feel good about where we sit.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	As it happens, Budden was a trending topic on X the day we met. On a recent episode of the podcast, Hill and Queenzflip had gotten into a heated exchange that seemingly almost came to blows. Therein lies the brilliance of The Joe Budden Podcast: It lives somewhere between the highbrow sensibility of PBS News Hour and the raw, uncut personality of barbershop talk.

	“It's organized chaos,” Budden says. “We come in Tuesdays and Fridays and do a think tank. We get the Sharpies, make a board — everything we're passionate about speaking on, and make a soup out of it. I never want to be formulaic, like, ‘This is what's going on, this is what I'm asking y'all to talk about.' It has to feel good. That's the art of it.”


	So what should listeners make of the viral shouting matches and controversies on the show? Budden assures me that, despite what some might think, none of it is staged. “There's a format, but there's no script,” he explains. “Everybody plays their role and contributes. By the end, it turns into a beautiful picture.”


	In 2018, Budden signed a two-year licensing deal with Spotify to bring his show to the platform exclusively for around $2 million per year. The alignment was part of the streaming giant's podcasting strategy, which included signing Joe Rogan for a whopping $200 million over three years. But as it came time to renew in 2020, Budden and his business partner Ian Schwartzman decided to move to a direct-to-consumer subscription model, partnering with Patreon at the start of 2021.  “At Spotify, you're working in conjunction with them, and you aren't reaping so many of the benefits of the scaling,” he says. Still, you wonder how many millions Budden left on the table.


	Since first launching in 2015, The Joe Budden Podcast has been an experiment in programming. The live-wire lineup of co-hosts embodies the perspective brought by the social media era, where content creators are expected, if not required, to present themselves in their rawest possible form. There's a balance in characters that, to Budden's credit, has the feeling of an all-star sports team, though he assembled the group with relationships in mind above all. “Parks is the longest-tenured — he's the engineer and on-air personality. Ice, I've known forever. Friendship is still the fabric of this thing,” he says. “Then we got Mona, who's a comedian with incredible timing, and Flip, who's infectious. Everybody brings something unique. When we come together, it's like Voltron. The sum is greater than the parts.”

	THAT BUDDEN HAS BECOME one of the most influential voices in Black media isn't much of a surprise. You could even say it was calculated. Shortly after the release of “Pump It Up,” he had an on-air stint on New York's Hot 97. He stopped because Def Jam, his record label at the time, gave him an ultimatum: Keep your rap career, or stick with radio. “If you're telling me at 23, 24 years old, ‘Hey, you have to make a decision,' for me, I would be able to talk in my fifties and sixties. I wouldn't be able to go out and tour,” he explains. “So that was always in the back pocket for me. ‘Let me go over here and rap, since you're saying I can't do both, and I'll get back to that later.'”


	Budden was prescient in other ways. As early as 2001, he was navigating rap message boards, where audiences would discuss new music in real time. “It was market re­search,” he recalls. “Def Jam, at the time, wasn't paying too much attention to social media. That's where you grew community.”


	Despite his embrace of technology, Budden still appreciates physical media. He recalls the power of the early-2000s mixtape circuit, where CDs distributed amongst rap fans made for a legible subculture. “So much good rap music got lost because of that transition,” he says. “When Drama got locked up and they started arresting DJs and guys selling CDs on 34th Street, that was a real turning point. Napster was happening at the same time. There was a fight going on for rights and ownership, and a lot of us had no idea. We were just doing it for the love.”


	“Now, it's regulated,” he adds. “Same thing they did with weed, they did with music. It's regulated.”


	He says he still buys albums, opting to purchase digital downloads over streaming. “If somebody hits a button one day, and we can't stream anymore, I still want my music,” he says. “There's nothing I love more than music, on Earth. I want my music, I'm buying it. Streaming was looked at like bootlegging when I was coming up. It should be looked at as bootlegging now.”


	That said, Budden isn't one to wallow in nostalgia; he simply stays on the front lines. Even before there was any concept of livestreaming, and before many of today's content creators were even born, Budden would webcast on the now-defunct platform UStream. Much like streamers like Kai Cenat, it was just him in a room, riffing. People in the industry at the time thought he was crazy for playing unfinished music on air.

	“I sat in front of these things and did everything that was outlawed back then,” he says. “There's a value in these people hearing and seeing the creation of the song, and how it comes together. But not at that time. A little too ahead of the curve.”


	That early pushback had a way of shaping how Budden approached podcasting. He says the decision to take the show independent was “scary but empowering.” And it was his experiences in the music industry that moved him forward. “What was going through my mind? ‘I won't allow myself to be treated the way I was treated yesterday, so tomorrow has to be different.'”

	If you love the Beatles, you definitely want to hear this new “Baby I'm a Rich Man,” from the superb new collection Anthology 4. It's a six-minute take from May 1967, unheard until now, with the lads hard at work in Abbey Road. John calls out to their loyal roadie Mal Evans, “We'd like some Cokes, Mal.” Paul adds, “And if you've got some cannabis resin!” That sounds good to John. “Yeah,” he says. “If you've got cannabis, send it in!” 


	They know the tapes are rolling, but they don't care. They're on top of the world and they know it.  Paul quips, “We've got that taped for the High Court tomorrow.” (This recording session happens to be the day after Mick Jagger and Keith Richards got dragged into court for their recent drug bust. Cheeky lads, these.) John declares, “All right, let's hear some rhythm and soul from London now!” Then they rip into “Baby I'm a Rich Man” — not even one of their most famous 1967 songs, just another day of genius for this crew, thriving on a four-way energy nobody else can reach. It's such a jolt to hear it — how passionately these boys love being the Beatles. 

	











Anthology 4 is a real treasure trove for fans. It's the companion album to the long-awaited new edition of the ultimate Beatles documentary. The original Anthology blew up into a global sensation when it debuted in November 1995, a TV miniseries plus three albums and a book. It's the full Fab Four story, in the words of the boys who lived it out: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Anthology is finally getting its new version, restored and expanded, debuting on Disney+ on November 26. It's got an emotionally powerful new Episode Nine, focusing on footage of the three surviving Beatles coming together in 1994 and 1995. 

	











	The Anthology albums were packed with unreleased tunes, outtakes, demos, and studio banter. Giles Martin, son and heir to original producer George Martin, has remastered the Nineties volumes, but he's also curated the new Anthology 4. The Anthology Collection has 191 tracks in all, available for download and streaming, as well as deluxe box sets with 12 vinyl LPs or 8 CDs. Anthology 4 is separately available as a stand-alone box, either triple-vinyl or 2 CDs.

Anthology 4 has 13 previously unreleased takes, mostly from the 1964-1965 period, where you hear them working out early songs like “Tell Me Why,” “Nowhere Man,” and “Every Little Thing.” It also gathers 23 tracks from previous archival editions, mostly in the past decade. But Anthology 4 weaves all the material together into a jubilant story of the band in full creative frenzy. As John quips at the end of this previously unheard take of “Hey Bulldog,” they're “veering between yer blues and yer comedy.”


	When the original Anthology albums dropped, everybody figured this was the final word on the Beatles — but it turned out the vaults were full of archival treasures that would take decades to emerge. Two of the Anthology 4 songs, “I Saw Her Standing There” and “Money (That's What I Want),” came out on The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963, an oddity released for just a few hours in 2013 to extend the European copyright.


	Most of these tracks come from the Special Editions that have been redefining the Beatles legacy ever since 2017, when the Sgt. Pepper box blew minds, packed with more goodies than even the most hardcore Fabological obsessives could have imagined. There's outtakes of “Got To Get You Into My Life” from the Revolver box, “Here Comes the Sun” from Abbey Road, “Don't Let Me Down” from the Apple rooftop. The topper is “Good Night,” from the 2018 White Album edition, with all four Beatles harmonizing — a stunning performance that somehow sat in the vaults for 50 years.

	But the heart of Anthology 4 is the previously unheard material. There's a revelatory first take of “In My Life,” with John thinking the song out loud, screwing up his courage, with Paul's harmony and Ringo's drums providing the brotherly support he needs. He never sounded more naked. “I've Just Seen A Face” is all madcap comic energy, with John joking about Fifties skiffle pioneer Lonnie Donegan, saying, “Lonnie's gonna be sorry he didn't sing this one.” They break up laughing, as they keep doing all over Anthology 4, and it's a contagious sound — if you savor the sound of these lads laughing at themselves, this album has their highest mirth-per-minute ratio.

	











	There's an amazing early take of “This Boy,” known only to proud owners of the 1995 “Free As a Bird” CD single, which means practically nobody. As it begins, John sneers, “Get that bloody mic out of the way.” But it's breathtaking to hear him leap into the bridge and wail “Oh myyyyy” — there's no holding back, only the most intense emotional urgency. John kept putting down “This Boy” for the rest of his life, dismissing as an early throwaway — but he was probably just threatened by how vulnerable he let himself sound. 


	“Every Little Thing” is a loose studio romp, which falls apart when Paul confesses, “I burped.” There's also a BBC rehearsal of “All You Need Is Love” with comic narration (“Queen Margaret in a low-feathered nightgown”). Ringo belts a fantastic “Matchbox,” sounding live and raw, without the bizarrely overdone reverb from the botched official version, busting out his “all right George” for the guitar solo.


	One of the best moments is the terminally underrated “I Need You,” a George Harrison tune from Help! It's faster and friskier than the final version, bristling with Buddy Holly energy, but you can hear how nervous he is. In the final minute, the rest of the band is snickering at him, yet the Quiet One perseveres and never breaks. (In the final credits of the Help! movie, he keeps repeating his songwriting credit out loud: “‘I Need You' by George Harrison!” It wasn't easy being George.) It isn't hard to hear the link between this “I Need You” and the solemn focus he brought to “Isn't It A Pity” or “Behind that Locked Door,” five chaotic years later.


	But the emotional highlight here is “If I Fell.” John guides himself into the song, as if he's not sure how earnest he dares to get, while Ringo clicks loudly behind him. This session is February 1964, right when the Beatlemania explosion is going global — just a couple weeks after their American conquest on The Ed Sullivan Show. But they're already determined to leave it behind, pushing on with this weirdly constructed ballad, with more chord changes than they'd ever crammed into one tune. The kidding and laughing is all gone as soon as the song begins — John is laser-focused on telling his story, his voice deadly serious, lifted by those hair-raising Paul harmonies. “If I Fell” is a song you've heard a million times, but hearing this version makes you marvel that it ever happened.

	











	The Anthology project inspired the three surviving Beatles, Paul, George, and Ringo, to reunite in the studio and rescue some unfinished John songs, from home cassette demos provided by Yoko Ono. “Free as a Bird” and “Real Love,” both Nineties singles, are here, newly remixed by producer Jeff Lynne. Anthology 4 ends fittingly with “Now and Then,” a John demo the lads tried at the 1994 sessions, but left unfinished.  In the new Episode Nine, Paul muses, “It might not go away, that one.” He was right — decades later, he returned to his old friend's song, until it became the final Beatles single in 2023.

	George Harrison tells a great story in the new episode about the Beatles working late nights at Abbey Road. “Some of the people here — the engineer, for instance — would always be trying to go home at 5:30,” he says in mock horror. “And we'd all be trying to make history.” So Mal Evans brewed a special pot of tea for the studio crew. “We doused the tea with uppers,” George recalls. “‘Can we go home now?' No, you can't, bastard — have a cup of tea.” Ringo adds, “George [Martin] hasn't come down yet.”


	The entire Anthology Collection bristles with that kind of nonstop restless creative spirit — the raw Hamburg punk rock of Volume One, the trippy studio experiments of Volume Two, the mature world-weary grit of Volume Three. There's a comic moment in the new Episode Nine where George and Ringo mock Paul for being the taskmaster in the band, always hustling the others into the studio. As Ringo quips, “We could sit in the garden longer than you.” Paul has to plead guilty. “I was the work fiend,” he admits. “I like the Beatles. I like to work with the Beatles. I'm not ashamed of that. It's what I love in life, all that making music.” You can hear that love loud and clear with all four boys on Anthology.

Charli XCX stars as herself in the first trailer for the singer's upcoming film The Moment, a movie that goes behind-the-scenes of Brat Summer while simultaneously serving as metafiction about the music industry.


	The A24 film was directed by Aidan Zamiri and “based on an original idea” by XCX. A previous logline teased that The Moment was about “a rising pop star navigates the complexities of fame and industry pressure while preparing for her arena tour debut,” and with the first trailer, it's revealed the “rising pop star” in question is Charli XCX herself.


	As the preview shows, The Moment combines real-life moments from the Brat tour — XCX's stop to The Late Show, concert footage, etc. — with scripted material to form the narrative. “It's fiction, but it's the realest depiction of the music industry that I've ever seen,” XCX previously said of the film, adding that it was “not a tour documentary or a concert film in any way.”

	











	The trailer also hints at some of the film's all-star cast with Rachel Sennott, Alexander Skarsgaard, and Kylie Jenner making quick cameos; the film will also feature Kate Berlant, Rosanna Arquette, Hailey Benton Gates, Jamie Demetriou, and others in XCX's orbit, like Shygirl and A.G. Cook, who's handling of The Moment's music.

The Moment arrives in theaters on January 30, 2026.


	2026 is shaping up to be a big year on the big screen for XCX, who has also crafted an album's worth of music for the upcoming Wuthering Heights adaptation. The singer is also set to star in Dakota Johnson's directorial debut, as well as Gregg Araki's I Want Your Sex, Cathy Yan's The Gallerist and Daniel Goldhaber's take on Faces of Death.

	The technical term is an ass-kicking. 


	Democrats came roaring back in the 2025 off-year elections, flipping seats from governor to positions in state and county legislatures, with the GOP failing to win any real pick-ups under the weight of Donald Trump's plummeting popularity.


	Gone is the talk of Trump's single-handed domination of our politics and the futility of resistance. American elections are functioning and Trump's second honeymoon is over, as prices continue to rise and the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein haunts the president and his allies.


	But Democrats need to learn the lessons from their big November night. Because whatever sugar high they may be feeling will soon collide with the fact that their party's approval rating is still stubbornly lower than Trump's, according to multiple polls compiled by CNN. 


	Much of the media focus is on the extraordinary elevation of the 34-year old Democratic Socialist Assemblyman Zorhan Mamdani to the New York mayoralty after polling at one percent a year ago. But if you dig into the data you'll see that over indexing his win risks the danger of misreading the mandate. That reality check should temper any temptation among Democrats to lurch to the far left.

	











	Over in New Jersey and Virginia, Governors-elect Mikie Sherril and Abigail Spanberger won victories, both with 57 percent of the vote, in states that often elect Republican governors. Democrats made gains in gains in virtually every county compared with last year's presidential election. Yes, they benefited from backlash against Trump, but crucially they made gains among middle-class moderates in the suburbs, and even improved margins in rural areas. That's a formula that can propel Democrats to victory in the midterms and beyond. 

	











	Here's the key stat to keep in mind: Mamdani won barely 50 percent of the vote in a city that's six to one Democrat. When all the votes are counted, he could well dip below majority support – which is academic to the extent that his opposition was split between red beret Republican Curtis Sliwa and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, running half-heartedly as an independent. But for the Democratic nominee to barely break 50 percent in NYC is not a massive mandate.

	Yes, Mandami succeeded in inspiring a young liberal base. Yes, he ran a brilliant and simple campaign. More than a million people turned out to support him. His campaign message was relentlessly focused on affordability and personal authenticity expressed through compelling short form digital videos on social media.


	Those are clear lessons that Democrats across the spectrum can learn from. In fact, Governors-elect Sherril and Spanberger also focused their messages almost exclusively on affordability and the economy. They refused to get drawn into divisive culture war debates.


	They also share a broad political profile which can help Democrats expand their appeal nationally. Both women were decidedly centrist members of Congress with national security street cred: Sherril was a former Navy helicopter pilot and Spanberger was a former CIA analyst.


	In contrast, Mamdani's profile is less likely to help win swing districts and swing states. He has never worked in the private sector and has no record of military service or executive experience – which is a practical challenge for managing a $117 billion budget.


	While he is now a national hero to the Bernie Bros, Mamdani is already a punching bag for national Republicans. As my friend, New York 1 anchor Errol Louis has joked: Mamdani is everything the Tea Party accused Barack Obama of being: born in Africa; a Muslim and a socialist. None of that, of course, excuses race-baiting or fear-mongering from Republicans.

	Part of the genius of Mamdani's campaign is that he may have been an avatar for identity politics, but he never played that card hard. While he resisted criticizing policies or people to his left (only half-heartedly distancing himself from calls to “globalize the intifada” and his own past tweets calling to defund the police), Mamdani offered a relentlessly upbeat demeanor and famously smiling face that inspired hope in many at a time when that is in short supply. His success was a prime example of Maya Angelou's admonition that people might not remember what you said but they remember how you made them feel.

	











	That's exactly why the contrast with his victory night speech and those offered up by Spanberger and Sherill was so stark.


	Spanberger called for “pragmatism over partisanship” in a state that has suffered under Trumpism's right-wing policies. But Mamdani met his triumphant moment not with a call to unity in a divided city but something close to a socialist manifesto, name checking Eugene Debs in the opening paragraphs, slamming Trump and Cuomo, and generally promising a new ideological order.


	That's clearly what he believes his mandate to be. But the job of mayor is effective management – it is essentially a non-ideological problem-solving position. As his legendary predecessor Fiorello LaGuardia once said, “There is no Democrat, Republican, or Socialist way to sweep the streets.” When it comes to governing, charisma is important, but competence is essential. 


	After the Bloomberg years, New York's last two mayors have left office in the doghouse with voters, with Bill de Blasio barely showing up for work and Eric Adams beset by a steady stream of corruption allegations from his crony circle. 


	We are living in an era of extremes. Donald Trump's team has tried to normalize the idea that any victory — no matter how narrow — is a mandate to impose their extreme ideological vision on the nation, believing that might makes right.


	To win the country, not just New York City, Democrats need to build a popular, durable majority based on something more than opposition to Trump — which is necessary but not sufficient. Democrats have correctly if belatedly focused on the issue of affordability. The basic social contract which says if you work hard and play by the rules you'll get ahead has been broken, and that righteous frustration is fueling populist fire.

	But that passion needs to be channeled in a constructive direction or it will burn the whole house down. Democrats should not defend a broken status quo but they need to offer reforms in ways that attract more people than they alienate — focusing on rebuilding the middle class and the middle of our politics while ditching the culture war obsessions that drag them down. Because Donald Trump has decided to divide in order to conquer, Democrats have an additional obligation to try and unite.


	This month's election results show that Democrats can win big in swing districts, kicking out candidates who suck up to Trump and excuse his unhinged excesses. But victories in New York City are not a model for winning in rural and purple America. Misreading Democratic mandates and thinking one size fits all  plays into Republican hands, and will only perpetuate the polarization afflicting our nation.

The highly respected Global Policy Journal has published a blog entitled “Don't look up?“ – Why it is past time for serious holistic research into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, written by Karin Austin (Director of the Center for the Impossible, Rice University, and of the John Mack Institute), Michael Bohlander (Chair in Global Law and SETI Policy at Durham University) and Kimberly S. Engels (Associate Professor of Philosophy at Molloy University and Research Director of the John Mack Institute).

They argue that UAP research needs to be taken more seriously, domestically and on the international level, and should encompass all aspects of the phenomenon, not just the technological side. The enormity of the implications for humanity if some of the UAP are indeed of non-human origin is nothing short of existential. 

It is important and encouraging that serious and rigorous major mainstream academic journals are beginning to include the topic in their wider discussion.

By Benjamin Davis / The Jambar

The Public Library of Youngstown and Mahoning County held an event called “Just How Weird is Ohio?” on Nov. 7, as part of its America 250 program. For the event, the library hosted James Willis, author and paranormal researcher.

Willis gave presentations on alleged hauntings, cryptids and strange folklore that are part of Ohio's history. When the library first contacted Willis, he said he liked the idea of examining the stranger side of Ohio's history. 

“I thought it was really kind of cool that they were looking to approach it from not necessarily purely historical, but the weird and spooky side of historical things in Ohio,” Willis said.

The presentations cover both historical events in Ohio and cryptids that were reported in the state.

“The one I did at the main library was where I talked about real historical events that happened in Ohio, but there was just a weird spin on them,” Willis said. “The other presentation [was] about Bigfoot and other mythical creatures that have been alleged to have been roaming around Ohio as part of their history.”

Willis said he has been involved in paranormal research for decades. In 1999, he founded his own paranormal research organization called Ghosts of Ohio, after moving to the state.

“I've been involved with looking for ghosts and ghost research since the mid 1980s. So, when I moved to Ohio I decided, ‘Okay, I'll just kind of join a group that is in Ohio,'” Willis said. “They didn't really … fit my sort of methodology or what I was trying to accomplish so [I] was like, ‘I'll just start my own group.'”

This fascination with the paranormal comes from Willis' upbringing in the Hudson Valley region of New York.

“The area that I grew up in, in the Hudson Valley of New York, is a very weird place,” Willis said. “They don't just have ghost stories up there … they've also got UFO reports, and monsters, and cryptids and serial killers, I mean you name it.”

The next event at the library for the America 250 program is “Owls of Ohio: Mask Craft,” which will be held from 4:30-5:30 p.m. Nov. 21.

The search for extraterrestrial technology around the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has hit a firm scientific wall, with astronomers reporting that the radio signatures detected near the comet are entirely natural.

Using South Africa's MeerKAT radio telescope, researchers captured faint absorption lines shortly after the object reappeared from behind the Sun, sparking excitement online about a potential artificial signal.

But detailed analysis has now confirmed these frequencies match standard cometary chemistry, not alien communication.

The findings quieten weeks of speculation fuelled by unusual behaviour, shifting brightness and bold theories from high-profile commentators, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.

The new results centre on two faint absorption lines at 1,665 MHz and 1,667 MHz, recorded on 24 October, shortly after 3I/ATLAS completed its perihelion. According to the International Business Times UK, these frequencies correspond to hydroxyl (OH) radicals created when sunlight breaks down water molecules in a comet's coma.

Coverage in LiveScience adds that the measured frequencies are textbook examples of comet outgassing, not transmission patterns from engineered technology. The Indian Express likewise reports that, while speculation swirled online, observational evidence points decisively to a natural origin.

As IBTimes UK previously noted, the alignment between the detected lines and known OH absorption behaviour leaves virtually no scientific room for an artificial explanation.

The detection was publicised through an astronomer telegram, prompting curiosity because the object had already shown erratic brightness and unusual polarisation.

Some commentators linked the frequencies to the famous 1977 'Wow! Signal', reviving theories aired by Loeb that 3I/ATLAS might be a probe or beacon, as Newsweek reported.

But planetary scientists have dismissed the extraterrestrial leap. ESA comet expert Michael Küppers told The Guardian: 'It looks like a comet and it behaves like a comet. There is no reason to think it is something else.'

Wired explains why the pattern confused some observers: MeerKAT didn't detect a signal being sent. Instead, it picked up a fingerprint of absorption—the natural imprint left behind when solar radiation interacts with a water-rich coma.

Beyond radio data, multiple instruments have strengthened the case that 3I/ATLAS is simply an unusual interstellar comet. Ultraviolet observations from NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected OH emissions, a classic signature of water activity.

Meanwhile, spectroscopy from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed that the coma is extraordinarily enriched in CO₂—among the highest concentrations ever seen in a comet—alongside carbon monoxide, water and dust, according to an arXiv preprint.

Polarimetric studies add a twist: the object displays 'extreme negative polarisation', an unusual trait that may indicate a distinct class of interstellar comet. But even this quirk points to exotic dust properties rather than alien engineering.

Public reactions remain mixed. Celebrities and media personalities—including Kim Kardashian and podcaster Joe Rogan, according to People and Primetimer summaries—have mused aloud about alien possibilities, amplifying Loeb's fringe speculation.

Astronomers urge caution. Researchers cited by Primetimer note that no evidence points to propulsion, metallic structure or engineered behaviour. They warn against conflating excitement with discovery.

Although MeerKAT's findings are robust, scientists say continued monitoring is warranted. As Wired highlights, Loeb has suggested that NASA's Juno spacecraft may detect low-frequency interactions when 3I/ATLAS passes closer to Jupiter in March 2026.

For now, though, the interstellar visitor speaks the familiar language of comet chemistry—water, sunlight and dust—not beacons from intelligent life.

Serving The University of Alabama since 1894.

A story about a pet dog who does stand up comedy, or a precocious girl who signs her name with a mathematical formula learning how to ballroom dance may sound crazy, but English professor and award-winning author Kellie Wells comes up with these stories. 

Wells is the author of three books and is currently working on an anthology where she will further explore the supernatural. 

Wells credits her love for the supernatural through both her enjoyment of grimoires, which are filled with “recipes for magical concoctions and spells and incantations,” and her admiration for specific figures like Baba Yaga, who despite her familiarity with audiences is also “hostile and trickster and to be feared.”

“Writers tend to be most enthusiastic about the thing they're doing at any given moment when you talk to them,” Wells said. “And so I'm having a good time with this collection of stories that I'm writing just about crones.”

Humor is also important to her work. Well said that she “gravitates” to comedy in her life and her love for stand up has helped her include humor in her writing. 

“When you find a writer who's able to make you laugh in a way that serves to make the reading all the more painful. That's when the writer has gotten to that experience of being human that most interests me,” Well said. 

Despite being an author whose works feature a great deal of both fantasy and comedic elements, in regards to genre, Wells is optimistic that the “binary of the literary” is starting to “dissolve” and offer more freedom to writers. 

At work, Wells is also a teacher who challenges students in unique ways through her classes on fiction writing with exercises designed to challenge their creative writing abilities. 

“Sometimes when I ask writers to write badly, to intentionally write poorly, they have to think,  ‘What is bad writing?'” Wells said. “And oftentimes, their responses to those assignments end up being some of the most interesting writing that they do, because it's very hard to write badly when you're trying to.”

Although she's unsure, Wells isn't too concerned about when her book will be completed. 

“I'm not in any particular hurry, although I've been working on it for quite some time, so I should probably get in more of a hurry, but I want to keep writing and experimenting with genres that I don't typically write in, and I would like to keep doing that,” she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","The Clint Eastwood Western Fans Are Calling a ""Supernatural Slasher"" is Free to Watch","https://www.dreadcentral.com/streaming-news/549882/the-clint-eastwood-western-fans-are-calling-a-supernatural-slasher-is-free-to-watch/","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 01:11:23 GMT","

I love a dusty, sunburnt Western. This might have something to do with the fact that I'm a sucker for a period piece. Or maybe it's because of the genre's super distinctive aesthetic. Maybe it's because I'm a horse girl at heart. Whatever the reason, I can't get enough. But despite my affection for the frontier, I admit that Westerns tend to follow a pretty standard storyline. That's not necessarily a bad thing. You know the beats, you know you're going to meet a mysterious drifter, you know there's going to be a showdown at the end. So when a Western has some supernatural elements, it stands out immediately to me as a horror fan as well.

That movie is Pale Rider, which is streaming for free on Tubi (alongside some other Western-horror gems). Directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, the film was released during a transitional moment for the Western genre due to the failure of Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate.

The story begins with a violent raid on a small California gold rush town. When mining baron Coy LaHood's (Richard Dysart) gang of men destroy her community and kill her dog, fourteen-year-old Megan Wheeler (Sydney Penny) prays for a miracle to protect her and her family. Her miracle rides into town in the form of a silent stranger on a pale horse. He doesn't have a name. He's simply known as the Preacher (Clint Eastwood).

I first discovered Pale Rider on Reddit after I saw a post claiming that it's “a lowkey supernatural slasher.” I hate admitting it, but they were right:

I love that the film never defines who or what the Preacher is, and I like that it doesn't feel the need to. The ambiguity is what makes this such an interesting watch. When the Preacher starts dispatching the town's tormentors with brutal, almost slasher-like efficiency in the film's climax, it becomes clear that this town is dealing with something beyond their comprehension. In one of my favorite scenes, the Preacher is sitting in a restaurant, calmly drinking coffee with his back to the gang; he suddenly vanishes only to reappear beside the armed men who didn't see or hear him approach. It's such classic slasher staging, which makes me wonder if Eastwood is a secret horror fan. Is the Preacher the ghost of one of LaHood's victims? An angel? Death itself? Pale Rider leaves every possibility open, which makes it fun to discuss with friends afterwards.

If you're in the mood for something that feels both familiar and unsettling all at once, then Pale Rider is the perfect pick. And the fact that it's streaming for free on Tubi makes it even harder to resist. 

And if you love Westerns or films that blend genres, let me know: @ashjenexi on Instagram and X.

Check for daily updates on your sun sign

Moon phases, seasons, and other current happenings

I'm always looking for ways to weave my favorite spirituality practices into everyday life. I've tested (more than) my fair share over the years: astrology chart deep dives, human design readings, akashic records, and dozens of psychic sessions with tarot readers, mediums, and intuitives—but I'm also very particular with my time and energy, and I'm not about to waste hours on practices or tools that don't offer a true takeaway.

On a quest to find the most beneficial daily practices, I've been dipping my toe into the waters of spirituality apps. Most recently, I tested Nebula, one of the top spiritual platforms with both astrology and psychic insights.

I was most impressed by the Nebula reviews on the Apple Store, where the popular pick has collected 160,000+ ratings with an overall 4.6-star rating. So, how did Nebula astrology and Nebula psychic readings compare to those that I've had in the past?

Keep reading for my full Nebula review after testing the platform for a couple of weeks, including my final verdict on whether Nebula is legit. (FYI, some people might refer to asknebula reviews due to the brand's domain! Don't worry—they're the same company!)

Nebula Spiritual Guidance Platform

Nebula is an all-in-one spiritual guidance platform with a strong focus on astrology insights and psychic readings. It's transaction and subscription-based, with various payment options available. Once you set up your account and answer a few brief intake questions, you'll find daily horoscopes, birth chart analyses, compatibility tools, tarot, numerology, and more.

The majority of the Nebula app and desktop site feel like a choose-your-own-adventure, allowing you to dive deep into many aspects of your astrological birth chart on your own. But for those who prefer more one-to-one guidance, there's also an option to chat directly with a psychic. 

Nebula has more than 1,000 spiritual advisors on the platform, and each one has their own experience level and area of focus. Before you select which person you'd like to chat with, you can view their profile with a breakdown of their years of experience, number of consultations, user reviews, and an overall rating out of five stars. You'll also see their cost per minute.

The Nebula app is free to download, while the website is free to visit. Both offer free basic features, but a subscription unlocks the full experience.

When you sign up, you get a free 3-day trial, but it's important to know that you'll start getting charged for your subscription once the trial ends. Choose a weekly subscription for $7.99 per week, a 3-month subscription for $39.99, or an annual subscription for $49.99.

While all horoscopes, astrology, and compatibility features are included in your subscription to the Nebula platform, you'll have to pay more for the one-on-one psychic readings. Your first three minutes are free, and then the cost per minute varies depending on which psychic you choose.

In my experience, the average cost per minute was $3.99 for speaking with a psychic with anywhere from two to 20+ years of experience.

When you first sign up for the Nebula, you'll be prompted to enter your birth details (date, time, and location) to generate a personalized astrology chart. There are also a few brief questions about what you are looking for guidance on (love, career, work, etc.).

From there, you can navigate between five categories: Horoscopes, Psychics, Compatibility, Chatroom, and Readings.

Horoscopes

The Horoscopes tab is where you'll find the most in-depth information on your own. At the top of the screen, you'll see a brief overview of your astrology signs (sun, moon, and rising—in my case: Taurus, Scorpio, Capricorn) along with a link to click to view your full birth chart (more on that in a minute!). 

Per its name, this is also the tab where you'll find your personalized horoscope for today, yesterday, tomorrow, the week, the month, or the year. In your daily horoscope, there's a fun breakdown of your “energy levels” in key life areas (career, love life, health, and family) for that day. 

Similarly, the weekly horoscope will highlight your focus of the week and your monthly horoscope will highlight a focus of the month (e.g. ‘reflect and flow'), along with favorable days and challenging days for the month. 

The yearly horoscope outlines five key themes to guide your 2025, along with a deeper dive into what to expect for the full year and a look at your month by month insights and predictions. There is a lot of information here and it's all personalized based on your actual birth chart, not just your sun sign (like a lot of astrology platforms).

If you do click into your birth chart, you'll go even deeper into personalized insights and easy-to-comprehend explainers on your chart placements, what they mean, and how to use them to (for lack of a better term) live your best life. 

Psychics

The Psychics tab is fairly straight forward. This is where you'll head if you want to start a one-on-one chat with a psychic. You'll see all your available options of who is currently online, broken down into sections based on who is the best match for your profile, who is the most accurate, and who is the best in certain areas (love, career, etc.).

If you start a chat with someone, your chat will live in the Chatroom tab. Otherwise, that tab will be empty.

Compatibility

The Compatibility tab is also exactly what it sounds like: a tool to determine your astrological compatibility with someone. Your own details will already be entered in there, but you'll need to add your partner (or potential partner or friend or family member!) and input their birth date, time, and place. 

Once you've entered that information, you'll get an overview of how compatible you are in a few key areas: love, sex, family, and friendship, along with your overall compatibility. 

Readings

Lastly, the Readings tab is filled with various blogs and resources such as guided meditations and manifestation tips.

My Nebula Astrology Review

The astrology side of the Nebula stood out to me immediately. As much as I love all things intuition and spirituality, horoscopes are the one thing that just always felt too gimmicky for me.

I have never been able to get on board with the idea that everyone who was born within 30 days of each other (in any year!) has the exact same prediction for the day, week, year, etc. 

That's what I really love about Nebula. Every horoscope and astrology insight the app provides is based on your entire birth chart. It's not just about your birth month and date; it's about what year, month, day, and time you were born, and where. I really did notice a difference in how relevant my daily horoscopes were when compared to the average astrology app that just looks at your sun sign. 

I also loved that I could actually see my full birth chart in detail. Of course, there are many ways to pull your chart for free online—but Nebula sets itself apart by pulling out digestible insights for all aspects of your chart. You can keep things high-level, or continue clicking through each element to learn more and more. I think I spent a full hour in the app the first time I opened it, and I was in the horoscopes tab the entire time.

After that first day, I continued to come back daily to read my horoscope. I really enjoyed building this morning routine that didn't take too much time but gave me such a great mindset (and a lot of helpful insights) entering into the day.

I also played around with the Compatibility tab, as I'd like to think any normal 30-something might. I entered my current partner's details and then followed up with everyone I've ever dated and all my best friends and family members. And yes, I even tested it with people I don't get along with so well. This tool was more of a fun activity than anything else, but a few of the insights were very spot on.

My Nebula Psychic Review

The one-on-one psychic chats were my second favorite part of the Nebula app, but I still appreciated the option. Nebula psychics are available either via chatroom or with audio chat. While I love face-to-face readings or a phone call, I definitely have friends who prefer a chatroom.

There are pros and cons to each! The chatroom is nice because if you just have one or two brief questions, you can be in and out in a few minutes. Otherwise, you can chat long with your Nebula psychic to get more info.

I chatted with a few different psychics for my Nebula readings, and I loved that I was able to see a lot of detail about each person before I started a conversation. I also really appreciated the vast array of options and how quickly each person responded. Plus, there were always a few hundred other options to choose from!

The one-stop-shop nature of the Nebula platform makes it a great option for just about anyone who is interested in spirituality and astrology. It's a fun and insightful tool for astrology enthusiasts who are looking for more than just a generic daily horoscope. Nebula is also a great option for beginners who are curious about tarot, astrology, numerology, and psychic readings and don't know where to begin. 

In particular, if you prefer chat-based communication, Nebula psychic readings are definitely worth checking out.

Nebula Spiritual Guidance Platform

The final verdict? Nebula surpassed my expectations. I love the daily horoscopes and the detailed astrology insights it provides, with guidance that genuinely feels aligned. If you're looking for an all-in-one spirituality app that's easy to use and can improve your daily life, I recommend giving this one a try.

Kim Kardashian is calling out the psychics she once trusted — but a former medium-turned-Christian says the reality star is focusing on the wrong problem altogether.

Kardashian recently revealed she fell short on the bar exam, a major hurdle for anyone pursuing a law career in the U.S. After sharing the disappointing news, she took aim at the psychics she had reportedly consulted, accusing them of completely blowing their predictions about her success. “I'm just letting you guys know that all of the … psychics that we have met with and that we're obsessed with are all … full of s***,” she said bluntly in a TikTok video.

But Jenn Nizza — once a psychic herself and now a Christian who speaks out about the dangers of the occult — told CBN News that Kardashian's outrage misses the deeper spiritual reality behind psychic practices. “She sees them as a pathological liar because the prediction didn't come true,” Nizza said. “But they're also lying when they're pretending to be her deceased father, and that's what I don't think she understands.”

According to Nizza, the issue isn't merely that the predictions were inaccurate. It's that the source of psychic information is deeply deceptive. “She doesn't realize that psychics get their information from demons,” Nizza warned. “She's just looking at this result of a prediction, which is made by a demon. And demons do not know the future.”

Nizza explained that while psychics can seem accurate at times, their so-called “insight” comes from demons who have observed human behavior for centuries and are able to make educated guesses. “The predictions will not always be correct,” she said. “Does it happen sometimes? Yes, just from the planting of seeds and self-fulfilling counterfeit prophecy. But demons are not God … They don't have the power of God to know the future.”

She said these demonic influences often pretend to be deceased loved ones — in Kardashian's case, her late father Robert Kardashian — in order to create an emotional connection and deepen the deception. “These demons will lie … they're lying spirits, and they'll pretend to be Robert Kardashian to hook Kim,” Nizza said.

While Kardashian may feel justified in calling psychics frauds, Nizza believes the greater danger is that millions are still turning to them without understanding the spiritual trap. “You and I can make predictions… but we're not God,” Nizza said. “Only God knows the future.”

The former medium warned that people who chase psychic readings often end up drifting further from Christ. In their pursuit of answers, she said, they are “kept away from the only way, truth and life, and his name is Jesus Christ.” Instead of finding peace, they begin “walking in the false light,” layering one New Age practice on top of another until they find themselves spiritually oppressed — or worse.

Nizza emphasized that spiritual chaos doesn't just affect someone's faith. It can damage relationships and impact mental, emotional, and even physical health. She hopes Kardashian — and others drawn to psychics — will turn instead to the God who knows the future and offers true guidance.","{'href': 'https://www.beliefnet.com', 'title': 'Beliefnet'}","other"

ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 776

JTA — Every day, it can seem, brings a fresh headline about how AI chatbots are spreading hateful ideas. But researchers tasked with understanding antisemitism and how it can be stopped say they have found evidence that AI chatbots can actually fight hate.

Researchers affiliated with the Anti-Defamation League's Center for Antisemitism Research trained a large-language model, or LLM, on countering antisemitic conspiracy theories, then invited people who subscribed to at least one of those theories to interact with it.

The result, according to a study released on Wednesday: The users soon believed in the antisemitic theories less, while at the same time feeling more favorable about Jews as a group. And the effects were still strong a month later, even without further engagement with the LLM.

The researchers are hailing the finding as a breakthrough in the quest for identifying actionable strategies in the fight against Jew-hatred.

“What's remarkable about these findings is that factual debunking works even for conspiracy theories with deep historical roots and strong connections to identity and prejudice,” David Rand, a Cornell University professor who was the study's senior author, said in a statement.

“Our artificial intelligence debunker bot typically doesn't rely on emotional appeals, empathy-building exercises, or anti-bias tactics to correct false beliefs,” Rand continued, referring to practices frequently employed by advocates seeking to fight antisemitism, including at the ADL. “It mostly provides accurate information and evidence-based counterarguments, demonstrating that facts still matter in changing minds.”

Matt Williams, who has headed the Center for Antisemitism Research since its founding three years ago, says the study builds on a growing body of research that views contemporary antisemitism as primarily a misinformation problem, rather than a civil rights problem.

“We need to think about antisemitism less like feelings about Jews, and more like feelings about Bigfoot,” he said in an interview. “And what I mean by that is, it's not ‘Jews' that are the problem. It is ‘the Jew' as a function of conspiracy theory that is the problem. And the relationship between ‘Jews' and ‘the Jew' in that context is far more tenuous than we might want to think.”

Calling conspiracy theories “malfunctions in the ways that we make truth out of the world,” Williams said the study showed something remarkable. “People can correct those malfunctions,” he said. “They really can, which is super exciting and really impactful.”

The study emerges from the ADL's relatively new effort to come up with evidence-based ways to reduce antisemitism, working with dozens of researchers across a slew of institutions to design and carry out experiments aimed at turning a robust advocacy space into less of a guessing game.

The new experiment, conducted earlier this year, involved more than 1,200 people who said on a previous ADL survey that they believed at least one of six prominent antisemitic conspiracy theories, such as that Jews control the media or the “Great Replacement” theory about Jewish involvement in immigration.

The people then were randomly assigned three different scenarios: A third chatted with an LLM programmed by the researchers to debunk such theories, built within Microsoft's Claude AI model; another third chatted with Claude about an unrelated topic; and the final third were simply told that their belief represented a “dangerous” conspiracy theory. Then they were all tested again about their beliefs.

Members of the group that chatted with what the researchers are calling DebunkBot were far more likely than members of the other groups to have their beliefs weakened, the researchers found.

DebunkBot was hardly a panacea for antisemitism: The study found that those who believed in more antisemitic conspiracy theories experienced less change. And Williams notes that the study found only that belief in antisemitic conspiracies was reduced, not rooted out entirely.

But he said any strategy that can cut against what researchers believe has been a widespread explosion of belief in conspiracy theories is a good thing.

The proportion of Americans subscribing to conspiracy theories over the last decade has reached as much as 45 percent, more than twice the rate that had held steady for 70 to 80 years, Williams said.

“To me, the increase in that level of saturation is far more concerning than any particular conspiracy theory moving through different generations,” he said. “I don't think that we're going to ever create a world in which we go under 15% — but going from 45 back to 30 or 25 seems more doable.”

The new study comes as AI models vault into widespread use among Americans, raising concerns about their implications for Jews. When Elon Musk launched a model of his own earlier this year called Grok, it immediately drew criticism for amplifying antisemitism — kicking off a pattern that has played out repeatedly. Soon, the company apologized and said it would train its model to avoid the same behavior in the future. Criticism of Grok is still widespread, but it no longer praises Hitler — though even this week it reportedly told one user that the Nazi gas chambers were not designed for mass killing, prompting an investigation by French authorities.

Chatbot training is seen as essential for delivering high-quality AI results. DebunkBot can be found online on its own website now, but Williams said efforts were underway within the ADL to convince the companies operating major AI platforms to incorporate its expertise.

“There's far more receptivity than not, by any stretch of the imagination,” he said, while noting that the work was early and he could not share many details.

Whatever happens with that effort, Williams said, the new research demonstrates that combating what's sometimes called the world's oldest hatred is possible.

“AI and LLMs — those are tools, right? And we can use tools for good and for evil,” Williams said. “But the fact that we can subject conspiracy theories to rational conversation and arguments and actually lead to favorable outcomes is itself, I think, relatively innovative, surprising, and extraordinarily useful.”

Crypto:

The cryptocurrency market extended a more than a month-long retreat in Thursday trading, just as stocks surrendered the gains they had logged earlier in the day. 

Market bellwether Bitcoin dropped more than 4% to below $87,000 for the first time since April, as the market struggled to find new buyers and the momentum that had supported prices earlier in the year evaporated. The pullback comes after weeks of unwinding among fast-moving traders and lingering positioning from October's record run-up, which has left the market more vulnerable to selling pressure and sharp swings.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

In this article

Google on Thursday rolled out Nano Banana Pro, its latest image editing and generation tool, continuing the company's momentum after launching its new Gemini artificial intelligence model earlier this week.

The product is built on Gemini 3 Pro, which was announced on Tuesday and contributed to record-breaking stock highs.

Alphabet's stock was up 4% Thursday.

Josh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs and Gemini, told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa that the Nano Banana Pro's capabilities expand beyond its original iteration, which launched in late August. 

""It's incredible at infographics. It can make slide decks. It can take up to 14 different images, or five different characters, and sort of keep that character consistency,"" he said.

He added that internal users have experimented with the feature by inputting code snippets and even LinkedIn resumes to create infographics.

""I think this ability to visualize things that were previously maybe not something you would think of as a visual medium that tends to be one of the magic things people are finding with it,"" Woodward said. 

The original Nano Banana went viral on social media as users turned photos of themselves or their pets into hyperrealistic 3D figurines. Woodward wrote in an X post in September that the product helped add 13 million new users to the Gemini app in the span of four days.

Nano Banana Pro is currently available in the Gemini app, with limited free quotas, Google's writing assistant, NotebookLM, as well as the company's developer, enterprise and advertising products. 

Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will have access to the product in Google's search features AI Mode.

The feature will later also roll out to Ultra subscribers first in Flow, Google's AI filmmaking tool.

Google introduced another feature in the Gemini app that allows users to upload any image to find out if it was generated by Google AI. 

Images generated on free Nano Banana accounts will have a watermark, but it will be removed for Google AI Ultra tier subscribers.

Google has been working to gain ground on OpenAI in the generative AI race, which ignited after the release of ChatGPT in 2022. 

Last week, OpenAI announced two updates to its GPT-5 model to make it ""warmer by default and more conversational"" as well as "" more efficient and easier to understand in everyday use,"" the company said. 

ChatGPT currently tops the list of free apps on Apple's App Store, with Gemini in the second spot.

The Gemini app currently has over 650 million monthly active users per month, and Gemini-powered AI Overviews has 2 billion monthly users, Google said in a release. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in October that ChatGPT had reached 800 million weekly active users.

Woodward said Google AI products have had growing demand, with many users signing up for Gemini's subscription plan to have ""higher limits with some of these advanced models.""

""We're seeing high numbers of people coming to lots of these products,"" he said. ""That's really the best problem to have, is there's a lot of demand, and we're trying to figure out actually how to serve it.""

The company is looking to continue scaling its AI offerings, Woodward said, highlighting Flow, Google's AI filmmaking tool, and Genie, a ""world building"" model that is currently available as a limited research preview.

            Israel's forced removal of tens of thousands of Palestinians from refugee camps in the occupied West Bank earlier this year amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has alleged.
    


            According to a 105-page report released by the non-profit organization, 32,000 Palestinians were expelled by Israeli forces from three camps in January and February, while international attention was focused on Israel's war in Gaza, and they have not been allowed to return.
    


            As part of its research, HRW said it interviewed 31 displaced Palestinian refugees from Jenin, Tulkarem and Nur Shams refugee camps. The organization also analyzed satellite imagery and Israeli military demolition orders, as well as verified video and images of Israeli military operations.
    


            In response to the report, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN in a statement that the military launched what it called Operation “Iron Wall” in the three camps ten months ago “in light of the security threats posed by these camps and the growing presence of terrorist elements within them.”
    


            The IDF said it destroyed “rows of buildings” to create “new access routes inside the camps.” The military said the decision to demolish the buildings “was made based on operational necessity, with careful consideration and only after alternative options to achieve the same military advantage were examined.”
    


            The IDF said the “demolitions were conducted lawfully, based on military necessity and with the required proportionality” and that “terrorism in Judea and Samaria has decreased by 70%” since the start of the operation, using the biblical term for the West Bank.
    


            The HRW report claims that Israel stormed Jenin refugee camp on January 21, with Apache helicopters, drones, bulldozers, and armored vehicles carrying ground forces, to oust the Palestinians living there.
    


            Similar operations were carried out at Tulkaram on January 27, and Nur Shams on February 9.
    


            Israeli soldiers “were yelling and throwing things everywhere…. It was like a movie scene – some had masks and they were carrying all kinds of weapons,” one 54-year-old woman told HRW.
    


            The displaced Palestinians have not been permitted to return home, the report found, adding that Israeli soldiers fired upon those who did attempt to re-enter. Only a few have been allowed to collect their belongings, it said, while HRW analysis of satellite imagery six months on found that more than 850 homes and other buildings had been damaged or destroyed across the camps.
    


            No shelter or humanitarian assistance was offered to displaced residents by the Israeli military, the report found. Instead, people were left to fend for themselves, seeking shelter wherever they could, including crowding into the homes of relatives or friends, or arriving at mosques or local charities.
    


            All three camps date back to the early 1950s, when they were established by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to house Palestinians who were expelled from their homes or forced to flee following Israel's creation in 1948. Those refugees and their descendants had resided there ever since.
    


            “Israeli authorities in early 2025 forcibly removed 32,000 Palestinians from their homes in West Bank refugee camps without regard to international legal protections and have not permitted them to return,” Nadia Hardman, a senior migrant rights researcher at HRW, said.
    


            “With global attention focused on Gaza, Israeli forces have carried out war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing in the West Bank that should be investigated and prosecuted.”
    


Dozens of Israeli settlers launch arson attack in West Bank as attacks against Palestinians surge



            Since the Hamas-led attacks of October 7, 2023, the Israeli military has intensified operations across the West Bank, targeting Palestinian militant cells, imposing checkpoints, and cutting communities off from the outside world.
    


            There has also been an escalation in Israeli settler attacks and land grabs in the territory. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law.
    


            HRW is now calling for senior Israeli officials to be investigated over the expulsions, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth, the Central Command commander who oversaw West Bank military operations.
    


            Where found responsible, they should be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity, the organization said.

EU officials have received almost no information on the peace plan presented to Ukraine by the administration of US President Donald Trump, The Telegraph reported on Wednesday, citing sources.

Several outlets, including Axios, the Financial Times, and The Telegraph, claimed that Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff had delivered to the Ukrainian leadership a 28-point plan for a phased settlement of the conflict with Russia. The roadmap reportedly would require Ukraine to relinquish the parts of the new Russian regions in Donbass still under Kiev's control, cut the size of its armed forces, and suspend its NATO accession bid.

Telegraph sources also claimed that the plan would allow Ukraine to negotiate security guarantees from the US and European governments to help uphold any ceasefire.

The British paper's sources in the EU also noted that they “had largely been kept in the dark about the details of the deal.” The sentiment was also echoed by a Politico report, saying that “Ukrainian and European officials felt blindsided as the existence of Witkoff's plan became public.” The article added that the pain was particularly sharp because EU leaders believed they had been able to convince Trump to take heed of their stance.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, who has repeatedly ruled out any territorial concessions, is also reportedly dissatisfied with the proposal.

Commenting on the reported deal, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was “nothing new” beyond what had already been discussed between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump during talks in Alaska in August. Senior Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev said the proposal went beyond a basic ceasefire, adding that “we feel the Russian position is really being heard.”

Moscow has insisted that any sustainable settlement of the conflict can only be reached if Ukraine commits to neutrality, demilitarization, and denazification, and recognizes the new territorial reality on the ground.

MOSCOW, November 20. /TASS/. The International Practical Science Forum ""Without a Statute of Limitations: Nuremberg, 80 Years On"" has become a platform for shaping a unified stance against Nazism in today's day and age and demonstrated that the legacy of Nuremberg remains a relevant principle of the global order, TASS Director General Andrey Kondrashov said at the forum's opening.

""Today marks another step along the long road of the No Statute of Limitations project. It is a path of truth, memory, and justice that began in Nuremberg 80 years ago and continues today, in our time. This forum has become a venue for interdepartmental dialogue and for developing a unified position rejecting Nazism - both in historical retrospect and in the present day,"" he said.

Kondrashov, who moderated the opening session, expressed deep gratitude to Yelena Malysheva, head of the National Center for Historical Memory under the Russian president. He praised her for ""the path of truth, memory, and justice she is leading us on today,"" emphasizing that ""she is a true activist who will not allow our history to be distorted.""

He also underscored the crucial role of media coverage in preserving historical truth. ""The entire planet is crisscrossed by the trenches of information warfare. The task of the media is to build strong public immunity to historical revisionism,"" he noted.

The International Practical Science Forum ""Without a Statute of Limitations: Nuremberg, 80 Years On"" is timed to the anniversary of the start of the international military tribunal against the main Nazi war criminals. Throughout the event, experts will examine modern challenges and threats to the preservation of historical truth and the memory of the Great Patriotic War and World War II in the context of the Nuremberg trials.

In the year marking the 80th anniversary of the Great Victory and the Year of the Defender of the Fatherland, the forum serves as a natural continuation of broad efforts to preserve the historical memory of the genocide committed against the Soviet people by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Great Patriotic War.

Cyril Ramaphosa says US has had ‘change of mind' but does not confirm Trump's attendance in Johannesburg

The US has changed its mind about attending the G20 summit in Johannesburg, South Africa's president has said, without confirming whether Donald Trump, who had said the US would boycott the event, now wanted to come.

Trump has claimed that South Africa racially discriminates against the minority white Afrikaner community, which led the country during the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.

Earlier this month, the US president alleged there were “abuses” of white farmers, including violence and land confiscation, and said it was a “disgrace” that South Africa was hosting the G20. South Africa's government has vehemently denied the accusations and pressed ahead with its plans to host the first G20 summit in Africa. The two-day summit opens in Johannesburg on Saturday.

At a press conference with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen and the European Council's president, António Costa, Cyril Ramaphosa said: “We have received notice from the United States, a notice which we are still in discussions with them over about a change of mind, about participating in one shape, form or other in the summit.

“This comes at the late hour before the summit begins and so therefore we do need to … see how practical it is and what it finally really means. In a way we see this as a positive sign, very positive, because as I've often said, boycott politics never work.”

Earlier on Thursday, Chrispin Phiri, a spokesperson for South Africa's foreign ministry, had accused the US of trying to coerce the country, after media reported that a US diplomatic note sent to South Africa said no final statement by G20 leaders could be issued without its presence.

“Washington's absence negates its role over the G20's conclusions,” Phiri said. “But we cannot allow coercion by absentia to become a viable tactic; it is a recipe for institutional paralysis and the breakdown of collective action.”

The note from the US embassy in Pretoria, sent last weekend, said the US would accept only a “chair's statement” rather than a leaders' declaration, according to AFP.

The note read: “South Africa's G20 priorities run counter to US policy views, and we cannot support consensus on any documents negotiated under your presidency. The US opposes issuance of any G20 summit outcome document under the premise of a consensus G20 position without US agreement.”

South Africa's priorities for its G20 presidency include improving debt sustainability for low-income countries and more finance for a “just energy transition” away from fossil fuels. It has invited an additional 22 countries to the summit and tried to present itself as a mature champion of multilateralism, the global south and Africa.

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said in February that South Africa's G20 themes of “solidarity, equality, & sustainability” amounted to “anti-Americanism”.

The US, which is taking over the presidency of the G20 next year, has also criticised the forum's expansion from its initial focus on global financial and economic issues when it was founded in 1999.

The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said at an Oval Office event: “We have whittled down the G20 back to basics … the G20 had become basically the G100 this past year. So it will be a concentrated group in Miami, seeing the best America has to offer, with American leadership.”

In a separate event on Thursday, Ramaphosa responded: “My retort is, no, we didn't convene the G100; we have convened the G million, if you like, the G20 million.

“Because if we are to create a world that is prosperous, a world that is caring, a world that is more equal, a world that is underpinned by solidarity, we do believe that it is important to involve the people who are going to be affected by the decisions that the leaders' summit are going to take.”

Ramaphosa also told reporters last week that he didn't want to hand the G20 presidency over to an “empty chair”.

“But the empty chair will be there, probably symbolically hand over to that empty chair and talk to President Trump and say, ‘Even though you are not here, I am now handing over to you the reins of chairing or being president of the G20.' Because the G20 as an entity continues, whether they are here or not.”

The G20, which includes 19 of the world's largest economies and the European Union, traditionally issues a communique at the end of the leaders' summit every year. Last year, Ukraine and its western allies criticised the final statement for not mentioning that Russia had invaded Ukraine.

Global markets rose in a relief rally after AI chip giant Nvidia released forecast-topping earnings yesterday and as traders assessed delayed U.S. jobs data out this morning.

A U.S Labor Department report showed nonfarm payrolls increased in September by 119,000, compared with an estimate of a 50,000 rise.

Wall Street futures extended their gains on the news: Dow futures were up 0.8 per cent, S&P 500 futures gained 1.41 per cent and Nasdaq futures were 1.88 per cent higher as of 8:40 a.m. ET.

TSX futures also pointed higher.

On Wall Street, markets are watching earnings from Walmart Inc., Intuit Inc. and NetEase Inc.

“It's fair to say that Nvidia's results have completely changed the market mood and pushed out any bubble fears for another day,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said.

Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.87 per cent in morning trading. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.75 per cent, Germany's DAX advanced 1.18 per cent and France's CAC 40 gained 0.92 per cent.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei closed 2.65 per cent higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.02 per cent. 

Oil prices advanced after falling yesterday as a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles offset speculation that a U.S. push to end the Russia-Ukraine war may add barrels to an amply supplied market.

Brent crude futures were up 0.9 per cent to US$64.08 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were 0.9 per cent higher at US$59.95.

NG analysts cautioned in a note that Ukraine was unlikely to back the plan as it could see it favouring Russia, but “signs that the U.S. is still trying to work on a deal eases some concerns over further sanctions against Russia and also how strongly current curbs will be enforced.”

In other commodities, spot gold was steady at US$4,074.09 an ounce. U.S. gold futures for December delivery fell 0.2 per cent to US$4,073.70 an ounce.

The Canadian dollar was little changed against its U.S. counterpart.

The day range on the loonie was 71.06 US cents to 71.22 US cents in early trading. The Canadian dollar was down about 0.41 per cent against the greenback over the past month. 

The U.S. dollar index, which weighs the greenback against a group of currencies, was down 0.04 per cent to 100.19. 

The euro slid 0.07 per cent to US$1.1530. The British pound rose 0.26 per cent to US$1.3093. 

In bonds, the yield on the U.S. 10-year note was last down at 4.135 per cent.

Alice Guo, who had posed as a Filipina, was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted on charges of human trafficking. Guo was jailed for her part in running a scam center in the town where she had been mayor.

A court in the Philippines on Thursday sentenced Alice Guo — the former mayor of Bamban located north of Manila — to life behind bars for human trafficking.

Guo, identified by law enforcement as Chinese national Guo Hua Ping, became mayor after posing as a Filipina and had been involved in running a Chinese-operated online gambling and scam outfit.

State prosecutor Olivia Torrevillas said in all, eight foreign nationals, including Guo, received life sentences.

""After over just one year, the court... gave us a favourable decision. Alice (Guo) was convicted along with seven other co-accused. Life imprisonment,"" Torrevillas said.

Local media reported that this amounted to 40 years in prison and a fine of 2 million Philippine pesos ($33,875).

""This eagerly awaited ruling is not only a legal victory but also a moral one. It delivers justice to victims, reaffirms the government's united stance against organised crime,"" the Presidential Anti-Organised Crime Commission (PAOCC) said in a statement.

Hundreds of people were forced into running scams at a compound in Bamban in Central Luzon, or face torture.

The scam center was raided by authorities in March 2024 following a tip-off from a Vietnamese worker who had managed to escape.

This led to the discovery of more than 700 Filipinos, Chinese, Vietnamese, Malaysians, Taiwanese, Indonesians and Rwandans at the sprawling compound.

Also discovered were documents that allegedly revealed that Guo was president of a company that owned the compound.

Guo was arrested by Indonesian police in September 2024 after she went on the run from Filipino authorities.

Southeast Asia has seen a multitude of cybercrime operations spring up, involving thousands of scammers.

According to UN figures, in 2023, people in the region were conned out of around $37 billion (€32.1 billion).

			Paul Dans is running to unseat South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, one of Donald Trump's top allies

Paul Dans was the architect behind Donald Trump's first months in power, when the president slashed the federal payroll, halted overseas aid and ended “diversity, equality and inclusion” policies.

And he did it all from outside the White House as the mastermind behind Project 2025, the blueprint for Mr Trump's second term.

When the conservative roadmap, produced by the Heritage Foundation, was weaponised by Democrats in their attacks on the president, Mr Dans was forced out.

Now he is back and running to unseat Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator in South Carolina.

Mr Graham, a staunch advocate for Ukraine, is too busy pursuing endless wars and getting in the way of the broader Maga agenda, argues Mr Dans.

“You couldn't create in the lab a worse politician than Lindsey Graham. This is a guy with just vile tendencies towards violence,” Mr Dans said.

“He only has one speed, so I'm trying to unite everyone who doesn't want to die in a nuclear holocaust.”

Mr Dans, 56, enters the race as an underdog but according to him, he is embarking on “a steel cage match for the future of America First”.

With Mr Trump unable to run again, do Republicans in South Carolina back the candidate who developed his policy framework?

Or do they re-elect the 70-year-old Trump ally, who in Mr Dans's words, “has promoted endless wars and endless government spending that has crowded out the American Dream for future generations”.

Mr Dans, can broadly be placed in the same wing of the Republican Party as Marjorie Taylor Greene, for example, who has urged the president to spend less time overseas on foreign entanglements and more time at home tackling an affordability crisis.

Polling is sparse a year ahead of the midterms. But an October poll by Quantus Insights shows Mr Dans some 50 points behind the sitting senator.

He is up against a steamroller of a fundraising machine. Mr Graham has won six consecutive elections, two for the House of Representatives followed by four for the Senate.

On Saturday, he was at Mr Trump's West Palm Beach golf course for the Trump-Graham classic, a fundraising tournament.

Mr Trump has made clear that the sitting senator has earned his endorsement.

Yet anyone who attended the president's rally in Pickens, South Carolina, in July 2023 will have seen the limits to his appeal.

He was booed by the Maga crowd when Mr Trump introduced him.

“Jeered for six minutes straight. People literally turned their back on him,” said Mr Dans, who sat for an interview with The Telegraph during a fundraising visit to Washington, DC. “Has he any shame? You would think he would have just called it a day.”

Mr Graham has a chequered history among some of Mr Trump's most ardent supporters.

He has admitted encouraging John McCain, the former senator, to turn over a deeply contentious dossier of Trump-Russia allegations to the FBI. The dossier was compiled by Christopher Steele, a former MI6 spy, and its contents have been largely discredited, making anyone associated with it a subject of suspicion among Mr Trump's allies.

He has come under fire from the America First wing of the party for being hawkish on Russia, arguing in favour of keeping up the supply of weapons to Ukraine, and remaining unflinching in his support of Israel.

More recently, Mr Dans accused his opponent of obstructing job cuts implemented by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) by forcing the plans to go through Congress.

And he pointed out, the US national debt stood at about $5tn in 1998 when Mr Graham was first elected to Washington. Today it is $38tn.

“Lindsey Graham has no stake in the future of this country. He is 70 years old and childless,” Mr Dans said, as his pregnant wife Mary Helen Bowers, a former ballerina who trained Natalie Portman for her role in Black Swan, sat beside him.

“That's a decision he made on his own, and by comparison, I am the dad of soon to be five kids that one day I'll leave on this Earth.”

Mr Dans was an early supporter of Mr Trump, serving in his first administration.

In 2022, he joined the Heritage Foundation and launched its 2025 presidential transition project, developing policy goals and vetted personnel lists.

The result was Project 2025 and a 920-page “Mandate for Leadership” policy book.

It included plans to ban pornography, make it harder for transgender adults to transition, reverse approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, close the department of education, all while taking an axe to “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) policies and cuts to federal government spending.

Not only did it provide a blueprint for the Trump campaign, but it also handed Democratic opponents page after page of attack lines.

Mr Trump distanced himself from the document and the backlash eventually forced Mr Dans to resign.

Yet once the election was over, the president stocked his administration with its authors and followed its playbook for achieving a smaller government.

“Ultimately, I feel, as a patriot, a great sense of accomplishment and hope that these major reform proposals are beginning to be put into work,” said Mr Dans.

He is most proud of Mr Trump's day one decision to freeze foreign aid and gut USAid, which he called a “deep state” and a “renegade government really purposed against the president”.

That work is only just beginning, he continued, and it was too important to leave it to senators like Mr Graham.

“We have a country to save,” he said. “And I'll be damned if we're going to just turn this over to the swamp.”

Mr Graham has powerful allies, however. Chris LaCivita, Mr Trump's 2024 co-campaign manager, is advising his campaign and accused Mr Dans, who grew up in the Baltimore suburbs, of being “parachuted into the race”.

It must be an “old, dusty” parachute, is the response. Mr Dans said he had lived in South Carolina for the past decade.

“Birth, marriage, death is the triple crown of life,” he said. “As far as I see it, Lindsey was born in Carolina. I was married there, so we're tied at this stage.”

Trump's urge to suppress free speech may be about Israel today, but it may be about something else tomorrow.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Rooting out terrorism and antisemitism was the supposed reason that plainclothed ICE agents arrested doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk on a street in Somerville, Massachusetts, after she coauthored an op-ed calling on Tufts University to divest from companies with ties to Israel due to the killing and starvation of Palestinian civilians. There is an international movement to boycott, sanction, and divest from Israel, but in the United States, President Donald Trump is imperiling the freedom even to publicly discuss such ideas, which should, in effect, be considered a test case for his larger attack on free speech. So far, the test is going well for Trump.

In what seems a long time ago, in 2024, the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank, released a blueprint for what it called “a national strategy to combat antisemitism” by addressing what it described as “America's virulently anti-Israel, anti-Zionist, and anti-American ‘pro-Palestinian movement.'” In essence, and in what's amounted to an extraordinarily effective work of political theater that has been sold to my own state, Massachusetts, among other places, that foundation dubbed its political opponents “supporters of terrorism.” It also labeled organizations working in opposition to its agenda a “terrorist support network,” and claimed for itself the noble mantle of “combating antisemitism” — even as it deftly redefined antisemitism from hatred of Jewish people to criticism of the U.S.-Israel alliance. President Trump has put the Heritage Foundation strategy into action and gone even further.

It may be his most original idea. As political scientist Barnett Rubin put it in September, “President Trump always says he's very creative and accomplishes things no one has ever done before. And now he is building a fascist regime which is legitimized by the fight against antisemitism. Nobody ever thought of doing that before.”

I attended Hebrew school as a child, and today, when I try to recall what I learned there about Israel and Palestine, I find in my memory an image of a desert, replete with flowers, and the pleasant recollection that the State of Israel was founded in that empty landscape. In 1998, I visited Israel with my family. My brother had his bar mitzvah at the mountain-top fortress of Masada overlooking the Dead Sea. Though I enjoyed an enviable private school education, I didn't hear the word Nakba until adulthood. That Arabic word for catastrophe refers to the displacement of 700,000 Palestinian people for Israel's founding in 1948. A majority of the population of the modern-day Gaza Strip descended from refugees of the Nakba.

According to Amnesty International and the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem, Israel has imposed a system of oppression on Palestinians across Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territories through an enforced system of segregation that constitutes apartheid. For decades, Israel has controlled who could enter or exit the Gaza Strip and, from 2007 on, that 25-mile strip of land functioned as what Human Rights Watch called an “open-air prison.” As of 2022, the unemployment rate in Gaza had hit 45%, and 65% of the people there were living in poverty. On October 7th of the following year, an armed group broke out of Gaza and waged attacks on Israel that killed 1,195 people, 815 of whom were civilians.

In the two years since then, Israel has responded by killing more than 67,000 Palestinians in Gaza in a military campaign of such horror that, as the head of Doctors Without Borders reported to the U.N. Security Council, children as young as five said that they preferred to die rather than continue living in fear while witnessing the slaughter of their family members. A girl named Sham was born in Gaza in November 2023 and survived smoke poisoning as an infant. As a toddler, she was diagnosed with acute malnutrition, before being killed on May 6th of this year when Israel dropped explosives on the shelter where she was living with her family. The United Nations and prominent experts, including Israeli-American professor of Holocaust and genocide studies Omer Bartov, have concluded that Israel's war on Gaza is a genocide. The current ceasefire has slowed, not stopped, the death toll.

By 2024, the International Court of Justice, the world's highest court, had ruled that Israel's occupation of Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem was illegal; that Israel needed to halt all settlement construction, evacuate its settlers, pay restitution to Palestinians, and allow them the right of return. It also indicated that all states and international organizations have a legal obligation not to assist Israel's further occupation of the area.

However, since October 2023, according to the Israeli Defense Ministry and the Council on Foreign Relations, using 800 transport planes and 140 ships, my own country has delivered 90,000 tons of arms and equipment to Israel, including tanks, artillery shells, bombs, and rockets. The U.S. government gives Israel billions of dollars annually in military aid, which that country spends mostly on purchases made through the U.S. “Foreign Military Sales” program. According to a Defense Department website, that program sells “articles and services [that] will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace.”

Despite how, as Israeli historian Lee Mordechai described it, Israel has limited the flow of information out of Gaza and campaigned to discredit critical voices, a July Gallup poll found that 60% of Americans disapprove of Israel's military actions there. Even more strikingly, a September Washington Post poll found that nearly half (48%) of Jewish Americans disapprove (and only 46% approve).

But according to recommendations issued by the Massachusetts Special Commission on Combating Antisemitism, a group created by state law in 2024, a teacher discussing such polling in a classroom could precipitate an anonymous complaint filed with the state police on the grounds that the educator has rendered the learning environment in my state hostile to Jewish students.

Last February, Special Commission co-chair and State Representative Simon Cataldo conducted an inquisition — yes, an inquisition — into the president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association (who is himself Jewish), including presenting a series of materials on Israel/Palestine that Cataldo had obtained from a database of educator resources. He displayed a graphic called “Born Unequal Abroad,” which lists the different rights afforded to an American Jewish child and the child of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. The former can visit Israel and even become an Israeli citizen at any time, while the latter is barred from visiting and has no pathway to citizenship (even through marriage). Cataldo seemed to regard that graphic (and others like it) as self-evidently antisemitic and displayed it as a smoking gun that revealed the supposed antisemitism festering within the Massachusetts Teachers Association.

In other words, in my home state today, “combating antisemitism” means a governor- and legislature-appointed commission conducting an inquisition of a (Jewish) union leader for the offense of failing to suppress critical discussion of a foreign nation that the world's leading human rights organizations have found to be upholding a system of apartheid and committing genocide. At the same time, actual antisemitism — that is, the hatred of Jewish people by xenophobic nationalists — has gone largely unexamined by the Commission in the midst of its campaign to shut down criticism of Israel. (I imagine President Trump and the Heritage Foundation applauding in the background.)

Indeed, over the course of a year of hearings, the Special Commission has perhaps irreparably merged the concept of antisemitism with criticism of Israel, which seems to have been the point. State Senator and Commission Co-Chair John Velis actually uses the terms “anti-Israel” and “antisemitic” interchangeably, though they do have different meanings and anyone charged with the responsibility of leading a state panel on antisemitism should know that. Velis, who is not Jewish, has taken multiple trips to Israel paid for by the Israeli government as well as a charity affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the lobby group known as AIPAC.

The Special Commission has unveiled recommendations for Massachusetts schools that include utilizing a definition of antisemitism that, according to the ACLU, will have the effect of chilling free speech. It has also recommended launching a statewide reporting system in which anonymous allegations of antisemitism in schools would be collected by the state police.

Following the initial release of those recommendations, Governor Maura Healey issued a statement applauding the Commission's work. Organizations like the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston have also sent out emails to their membership commending the Commission.

Perhaps in response to the hours of dissenting public testimony that (mostly Jewish) people as well as scholars and education experts have offered, the commissioners wrote in their most recent report, “We should listen to and respect people who say that they have been harmed by antisemitism; we should not gaslight them or tell them that their experience is invalid.”

Who could argue?

After Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk was abducted from the street by ICE agents for the offense of co-writing an op-ed in the school paper asking the school to divest from companies with ties to Israel, a federal judge found that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem had violated the First Amendment through a policy of targeting for deportation noncitizens who criticized Israel or voiced support for Palestinians. The judge also found that executive orders issued by President Trump had relied on a definition of antisemitism that encompassed First Amendment-protected speech (the same definition recommended by the Massachusetts Commission!).

But will that federal court ruling even matter? According to the same judge, “The effect of these targeted deportation proceedings continues unconstitutionally to chill freedom of speech to this day.”

Pulitzer Prize-winning author Benjamin Moser has noted that, after October 7th, some American Jewish institutions not only supported Israel's reign of terror over Palestinian civilians but also applauded the clampdown on free speech in order to sustain the killing. “The younger generations, people who have seen with their own eyes the crimes of the so-called Jewish state, and who feel the sacrilege, the impious desecration, of the values they thought were Jewish,” he wrote, “will never return to these institutions.”

But will it matter? Surely, it won't stop Donald Trump from using his version of Jewish identity as a moral shield for his attack on free speech.

In Massachusetts, a coalition of organizations has publicly opposed the Special Commission's recommendations and, in the western part of the state where I live, a group of residents has resorted to putting out yard signs with QR codes on them to call attention to this travesty. I'm part of that effort, but does it matter?

In California, a new law, ostensibly intended to protect Jewish students from discrimination, goes into effect on January 1st. It has, however, put educators on alert that they may be accused of antisemitism if they share information deemed critical of Israel.

Meanwhile, the leaders of civil society organizations appear ill-suited to resist such suppression of free speech and, in some cases, seem to embrace it. In January, members of the American Historical Association voted 428 to 88 in favor of declaring their opposition to “scholasticide” (the deliberate destruction of an education system) in Gaza. But the Association's leadership council vetoed that vote. A similar episode occurred at the Modern Language Association.

Amy Hagopian, a professor emeritus of global health at the University of Washington, who for years taught a class on war and health, recently wrote about how she was expelled from the American Public Health Association after publicly protesting a decision by its executive board to halt consideration of a resolution on Palestinian health justice. (An anonymous complaint had alleged that the protest was antisemitic.)

The usual line-toeing of politicians in both major parties has involved reciting statements of support for Israel, whatever it does. By contrast, Zohran Mamdani was clear during his victorious campaign to become mayor of New York City that he supports an end to apartheid for Palestinians and opposes the crimes against humanity committed by Israel. In American politics, that represented a fresh playbook. He focused successfully on his city's absurdly high cost of living and did so as part of a coalition that included people of the Jewish faith and other faiths, even as powerful moneyed interests lined up against him. And he won.

Keep in mind that a clear majority of Americans do indeed disapprove of Israel's actions in Gaza, so it makes sense that there was an electorate for a candidate who would tell the truth about the oppression of Palestinians, while rejecting claims that it's antisemitic to do so. Mamdani won a third of voters who specified Judaism as their religion (just as he won a third of Catholics). He also overwhelmingly won among those with no religious affiliation (a quarter of the electorate) and those whose religious affiliation was described as “Other,” which is where exit pollsters put people who are Muslim.

Trump's urge to suppress free speech may be about Israel today, but count on one thing: it will be about something else tomorrow. The real question is whether Americans will accept his violations of the First Amendment or fight to protect free speech even when they dislike things other people have to say.

There are those who believe that Mamdani's victory cannot be replicated outside New York City. But given that free speech itself may hang in the balance, it's at least worth a try.

            Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and some of his agents have left Charlotte, North Carolina, according to a Homeland Security official.
    


            The departure is likely a relief to the city, which saw businesses close, children kept out of school, hundreds arrested, and many living in fear during “Operation Charlotte's Web,” which lasted nearly a week.
    


            Immigration enforcement will continue in the area, similar to what happened in Chicago after Bovino and his team departed, other law enforcement officials told CNN.
    


            Bovino and his agents are expected to launch an operation in New Orleans after the Thanksgiving holiday.
    


            Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden issued a statement Thursday saying federal officials confirmed to him that the Customs and Border Protection operation in Charlotte is over.
    


            As a result, the statement said, there will be no CBP operations in Charlotte on Thursday.
    


            “We will continue to build relationships, mend bridges, and listen to the voices of everyone in our community,” McFadden said. “As we move forward, I want the city of Charlotte to know, I will keep fighting for clarity, accountability, and trust. I will continue to protect this city and every single one of its citizens.”
    


            McFadden noted that while the CBP operation known as “Charlotte's Web” has ended, ICE will continue its own enforcement efforts.

Live Updates


            • Epstein files: The Justice Department has 30 days to release its Jeffrey Epstein-related files after President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan bill last night directing it to do so. Some lawmakers worry the Trump administration may try to hinder the process by slowing the release or redacting information.
    


• Trump accuses Democrats: The president called for the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who urged troops to disobey illegal orders that might be issued by the administration, calling it “seditious” and “punishable by death.” Democratic House leadership condemned what they described as death threats, while House Speaker Mike Johnson defended Trump's post.
    


            • Cheney's funeral: Elsewhere in Washington, political leaders from both sides of the aisle gathered to pay respects to former Vice President Dick Cheney. Former Rep. Liz Cheney said her father chose to defend the Constitution over political partisanship. Neither Trump nor Vice President JD Vance were invited, according to a source.
    


            In a joint statement, the six Democratic lawmakers who President Donald Trump accused of engaging in “seditious behavior, punishable by death” over their video urging troops to not obey unlawful orders said they “will not be intimidated.”
    


            Sens. Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan urged others to “unite and condemn the President's calls for our murder and political violence.”
    


                    “What's most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law. Our servicemembers should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty,” according to the statement.  
                





            Additionally, Slotkin said during a conference that “I'm not going to shut up because Donald Trump is threatening me.”
    


            Slotkin said she was accompanied by security to the NewDEAL's 15th annual Leaders Conference in Washington, DC.
    


            Past presidents and politicians of both parties gathered in Washington, DC, for former Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral.
    


            The service at the Washington National Cathedral featured tributes from his family, former President George W. Bush and others who worked closely with Cheney during his decades in politics. Notably, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance were not invited.
    


            Speakers talked about his love for his family and his country, and told personal stories about how he loved fly fishing and the outdoors.
    


Here are some of the notable moments:



            The bill ordering the release of the full Justice Department case files on Jeffrey Epstein is now law — but some in Congress remain skeptical that the documents will be made public.
    


            There is a provision in the law that allows the Trump administration to withhold documents that are part of an ongoing investigation. President Donald Trump asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Epstein's ties to many high-profile Democrats last week.
    


            Lawmakers like Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who co-sponsored a version of the bill in the upper chamber, said he “doesn't trust this administration to follow the law at all.”
    


                    “I expect the administration to block release of anything that puts the Trump administration or Trump himself in a bad light,” he told CNN.
                





            He doesn't think there will be anyone inside the administration ensuring the DOJ follows the law as it's written, including providing the required explanations for why certain documents are being withheld.
    


            Meantime, GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said he expects the DOJ to “fully comply,” warning that it would be a “mistake” for the administration to hold up the disclosure.
    


                    He said he knows Bondi well, and “I'd expect her to follow the law completely. And they need to do so swiftly.”
                





            The former Missouri attorney general also encouraged the DOJ to look into mounting more prosecutions related to the Epstein case. “Given the scope of who is involved in this, I'm just really shocked that you can't prosecute more people,” Hawley said.
    


            As Dick Cheney's funeral service comes to a close, elsewhere in DC, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended President Donald Trump's call for the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials in a video to disobey illegal orders.
    


                    “I know the DOJ and the Pentagon are looking into the legality of all that, but what I can address is what everybody knows. That was wildly inappropriate. It is very dangerous. You have leading members of Congress telling troops to disobey orders. I think that's unprecedented in American history,” Johnson said. 
                





            The speaker noted his son attends the Naval Academy, and said, “I know young soldiers, airmen, sailors. They don't need that kind of nonsense from people in Congress. It is very dangerous.”
    


            Pressed on Trump saying the Democrats' actions should be punishable by death, the speaker said, “I'm gonna let others define what it is, but it's wildly inappropriate.”
    


            Johnson a bit later expanded on his thoughts, saying he took Trump's suggestion to be the president simply explaining sedition.
    


            “What I read was he was defining the crime of sedition. That is a factual statement, but obviously attorneys have to parse the language and determine all that,” he told reporters.
    


            When it came to choosing between his party and the Constitution, it was an easy choice for Dick Cheney, his daughter and former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney said.
    


                    “For him, a choice between defense of the Constitution and defense of your political party was no choice at all,” she said.
                





            Liz Cheney said her father was “inspired to service” by a speech from former President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat, despite him joining the Republican Party.
    


            “He knew that bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she added.
    


            Liz Cheney closed her eulogy by recalling her father's final words after a night in which she said the skies above her parents' house “filled with clouds in the shape of winged angels.”
    


            “As my dad left this earth, his last words were to tell my mother he loved her,” she said.
    


            “And now all of us who loved him so dearly, say to him: Good night, sweet Dad. May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest,” Cheney added, referencing the line from Shakespeare's “Hamlet.”
    


            Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman and one of Dick Cheney's daughters, recalled that her father attributed the path he'd traveled to being “born an American — a blessing, surely, among life's greatest.”
    


            “My dad thought deeply about what this blessing meant, about the duties it imposed,” she said.
    


            She recalled visiting Civil War battlefields with her family when she was young, saying her father “read every word of every sign” at every stop they made. Liz and her sister, Mary Cheney, then young children, “moaned and groaned.”
    


            “My dad's devotion to America was deep and substantive. He spent his life studying the history of our great republic. He knew you couldn't truly appreciate what it means to live in freedom if you didn't understand the sacrifices of the generations who came before. And he made sure that his children and grandchildren understood this, too,” she said.
    


            From driving to rodeos to cooking Christmas dinner, Dick Cheney's grandchildren remembered the little moments of life with their grandfather.
    


            Elizabeth Perry talked about when Cheney drove her to her first day of college. He spent the drive giving her advice as she was set to start her freshman year and reminisced on the times he drove his own kids to university.
    


            “I will forever see him that way. Driving along an open road and telling me stories about his life while talking about the family that he loved so dearly,” she said.
    


            Richard Perry said one thing he and his grandfather both had in common was that they played high school football. He said Cheney kept the schedule of his games on his desk.
    


            “Every Christmas, Grandpa would cook our dinner while we hung out in the kitchen watching his favorite John Wayne movies, year after year,” he said.
    


            But above all, Richard Perry said he remembered the way his grandfather would look at him. He didn't have to say anything, but “you could just feel his love.”
    


                    “He always told us how proud he was of us, and we will always try to follow his example. To be people driven to love our families, to be respectful and to live through the lessons he taught us. To put love and our families first,” Richard Perry said.
                





            Grace Perry shared her own memories and lessons she learned from Cheney. When she did rodeo, she said her grandfather drove her and her horses across the state.
    


            “My grandpa had a love for the land, a love for his country, and a love for Wyoming. Any day of the week, any hour of the day, he was there to help,” Grace Perry said.
    


            Attendees at former Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral include the current and former top-ranking Senate Republicans: John Thune of South Dakota and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
    


            The attendees of Cheney's funeral in many ways represent the old guard of the GOP, including former presidents and vice presidents who aren't aligned with the shift of the party under President Donald Trump. Trump and Vice President JD Vance were not invited.
    


            McConnell has become a fierce Trump critic and is retiring from the Senate.
    


            Former President George W. Bush called Dick Cheney, a “true man of the West, ” as he described his former vice president's demeanor on the campaign trail.
    


            “If any voters came looking for a kind word and a hug, they'd have to settle for the kind word,” Bush joked.
    


                    But, he added: “You can't question the appeal of the only person from America's Mountain West elected to national office.”
                





            Bush said Cheney offered to step aside in 2004 to allow Bush to choose a different running mate in his bid for reelection. But, he said, he “arrived back at the conclusion that they do not come any better than Dick Cheney.”
    


            “He lifted the standards of those around him just by being who he was,” Bush said. He said Cheney was an “old breed of public servant, defined by their substance and character.”
    


            “You did not know Dick Cheney unless you understood his greatest concerns and his ambitions were for his country,” Bush said. “Across 40 years, his service was consistent, faithful and noble.”
    


            As Dick Cheney's funeral is underway at the Washington National Cathedral, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are reacting to President Donald Trump calling six congressional Democrats “traitors” over a video they posted urging troops to disobey illegal orders.
    


            Republican Sen. Rand Paul warned the president against using violent rhetoric, saying he doesn't “think it's a really a good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.”
    


                    “I think we have political disagreements, and we need to work them out in the political run,” Paul told reporters.
                





            Trump said Sens. Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin, and Reps. Jason Crow, Chrissy Houlihan, Maggie Goodlander and Chris Deluzio — all of whom are former military or intelligence officers — should be arrested and put on trial, adding the video was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”
    


            The Republican senator added that people who are “not stable” could see this kind of rhetoric and attack those Democrats.
    


            “I think we should be careful about rhetoric, as far as saying people are traitors, Marjorie Taylor Greene, things like that. That kind of rhetoric isn't good. It stirs up people among us who may not be stable, who may think, ‘Well, traitors, what do we do with traitors? That's the death penalty. Maybe I'll just take matters into my own hands,' which is not something we should be encouraging,” said Paul.
    


            “So I have a lot of disagreement with Democrats, but I try to keep it on the civil, civil level, and try not to call any of them traitors or anything like that, because I think that is something that could incite some people among us who aren't stable to commit violence.”
    


            While searching for a running mate, former President George W. Bush enlisted the help of a trusted source to lead the effort: Dick Cheney.
    


            “Dick Cheney and I went through the files name by name. We talked over the various qualities I was looking for in a vice president: preparedness, mature judgment, rectitude and loyalty. Above all, I wanted someone with the ability to step into the presidency without getting distracted by the ambition to seek it,” Bush said.
    


                    “After weeks of these meetings, I began to have a thought I could not shake. I realized the best choice for the vice president was the man sitting right in front of me,” he said.
                





            Pete Wiliams, who worked closely with former Vice President Dick Cheney, talked about his humility and character as a leader during his decades of public service.
    


            Williams, the press secretary for Cheney when he was defense secretary, told a story about when then-President George H. W. Bush was trying to reach a nuclear weapons agreement with the Soviet Union.
    


            A new negotiation strategy Bush planned to announce in a speech was leaked early, Williams said, prompting Cheney to call him and another official to his office.
    


            “He looked at us sternly and he said, ‘The bad news is that the president of the United States is very angry with you both,' and then I asked for the good news, and he said, ‘I only have to fire one of you.'” Williams said. “I could tell he was joking. I'm not sure the senior official realized it.”
    


            “Then Secretary Cheney said, ‘It's okay guys, I told the president it was my idea.' He could have told President Bush that it was our fault, but he took the blame and saved us from ourselves,” Williams said.
    


            This story was just one example of how Cheney “demonstrated that kind of decency and concern for all the people who served him during his more than 40 years in public life.”
    


            Williams also talked about Cheney's love of fly fishing and the outdoors.
    


            Former President George W. Bush, who is eulogizing his former vice president, Dick Cheney, joked that he discovered in 2000 that “when you choose one Cheney, you get four.”
    


            Bush started his speech at Cheney's funeral by acknowledging his wife and two daughters.
    


            “In a family so close, you dread the day when the circle is broken,” he said. “He sure loved you all, and he was proud of his family.”
    


            Dr. Jonathan Reiner, Dick Cheney's cardiologist for 27 years, described the late former vice president as the model patient as he recounted Cheney's lifelong battle with heart disease, starting with a heart attack at age 37, during his first run for Congress.
    


            He prompted laughter from the crowd when he drew an implicit comparison to the opaque statements issued by President Donald Trump's doctors. Trump is not in attendance, having not been invited to the funeral.
    


            “He never allowed politics to influence his personal health care decisions, and not once in all my time as his doctor did he try to to write or change a single word of a statement I issued,” Reiner said.
    


            Reiner said that “in moments of true existential risk for him, the vice president was always the calmest person in the room — including me.”
    


            “He lived most of his adult life with a relentless disease intent on killing him, but he never looked over his shoulder — he only looked ahead,” he said.
    


            Previous vice presidents and lawmakers of both parties have gathered inside the Washington National Cathedral for Dick Cheney's funeral.
    


            Just moments ago, Cheney's casket was brought inside. The clergy met it on the steps of the cathedral where they said a prayer.
    


            In the cathedral, former President Joe Biden and former first lady Jill Biden are seated next to former Vice President Kamala Harris. Former Vice President Mike Pence is also in the front row.
    


            Former President George W. Bush, who is expected to give the eulogy, and his wife Laura Bush are seated next to the Bidens. Joe Biden and Laura Bush were seen having a long conversation.
    


            Lawmakers such as the Republican former Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, and the Democratic former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, are also in attendance.
    


            Meanwhile in New York City, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is previewing his Friday meeting in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump.
    


            He said at a press conference that their meeting was an “opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers.” Mamdani was questioned repeatedly about how he would approach Trump, who has used a series of Oval Office meetings this year to provide dressing-downs of foreign heads of state, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, an episode Mamdani was asked about.
    


            “I'll stand up for New Yorkers, every single day,” Mamdani responded.
    


            “I think being a New Yorker means that you're prepared for all situations, all kind of comments, all kind of commentary. And at the end of it, the focus has to be, what's the case that you are making? Why are you there?,” Mamdani added. “For me, it's not about myself, it's not about a relationship with an individual. It's about a relationship between New York City and the White House.”
    


            Mamdani also emphasized that the affordability agenda at the center of his mayoral campaign would be the focus of his conversation with the president.
    


            “I view this meeting as an opportunity for me to make my case. And I'll make that case to anyone, frankly, as we've been doing over the course of the campaign, and now as I will be the next mayor of this city, it behooves me to ensure that I leave no stone unturned in looking to make this city more affordable,” Mamdani said.
    


            Vice President JD Vance on Thursday offered condolences to the family of former Vice President Dick Cheney, praising his predecessor's public service while acknowledging his “disagreements” with President Donald Trump.
    


            “My condolences go to Dick Cheney and his family,” Vance said during an appearance at a Breitbart News event. “Obviously there were some political disagreements there, but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.”
    


            Neither Vance nor Trump were invited to Cheney's memorial service on Wednesday, where a slew of former presidents and vice presidents were expected to attend.
    


            Cheney emerged as a sharp critic of Trump following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. His daughter, former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, also clashed repeatedly with Trump, serving as a chief supporter in Congress of Trump's impeachment over the riot at the Capitol.
    


            Both Cheney and Pence had high-profile breaks with President Donald Trump. Pence's came in the wake of his refusal to attempt to reject electoral college votes on January 6, 2020; he later ran against Trump for the 2024 GOP nomination. Cheney in 2024 endorsed the Democratic nominee, former Vice President Kamala Harris, as he warned that Trump was a threat to the republic.
    


            Pence would not directly address whether Cheney's warnings have come true.
    


            “I would never begrudge the late vice president his opinions or political judgment,” he said. “But at the end of the day, I think his lifetime is evidence of the fact of, really, the strength of this nation. And in a very real sense, as we go forward, I think people will continue to be inspired by his devotion to our military, his devotion to our national defense, and a lifetime of service — and that's where we should focus today.”
    


            Former Vice President Mike Pence says Cheney called him after the 2016 presidential election and shared two pieces of “sage advice.”
    


            First, Pence told CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Cheney said he received the president's daily brief, first thing in the morning, at the vice president's residence, before attending as the president received the same classified intelligence report.
    


            “It was a way that he said, ‘You will be better equipped to be able to advise the president if you know in advance what's coming and can run that through the filter of the president's priorities,'” Pence told Zeleny before Cheney's funeral.
    


            Cheney also advised Pence to “spend a lot of time on Capitol Hill” — which both vice presidents, who were members of the House and held the same Republican leadership post, made a regular practice.
    


            “He was the one that said to me, ‘Don't just go to Capitol Hill when the administration is looking for something; looking for a vote. But go on a regular basis,” Pence said. He said he regularly attended Senate lunches.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday sought to bring a swift end to perhaps the most damaging saga of his term, signing a measure compelling the release of the Epstein files after losing a monthslong, tooth-and-nail fight to prevent their disclosure.
    


            The decision represents a stunning reversal for the president aimed chiefly at quelling a brewing GOP revolt and restoring his iron grip over the party. But few believe the path will be so easy from here.
    


            “I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES,” Trump posted on Truth Social late in the day, framing the overwhelming votes for it in Congress as a result of his involvement.
    


            The measure becoming law is now set to open a fraught new stage in the push for the files tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, putting the Justice Department under fresh scrutiny and testing the White House's ability to pivot attention away from the president's past dealings with Epstein and toward more advantageous political ground.
    


            At an unrelated press conference earlier Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi would only say that the Justice Department would “follow the law” when asked about the Epstein files.
    


            But already, officials face growing suspicion from Capitol Hill and their MAGA base that the administration will use a just-opened, Trump-ordered criminal investigation as an excuse to keep some of the Epstein case file under wraps.
    


Reading the fine print on the Epstein files legislation



            Justice officials, meanwhile, are scrambling to balance their probe with a looming December deadline for releasing the documents after being caught off-guard by both Trump's demand for a new investigation and his subsequent sudden support Sunday evening for making all the Epstein files public, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    


            And even as the White House tries to accelerate past the controversy to focus on next year's midterm elections, there remains little sign that Trump's supporters are anywhere near ready to leave it behind.
    


            “This is a storyline that's going to continue to dog the president into the second year of his presidency,” said Alex Conant, a longtime GOP operative. “The Epstein conspiracies have reached moon landing status. And we'll never stop talking about it.”
    


            The relentless intrigue surrounding the Epstein files marks the rare issue that has driven a wedge between Trump and the Republican Party he's led for the last decade, exposing a vulnerability for the White House made all the more frustrating by the fact that it's largely the result of a series of self-inflicted wounds.
    


            Since it became clear that he could not suppress the files' release, Trump has tried to reunify the GOP behind a new effort to tie Epstein directly to the Democratic Party.
    


            In announcing he'd signed the bill, Trump focused squarely on Democrats, writing, “Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed,” and adding, “This latest Hoax will backfire on the Democrats just as all of the rest have!”
    


            The offensive has drawn on newly disclosed Epstein emails that mention various prominent Democrats, alongside numerous references to Trump — a development that White House officials hope will put them back on offense after months under siege. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there's no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein's wrongdoing.)
    


Trump signed the Epstein files bill. Will he actually release them all?



            “All of a sudden there existed a real opportunity to change the narrative,” one official told CNN, noting that aides had only limited knowledge of what was in the documents compiled by Epstein's estate until a House committee released them last week. 



            But the strategic shift comes after months of failed gambits, dismissals and outright resistance to releasing the files — all of which has sapped precious attention and time from the administration's core agenda.
    


            The president now faces some of the lowest approval ratings of his term so far, as well as the twin challenges of waging an uphill battle toward the midterms while keeping a lid on the simmering divisions over Epstein.
    


            “I think the president was in the right position at the end,” GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said of his support for the Epstein measure. “The rest of the story now is that they will have to deliver on that package in very short order, and then it's going to depend upon what's in the package and what's been withheld.”
    


            Trump's signature on the bill — and the credit he claimed for its success — capped a public push for the files that the president himself first fueled nearly a year-and-a-half ago, after he pledged on the campaign trail to release the materials if elected.
    


            His team then leaned into that off-hand commitment as a way to energize a segment of the GOP base that's been fixated on the Epstein files and has been convinced they would implicate a range of powerful figures in the late financier's sexual abuse of young girls.
    


            The administration further heightened expectations in February, when Bondi distributed “Epstein Files” binders to conservative influencers at the White House. The event was a dud; virtually all of the information was already public, sparking public backlash and opening the door to months of private tensions among top DOJ officials.
    


            Bondi later claimed the administration was poring over newer materials, only for the DOJ to announce months later that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”
    


            The ensuing firestorm pitted the White House against many of the MAGA figures who had aided Trump's rise, sparked a bipartisan effort on Capitol Hill to force the release of the files and prompted an internal scramble to tamp down an issue that threatened to consume the administration through much of the summer.
    


            That effort became more challenging in the wake of revelations that magnified Trump's past connections to Epstein, including that the president's name had surfaced in the files. (Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.)
    


            Within the White House, aides sought to manage the expectations of their allies, trying to explain that publicizing the rest of the files risked harming victims and violating the privacy of people whose names were in the documents but not credibly accused of wrongdoing.
    


            Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly took to social media to try to browbeat Republicans in line, insisting that the files he once vowed to release were now little more than a Democratic “hoax.” Yet neither approach succeeding in quelling the calls for more disclosure.
    


            “We're trying to explain to people that they're believing in something that does not exist,” a senior White House official said. “That's why it's so frustrating.”
    


            At one point, as the congressional effort to compel the Epstein files' release gained steam, officials floated launching the new DOJ investigation as a way to alleviate the pressure and block any more documents from being released, an administration official said.
    


            But it's not clear whether the option made it to Trump. A White House official said the idea of an investigation into Democrats came after the emails were released by the House oversight panel last week. The Justice Department declined to comment.
    


            During Wednesday's unrelated press conference, Bondi said that “new information” obtained by investigators had prompted her to reopen the Epstein matter without specifying what that was.
    


            So last Friday, as the House vote on releasing the files loomed, Trump abruptly called for the DOJ to probe Epstein's connections to a handful of Democrat-aligned figures including former President Bill Clinton. He also sought an inquiry into the banking giant JPMorgan Chase's associations with Epstein. (Responding to the probe, spokespeople for Clinton and JPMorgan maintained they were not involved in Epstein's crimes.)
    


            The White House insists Trump has always been on the side of releasing the files. “President Trump has never been against releasing the Epstein files — rather, he has always been against Republicans falling into the Democrat trap of talking about this rather than focusing on the historic tax cuts signed into law, the fact that zero illegal aliens have entered our country in five months, and the many other accomplishments of the Trump Administration on behalf of the American people,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CNN.
    


            And since the opening of the new investigation, multiple White House officials have insisted to CNN that Trump will not stand in the way of the documents being released and that aides have little reason to believe the new investigation will affect that process, though Bondi declined to offer any explicit assurances on Wednesday.
    


            Within the DOJ, some officials have lamented that Trump's novel support for releasing the files amounts to a lose-lose — with Bondi and her department now facing dueling directives to both run an investigation and make public its pertinent documents.
    


            The White House's belated bid now to lean into the Epstein files as a political attack line has also generated some grumbling among allies on Capitol Hill and in the broader Trump orbit who had hoped to move on from a challenging period.
    


            In the last two weeks, some of these allies noted, Trump oversaw an end to the record-long government shutdown, promoted the administration's efforts on key affordability issues and hosted a series of high-profile diplomatic events.
    


            Yet as Trump and his aides try to turn the tables on Democrats over Epstein, “this is all anyone's talking about,” Conant said.
    


            “The power of the presidency is the ability to set the agenda,” he added. “And to the extent that this is a distraction, it does undermine what else he can do.”

President Donald Trump on Thursday accused half a dozen Democratic lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” after the lawmakers — all veterans of the armed services and intelligence community — called on U.S. military members to uphold the Constitution and defy “illegal orders.”

The 90-second video was first posted early Tuesday from Sen. Elissa Slotkin's X account. In it, the six lawmakers — Slotkin, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan — speak directly to U.S. service members, whom Slotkin acknowledges are “under enormous stress and pressure right now.” 

“The American people need you to stand up for our laws and our Constitution,” Slotkin wrote in the X post. 

Trump on Thursday reposted messages from others about the video, amplifying it with his own words. It marked another flashpoint in the political rhetoric that at times has been thematic in his administrations, as well as among some in his MAGA base. Some Democrats accused him of acting like a king and trying to distract from soon-to-be-released files about disgraced financier and sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein.

With pieces of dialogue spliced together from different members, the lawmakers introduce themselves and their background. They go on to say the Trump administration “is pitting our uniformed military against American citizens. They call for service members to “refuse illegal orders” and “stand up for our laws.”

The lawmakers conclude the video by encouraging service members, “Don't give up the ship,” a War of 1812-era phrase attributed to a U.S. Navy captain's dying command to his crew.

Although the lawmakers didn't mention specific circumstances in the video, its release comes as the Trump administration continues attempts at deployment of National Guard troops into U.S. cities for various roles, although some have been pulled back, and others held up in court.

Troops, especially uniformed commanders, have a specific obligation to reject an order that's unlawful, if they make that determination.

However, while commanders have military lawyers on their staffs to consult with in helping make such a determination, rank-and-file troops who are tasked with carrying out those orders are rarely in a similar position.

Broad legal precedence holds that just following orders, colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defense” as it was used unsuccessfully by senior Nazi officials to justify their actions under Adolf Hitler, doesn't absolve troops.

However, the U.S. military legal code, known as the Uniform Code of Military Justice or UCMJ, will punish troops for failing to follow an order should it turn out to be lawful. Troops can be criminally charged with Article 90 of the UCMJ, willfully disobeying a superior commissioned officer, and Article 92, failure to obey an order.

On Thursday, Trump reposted to social media an article about the video, adding his own commentary that it was “really bad, and Dangerous to our Country.”

“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!!” Trump went on. “LOCK THEM UP???” He also called for the lawmakers' arrest and trial, adding in a separate post that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.” 

Democrats were swift to react to Trump's words, with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warning in a floor speech that the president was “lighting a match in a country soaked with political gasoline.”

Speaker Mike Johnson said he did not believe Trump was calling for violence in the social media posts, saying Trump was merely “defining a crime,” and calling the Democrats' video “wildly inappropriate.”

“Think of the threat that is to our national security and what it means for our institution,” Johnson added.

Trump's allies balked at the video. Wednesday on Fox News, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called the messaging “insurrection — plainly, directly, without question” and said it represented “a general call for rebellion from the CIA and the armed services of the United States, by Democrat lawmakers.”

On X, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth commented on the video Tuesday as “Stage 4 TDS,” referring to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a term used by Trump to describe voters so angry and opposed to him that they are incapable of seeing any good in what he does.

The Steady State, which describes itself as “a network of 300+ national and homeland security experts standing for strong and principled policy, rule of law, and democracy,” wrote in a Substack post on Thursday that the lawmakers' call was “only a restatement of what every officer and enlisted servicemember already knows: illegal orders can and should be refused. This is not a political opinion. It is doctrine.”

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell challenged the theory that illegal orders were being issued.

“Our military follows orders, and our civilians give legal orders,” Parnell told The Associated Press on Thursday. “We love the Constitution. These politicians are out of their minds.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Washington National Cathedral on Thursday hosted a bipartisan show of respect and remembrance for Dick Cheney, the consequential and polarizing vice president who in later years became an acidic scold of fellow Republican President Donald Trump.

Trump, who has been publicly silent about Cheney's death Nov. 3, was not invited to the memorial service.

Two ex-presidents came: Republican George W. Bush, who eulogized the man who served him as vice president, and Democrat Joe Biden, who once called Cheney “the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American history” but now honors his commitment to his family and to his values.

“Solid and rare and reliable,” Bush said of his vice president, praising a man whose “talent and his restraint” exceeded his ego. “Smart and polished, without airs.”

Among the eulogists, Liz Cheney, his eldest daughter, only obliquely addressed what amounted to a father-daughter feud with the president — a man her dad had called a “coward” for trying to overturn his loss in the 2020 election.

She spoke of her father's conviction that when confronted with a choice between defending the country and a political party, the country must come first. “Bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she said.

A former high-ranking House member whose Republican political career was shredded by Trump's MAGA movement, Liz Cheney chose not to speak directly of Trump. She spoke of seeing clouds in the shape of angels just before her father died.

Moments before the service began, figures of recent but now receded power mingled: Bush and Biden and their wives sitting in a row together, former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris and Mike Pence chatting side by side in their pew with Al Gore and Dan Quayle together behind them. 

Biden greeted Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former longtime Senate leader, and his wife, former labor and transportation secretary Elaine Chao. Behind them sat Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker. All gathered in the grand cathedral known as “a spiritual home for the nation.”

Others delivering tributes at Thursday's funeral were Cheney's longtime cardiologist, Jonathan Reiner; former NBC News correspondent Pete Williams, who was Cheney's spokesman at the Pentagon; and the former vice president's grandchildren. Six grandchildren were there — a seventh is about to give birth.

“I'm happy to report that I haven't given many eulogies,” Reiner said in his remarks. “Nobody wants a doctor who is great at funerals.” 

Reiner recalled doctors telling Cheney decades ago, after the first of multiple heart attacks, that he should abandon his political ambitions then. Yet he kept winning elections as a Wyoming congressman for years after that.

Cheney, he said, was always the “calmest person in the room.”

Cheney had lived with heart disease for decades and, after the Bush administration, with a heart transplant. He died at age 84 from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said.

Trump's vice president, JD Vance, on stage at another event in the morning, was asked about Cheney and said: “Obviously there's some political disagreements there but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.”

Vance was also not invited to the funeral, according to a person familiar with the details who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The White House lowered its flags to half-staff after Cheney's death, as it said the law calls for, but Trump did not issue the presidential proclamation that often accompanies the death of notable figures, nor has he commented publicly on his passing.

The deeply conservative Cheney's influence in the Bush administration was legendary and, to his critics, tragic.

He advocated for the U.S. invasion of Iraq on the basis of what proved to be faulty intelligence and consistently defended the extraordinary tools of surveillance, detention and inquisition employed in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Bush credited him with helping to keep the country safe and stable in a perilous time.

After the 2020 election won by Biden, Liz Cheney served as vice chair of the Democratic-led special House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. She accused Trump of summoning the violent mob and plunging the nation into “a moment of maximum danger.”

For that, she was stripped of her Republican leadership position and ultimately defeated in a 2022 Republican primary in Wyoming. In a campaign TV ad made for his daughter, Dick Cheney branded Trump a “coward” who “tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.”

Last year, it did not sit well with Trump when Cheney said he would vote for the Democrat, Harris, in the presidential election.

Trump told Arab and Muslim voters that Dick Cheney's support for Harris should give them pause, because he “killed more Arabs than any human being on Earth. He pushed Bush, and they went into the Middle East.”

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts weigh in on parents struggling to decipher Gen Z's slang words.

It is a phenomenon that has swept the nation, seemingly coming out of nowhere in our country's middle schools. The bewildering phrase ""6-7"" has been amusing kids and annoying parents for months now, but in fact, this expression dates to the 14th century and is one of modern English's oldest.

When my 15-year-old son patiently tried to explain to me that ""6-7"" meant nothing, but was just something you say as a joke when you hear the numbers together, while making a weighing gesture with your hands, I asked him if it meant the same as ""being at sixes and sevens?""

 (Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty images.)

He didn't know what that expression meant, and to be fair it is rather arcane. I probably read too much PG Wodehouse, but it got me thinking that maybe this ""6-7"" thing didn't actually pop up out of nowhere. Maybe it is very, very old, I thought.

Turns out, that was a good instinct.

BUY YOURSELF A LIFE-SIZED T-REX AND SIX OTHER ABSOLUTELY NUTS STORIES FROM SEPTEMBER

The first usage of ""6-7"" dates back to the 1300s, which is about as old as modern English gets. It referred to a dice game called Hazard that would eventually develop into what we know as craps.

In the game, a player would call out the number he was trying to shoot for, or make, with two six-sided dice. Five, eight and nine were the most likely results. Six and seven, gamblers quickly discovered either through math or experience, offered lower odds and hence less chance of winning.

Several of the most-searched slang terms revolve around looks and attractiveness, like ""mogging"" and ""chopped."" (iStock)

From then on, six and seven, taken together, became forever associated with risk and worry. It can be found in the works of Chaucer, and has marched quite steadily down through the centuries.

BOOK BUMMER: WHY READING IS IN DEEP DECLINE

Almost 300 years later, in 1595, William Shakespeare would use the expression in his play ""Richard II,"" with the Duke of York uttering, ""I should to Plashy too, but time will not permit. All is uneven, and everything is left at six and seven.""

Once again, in Shakespeare's usage six and seven mean risk, worry and confusion.

Over the next few centuries, the phrase would become plural and popularized as ""being at sixes and sevens,"" meaning being worried or confused, as in, ""My check is late and my rent is due, I am at sixes and sevens over it.""

DICTIONARY.COM DECLARES '6-7' WORD OF THE YEAR

The dead giveaway that this latest iteration of ""6-7"" is related to its medieval precursor is the weighing motion with the hands. It says visually, ""it might be this, or it might be that,"" it's confusing, unclear, a matter of chance.

What does the endurance of this symbol, this expression that has been with our native tongue since its birth really mean? What can it tell us, beyond being just a little fun fact of history?

A double-digit combination set the social media sphere ablaze among teens in 2025, leaving parents and teachers befuddled -- and now it has officially been crowned Dictionary.com's ""Word of the Year"": 67. But even the organization that unveiled the winning word -- pronounced ""six-seven"" and never ""sixty-seven"" -- admitted it was not exactly sure about its meaning. (Chris Delmas/AFP)

It tells us that we are much more closely linked intellectually to those who spoke our language 700 years ago than we think, that we almost never invent, we almost always borrow or repurpose, as Shakespeare, our greatest writer, did himself.

TEST YOURSELF ON THE GEN Z SLANG OF 2025: CAN YOU DECODE ‘HUZZ' AND ‘GLAZING'?

It was the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein who suggested that language is not merely the vessel of our thoughts, it is also the driver. Here we have the English language stubbornly demanding for centuries that these two numbers have a special meaning.

This is why it is vital to read old books and to make kids read old books. They aren't actually old. They are in fact, timeless in as much as their contributions become indelible. We understand what we ourselves are saying much better when we understand those who said it first.

So, the next time your kid starts giggling and saying ""6-7,"" just imagine them on the old-timey streets of Elizabethan London doing it, because the people there and then would know exactly what it means, even better than we do.

The history of English-speaking people is much shorter than it feels, we are much more closely related to those long gone than we recognize. 

So, as we march into the future of artificial intelligence, and brave new worlds, let us remember, we find our real meaning, our real selves and what we are, in the past, not in the future, and just as with ""6-7,"" the past will always find a way.

Republicans may be facing a “worst-case scenario” in their redistricting fight with Democrats after a three-judge federal court panel ruled that Texas cannot use a racially gerrymandered congressional map hastily drawn this summer at President Donald Trump's urging.

Trump's public push for Texas and other red states such as Indiana to revise their maps ahead of the 2026 elections to boost the GOP headcount in the House of Representatives spurred Democrats in California and Virginia to redraw their own. The goal in Texas was to net up to five additional Republican seats that would allow the GOP to secure the House for Trump's final two years in office.

The El Paso court panel said Tuesday in a 2-1 decision that “substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map” and ordered the state to revert to the maps it had drawn in 2021.

The Texas court's decision complicated the expected alignment between Texas and California for redistricting reforms.

California's Proposition 50 was initially justified as a parallel action to that of Texas. There was even language in the measure indicating that California would only move forward with its redistricting plans if Texas proceeded with its own plans. However, that language was removed from the measure before it reached Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) desk for him to sign it into law. That means there was nothing written on the ballot tying its validity to Texas's decision when Californians went to cast their votes on Proposition 50 on Nov. 4.

CALIFORNIA'S PROPOSITION 50: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT REDISTRICTING VOTE

With Texas no longer proceeding with its map, Proposition 50 stays in effect, delivering an unexpected blow to Republicans.

“This is something of a worst-case scenario for Republicans, because there was no clause when voters passed Prop 50 that it would it would be tabled if Texas was invalidated,” Dave Wasserman, the senior editor and elections analyst for the Cook Political Report, told the Washington Examiner. “So the net result is that Democrats could come out ahead in this redistricting fight if the decision in Texas is upheld. In fact, Democrats could net, effectively, the three seats they need for the majority from redistricting.”

Following the Texas decision, Newsom, who is reportedly considering a 2028 White House bid, posted on X: “Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned — and democracy won. This ruling is a win for Texas, and for every American who fights for free and fair elections.”

The situation in Texas also ramps up pressure on Indiana Republicans to produce and pass a new map that favors the GOP, despite state Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray saying last week that there are not enough votes to pass a new map.

Trump unleashed on Republicans in the Hoosier State this week, threatening to back primary challenges to senators who have resisted pressure to change their maps. Republicans already hold a 7-2 advantage in the state's congressional delegation, but Trump wants to secure more seats. He has singled out Bray and state Sen. Greg Goode.

“Because of these two politically correct type ‘gentlemen,' and a few others, they could be depriving Republicans of a Majority in the House, a VERY BIG DEAL!” Trump posted on Truth Social.

Soon after, Goode was the victim of a swatting call that brought sheriff's deputies to his home on the pretense of a “domestic violence emergency.” Goode has not publicly stated his position on redistricting but has said he will wait until he sees a map. Bray announced Friday that the state Senate would be out until January 2026.

Gov. Mike Braun (R-IN) said the Indiana Senate needs to have a public discussion surrounding redistricting and look at maps that are “going to hopefully come from” the Indiana House. Braun also criticized Bray and said he would consider a change in leadership in the state Senate and the caucus.

Despite the pressure, there has been little to no actual movement on Indiana passing new maps. 

“The idea that we could have gone from Republicans creating an impenetrable map for themselves to, like, the Democrats now potentially gaining seats if this Texas court thing stays is an unbelievable turn of events in a short period of time,” Tim Miller, host of The Bulwark Podcast, said. 

Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School, said that most “law around redistricting is up to the state, not the federal government, not federal law, and we just changed state law.” He added that he did not think “there are many grounds for a legal challenge against Prop. 50 to succeed.”

Last week, the Justice Department joined a GOP-led lawsuit attempting to block California's new map. The Trump administration argued that the new districts violate the Constitution because Proposition 50 was “a rush-job rejiggering California's congressional district lines,” and argued that “race cannot be used as a proxy to advance political interests, but that is precisely what the California General Assembly did with Proposition 50.” 

The plaintiffs claimed that “race was a predominant factor in drawing at least District 13 in the Proposition 50 map.”

With the passage of Proposition 50, the number of Republicans representing Californians could be cut in half. The state has 43 Democrats and nine Republicans in the House. Proposition 50 shifted five GOP-represented House districts into the competitive or easily winnable category for Democrats.

Specifically, the map changed districts held by Reps. Kevin Kiley (R-CA) and Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) in Northern California. In Southern California, Reps. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Ken Calvert (R-CA) are at risk, and in the Central Valley, Rep. David Valadao (R-CA) will likely have a much harder time getting reelected.

REDISTRICTING SETBACKS IN COURT SLOW GOP MAP PUSH AHEAD OF 2026

The new map eliminated Calvert's Inland Empire district and created a new seat in Los Angeles County that skewed heavily toward Democrats.

Wasserman, who does not believe the federal government has much of a case against Proposition 50, called the “plot twists” leading up to the midterm election among the most extreme he has ever seen.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Sam Altman-founded company behind the ""Orb,"" a volleyball-sized metal sphere that scans irises to prove people's humanity, had a message for employees: work weekends and ignore anything outside your job — for the good of humanity.

During a January all-hands with employees of the startup, Tools for Humanity, CEO Alex Blania laid out his expectations.

""We will neither fail, nor will we be an average outcome, and that's what we want and that's all I care about every day and all you should care about every day, and nothing else should matter,"" Blania said, according to a recording reviewed by Business Insider. ""If you should care about something else, and if you want something else, you should just not be here. It's as simple as that.""

The company's mission is to build a global digital identity system that can verify who is human in an increasingly AI-driven world. Blania said it exists solely to achieve that goal — and that anything else is a distraction.

""We don't care about politics, we don't care about DEI, we don't care about anything, we just care about how can we achieve the mission through merit, performance, and excellence,"" said Blania, who also told staffers he had recently attended President Donald Trump's inauguration in Washington, DC.

Several ""team values"" displayed on a television screen in the start-up's now-former San Francisco office echoed Blania's messaging, a February video viewed by Business Insider shows.

""We are very (very) hard working. We believe this is a once in a lifetime project and that success is important for humanity,"" one read. ""Therefore, we work weekends, we're always on call, and we push as hard as our circumstances allow us to. As a result we defy the odds, get to escape velocity and succeed on the mission.""

Other values included a warning that the company doesn't ""tolerate slowness and comfort,"" as well as the idea that ""we have no place for talkers, ideology, or politics. We don't have time to worry about each other's feelings; we say what needs to be said.""

The values were written by Blania, according to a former employee.

""The organization's transparency about its values and operating principles has resulted in building a team that is passionate and focused on its increasingly urgent mission of ensuring every human benefits from the age of AI,"" a Tools for Humanity spokesperson told Business Insider.

The core values currently include optimism about the project, individual responsibility, and clear thinking.

Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today.



The company's philosophy reflects a broader corporate trend toward hardcore culture.

John Stankey, AT&T's CEO, sent the company's managers a frank memo about its return-to-office policy and told workers to prioritize performance and accountability over loyalty or comfort. Business Insider previously reported on Amazon's ""hardcore culture reset.""

During the January meeting, Blania said that the company aimed to deploy an additional 3,000 Orbs to verify 30 million users by the end of the quarter, and that it wanted 100 million verifications by the end of the year.

He has described the company's overarching goal as reaching a billion users. Business Insider previously reported that, so far, Tools for Humanity has verified around 17.5 million people — a little under 2% of its target.

Employees were also encouraged during the January meeting to use artificial intelligence to boost productivity.

""We're here as a company that's trying to solve problems in the AI world,"" said Damien Kieran, whose LinkedIn describes him as the company's chief legal and privacy officer. ""We also probably don't use AI as much as we should.""

To address this, he said, the IT team was negotiating a new deal with ChatGPT Enterprise — the large language model sold by Altman's OpenAI. Business Insider has reported that there were also discussions around integrating Tools for Humanity's cryptocurrency World project with OpenAI to verify those using its services.

OpenAI didn't respond to a request for comment.

ChatGPT wasn't the only artificial intelligence tool being employed by Tools for Humanity. Staffers were told that another AI model — which directly competes with Altman's flagship venture — would soon be accessible.

""Gemini Enterprise will also be available by the end of the month to everybody,"" Kieran said. ""All of the Gemini AI stuff that Google has to offer will be available to folks.""

Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack on Thursday gave indications that she thinks the central bank could be nearing the end of what could be a brief rate-cutting cycle.

The policymaker told CNBC that she thinks the current level of interest rates is ""barely restrictive, if at all"" when it comes to the economic impact. 

Restrictiveness is a key metric for Fed officials, who are divided ideologically over whether labor market weakness or inflation is a bigger threat. Hammack has been more in the hawkish camp when it comes to inflation, preferring higher rates and more restrictive policy as a bulwark against another surge in prices.

""I think that we need to maintain a modestly, somewhat restrictive stance of policy to make sure that we are continuing to bring inflation back down to our 2% objective,"" she told CNBC's Steve Liesman on ""Squawk on the Street."" ""Right now, to me, monetary policy is barely restrictive, if at all, and I think we need to make sure that we're maintaining that somewhat restrictive stance to bring monetary to bring in place.""

Hammack added that she thinks the current federal funds rate, targeted in a range between 3.75%-4%, is ""right around a neutral rate,"" indicating it does not need to come down much further.

As a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year, Hammack serves as a key policy voice. 

The Fed next meets Dec. 9-10, and market expectations have swung from a near-certainty that the committee would approve a third consecutive quarter percentage point reduction to now pricing in about a 60% probability that the committee will stand pat, per the CME Group's FedWatch tracker of futures prices. Minutes from the October meeting, released Wednesday, detailed the sharp divide among committee members.

While focused on inflation, Hammack expressed concern over current price levels, noting that interviews she and her staff have conducted around the Cleveland area indicate labor market pressures as well as inflation concerns that are causing difficulty for households to make ends meet.

""What we hear from the workers is that they're holding on to their jobs for dear life, if they have them,"" she said. ""We are in this slow,  this low-hiring, low-firing environment. But what I also heard ... was that the money that they have coming in is just not stretching as far as it used to. What used to cost $30 now costs $5, and so ... that inflationary pressure is still very salient for them.""

Addressing the September nonfarm payrolls report released Thursday, Hammack called the picture ""mixed"" as it showed both higher-than-expected payrolls growth and a tick up in the unemployment rate.

Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) slump deepened Thursday just as U.S. stocks gave back gains fueled by Nvidia's (NVDA) Q3 earnings beat, in a sign of renewed investor caution.

Continuing with recent patterns, even the most modest of crypto gains were met with waves of selling on Thursday, sending bitcoin BTC$86,401.96 back to $88,000 after a rally above $93,000 just hours earlier.

The move higher had begun on Wednesday evening in the U.S. after Nvidia (NVDA) calmed jittery markets with an earnings beat and rosy outlook. In addition to boosting battered crypto, the NVDA results sent the Nasdaq higher by more than 2%.

Stocks are also rapidly reversing their gains, with the Nasdaq now higher by just 0.3%. Even mighty Nvidia is trading flat after being up more than 5%.

Hurting sentiment at the macro level are continued ideas that the Fed, for now, appears set not to trim interest rates at its December meeting. The September employment report (released today instead of weeks ago due to the government shutdown) showed a far stronger than expected 119,000 jobs added that month. 

Also leading hawk, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, was on the wires suggesting that not only was perky inflation not a reason to cut rates, but high stock prices were also a concern. Market veterans will hear echoes of Alan Greenspan's ""irrational exuberance"" speech of 1996. Stocks went on to strongly rally for four more years.

Hit harder than bitcoin was Ethereum's ether ETH$2,812.94, now off nearly 4% over the past hour, perhaps weighed down by digital asset treasury FG Nexus selling a chunk of its holdings to buy back some of its battered stock (down more than 95% from its summer high).

A check of crypto-related stocks now finds large losses after opening gains. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) is down by another 4.7% and off 62% year-over-year to a new 52-week low of $178. Exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Gemini (GEMI) are down 4% and 5%, respectively, and stabecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) is lower by 3.5%.

BlackRock has now joined the race to launch a staked ether ETF, registering the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF in Delaware on Nov. 19, according to a state filing highlighted by Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas.

The registration is only an initial step and not yet a formal application under the Securities Act of 1933, but it signals that the world's largest asset manager is preparing to seek approval for a yield-bearing ether product.

BlackRock's move comes weeks after VanEck registered a similar trust tied to Lido's staked ETH, positioning issuers for the next phase of competition once regulators give clarity on whether staking can be included in U.S. ETFs.

The first wave of spot ETH ETFs launched in 2024 without staking after the SEC told issuers to strip the feature, citing its view that certain staking services could constitute unregistered securities offerings.

 Rachel Sales

The Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”) has recently published guidance for the education sector on complying with data protection law when sharing data to safeguard children and young people. This guidance provides sector specific advice and case studies to run alongside the ICO's 10 step guide to sharing information to safeguard children. Its message is clear: data protection law is not a barrier to safeguarding, it is a framework to support it.

Here are some of the key takeaways:

Education providers must identify a lawful basis before sharing information. While consent is a lawful basis, it is often not the most appropriate in a safeguarding context because consent must be freely given and there is usually a power imbalance between an education provider and a child or a child's parent.

For state schools, the most appropriate lawful basis for sharing safeguarding concerns will typically be public task. In contrast, a private school or private nursery is more likely to rely on legitimate interests, which involves a three-part test:

Education providers should note that the Data Use and Access Act 2025 introduces a new lawful basis of ‘recognised legitimate interest'. For certain public interest purposes, including safeguarding, this will remove the obligation to carry out the balancing test at step three above once these provisions come into force. The ICO has released initial guidance on this but more is expected to follow.

Education providers should consider the capacity of the child or young person to exercise their own data protection rights when deciding whether to share information. The ICO suggests that, in many cases, it is reasonable to assume that a child has capacity from the age of 12. Even when consent is not relied upon as the lawful basis for sharing information, organisations should still listen to and consider the views of the child alongside safeguarding considerations because open communication and transparency can improve the effectiveness of safeguarding decisions. The ICO emphasises, however, that a child's wishes should not override a duty to report a child protection concern.

Where an education provider regularly shares information with other organisations, such as the local authority, a health and social care organisation or the police, the ICO recommends agreeing formal data sharing arrangements between those organisations. However, in emergency situations, the absence of a formal arrangement should not prevent an organisation from raising a safeguarding concern. In such cases, organisations should keep a detailed record of what was shared, with whom and why. Even where a formal arrangement exists, an education provider may not have time to follow the usual process in an emergency. The ICO is clear that organisations should not hesitate to share information to prevent harm.

The ICO has published 12 helpful case studies to show how these considerations may apply in practice.

If you have any questions on the ICO's new guidance or how it may impact your organisation's safeguarding and data protection practices, please contact our education law experts for tailored advice.

Nvidia's blowout third-quarter earnings reignited momentum across tech and crypto markets, with the GPU giant posting stronger-than-expected revenue and profit.

Its results boosted AI-linked stocks and helped pull Bitcoin and major mining firms higher, even as analysts warned of mounting financial pressures for miners expanding into AI infrastructure. At the same time, crypto exchange Bullish reported its best quarter since going public, swinging to profitability and posting sharp revenue growth, though its stock continues to slide.

Nvidia once again delivered a standout performance in the third quarter, easily surpassing Wall Street expectations. The company reported $57.01 billion in revenue, beating the consensus estimate of $55.2 billion, while earnings per share rose to $1.30. This is well above both the projected $1.26 and the $0.81 that was recorded a year earlier. Much of this strength came from Nvidia's data center division, which quickly became the backbone of global AI growth and generated $51.2 billion in revenue for the quarter.

The company's impressive growth over the quarter also boosted investor confidence. Nvidia now expects fourth-quarter revenue to reach $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, which is much higher than Wall Street's expectation of $62 billion.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

CEO Jensen Huang said the company is experiencing unprecedented demand for its AI computing platforms, and described Blackwell chip sales as “off the chart.” He also revealed that cloud GPUs are effectively sold out. CFO Colette Kress added that Nvidia's new Blackwell Ultra lineup has already become the company's leading architecture.

After the earnings release, Nvidia's stock jumped more than 5%, which also lifted a range of AI-linked tech names including AMD, Micron, Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft. Nvidia shares are now up more than 34% year-to-date, while AMD has gained an impressive 82%.

The upbeat print provided a stabilizing effect on the broader market after a very volatile trading session. Some major investors have nevertheless taken profits, with Peter Thiel's hedge fund unloading close to $100 million worth of shares and SoftBank selling its entire $5.8 billion stake to help fund its own AI efforts.

The strong results spilled over into digital asset markets as well. After dipping below $89,000 earlier in the day, Bitcoin rebounded to around $92,000 shortly after Nvidia released its numbers. Bitcoin mining stocks — many of which now straddle both the crypto and AI sectors due to their large-scale data center operations — saw even sharper moves. 

Cipher Mining surged by close to 13% in after-hours trading, followed by IREN with a 10% jump. Bitfarms, TeraWulf, CleanSpark and Marathon Digital also traded higher. This momentum comes as miners are pivoting into AI hosting and high-performance computing. IREN recently secured a $9.7 billion AI cloud agreement with Microsoft, while Cipher Mining signed a $5.5 billion deal with Amazon Web Services.

Still, analysts warn that not all challenges have disappeared. VanEck's Matthew Sigel pointed out that miners face growing financial strain as they invest heavily in AI infrastructure, with debt-financed GPU purchases becoming more common. He said that falling Bitcoin prices and rising borrowing costs could pressure margins. 

Bullish, the institutionally focused crypto exchange and parent company of CoinDesk, also reported its strongest quarterly performance since going public, driven by accelerating institutional demand across its US spot market and a growing options desk that surpassed $1 billion in trading volume. 

Press release from Bullish

The company posted $18.5 million in net income, which is a sharp turnaround from the $67.3 million loss that was recorded a year earlier. Adjusted revenue rose 72% year-over-year to $76.5 million, while adjusted EBITDA climbed to $28.6 million from $7.7 million. Adjusted net income also turned positive at $13.8 million, though adjusted transaction revenue slipped to $26.7 million from $32.9 million as overall trading activity eased.

Despite the strong financials, Bullish's stock continued to struggle. Shares fell more than 6% in early Wednesday trading and are still down nearly 40% over the past month. After debuting on the NYSE in August and initially surging as much as 218% from its $37 IPO price to an intraday high of $188, the stock has since retraced most of those gains.

The company's performance comes during a pivotal year for publicly listed crypto firms. Under a more supportive US regulatory environment and with new stablecoin rules introduced under the GENIUS Act, 2025  brought a wave of digital asset companies to public markets—many with explosive debuts. 

Stablecoin issuer Circle went public in June and soared 167% on day one but now trades around $71 after peaking at $82. Figure's September Nasdaq debut saw the stock jump almost 25% before later settling near $38. Meanwhile, Gemini Space Station opened above expectations but has since dropped to around $11.60 after an early rally.

Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, who has in the past has said he owns some bitcoin BTC$86,401.96, put a clearer figure on it, saying it's been about 1% of his portfolio for some time.

However, the hedge fund mogul said bitcoin still faces significant structural challenges before it can realistically be considered a global reserve asset.

""I have a small percentage of bitcoin,” he told CNBC on Thursday. “I've had it forever, like 1% of my portfolio.”

Hindering its adoption as a reserve currency, said Dalio, are issues such as its traceability, transactional transparency and vulnerabilities in light of the progress of quantum computing.

“I think the problem of bitcoin is it's not going to be a reserve currency for major countries because it can be tracked and it could be, conceivably with quantum computing controlled, hacked, and so on and so forth,"" Dalio said, stressing governments will not adopt financial products that record in a public and permanent way.

Recently, Dalio called on investors to allocate 15% of their portfolios to bitcoin and gold, an asset which he says he prefers. “The advantage of gold is that it's an asset you can hold, and you're not dependent on someone to provide it.”

In a broader sense, Dalio warned the U.S. economy is nearly 80% of the way into a bubble similar to those that preceded the 1929 crash and the dot-com era collapse of 2000.

The multi-billionaire hedge fund manager explained his predictions come from his bubble indicator, which tracks data going back to 1900. He said it tracks multiple metrics, including leverage, money supply, and wealth concentration, to evaluate market vulnerability.

“The picture is pretty clear, in that we are in that territory of a bubble,” Dalio said.

 Some users viewed the asset reallocation as an alarming sign of the platform's ability to blacklist user funds without requiring a governance proposal. 

The Trump family-backed crypto project World Liberty Financial has reignited concerns about its ability to freeze and reassign user funds, despite promoting itself as “community governed.”

The platform said Wednesday that it will reallocate assets affected in a pre-launch phishing attack that exposed the seed phrases of what it described as a “relatively small subset” of user wallets. WLFI said the compromised wallets were targeted through “third-party security lapses,” not issues with the platform or its smart contracts.

“This was not a WLFI platform or smart contract issue. Attackers gained access to user wallets through third-party security lapses,” wrote WLFI in the X post.

The reallocation will only apply to users who have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. Accounts belonging to users who have not completed KYC will remain frozen. WLFI first halted the affected wallets in September as it investigated the attack.

WLFI blacklisted 272 wallets, 215 of which were tied to a phishing attack, while 50 of those wallets reported being compromised.

“We stepped in preemptively to stop hackers from draining funds and are working with the rightful owners to secure/move assets,” wrote WLFI in a Sept. 6 X post.

Cointelegraph has contacted WLFI for details on the total value of affected assets.

Some X users cried foul after the announcement, raising concerns about the platform's ability to freeze and reassign user funds without the necessity of a decentralized governance proposal.

“I think it's hilarious how everyone is cheering that you can rug or lock any wallet on your own protocol. The entire ecosystem is dependent on your security. Everyone will get phucked in the end,” wrote pseudonymous blockchain developer flick, in response to WLFI's announcement.

Other users took WLFI's move as a sign of accountability, as the platform aims to compensate users for the September phishing attack.

“Good to see a project actually taking responsibility instead of hiding behind ‘not our fault'. User safety > everything,” wrote crypto trader DefiBagira in a Wednesday X response.

CDC Vaccine Website Promotes Antiscience Claims of Autism Ties

The CDC this week quietly changed its official language to suggest vaccines may cause autism, a claim that scientists say has no basis in evidence

By Humberto Basilio edited by Claire Cameron

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has quietly revised a vaccine safety page on its website to introduce language that suggests uncertainty over whether vaccines cause autism, echoing ideas promoted by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic.

Experts who spoke to Scientific American decried the changes as anti-science and potentially harmful. “This is a tragedy,” says University of Minnesota epidemiologist Michael Osterholm.

The administration's move rejects decades of evidence showing there is no link between vaccines and autism, he says, adding that the changed guidance poses a public health risk because it could discourage vaccine uptake.

The website change “signals that truth carries no weight in the current and future discussions on vaccines,” and because of that, Osterholm says, “children will die.”

Previously, the CDC webpage cited decades of research showing that vaccines do not cause autism. The new version, which was apparently updated on Wednesday, states that the claim “vaccines do not cause autism” is not evidence-based and that “studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities.”

Since 1998 researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving more than 5.6 million people that have investigated such claims and have found no link between autism and vaccines, said Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a statement. One 2019 study, for example, found no evidence of a tie between autism and the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in a group of more than 657,000 children.

“There is no link between vaccines and autism,” Kressly said. “Anyone repeating this harmful myth is misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead parents.”

The CDC update also states that officials will start investigating early childhood vaccinations and autism.

“It will be hard for the public to trust anything the CDC has to say after this,” says Brian Lee, an epidemiologist at Drexel Dornsife School of Public Health.The CDC did not immediately respond to Scientific American's request for comment.

The Science That Could Change How You Think about Protein

Fitness influencers promote superhigh-protein diets, but studies show there's only so much the body can use

By Mariana Lenharo & Nature magazine 

Social-media trends are encouraging people to consume more protein than most official guidelines recommend.

Snack bars, yogurts, ice cream, even bottled water: it seems like food makers have worked out ways to slip extra protein into just about anything as they seek to capitalize on a growing consumer trend.

Today, protein-fortified foods and protein supplements form a market worth tens of billions of US dollars, with fitness influencers, as well as some researchers and physicians, promoting high-protein diets as the secret to strength and longevity. Protein is undeniably essential, but how much people really need is still a topic of debate.

On the one hand, most official guidelines recommend a minimum of close to one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, or the equivalent of about 250 grams of cooked chicken (which contains around 68 g of protein) for an adult weighing 70 kilograms. On the other hand, a growing narrative in wellness circles encourages people to eat more than double that amount. Many scientists fall somewhere in the middle and take issue with some of the advice circulating online.

“It's really frustrating because there isn't evidence to support the claims that they're making,” says Katherine Black, an exercise nutritionist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, referring to the super-high protein recommendations often shared on social media. What research does show is that protein needs can vary from person to person and can change throughout a lifetime. And people should think carefully about what they eat to meet those needs. “On social media, it's like everyone's worried about protein, putting protein powder into everything,” she says.

Health authorities can help to guide people's dietary choices on the basis of the latest research. The next Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a document that advises on what to eat for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, is due to come out by the end of this year. But its recommendations, which have tended to be broadly influential, might be changing.

Researchers have been trying to estimate how much protein people need for more than a century. In 1840, chemist Justus von Liebig estimated that the average adult required 120 grams of protein a day, on the basis of a group of German workers' diets. Later, scientists started to use nitrogen to calculate protein requirements. Protein is the only major dietary component that contains nitrogen. So, by measuring how much of it people consume and the amount they excrete, researchers could estimate how much the body uses.

Since the 1940s, this nitrogen-balance method has been used to determine the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), a set of nutrient recommendations developed by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

The latest such recommendation for protein, from 2005, establishes the RDA for both men and women at 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, which it states should be enough to meet the needs of 97–98% of healthy people. European and global-health authorities recommend similar or slightly higher levels.

Although scientists recognize that RDAs are a useful reference point, many say that people could benefit from a higher amount. “The RDA is not a target; it's simply the minimum that appears to prevent any detectable deficiency,” says Donald Layman, a researcher focusing on protein requirements at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign. Evidence suggests that the optimal range is between 1.2 and 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, he says.

That is especially true for older adults, who often experience muscle loss as they age, as well as for certain athletes and people trying to gain muscle.

For example, in an observational study of 2,066 adults aged 70–79, those who reported eating the most protein — about 1.1 gram per kilogram of bodyweight — lost 40% less lean mass during the three years of follow-up than did those who ate the least — around 0.7 grams per kilogram.

“For older adults, 1.2 grams per kilogram is just giving them a little extra protection,” says Nicholas Burd, a nutrition and exercise researcher also at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign. Furthermore, older people might experience a decline in appetite, which makes it particularly important for them to pay attention to their protein intake. It doesn't mean that they need to take protein supplements, he says. “It's all things we can do with just normal incorporation of high-protein foods in our lives.”

For healthy adults, increasing protein can boost the effects of resistance exercise, such as weightlifting. A 2017 systematic review found that, among people engaged in this type of training, taking protein supplements enhanced muscle gain and strength. But increasing protein beyond 1.6 grams per kilogram per day provided no further benefit.

Meanwhile, some fitness influencers swear by eating 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight. For most people, that's simply overkill, says Burd. There's little harm, other than for people with kidney disease, but Burd adds: “You just create an inefficient system where your body gets very good at wasting food protein.”

Some practitioners might recommend higher protein targets to ensure that people get enough, Burd says. But the protein craze has been driven mostly by aggressive marketing of high-protein foods and supplements, he says.

“The myth of increased protein needs has seeped into popular imagination, including among health professionals, and has been conveniently reinforced by the food industry,” says Fernanda Marrocos, a researcher specializing in nutrition and food policy at the University of São Paulo in Brazil.

Not all proteins are the same, and some researchers argue for a more nuanced recommendation that takes into account the amino acids — the building blocks of proteins — that foods contain. The human body requires 20 amino acids to function properly, including 9 that are considered ‘essential' because they can be obtained only through food.

The balance of those nine in animal-based foods is exactly what other animals need, says Layman. “In plants, the essential amino acids are generally there, but they're in proportions for the plants.” That means that some plants might be rich in certain amino acids but not in others, so meeting the amino-acid requirements with plant-based products might require a greater variety of foods.

He is critical of the way that official dietary guidelines calculate the recommendations for proteins from different sources. For example, according to the US Department of Agriculture, 14 grams of almonds can substitute 28 grams of chicken breast. Research by Layman and his colleagues, which considers the amino-acid balance, suggests that it would actually take more than 115 grams of almonds to substitute 28 grams of chicken.

Robert Wolfe, a researcher focusing on muscle metabolism at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock, says that dietary guidelines should incorporate the analysis of the quality of the protein, including the amino-acid balance and the degree to which the human body can digest them.

One area for future research, Wolfe says, is understanding exactly how food processing affects protein content. Factors such as cooking temperature, for example, can influence how well the body digests protein. This can have implications for certain protein supplements and high-protein bars, which are generally highly processed.

Obtaining that information requires going beyond nitrogen-balance studies. Wolfe's team has used isotope tracers to determine the rate at which food protein is incorporated into new proteins in the body. One study of 56 young adults, for example, concluded that eating animal-based proteins resulted in a greater gain in body protein than did eating the equivalent amount of plant-based protein. But studies in this area are still small and shouldn't be taken to mean that people must get all their protein from animal sources.

The American Heart Association recommends prioritizing plant proteins, given that the saturated fat found in red meats can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. There's also a high environmental cost associated with meat production, which is a major source of greenhouse-gas emissions.

Burd says that if a diet includes at least a portion of animal-based protein, it will probably provide all the essential amino acids for maintaining good health. And it is possible to achieve the same benefits solely from plant-based proteins. “This is where supplements could be beneficial because it's more challenging to reach that balance from plants only,” Burd says.

Specialists advising the formulation of the upcoming Dietary Guidelines for Americans say that most Americans already eat more than enough proteins. They suggest reducing protein consumption from red meat, chicken and eggs and increasing the consumption of certain vegetables. But it's unclear what exactly will be in the guidelines: US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr has stated in recent months that they will emphasize the need to eat saturated fats from sources including meat and dairy, which goes against recommendations from many medical associations.

Protein consumption is adequate in most parts of the world, says Marrocos. A study her team led in Brazil found that, in general, people consume well above the World Health Organization's protein recommendation, even those with the lowest income. So there's no need to obsess about hitting an exact protein number.

“For most people, as long as they're eating enough calories and a reasonably varied diet, they'll get all the protein they need,” says Marrocos.

 Bees obviously can't use this skill on human level, but this progress could help scientists better grasp complex cognitive-like traits. 

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Throughout the 1940s, Austrian ethologist (a researcher focused on the behavioral study of non-human animals) Karl von Frisch decoded what's known as the “waggle dance”—a sophisticated figure-eight dance that allowed honey bees to communicate the distance of resources like water, pollen, and new nesting locations. Up until that point, the opinion that insects have any sort of intellect was a minority-held belief. Even von Frisch, who won the Nobel Prize for his bee-decoding efforts in 1974, once wrote that “the brain of a bee is the size of a grass seed and is not made for thinking. The actions of bees are mainly governed by instinct.” 

But the waggle dance was only the beginning. In the subsequent decades of bee research, scientists have uncovered even more of the remarkable mental abilities of bees. For example, these tiny critters use tools, understand abstract mathematical concepts, and recognize human faces—all with just 0.01 percent of the neurons found in a human brain. Now, scientists are adding to this list of impressive accolades with a new study, published in the journal Biology Letters. It details how bees can also understand the building blocks of morse code, the complex system of dots and dashes that heralded the information age in the mid-19th century. 

Led by scientists at Queen Mary University of London, the study focused on a specialized maze that led to either a sugar reward or a bitter substance called quinine. Each result was associated with a signal—either a short-flashing circle (or dot) for sweet, or a long-flashing one (representing a dash) for butter. In each room of the maze, the orientation of the dot/dash stimulus changed, so researchers could be certain that the bees weren't relying on spatial cues to select the right answer. They also tested the bees without using a sugar reward, in case the olfactory senses were leading the bees to the correct answer. The bees quickly learned to associate a quick-flashing dot with a reward and long-flashing dash with disappointment.  

“Since bees don't encounter flashing stimuli in their natural environment, it's remarkable that they could succeed at this task,” Alex Davidson, the lead author of the study and a Ph.D. student from Queen Mary University, said in a press statement. “The fact that they could track the duration of visual stimuli might suggest an extension of a time processing capacity that has evolved for different purposes, such as keeping track of movement in space or communication.”

While bees aren't going to suddenly start typing out complex messages to their buzzing buddies—one dot and one dash at a time—this experiment does confirm the simple-yet-groundbreaking idea that certain insect minds can keep track of time. The researchers note that, while they don't know of a neural mechanism that explains this mental behavior, future studies could test different ideas in these miniature brains and see what they discover. What they find could even have an impact on human-made technologies. 

“Processing durations in insects is evidence of a complex task solution using minimal neural substrate,” Elisabetta Versace, a senior author of the study from Queen Mary University, said in a press statement. “This has implications for complex cognitive-like traits in artificial neural networks, which should seek to be as efficient as possible to be scalable, taking inspiration from biological intelligence.”

It's true that the brain of a bee is the size of a seed, but that seed certainly has sprouted into a complex mental tree—one that scientists are only beginning to understand.

                                GeekWire Gala: Last chance for early bird tix!

University of Washington President Robert Jones wants to expand computer science access for undergraduates and build new public-private partnerships to tackle society's grand challenges — and he has concrete ideas on how to make that happen.

More than 100 days into his tenure as the UW's 34th president, Jones is also working to dispel two persistent myths: that it's nearly impossible to get into the UW's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, and that AI is taking everyone's jobs.

This fall, the Allen School — a top tech program nationally — accepted 37% of the direct applicants from Washington state high schools, though out-of-state admissions is only 4%. “We actually accept many more students than the general public believes,” Jones said in an interview this week with GeekWire.

As to the AI job apocalypse? “That's an overblown fear,” Jones said. AI is a “critically important tool to have in your tool chest to be more effective in the future.”

Drawing on his experience leading the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Jones wants to give a bigger slice of the UW's 45,000 undergraduates access to computer science courses — even if they're in unrelated degree programs. 

The idea is modeled on the groundbreaking “CS + X” initiative that he helped expand during his past presidency in Illinois. The program created tech-infused studies in 17 degree programs including advertising, astronomy, economics, music, philosophy and physics. 

RELATED: University of Washington lands $10M from billionaire Charles Simonyi to tackle AI in the classroom

In Illinois, CS + X launched in crop sciences more than a decade ago because agricultural tech was, and continues to be, one of the fastest growing sectors in the state. Jones himself began his career as a professor in plant physiology and became an international authority in the field.

“AI is just an amazing tool, and we're doing work here to try to make sure that our students are getting as comprehensive an education as possible,” Jones said. Bolstering a graduate's knowledge of computer science and artificial intelligence in addition to their focus area makes them “much more employable.”

A $10 million gift  announced Tuesday from Microsoft pioneer Charles Simonyi and his wife, Lisa Simonyi, will help facilitate the integration of AI into education and research across the university through the newly formed AI@UW initiative. 

AI@UW, which includes a new Vice Provost for Artificial Intelligence position, will help the UW maintain its “strategic advantage” as an AI leader, Jones said. It's also an example of the sort of public-private collaborations he'd like to foster.

Jones envisions expanding what he calls “radical partnerships” — building diverse coalitions across geographies, institutions and sectors to tackle problems “that are too big for any one entity to solve alone.”

The collaborations can bring together both expertise and funding. The university faces a difficult financial landscape as Washington state's revenue forecast continues to weaken, drawing down an already strained budget. Add to that ongoing worries about funding cuts to federal research programs that the UW heavily relies upon.

Jones pointed to the university's long-running WWAMI program, which serves medical students from Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho who earn their degrees at the UW and return to their communities to practice medicine, as a prime example of the radical partnership approach.

“I've done about three or four of these over the last 10 years,” he said, “and they're just amazing ways to bring people together and to think about doing research in a different, in a much more collaborative, much more impactful way than we've ever thought about.”

The strategy is particularly suited to AI, quantum computing or other massive technological challenges, he said. Jones was involved in partnerships with the University of Chicago to bolster quantum science research in Illinois and a human biology collaboration with the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago. 

In future collaborations in his new role, Jones is eager to work “seamlessly” with the region's tech sector, leveraging the fact that UW helped create an ecosystem that includes giants like Amazon and Microsoft, as well as hundreds of smaller companies. More than 110 UW spinoffs currently operate in the state, according to the university's CoMotion program, which supports entrepreneurship.

“What we have to do more of is working together to fund and to create the next big idea that's going to be transformative,” Jones said, “not only for the state of Washington, but for the nation and the world.”

Mount Rainier is not getting ready to erupt, but scientists at the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network might blow their stacks over having to respond to a rumor about increased tremor activity at the Washington state volcano.

The Daily Mail reported this week that the mountain was sending up “a flurry of strange signals” and raising concern “that something inside the volcano might be shifting.”  

“This towering stratovolcano looms over more than 3.3 million people across the Seattle-Tacoma metro area, threatening to cripple entire communities with ashfall, flooding, and catastrophic mudflows if it erupts,” The Daily Mail reported in dramatic fashion in a story that went viral online. 

PNSN was forced to respond on Wednesday with a detailed blog post debunking the story, explaining that a likely buildup of ice on the antenna of a Rainier seismic station was causing radio interference misread as seismic activity.

PNSN said the station at St. Andrews Rock (STAR) is “one of the last remaining old analog sites on the mountain and uses very low-power radio transmission to send data down to a receiver site.” The system, located just west of the summit, is susceptible to weather-related interference and PNSN said recent stormy weather likely caused “rime ice buildup.”

The blog post contains recent seismograms and further explanation about how the station's typical signals are affected by glacier slips, rock falls and high winds. PNSN said any unusual seismic activity such as significant earthquakes or volcanic tremor would show up on numerous other stations that are on or near the volcano and would be detected and reported by PNSN within a short time.

“We realized that what they were seeing was one, just one, of our many seismic stations that was sending out essentially static, just noise, instead of actual data,” PNSN Director Harold Tobin told KING 5. “And that's the whole problem, and the thing that people think is tremor at the volcano, it's just some static.”

Washington's Mount Rainier has suddenly awoken and is buzzing with almost nonstop activity for days, stoking fears that an eruption could come soon. 🔗 https://t.co/ZQeqGiKetq pic.twitter.com/KfZ6cUvWi3

PNSN is operated cooperatively by the University of Washington, the University of Oregon, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)'s Seattle Field Office to monitor earthquake and volcanic activity across the Pacific Northwest.

The last minor eruption at Mount Rainier was recorded in 1884.

The last minor eruption at PNSN was Wednesday in response to The Daily Mail.

“Unfortunately, sloppy journalism by non-scientists who don't understand seismology nor check with those that do can generate confusion in the public and more work for those who need to correct the clearly incorrect information,” PNSN's blog post read. “It is no wonder that some publications are only considered tabloids and should never be believed.”

Gemini will replace Google Assistant in Android Auto, the smartphone projection technology integrated into millions of cars, trucks, and SUVs. Google announced the move Thursday, noting that Gemini will start to roll out to Android Auto users who have upgraded from Google Assistant to Gemini on their phone.

By bringing Gemini to Android Auto, Google is making it possible for users to speak naturally and have a back-and-forth conversation to complete more complex tasks on the go, according to the company. Android Auto is an app that runs on a user's phone and wirelessly communicates and projects features like navigation, music, and messaging from an Android-based smartphone to the car's display.

The rollout doesn't come as a surprise, as the change is part of Google's plans to replace Google Assistant with Gemini across all of its devices and platforms. The company announced in May that Gemini would be coming to Android Auto this year.

With Gemini, users can ask questions about businesses along their route to find something specific. For example, users could ask something like: “Hey, Google, I need your help. I'm suddenly craving barbecue. Any good spots along my route that are open now, near my destination?” If a spot looks interesting, Gemini can offer more information about the place, such as details about the restaurant's most popular dish or whether the establishment is dog-friendly.

Users can also reply to messages with Gemini and get summaries of texts. For instance, you can ask Gemini to let your friend know that you're stuck in traffic and to add your ETA to the message. Or, you can ask Gemini to translate a message into a different language before sending it.

Gemini also lets users access their emails in Gmail while driving. For example, a user could ask something like: “I have a hotel booked for tonight. I think the address is in my email. Can you check and navigate there?” Gemini can also give you a summary of your unread emails.

Google notes that Gemini can help people get the right soundtrack for a drive by asking it to create a playlist with specific instructions such as, “Can you give me a road trip playlist? Ideally something upbeat, about 3 hours long, that's good for both me and the kids.” This works with streaming services like YouTube Music, Spotify, and more.

Additionally, Google says users will be able to go Live with Gemini to chat about anything by saying, “Hey, Google, let's chat.” From there, you can brainstorm ideas or learn something new.

For example, you could say, “All right, I'm driving to St. Louis for a wedding. Can you be my tour guide and share some fun facts about it?” And then follow up with further instructions: “Thanks for teaching me all about St. Louis. Changing topics, the rehearsal dinner is at his parents house, and I'd like to get them a small something. What are some good ideas?”

Gemini begins rolling out on Android Auto globally starting Thursday in 45 languages.

To access it, you need to make sure you're using the Gemini app on your phone. You'll see a tooltip on your car display once it's available for you. To use it, you need to say, “Hey, Google” and then press the mic button on your car screen or long press the voice control button on your steering wheel.

Poly can search your content in natural language, across a broad range of file types and down to the page, paragraph, pixel, or point in time. We also provide an integrated agent that can take actions on your files such as creating, editing, summarizing, and researching. Any action that you can take, the agent can also take, from renaming, moving, tagging, annotating, and organizing files for you. The agent can also read URLs, youtube links, and can search the web and even download files for you.Here are some public drives that you can poke around in (note: it doesn't work in Safari yet—sorry! we're working on it.)Every issue of the Whole Earth Catalogue: https://poly.app/shared/whole-earth-cataloguesArchive of old Playstation Manuals: https://poly.app/shared/playstation-manuals-archiveMini archive of Orson Welles interviews and commercial spots: https://poly.app/shared/orson-welles-archiveArchive of Salvador Dali's paintings for Alice in Wonderland: https://poly.app/shared/salvador-dali-alice-in-wonderlandTo try it out, navigate to one of these public folders and use the agent or search to find things. The demo video above can give you an idea of how the UI roughly works. Select files by clicking on them. Quick view by pressing space. Open the details for any file by pressing cmd + i. You can search from the top middle bar (or press cmd + K), and all searches will use semantic similarity and search within the files. Or use the agent from the bottom right tools menu (or press cmd + ?) and you can ask about the files, have the agent search for you, summarize things, etc.We decided to build this after launching an early image-gen company back in March 2022, and realizing how painful it was for users to store, manage, and search their libraries, especially in a world of generative media. Despite our service having over 150,000 users at that point, we realized that our true calling was fixing the file browser to make it intelligent, so we shut our service down in 2023 and pivoted to this.We think Poly will be a great fit for anyone that wants to do useful things with their files, such as summarizing research papers, finding the right media or asset, creating a shareable portfolio, searching for a particular form or document, and producing reports and overviews. Of course, it's a great way to organize your genAI assets as well. Or just use it to organize notes, links, inspo, etc.Under the hood, Poly is built on our advanced search model, Polyembed-v1 that natively supports multimodal search across text, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, audio, video, PDFs, and more. We allow you to search by phrase, file similarity, color, face, and several other kinds of features. The agent is particularly skilled at using the search, so you can type in something like “find me the last lease agreement I signed” and it can go look for it by searching, reading the first few files, searching again if nothing matches, etc. But the quality of our embed model means it almost always finds the file in the first search.It works identically across web and desktop, except on desktop it syncs your cloud files to a folder (just like google drive). On the web we use clever caching to enable offline support and file conflict recovery. We've taken great pains to make our system faster than your existing file browser, even if you're using it from a web browser.File storage plans are currently at: 100GB free tier, paid tier is 2TB at $10/m, and 1c per GB per month on top of the 2TB. We also have rate limits for agent use that vary at different tiers.We're excited to expand with many features over the following months, including “virtual files” (store your google docs in Poly), sync from other hosting providers, mobile apps, an MCP ecosystem for the agent, access to web search and deep research modes, offline search, local file support (on desktop), third-party sources (WebDAV, NAS), and a whole lot more.Our waitlist is now open and we'll be letting folks in starting today! Sign up at https://poly.app.We'd also love to hear your thoughts (and concerns) about what we're building, as we're early in this journey so your feedback can very much shape the future of our company!

1. We have an embedded agent that can read, edit, organize, and take actions on your files. This means it can read almost any media type, which is why it's ""cursor for files"" even though ""isn't _cursor_, cursor for files?"". In other words, Cursor is ""Poly for text"" :)2. We provide you with an ""IDE"", I.e. a file browser. However, unlike Cursor we actually built our engine rather than relying on an existing open source one like VS CodeLastly, agree about the enterprise solution. All in due time for sure!

We don't use transcription or any post processing. We simply embed the file. Our embedding has an additional inner dimension to support long duration content. So it's [N x D] where D is the embed dimension and N is an internal dimension that varies on the content.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now echoing rhetoric long associated with the anti-vaccine movement. As of this week, the CDC is no longer rebutting the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism.

Late Wednesday evening, the CDC dramatically changed its webpage on vaccines and autism. The page now claims that the federal government has not done enough to rule out a connection between vaccination and higher risk of autism—a stance long held by the current secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Understandably, many experts are aghast at the changes.

“This represents a new and devastating turn by the CDC, which has been effectively dismantled by the Secretary of HHS,” Helen Tager-Flusberg, a professor emerita at Boston University and executive committee member of the Coalition of Autism Scientists, told Gizmodo.

Though the CDC isn't officially stating that vaccines are responsible for autism, the clunky changes made to its relevant webpage all but imply so. Whereas previously the CDC definitively declared that vaccines do not cause autism, based on the overall evidence, it now states: “The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.”

Tager-Flusberg and others founded the Coalition of Autism Scientists earlier this April, in response to RFK Jr.'s initial announcement that he would supposedly uncover the causes of autism. Since then, all they've seen is a constant stream of misinformation from Kennedy and his version of HHS, with this latest CDC change being no exception.

David Mandell, a psychiatric epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania and fellow coalition member, notes many studies have failed to find any such link between autism and vaccines or specific vaccine ingredients, including those that relied on data collected by the CDC.

“15 studies using the CDC's own data show that vaccines don't cause autism. Another dozen studies from other countries show the same,” Mandell told Gizmodo. “As any scientist knows, you can't ‘prove' the lack of association. You conduct related studies, over and over, until the bulk of evidence finds no association.”

This is the only latest bit of junk science to have emerged during RFK Jr.'s reign over the country's public health, of course.

He's unilaterally dismissed outside advisors and installed people sympathetic to the anti-vaccination movement, pushed for the end of water fluoridation despite little evidence of its supposed harms, and is set to tie mass shootings to irrelevant factors like antidepressant use. Earlier this September, Kennedy and President Donald Trump also tried to officially blame autism on the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy—another link that Mandell, Tager-Flusberg, and many other health experts do not support.

‘Irreparably Damaged': Former Senior Official Details the Darkest Days of the CDC Under RFK Jr.

While many scientists have continued to push back against Kennedy's misleading claims, his takeover of HHS and the CDC has reached full circle. Earlier this summer, RFK Jr. fired former CDC director Susan Monarez after she reportedly refused to sign off on vaccine-related changes recommended by RFK Jr.'s allies. In response, several senior CDC officials resigned in protest.

The CDC now states that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be conducting a “comprehensive” study into autism causes. Given what's happened so far, there are fewer and fewer reasons to trust this long-standing health agency any longer.

Edited by Shrabasti Bhattacharya

In a US study of about 153,000 children conducted from 2021 to 2023, families with a child with vision impairment were much more likely to experience food insecurity and more severe food shortages than families with children without vision impairment. These differences remained after accounting for household income, parental education, and most demographic factors.

Families of children with visual impairment “often incur substantial direct costs, including medical care, assistive devices, and specialized educational materials that are frequently not covered by insurance, as well as indirect costs such as reducedparental employment due to increased caregiving demands. These financial strains divert limited household resources away from meeting basic needs such as food,” the researchers reported.

The study was led by Tushar Talaparthy, of the Tilman J. Fertitta Family College of Medicine in Houston. It was published online on November 17, 2025, in the American Journal of Ophthalmology.

The cross-sectional design prevented determination of causality between vision impairment and food insecurity. Assessment of vision impairment relied on a single caregiver-reported question without clinical details about cause, severity, or age at onset. Potential residual confounding from unmeasured variables such as coexisting disabilities or parental employment remained possible. 

This study did not report any source of funding. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Joseph Mikhael, MD, MEd; Sigurdur Y. Kristinsson, MD, PhD

November 20, 2025

This transcript has been edited for clarity. For more episodes, download the Medscape app or subscribe to the podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or your preferred podcast provider.

Joseph Mikhael, MD, MEd: Hello. I'm Dr Joseph Mikhael and this is season 2 of the Medscape InDiscussion Multiple Myeloma podcast series. Today, we are going to discuss one of my favorite topics: screening for multiple myeloma. We've specifically titled the topic, “Is It Time to Screen for Multiple Myeloma?” The answer is no, but why?

I honestly cannot think of anyone on the planet who has a better understanding and appreciation of screening, who has led the largest study ever in screening for multiple myeloma. That, of course, is Dr Sigurður Kristinsson, a very good friend of mine. Don't hold that against him, but he is a wonderful individual.

He comes to us as a professor at the University of Iceland. He has led the largest myeloma screening study in the world — the iStopMM: Iceland Screens, Treats, or Prevents Multiple Myeloma project, where nearly 100,000 people are involved in this study. And he'll explain to us what that means. He has really been leading the whole world effort in myeloma of understanding the principles of screening, and how ultimately we may or may not be screening for multiple myeloma. Welcome to the Medscape InDiscussion multiple myeloma podcast.

Sigurður Kristinsson, MD, PhD: Thank you so much, and thank you for this kind introduction, and of course, to Medscape for having me. I'm really looking forward to our discussions today.

Mikhael: It's a really fun environment to be able to have this sort of free-flowing discussion, and I'm looking forward to listening to you. I'm not saying it to butter you up, but honestly, I learn so much from you every time we have these kinds of discussions because you have spent so much of your career and time and thinking through this topic. I am very thankful that you have the ability and time to spend with us today.

So let me just tee it up a little bit because I think what happens is sometimes we just assume that myeloma is a disease where the average patient sees their primary care provider three times with signs and symptoms consistent with myeloma before the diagnosis is made. Yes, there are those incidentalomas where people may get diagnosed because they had a blood test for another reason, or insurance reasons, or whatever, but the vast majority of our patients get diagnosed after having symptoms over a long period of time.

And it's even longer, especially here in the US, in certain populations like African Americans and Latino Americans. So, some of us would naturally think, “Oh, well, then we should be screening for myeloma.” Why don't we just catch it early? Isn't that what we're doing in cancer in general? But of course, we've come to realize that you can't just willy-nilly screen. It has to be done in a very systematic way. I wonder if you can share with us a little bit about the principles and the concept of screening, even before we get into myeloma.

Next week I'm going to have a colonoscopy. Sadly, my father died of colon cancer, and so I have colonoscopies more regularly, but long before we knew the best way to do colonoscopies or to screen for colon cancer, we had to have the data to prove it — same thing with breast cancer and mammography. Maybe you can tell us about what some of those principles are that guide us as we think about screening for any disease, let alone myeloma.

Kristinsson: Sure. You bring up a very important topic. One thing is to identify a disease when it's already symptomatic. Like in myeloma, people have symptoms on average 6 months before they're diagnosed. What we are really talking about here is screening asymptomatic individuals. We know from the literature and other cancers that there is a benefit of screening for breast cancer, cervical cancer, and some say for colon cancer as well. So there's evidence for that. But there are criteria that you should use. These are called the Wilson-Jungner criteria, which were established in the 1960s and have been updated once or twice since.

They pinpoint 10 important points or criteria that a disease, a test, and the population should fulfill before you even consider screening for them. Sure, it makes sense. It's probably true for all diseases. It's better to diagnose them early, rather than late. It makes sense. But we cannot screen for all diseases all the time. It's ineffective. It costs a lot and it can cause side effects. There can be invasive procedures, there can be mental health impacts, and so on. So the literature is pretty firm on breast cancer and these other cancers.

What they have essentially done is randomized clinical trials. So you randomized from screening to nonscreening, and then you see if this leads to an improvement in outcome. Then the key is, what is the outcome? Usually, the outcome is overall survival. So if you screen, it should lead to an improvement in overall survival. Not just that you find more cases, and the few that are diagnosed with a disease sort of get a little bit better prognosis.

The other thing is that in order to raise awareness for a rare disease like myeloma, you should know the symptoms. If you have an individual with anemia, renal failure, or back pain, think about myeloma and do the testing. But that's not really screening. That's not what we're talking about today. And so, the Wilson-Jungner criteria, this is what some people are discussing at the moment in myeloma — that we should just go ahead and screen. We'll have a little discussion about that today. I have my opinion about that and the literature is something that you really cannot debate or even have an opinion on there. It's pretty straightforward. But, in general, you should do the studies around much clinical trial. Check the Wilson-Jungner criteria. It will show that it's superior to not screen in terms of overall arrival. Yes, let's screen, but then we have to implement that. But if not, we should definitely not do it.

Mikhael: This is extremely helpful. You brought up so many outstanding points and I think it's really important for our audience to grasp this because I know many of us can sometimes almost exchange the words screening and testing. For example, a lot of the work that I do in health disparities, and even through the International Myeloma Foundation, we're raising awareness, as you said, of myeloma. We're teaching primary care doctors. If someone has anemia, renal insufficiency, and pain that doesn't make sense, then you test for myeloma. That's not truly screening in the big picture that we're looking at, because then you are focused on a sign or a symptom.

Secondly, I really like how you brought out a very important point that we need to do this systematically to see an improvement in survival. It's not just catching more cases. Dr Robert Kyle showed this to us almost 50 years ago now by screening a population near Mayo Clinic in Minnesota that the precursor to myeloma is inordinately common. And so we have to be particularly careful. Maybe I'm biased here a little bit from my Canadian training, where we're always trained that testing actually can hurt somebody. Here in the US, we just love to order tests, but there are implications, as you said, psychological implications, cost implications. And typically, if a test is either equivocal or positive, it might lead to more testing, and there can be other issues with it. So, putting in summary what you've said is we do have principles of screening, and really, if we're going to embark on screening, we have to look at overall survival as being the endpoint if we're going to be able to do this en masse.

Now, if only we had a large, national screening study of tens of thousands of patients to guide us. So tell us about iStopMM. I can remember being with you in Scotland at an evening event, and you and I, Dr Carl Ola Landgren, and a few other people were writing on the back of napkins, coming up with this sort of basic concept. But you've taken it to a level that is almost indescribable. Please describe it for us.

Kristinsson: Stephen Harding was a key member there as well. The idea actually came across in Edinburgh in 2015. We started the whole concept of screening Icelanders in October 2016. Basically, we invited all Icelanders, 40 years and older at the time, to participate in this iStopMM study, which, as you said, stands for Iceland Screens, Treats, or Prevents Multiple Myeloma.

We really wanted to screen Icelanders for the precursor and see if we could evaluate the effect of screening. There are 146,000 Icelanders that are more than 40 years or older, and 80,742 individuals gave informed consent for screening. During the next 3 years, we managed to screen 75,422 individuals. The Binding Site in Birmingham performed the assay. So they did protein electrophoresis and free light chain analysis. Those who would be diagnosed with MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance), either light chain MGUS or classic MGUS — IgG, IgA, or IgM — were then entered in a randomized clinical trial with three arms.

Arm 1 is basically the placebo arm, if you will, or the standard of care, which is not screening. They had MGUS but were not notified. Arms 2 and 3 had MGUS, and we met them in our clinic. We informed them, we tested them, and we did bone marrow in some and not others, according to the protocol. The whole concept is comparing arms 2 and 3 (those people have MGUS, and they're worked-up and followed) compared to arm 1, which does have MGUS but they're not being actively followed.

So if MGUS screening makes sense and improves survival, arms 2 and 3 together should have an improved overall survival compared to arm 1. This is the primary outcome. We also have secondary outcomes, which compared the number of cases, and we are looking at the mental health impact; we take that super seriously. So we do a lot of questionnaires, and we do biobanking and all kinds of questionnaires and testing.

So that's the whole concept. We are currently around 5 years down on the average or a median follow-up time. It's still too early to say if the overall survival is different, but we have some very interesting findings that sort of indicate that it is beneficial. But we haven't reached the primary endpoint yet.

Mikhael: Just the sheer numbers of it become a little bit overwhelming. I'm helping with coordinating a study here in the US in the Charlotte, North Carolina, region. Our chief objective this year is to screen 1000, let alone 80,000. It's just amazing what you've done. Maybe you can also tell us what is sort of unique about Iceland that allows this to happen the way it does? I know you have an incredible deCODE Genetics lab. There's sort of a philosophy among the individuals of Iceland that they would be more willing to participate. This is a tremendously positive thing, because I assume that you're going to be able to gain a lot of other genetic information through this — is there something that predisposes and the like. But by contrast, I'll also ask you, does that mean that we can't apply this to other nations or other countries that don't have the same, similar background to the Icelanders? But let's start with what makes Iceland so unique and why this study can therefore be even more powerful.

Kristinsson: Iceland is a beautiful country with a fantastic landscape and fantastic people. Secondly, there is a tradition here and sort of the philosophy, if you will, that Icelanders really like to participate in science and if they can sort of contribute to new knowledge. That's very important. This is not only true for the iStopMM study, this is true for the genetic studies and there are many large epidemiological studies with high participation rate. Maybe not quite as high as this one, but still, when we reached out, we didn't really know — would we have 30,000, 50,000 or 80,000, but it just really exploded. I met every single one with MGUS or smoldering myeloma. They have been donating blood, they are participating in all these, they have a t-shirt with a sign of different scientific projects, and so on. So, I think that's a very important thing here in Iceland that they want to participate. Also, when we tell them that we need another test, or we want to do a bone marrow to evaluate this and that, they don't ask first if it's beneficial to themselves. They really say, “If it's important for you and my future kids and grandchildren, then I want do it.” Most people are like that, so I think that's very important.

Mikhael: It would be quite different here in the United States, so that is really remarkable.

Kristinsson: The other thing is that since we are collaborating with other health authorities here, and deCODE as you mentioned, we already have a lot of information, clinical information — like every disease that all the 80,000 people have been diagnosed with since the beginning of digitalized era.

So we have now every pneumonia, every hyperthyroidism, every colonoscopy, every blood test, every thyroid and cholesterol level. We know all this for all 80,000 individuals since the year 2010. We update this twice a year, every cancer and so on. We also have collaboration with the genetic information. I think that's very important that we do not have to collect all these samples and clinical information ourselves. This is already in the system.

The most important thing is, what's the external validity of what we see? What's the generalizability? I think then it's important to think that the prevalence of MGUS and myeloma in Iceland is similar to other Western or predominantly White populations. Survival is similar in myeloma compared to other populations. Both the germline genetics, which we have looked at, and also the somatic-like changes that happen in myeloma over time — they're exactly the same here as everyone else. So even if Icelanders themselves, their personalities are different to the rest of the world, I think that's a positive thing.

But I have to admit that, when it comes to MGUS, we are basically the same. Having said that, all the findings that we have that can be validated in other populations should be validated. Not everyone can do the randomized clinical trial and do lots of bone marrow, but what can be done (eg, changing criteria, prevalence of smoldering), all this needs to be validated. This is what we are doing. We have also seen in the literature that there's a lot of interest in different cohorts to validate. Everything that we have published that can be validated has been validated. So no one is finding strange, different things than what we are. I think in the end, when we have the final verdict — it's only one verdict of them all — it should be screened for MGUS or not. I think people just have to rely on that.

Mikhael: You've raised so many points, and I love the fact that it's sort of the nirvana of the medical record that you could have it all integrated into one. That's one of the greatest challenges we face here often in the United States — “bits and pieces” of health information. You have it all integrated, which is wonderful. But I really appreciate your comments about the generalizability because I have very often heard people say, “Iceland is a very unique country. Genetically speaking, it reflects a small group of White individuals. Can this really be applied?” So I think your comments about generalizability is really important. I think of one of the individuals who helped you, especially in the early days, my former boss, Dr Brian Durie, would say, “It sounds very simple, but myeloma is myeloma.”

Kristinsson: That's what he loves to say. Myeloma is myeloma. I love that. It's true. What we have done has been validated in African American populations in the US, in the Bronx, in Israel, in China, and in Sweden. Wherever you look, this can be validated and ensued.

Mikhael: I think the point you make is so important to distinguish between a greater incidence of something doesn't necessarily make the disease different per se in that individual. As an African American man, I know I'm at twice the risk of getting myeloma, but it doesn't mean that we can't learn from that.

Well, as we come into our last 5 minutes or so here, I would love for you to share with us. I know that you said obviously the final verdict, should we be screening? Does it save lives? Right. Does it improve overall survival? That verdict is not out yet. The jury is still meeting behind closed doors. We need more time for that. But, in the interim, we've learned a lot of things from your study, and I know it's impossible for you to summarize them in a couple of minutes. But can you give us a couple of highlights of things that we've already learned through iStopMM?

Kristinsson: One of the most important findings we had was that since we did bone marrow in every single person in arm 3 of the study, which is about 1100 individuals. We found that we could evaluate the prevalence of smoldering myeloma, which no one had done before. So we could see that 0.5% of Icelanders 40 years and older have smoldering myeloma. That was a surprise that smoldering myeloma is so common. I know you have an episode on smoldering myeloma, so I think that's a key thing. Only 8% of them had high-risk smoldering myeloma, which some people claim should be treated. This indirectly proves that you shouldn't treat everyone with smoldering myeloma. You can't treat 0.5% of the population with chemotherapy.

We have also changed the definition of light-chain MGUS, which was a bit off. No one has been publishing anything about light-chain MGUS since the definition paper in The Lancet more than 10 years ago. Hopefully, we can start to understand more about that.

Also we found — a little bit surprisingly — that autoimmune disease is not a risk factor for MGUS and myeloma. I know that a lot of rheumatologists and internal medicine specialists are screening all their cases of autoimmune disease for MGUS and myeloma. But the hazard ratio was actually 1.0. So I think that proves that you shouldn't look actively for myeloma in everyone with rheumatoid arthritis or SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) and so on.

One of the unpublished findings is the mental health impact. When people gave informed consent, 70,000 of the participants gave us their email address. We have been sending at least once a year, usually twice a year, questionnaires about anxiety, depression, satisfaction with life, and worries. So just after they gave informed consent, like 5 minutes later, they told us if they were worried and anxious and so on, using these validated questionnaires.

Immediately after we told part of the people they had MGUS, they told us again. And then also the people that do not have MGUS. Everyone is answering these questions all the time. My mother and all her friends are doing this, and they send me a text when they have. So we can see that using these validated questionnaires, now 5 years later, that we are not causing a mental health crisis in Iceland. People, on average, are not more worried, depressed, or anxious, and so on. So I think that's a huge secondary outcome of the study: If you give them the diagnosis, you tell them the plan, it's not a death sentence. Most people with MGUS will never develop myeloma and will never need any treatment. So when you deliver the diagnosis in that fashion and you follow them for years, people are okay.

Mikhael: That's amazing. I mean, so many huge lessons there. I'm particularly interested in the autoimmune disease, by the way. Back in the day, when I was in Canada, I had an MGUS clinic, and it happened to be right next to the rheumatology clinic. And so we would always have these discussions, whether or not it was “incidental-oma” — incidentally found because these are sort of sicker patients that are getting more tests.

I think that really sheds a lot of light, and I think the psychological impact aspect of your study is going to be extremely important going forward. When we think of the implications of potentially screening millions of people here in the US and across the world, I think it's going to be important to have that.

Granted, as you said already, the philosophy of thinking is a little bit different in Iceland than it would be in the US. I love it when you tell me that you send out a survey that takes almost an hour to fill out, and they do it. Here, we'd be lucky to get surveys done that take 5 minutes. So, I really want to commend you and your leadership and work in not only conceiving this idea but also fulfilling it.

I think it is going to have a massive implication in the myeloma community. Well, it's hard to believe our time has already gone, but I want to take a moment to thank you again for your incredible insights today.

The major lessons we've learned are understanding the principles of screening, that we have to do it in a very calculated and careful manner, with the goal of overall survival. The iStopMM study has consented over 80,000 individuals and in 5 years has learned great lessons, but is still waiting for the final verdict, as it were, as to whether or not screening is truly going to save lives. And we hope to have that answer from you within the next couple of years.

I'd like to thank Dr Kristinsson for joining me today. It's just a pleasure to have this conversation with you. Thank you all for tuning in.

Laurence  Salmon

 November 20, 2025  

Sjögren syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the lacrimal and salivary glands, causing persistent ocular and oral dryness, fatigue, and inflammatory joint pain.

Although historically considered rare, it is now recognised as the most common systemic autoimmune disease, with a prevalence of 2%-4%.

Because early symptoms are nonspecific and presentations vary widely, timely recognition is essential to reduce the risk for systemic complications, including lymphoma.

Sjögren syndrome may be primary or occur alongside autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or systemic sclerosis.

Lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands results in xerophthalmia, xerostomia, and dryness of the skin, airways, and vagina.

The classic triad includes persistent dryness, chronic fatigue, and inflammatory joint pain. Xerophthalmia may impair visual acuity and increase the risk for corneal ulceration, whereas xerostomia predisposes patients to dental caries and oral candidiasis.

Systemic involvement occurs in 30%-40% of individuals. Manifestations include parotitis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, interstitial lung disease, distal renal tubular acidosis, peripheral neuropathy, and cutaneous features such as purpura and Raynaud phenomenon. The overall risk for lymphoma is approximately 5% and is higher in individuals with active systemic disease or immunologically active profiles.

The condition disproportionately affects women, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 9:1, and typically presents at approximately 50 years of age.

Diagnosis integrates clinical features with laboratory testing, functional gland assessment, and histology. The French National Authority for Health recommends:

Laboratory testing includes:

Functional testing includes:

Histology includes:

Activity scoring includes:

Individuals with an active immunological profile, notably those who are anti-SSA/Ro60- and anti-SSB-positive, are at a greater risk for systemic complications.

Finally, the classification is based on the American College of Rheumatology and EULAR 2016 criteria, which requires a score ≥ 4. A weighted score of 3 points is assigned for an objective immunological abnormality, defined as anti-SSA/Ro60 positivity or a minor salivary gland biopsy with a focus score ≥ 1.

Each positive functional test, including an ocular staining score ≥ 5, a Schirmer test ≤ 5 mm in 5 minutes, or an unstimulated salivary flow ≤ 0.1 mL/min, contributes to 1 point.

The exclusion criteria apply and include a history of cervical irradiation, active hepatitis C, HIV-associated disease, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, graft-vs-host disease, or immunoglobulin G4-related disease.

Despite clear criteria, diagnosis remains challenging because the clinical presentations are heterogeneous, often lack early dryness, and commonly overlap with symptoms frequently seen in the general population.

Management focuses on symptomatic relief and prevention of systemic complications.

Treatment depends on the clinical manifestations and includes:

Sjögren syndrome requires regular oral and ophthalmological reviews supported by clinical and laboratory surveillance to assess disease activity, detect systemic involvement, and evaluate the risk for lymphoma.

The 2022 National Diagnostic and Treatment Protocol from the French National Authority for Health provides structured guidance for long-term follow-up care.

Treatment is multidisciplinary and coordinated according to the disease severity and progression. Care may be provided by clinicians in primary care with specialist input or by hospital specialists in more severe cases. Referral to expert centres is recommended for refractory, severe, or multisystem forms.

The FAI²R health network, dedicated to rare autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, brings together reference centres and competence centres to support the coordinated management of Sjögren syndrome across regions.

Patient education programs are an essential part of long-term care, helping individuals manage their conditions more effectively on a day-to-day basis.

Support from organisations such as the French Association for Sjögren's Syndrome and Dry Syndromes further improves access to information and community resources.

Investigators from the Center for Advanced Gerotherapeutics at Cedars-Sinai found that aged blood vessel cells play a key role in the development of metabolic disorders, including diabetes. The preclinical findings, published in Cell Metabolism, could lead to new treatments for these complex disorders.

Obesity increases the accumulation of senescent cells, aged cells that have stopped dividing but have not died, in several organs and tissues.

Senescent cells differ depending on the originating cell types, diseases and other factors. Some senescent cells help with wound healing, but others cause harm and are known contributors to age-related diseases. Our goal is to identify and target these harmful types of senescent cells while sparing helpful cells.""

Masayoshi Suda, MD, PhD, assistant professor of Medicine at Cedars-Sinai and lead author of the study

Previous research by the investigators showed that eliminating senescent cells with drugs called senolytics improved metabolic function, the body's method for turning food and drink into energy.

In the current study, investigators focused on senescent blood vessel cells. They selectively removed these cells from obese laboratory mice and found that the animals' inflammation and fat mass were reduced-and blood sugar levels improved.

When the investigators transplanted senescent blood vessel cells into lean laboratory mice, those mice developed inflammation in fat tissue and metabolic dysfunction.

Suda said this occurred because senescent blood vessel cells release high levels of inflammatory molecules.

The investigators next treated both groups of mice with fisetin, a naturally occurring senolytic compound, and found that the mice had fewer senescent blood vessel cells and improved diabetic symptoms. Investigators saw a similar decline in senescent blood vessel cells when they treated tissue samples from obese human patients with fisetin.

""Preliminary findings like these are crucial to translating aging research into clinical care,"" said James Kirkland, MD, PhD, director of the Center for Advanced Gerotherapeutics and senior author of the study. ""While more research is needed, we aim to eventually treat multiple age-related diseases simultaneously by using fisetin and related senolytics for aging and metabolic health.""

Suda said his team will next work to test this approach in clinical trials. 

""If we can target senescent cells safely in humans, it could help address not just diabetes but a range of age-related conditions,"" he said.

A simulated 2026 World Cup group stage draw gives the U.S. men's national team's good odds of advancing to the knockout stage.

The USMNT are riding a five-game unbeaten streak after defeating Uruguay to close out November. While they won't play another international friendly until March, manager Mauricio Pochettino and his players have their eyes fixed on the upcoming group stage draw. 

The event takes place Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., though the field hasn't been fully confirmed yet. Only 42 of the 48 teams that will make up the tournament have qualified at this stage, while the remaining six will be determined through UEFA and intercontinental playoffs in March. 

That being said, simulations are already ongoing as coaches, players and fans try to map out a prospective journey. Being in Pot 1 as a host nation automatically avoids clashes with top dogs like Spain, France, England, Brazil and Argentina.

One simulation run by Sports Illustrated puts the USMNT in a strong position to not only advance, but possibly top their group kicking off a magical summer run.

Group D

USA

Uruguay

Egypt

Saudi Arabia

The USMNT face CONMEBOL's Uruguay, CAF's Egypt and AFC's Saudi Arabia in the simulation. Chances are Pochettino and co. will fancy themselves if this group became a reality. 

Despite numerous absences and a heavily rotated side, the USMNT routed Uruguay in their final match of 2025. A first-half blitz saw Sebastian Berhalter and Alex Freeman score their first senior international goals going on to win 5–1 in a convincing performance. La Celeste were missing key players as well, but the performance instilled belief in Pochettino's project.

Lineups would look largely different if they meet again next summer and the stakes raised. Yet, the USMNT would likely fancy their odds after getting some revenge for their 2024 Copa América exit.

Next up would be Mohamed Salah and Egypt. These two countries have only played twice in a competitive setting, with the USMNT winning their last meeting 3–0 in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup. Salah, being the talismanic presence that he is, can determine any game on his own. Still, the USMNT should be favored on home soil.

Closing out their prospective opponents are Saudi Arabia. The USMNT defeated Hervé Renard's side in the Gold Cup this past summer without names like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Folarin Balogun. Given their improved tactical look and the players that should be involved next summer, the USMNT stand a real chance of advancing to the knockout stage.

Two-time champions AAaUruguay will be favored to advance as well, with the third spot up for grabs. The USMNT vs. Uruguay clash would likely determine who tops the group. If the host nation slips up along the way, they can still qualify if they are among the eight best third-place finishers.

Here are the rest of the groups from the Sports Illustrated simulation ahead of the real thing:

Group A

Mexico

Japan

Ivory Coast

New Zealand

Host nation Mexico face a difficult path having to take on Japan, Ivory Coast and New Zealand. El Tri are winless in their last six games since defeating the USMNT in the Gold Cup final. They need to show improvement between now and the World Cup if they're to be taken seriously. 

They should advance as, at least, a third-place team from this prospective group.

Next. Best Players Not Going to World Cup 2026. The Best Players Not Going to the 2026 World Cup. dark

Group B

Canada

Ecuador

Scotland

Jordan

Canada would battle Ecuador, Jordan and UEFA-qualifying darling Scotland. The Tartan Army needed a late stoppage time winner from Kieran Tierney to top their group, sending Denmark to the playoffs. Given Andy Robertson's emotional tribute to the late Diogo Jota after the game, Scotland will be highly motivated to make the most of their first World Cup appearance since 1998.

Like Mexico, Canada should advance from this group.

Group C

Netherlands

Italy (unconfirmed)

Tunisia

Uzbekistan

Italy must go through the playoffs once again this World Cup cycle hoping to avoid a similar heartbreak to 2022. If they qualify and are placed alongside Netherlands in this group, they would be the overwhelming favorites to advance.

Group E

Spain

South Korea

Türkiye (unconfirmed)

Curaçao

As reigning European champions, Spain are one of the favorites to win the tournament next summer. If this is their group, they should qualify for the knockout stage with ease. Among the rest, South Korea and Türkiye are names to watch this tournament. 

Curaçao hope to shock the globe after becoming the smallest nation by population to qualify for a World Cup.

Group F

Belgium

Croatia

Australia

Cape Verde

Belgium and Croatia in a simulated Group F would be overwhelming favorites. This could be the last World Cup fans get to see the likes of Kevin De Bruyne and Luka Modrić play for their respective countries as well.

Group G

Argentina

Senegal

Austria

Qatar

Argentina dominate narratives coming into the tournament. La Albiceleste are not only defending their title as world's best, but this World Cup will likely be Lionel Messi's last. All eyes will be on the superstar to see if he can go back-to-back. 

They slipped up in the group stage back in Qatar losing to Saudi Arabia, so Senegal and Austria are potentially tricky fixtures.

Next. World Cup favorites. The Favorites to Win the 2026 World Cup—Ranked. dark

Group H

France

Iran

Paraguay

DR Congo (unconfirmed)

The 2026 World Cup will be Didier Deschamps's last as France boss with Zinedine Zidane rumored as a potential successor. Can he guide Les Bleus to another final appearance? Their simulated group gives them a strong chance of advancing as they look to right the wrongs of a heartbreaking shootout defeat in 2022. 

Elsewhere, Iran and Paraguay likely fight for the second seed. DR Congo have yet to book their spot through the playoffs, so this group could become a bit more difficult.

Group I

Germany

Switzerland

Panama

South Africa

Julian Nagelsmann's Germany would be favored to advance from a simulated Group I, though they are still looking for a signature moment since their 2014 triumph. Die Mannschaft were bounced from the last two World Cups in the group stage. Their quarterfinal exit from Euro 2024 also left much to be desired.

At minimum, Switzerland will fancy themselves against Germany in a match that could determine who tops this prospective group. Panama and South Africa would hope to qualify by being one of the eight best third-place sides.

Group J

Portugal

Colombia

Norway

Ghana

2026 also likely represents Cristiano Ronaldo's final World Cup in a Portugal shirt. Unfortunately for the reigning UEFA Nations League champions, they've been drawn into this simulation's group of death.

Colombia were runner-ups at the 2024 Copa América, while Ghana are always a tough opponent in international competitions. 

Portugal's advancement here would be difficult and a mouthwatering clash against Erling Haaland and Norway, qualified for the first time since 1998, is undeniably box office.

Group K

England

Morocco

Poland (unconfirmed)

Haiti

Thomas Tuchel leads a talented England into a World Cup. If not for Harry Kane's penalty miss against France, who knows how far the Three Lions could've gone in Qatar last time. The German manager looks to get over the line in an international tournament after Sir Gareth Southgate came up just short in consecutive Euros. 

Morocco would be their toughest test here after finishing fourth last World Cup. Poland must go through the playoffs with Haiti rounding out this group.

England Right Back Options. England's Right Back Options—Ranked. dark. Next

Group L

Brazil

Denmark (unconfirmed)

Algeria

Iraq (unconfirmed)

There's no doubting Brazil's pedigree. Yet, they have multiple question marks heading into 2026. Carlo Ancelotti must get the most out of his players as he continues to search for consistency. They would be favored over most sides in this group, but how far this iteration of Brazil can go remains to be seen.

Joining them in the simulation are Algeria and two playoff sides: Denmark and Iraq.

Barcelona's long-awaited return to the renovated Spotify Camp Nou will feature a secret ceremonial kick-off and multiple performances for the reopening against Athletic Club. With 45,000 fans expected, Barca promise surprises as the stadium comes back to life after 909 days away.

Barcelona's return to the Spotify Camp Nou against Athletic Club marks the end of a 909-day exile and the beginning of a new chapter at the iconic stadium. According to Mundo Deportivo, the club has confirmed that the refurbished venue will welcome 45,000 supporters, with gates opening at 2:15 PM, two hours before the 4:15 PM kick-off, to ensure fans experience the full pre-match lineup of celebrations.

The reopening event is designed to be both emotional and theatrical. As per the report, DJ Mon will be the first to perform as fans enter, followed by the central pre-match segment beginning at 4:00 PM. Catalan duo Figa Flawas will take the stage shortly before kick-off, while the Orfeo Catala will perform the ‘Cant del Barca' accompanied by fireworks, symbolising the club's return to its spiritual home.

But the biggest talking point ahead of the match is Barcelona's deliberate secrecy surrounding a “special ceremonial kickoff.” The club has refused to reveal who will take the honour, teasing supporters with the promise of further surprises throughout the evening. At halftime, popular group The Tyets will perform.

Barca have encouraged fans to arrive early, fill the renovated stands in Blaugrana colours and immerse themselves in what the club describes as a once-in-a-generation moment. 

The reopening is not only a logistical triumph but also a deeply sentimental milestone for the club's leadership. President Joan Laporta has spoken extensively about the emotional weight of the return, calling Saturday's event “a historic moment” and telling RAC1, “It'll be wonderful to be back.”

Sporting director Deco added his personal tribute through a series of messages shared on Instagram, each reflecting pride in Barcelona's homecoming after more than two years away. His posts captured the atmosphere the club wants to create, “The Future is Here: We're Coming Home, to the New Spotify Camp Nou.”

In a second message, he wrote: “It's a pride to see how our house is transformed to house the next chapters of FC Barcelona's history. Long live Barca!” He followed with a third reflection: “The Legend Returns: Back to the New Spotify Camp Nou! I feel immense pride witnessing the return of FC Barcelona to its transformed home.” And finally, echoing the club's historic motto, one more declaration: “More Than A Club!”

These messages underline the importance of the moment internally at Barca. Beyond the performances and the secret kick-off, the reopening is being framed as a symbolic rebirth, a return not just to a stadium, but to identity, history and continuity. For Laporta, Deco and the wider institution, Camp Nou is more than infrastructure; it is the heart of the club.

Barca's return comes at the end of a renovation saga far more complex than anticipated. The club had originally left the Camp Nou in 2023 to begin a €1.5bn modernisation project designed to transform the ageing 1957 structure into a world-class, revenue-generating venue. However, the journey back has been marked by repeated setbacks, shifting deadlines and ongoing construction challenges.

The initial plan targeted November 2024, coinciding with the club's 125th anniversary, but this quickly proved unrealistic. A proposed return for the Gamper Trophy in August 2025 also fell through. Even La Liga's flexibility in allowing multiple away fixtures at the start of the 2025-26 season failed to align with the pace of construction, forcing Barca to temporarily move matches to the Estadi Johan Cruyff and later back to Montjuic.

The delays stemmed from several structural and administrative hurdles, including approvals linked to Phase 1B and ongoing negotiations with the city council. The Espai Barca project itself has a long backstory, Norman Foster's 2007 redesign failed to progress, then the modernisation plan proposed under Josep Maria Bartomeu in 2014 stalled amid financial turmoil. When Laporta returned to the presidency in 2021, he radically revised the project, leading to socios approving a new model in December of that year. Turkish construction firm Limak was hired in early 2023, with funding secured through Goldman Sachs shortly thereafter.

The new stadium features expanded VIP rings, improved infrastructure, modernised changing rooms and a redesigned players' tunnel. These updates aim to increase recurring revenue, projected at around €120 million annually, while elevating the fan experience.

Saturday's match against Athletic Club is more than a celebration; it is a first operational test of the new Camp Nou. The ultimate goal is to reopen the stadium at its full 105,000-seat capacity, though no definitive completion date has been set.

On the sporting side, Hansi Flick's team will hope to turn the emotional return into a performance boost. Playing at the Estadi Olimpic and later splitting games across alternative venues disrupted momentum over the past two seasons. The return to Camp Nou is viewed internally as a psychological turning point for both players and supporters.

Athletic Club arrive as the first visitors to the partially reopened stadium, giving Barca a high-profile opportunity to mark the occasion with a statement result.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Spurs striker trains in special equipment ahead of north London derby against Arsenal after breaking jaw","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/randal-kolo-muani-mask-spurs-striker-trains-special-equipment-north-london-derby-arsenal-breaking-jaw/bltc252ca6bc1cbee8a","Thu, 20 Nov 2025 17:59:31 GMT","

Tottenham loanee Randal Kolo Muani has reportedly been training in a specially fitted mask ahead of the north London derby against Arsenal. During Spurs' 2-2 draw with Manchester United earlier this month, the striker suffered a fractured jaw following a clash with Harry Maguire. However, after the Paris Saint-Germain man did not need to have surgery, Tottenham are doing all they can to give him a chance of facing the Gunners this weekend.

Kolo Muani was withdrawn at half time following the coming together with Maguire, with head coach Thomas Frank later saying: ""He actually struggled a little bit but nothing big."" Initial suggestions were that the France international could miss up to eight weeks with this injury but last week, news emerged that he did not require surgery. The Telegraph is now reporting that he has trained in a mask he had fitted to help protect his jaw. It is not yet known if he will be okay to face Arsenal at The Emirates on Sunday afternoon. If the forward does return to the field soon, he could take after ex-Spurs striker Harry Kane when he wore a mask after breaking his nose, before scoring a truly world-class goal in a 2-2 draw with the Gunners.

On September 1, Kolo Muani joined Tottenham on loan for the 2025/26 season, sparking a great deal of excitement among Spurs fans. He has featured eight times in all competitions for the north London team but is yet to get off the mark. Tottenham supporters will be hoping he can recapture the form he showed at Juventus last season, where he notched 10 goals in 22 games.

In the final day of the summer transfer window, Tottenham snapped up the Frenchman for the season as they sought to add more firepower to their attack. With Dominic Solanke and Richarlison often struggling with injuries and being somewhat goal-shy, the loan move seemed a savvy deal. Following the move, Frank said the 26-year-old gave their frontline something a bit different.

""Randal is a quality player who has proven himself over a number of years, playing for big teams in the Champions League and also with good experience for the France national team,"" Frank said of his latest addition in early September. ""He's a good age, in the prime of his career, has good qualities that will suit both us and the Premier League, and gives us a different option in the final third being able to play out wide and through the middle.""

Tottenham sit fifth in the Premier League with 18 points from 11 matches. Next up, they travel to bitter rivals Arsenal on Sunday, who sit four points clear at the top of the table. A win will boost their hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League, but a loss could leave them languishing behind their neighbours.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Fernandinho has officially decided to bring down the curtain on an extraordinary career, drawing to a close more than two decades at the top of the game and a trophy cabinet that places him among Manchester City's most decorated players of all time. The former Brazil international, now 40, confirmed he will not continue playing, ending speculation that had lingered since his return to Athletico Paranaense in 2022.

Fernandinho spent nine seasons at Manchester City after arriving from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, where he had already earned six Ukrainian league titles and a UEFA Cup. Under Manuel Pellegrini and later Pep Guardiola, he became the anchor of City's midfield. Known for his exceptional reading of the game, immaculate tackling, and unrivalled positional awareness, his influence allowed the club's creative talents to flourish. Across 383 City appearances, Fernandinho lifted five Premier League titles, six League Cups, an FA Cup and a Community Shield.

After leaving Manchester in 2022, Fernandinho went home, rejoining Athletico Paranaense, the club that first introduced him to professional football. His playing time naturally declined as the seasons passed, and the midfielder had not featured since December 2024 in a league match against Atletico Mineiro. Speaking after a charity game this week at the club's stadium, he made clear his body had given him its final warning. 

""I'm already tired. I ran for 30-something minutes today and I'm exhausted,"" he said. ""There's nothing in football that motivates me anymore. I've achieved everything I could. Now it's time to enjoy my family.""

The 40-year-old added that his departure came after he and the club failed to reach an agreement on a new deal. 

""We didn't reach an agreement for a new contract, and that's the most natural thing in the world. I've never hidden my gratitude, my respect and affection for Athletico, especially their fans,"" he said.

When Fernandinho left City, he had not initially informed Guardiola about his decision. 

""I didn't know it,"" the manager told reporters during a press conference. ""You gave me the news. We will see what will happen at the end of the season. I said many times we will see what happens. I said at the end of the season we will talk – maybe it is a family decision, maybe he wants more minutes. I would love to be with him.""

Guardiola suggested that the then sporting director, Txiki Begiristain, might have been aware of the development.

""Maybe Txiki knows it and didn't tell me,"" Guardiola said. ""I don't know. It is a surprise for me; I will say to him [Txiki]: 'What happened?' But I know his [Fernandinho's] intentions. Another player would do it for his benefit. Knowing Ferna, it will not be this.

""I want the happiness of my players and absolutely we are going to play tomorrow for him and give him the best farewell moment, reaching again the semi‑final of the Champions League and try to go through again. I understand the players want to play, it is completely understandable. Not just because he is 35 or 36. Look what happened with Ferran Torres: he wanted to play so joined Barcelona. I understand Ferna wants go back to Brazil, with his father and mother there, and I am pretty sure the club is going to help him do what he wants.""

Attention now shifts to Fernandinho's future beyond the pitch. The Brazilian has previously expressed interest in coaching, and Manchester City have a history of integrating former players into roles across their academy, global network or ambassadorial programmes. With his intimate knowledge of Guardiola's system, he would be a valuable addition should he choose to pursue the coaching path. However, as he mentioned, right now, he would opt for a quieter period dedicated to family life, after spending years at the elite level.

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Leclerc: 'The best thing I can do is keep doing my best'

With a short break between the Sao Paulo and Las Vegas Grands Prix, how have the drivers been spending their time away from racing? Take a sneak peek into the life of the drivers off-grid...

As the end of the 2025 season looms, the drivers are heading for a bold and action-packed weekend at the Las Vegas Strip Circuit – and the energy is already building. After the thrills and drama of Sao Paulo, the grid took a brief moment to recover, reset, and let their hair down before diving back into the final three races to end the season strong.

Whilst some stayed off-grid to focus on final prep work, some drivers showed that it's just as important to let off steam and have a balanced break – proving  that even in the midst of a title fight, there's always room for a little fun, relaxation, and the occasional unexpected adventure!

Fresh from his best-ever Grand Prix result in Sao Paulo and before jetting off to Vegas, Kimi Antonelli squeezed in a trip to Turin to watch the highly anticipated ATP Finals. The Mercedes rookie went to support F1 Ambassador and fellow Italian Jannik Sinner, who was playing in the season finale against world number one Carlos Alcaraz.

Antonelli joined in the celebrations as Sinner clinched the title, and the pair even had time to snap a quick photo before Kimi set off for the final triple header of the year. He'll be hoping to carry a bit of that winning energy with him!

One driver that is really itching to make the most of his final week off before the season climax is Charles Leclerc. The Ferrari man, fresh off his heartwarming engagement announcement before Sao Paulo, has clearly been busy in the run up to Las Vegas, including launching his new lifestyle merchandise!

Amid the wedding planning, Leclerc unveiled his latest collection with an eye-catching promo video featuring fiancée Alexandra Saint Mleux and their dog, Leo, both proudly modelling the new gear. And judging by Leo's enthusiasm, it definitely gets his seal of approval!

As if that wasn't enough excitement for one week, Leclerc and Alexandra also squeezed in a night at the opera before taking a group of friends to Universal Studios in LA. It's no secret that the Monegasque loves a good costume moment (banana suit, anyone?), so it was no surprise to see him roaming the park in a Mario hat, with Alexandra matching the vibe in a Yoshi one.

In a week where F1 The Album was nominated for three awards at the Grammys, Oscar Piastri enjoyed his own successes. In a post from the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, it was announced that Piastri was the recipient of 'The Don' award – a major accolade celebrating the athlete who's inspired the country the most – not a bad addition to his ever-growing trophy cabinet!

Championship leader Lando Norris dived head-first into US culture by enjoying an exciting evening out watching the Las Vegas Raiders. Despite their loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Norris was all smiles, and with the Las Vegas Strip Circuit only a short drive away, it doubled as the perfect warm-up for the wild energy the city is known for during race week!

Over in Munich, Audi offered the first look at their 2026 livery concept, and team mates Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto were among the first to see it up close. Both drivers took to social media to share their excitement as the brand gears up for its full-works debut in a few months' time.

With major regulation changes on the horizon, Audi's early design signals a bold new identity for the current Kick Sauber team – and anticipation is already building for the full unveiling early in 2026, when fans will finally see the machine that marks the start of Audi's new era in Formula 1.

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Leclerc: 'The best thing I can do is keep doing my best'

All the main talking points as F1 ACADEMY gears up for a thrilling title decider.

Their battles have had fans on the edge of their seats all season long, but for the 2025 F1 ACADEMY field, it all comes down to this as the Drivers' and Teams' titles hang in the balance.

Breaking new ground as the first single-seater category to race on the streets of Las Vegas, every driver has something at stake – whether that's a title, potential 2026 opportunities or one final hurrah as they look towards the next chapter in their racing journeys…

Doriane Pin and Maya Weug have been neck and neck throughout the season, each leading the standings at various points throughout the campaign.

Last time out in Singapore saw a much-needed storming performance from Weug, with the Ferrari driver claiming pole, a podium from P8 on the Race 1 reverse grid and snatching the Race 2 win away from her Mercedes rival on the final lap.

Each have brought their own strengths, with Pin's consistency evident in a points-scoring streak stretching back to her F1 ACADEMY debut last year. Meanwhile, Weug has been the outright quicker of the two, with three pole positions to Pin's zero, and has one additional podium finish.

Separated by only nine points and tied on three victories apiece, it's Pin who holds the slender advantage. But with 39 points to play for, the fight to become the series' third champion can only be decided in a Saturday afternoon showdown.

The battle between Pin and Weug has a knock-on effect for their teams, PREMA Racing and MP Motorsport. Reigning Champions PREMA, who also field Aston Martin's Tina Hausmann and Alpine racer Nina Gademan, are looking to secure their third consecutive Teams' title and hold a 49-point advantage over their Dutch rivals.

For MP, they'll be relying on their rookies Alba Larsen in the Tommy Hilfiger car and Wella's Joanne Ciconte to push towards the top end of the field, mirroring how the pair started the year in Shanghai.

Campos Racing still remain in the hunt, albeit in a distant third place, 70 points adrift of PREMA.

For seven drivers, Round 7 is their final chance to make their mark as their time in the series draws to a close at the end of their two-year stint. While Pin and Weug have the title in their sights, race winners Chloe Chambers and Lia Block will be looking to climb on to the top step one last time at their home event.

Although silverware has eluded Hausmann, Chloe Chong and Aurelia Nobels up until this point, the unpredictability of the Las Vegas circuit, combined with the reverse grid race on Friday afternoon, opens up a world of opportunities for them to seize.

Two new names have joined the field for the final round – and each will be eager show they've got what it takes to earn a spot on next year's grid.

Payton Westcott becomes the seventh Wild Card driver of the year, with the American one of nine karters supported by F1 ACADEMY DISCOVER YOUR DRIVE in the Champions of the Future Academy Program last year. Strong showings across her rookie campaign in Italian F4 and a promising showing in the inaugural F1 ACADEMY Rookie Test have earned her a spot behind the wheel of the #15 Visit Las Vegas car.

There is also a change in the TAG Heuer car as Rachel Robertson steps in for the injured Aiva Anagnostiadis. The 18-year-old finished third in the 2025 Radical Cup UK campaign before achieving back-to-back top-five finishes in the Rookie Test.

Four of 2024's Wild Card drivers earned full-time seats for this year – but how many familiar faces will we see next season?

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Leclerc: 'The best thing I can do is keep doing my best'

Lando Norris believes this weekend in Las Vegas will be a greater challenge than previous races this season.

Lando Norris believes ""expectations are not to the same level"" this weekend for the Las Vegas Grand Prix as at previous races this season, with the McLaren driver admitting ""it's going to be trickier"" due to the track layout and cold temperatures.

Norris heads into this weekend's event having claimed dominant victories at the two previous races in Mexico City and Brazil, which has helped the Briton establish a 24-point lead over team mate Oscar Piastri.

Despite the strong run of form, Las Vegas has historically been a venue where McLaren has struggled since it was introduced to the calendar in 2023, with Norris crashing out during that year's race and finishing only sixth 12 months ago.

""From the last two years it's certainly been the hardest race of the year that we've had,"" said Norris during the pre-weekend press conference.

""So my expectations are not to the same level as Mexico and Brazil where we've been performing very well for a good amount of years.

""But we've had an excellent year, we've improved in places that we struggled in the past so I'm certainly coming in with more confidence than in previous years but not the same amount of confidence going into the last few races we've had.

""You never know, expectations are still high, I'm still coming here to win and to want to repeat the last few weekends I've had but I think it's going to be tricker for sure than the last couple.""

With just three Grands Prix and one Sprint remaining this campaign, Norris looks on course for his maiden World Championship having overturned a 34-point deficit to Piastri after his retirement in Zandvoort from a mechanical issue.

Over the following six races, Norris has claimed two wins and a further three podiums in contrast to the sole rostrum for his team mate.

When asked if anything had changed during that period, Norris admitted that work away from the track even earlier in the season had been crucial, and was still proving pivotal.

""It's just a constant amount of work that I do with my team to always keep finding little things,"" said Norris.

""It's not like I've gone out and gone 'this is how the car needs to be driven'. I still struggle now, one weekend to the next it changes. Mexico to Austin, completely different feelings, to Brazil again, completely different feelings. It's not like you figure it out and everything is easy.

""I still, every weekend, need to adapt a lot to how the car wants to be driven. It's never one thing, it's just a lot of things that I've been doing on the simulator, I've been spending time with my team on trying to figure out and adapt, to having better procedures of working through FP1, FP2, FP3 to try and understand more about the car and the way it needs to be driven.

""I've had to step up more than ever in terms of my work ethic, my understanding of all of these things. Get more out of the people around me and then get more out of me at the same time and work more than I have before.""

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Leclerc: 'The best thing I can do is keep doing my best'

After Ferrari Executive Chairman John Elkann stated that the team's drivers need to ""talk less and focus on driving"", Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc have shared their reactions.

Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc have shared their reactions to Ferrari Executive Chairman John Elkann's recent comments that the drivers need to ""talk less and focus on driving"" after the squad's double retirement in Brazil.

The Sao Paulo Grand Prix proved difficult for the Scuderia, with Leclerc recording a DNF after being hit by Kimi Antonelli's Mercedes in a Turn 1 melee also involving McLaren's Oscar Piastri, while Hamilton went on to retire the car after sustaining lasting damage during earlier incidents.

Elkann made comments about the drivers needing to “focus on driving” in the wake of this weekend, one that saw the Scuderia slip backwards from P2 in the Teams' Championship to P4.

Asked about the remarks ahead of this weekend's Las Vegas Grand Prix, Leclerc explained that he had spoken to Elkann and that his words were a reflection of the shared ambition to take Ferrari back to the top.

“John has known me for many, many years, and we have a very good relationship and we've always been very honest with ourselves and speak to each other very regularly, so obviously, we have spoken since then,” said Leclerc.

“Obviously, John is a very ambitious person and wants the best for Ferrari, just like I do, and we are trying to do our best in order to make sure that Ferrari is back on top.

""That's John's priority, that is my priority, that is the priority of the whole team, and we are doing absolutely everything to do that.

“The best thing I can do is to keep doing my best and do everything to bring back the team that I love to the top of the standings.”

The Monegasque also suggested that facing challenges during a season does not make him any less motivated.

“All seasons are challenging. I don't think there are any that are easier,” Leclerc added. “There are some that are happier and some others that are a bit more difficult to keep the smile on.

“This is probably one of those that is a little bit more difficult from the first race to the last race, as we had high expectations after last year. We started on that back foot and then you have to try to recover from there.

“That doesn't hurt my motivation. I'm very motivated, I'm very driven by bringing back Ferrari to the top, and that's what motivates me. It's been a tough one, but I still see a lot of positives in a season like that, and I'm sure a season like that will help us to be better in the future.

“But we've got to do more, and a lot more, in order to fight for a championship which I hope will be for next year.”

Also asked about Elkann's comments, Hamilton insisted that Ferrari remain as united as ever.

“We've just been focused on doing our job back at the factory, so everyone's super-focused on improving,” the seven-time World Champion explained. “I speak to John every week. We have an amazing relationship. The passion has not disappeared from our team.

“We've obviously got a steep hill to climb, but we want to finish off strong this year.”

Hamilton also reiterated that he stands by his decision to join Ferrari, the Briton adding: “It was very difficult at some points during the year, but I feel like I've really surprised myself in terms of my resilience.

“I still feel very, very positive. I still feel very determined, very dedicated to the challenge we have, and I just really see that every challenge that we have is an opportunity to learn and grow.

“It has been the most challenging year and it's definitely not a year that I would ever dream of, especially in your first year at Ferrari, but we take the learnings from every single weekend and I really feel like we take the learnings from this year to grow on to something better in the future.

“I firmly believe in absolutely every single individual at the factory and here at the track who do an extraordinary job. Every week, they give it 100%, and that is all you can every ask of people. Of course, we've got to continue to – I'm committed to helping them rebuild and grow back to their winning ways.”

The telcom giant becomes the latest to shed thousands of staff, but also sets up a training program for employees it is handing pink slips to. 


							By 

	Erik Hayden


Executive Editor, Business


	If this is the year of publicly-traded companies signaling to Wall Street that they're going to do more with less, in preparation for an AI-driven economy, add Verizon to the list of giants cutting a substantial number of jobs in a pivot. 


	The company, newly led by former PayPal mogul Dan Schulman, said Thursday that it is reducing its workforce by 13,000 employees and cutting its outsourced and outside labor expenses. As of the end of Dec. 2024, Verizon had 99,600 full-time staffers, some 88 percent of them are based in the U.S.

	The cuts are not unusual: Amazon revealed it was slashing 14,000 jobs, Microsoft has exited 15,000 employees, Paramount's new ownership is cutting roughly 2,000 roles and many other blue-chip companies have seen a thousand-plus staffers cut this year. CEOs have implied that they're reshaping reshaping workforces to compete in the AI age — whether that's the reason for the timing of the cuts has been debated.


	One interesting detail in Verizon's Nov. 20 announcement is the unveiling of a $20 million program for those 13,000 cut employees in “reskilling” (i.e. retraining) the staffers that are being exited, in hopes of finding them new roles at other companies.


	“To help our people prepare for their future, we have established a $20 million Reskilling and Career Transition Fund for employees departing Verizon,” Schulman wrote in a public memo. “This fund will focus on skill development, digital training and job placement to help our people take their next steps. Verizon is the first company to set up a fund to specifically focus on the opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI. It is my intent to also work with other companies and the public sector to address the opportunities and challenges in a world where technology will impact all of us.”

	











	One employee that was recently exited at the telcom giant was CEO Hans Vestberg, who had led the company for eight years and was bumped from the role on Oct. 6. During Vestberg's tenure he effectively shuffled Verizon out of the media business, selling Yahoo and AOL to private equity giant Apollo for $5 billion. He'll stay on as an advisor through next October. 


	During Schulman's first earnings call as CEO on October 29, he candidly set expectations for a major shake-up. “When I look at our performance objectively, Verizon is clearly falling short of our potential,” the exec told analysts. 


	“For the past few years, our financial growth has relied too heavily on price increases, a strategic approach that relies too much on price without subscriber growth is not a sustainable strategy,” Schulman added. “This cannot continue, and there is no question that meaningful change is needed.”


	The new CEO thinks AI will reverse that trend. “I am a strong believer in the growing power and resulting opportunities created by AI,” he said on the call. “We have barely scratched the surface of how AI-powered innovation can transform our customer experience.

Siblings Noah and Jacobi Jupe, 20 and 12, share the screen together in ‘Hamnet', a drama about the Bard's own dramatic family tragedy


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Senior Entertainment Reporter


	When 3-year-old Jacobi Jupe visited his older brother, Noah, on the set of the 2017 movie Wonder, he was amazed by the spectacle of it all. He later turned to their mom and, in classic little sibling fashion, asked: “How do I do that? How do I do what Noah does?”


	“I didn't want to be that older brother that was like, ‘You should do it this way. This is what you need to learn.' I was there if Jacobi wanted to ask me questions,” says Noah of his brother entering his chosen profession. “I wanted to support him and just make sure that he was loved and cared for and protected in this crazy world.”

	Both Jupes grew up in London — along with a middle sister — in a household led by actress Katy Cavanagh and filmmaker Chris Jupe. Jacobi, now 12, has since appeared in Disney's Peter Pan & Wendy and the Billy Crystal Apple drama Before. Noah, 20, has starred in Paramount's A Quiet Place franchise and acted opposite the likes of Christian Bale and Natalie Portman. But with this month's awards frontrunner Hamnet (out Nov. 26), the brothers appear in the same project together for the first time.

	The film — based on Maggie O'Farrell's best-selling 2020 historical novel — explores the marriage of Agnes and William Shakespeare as they endure the death of their young son, a loss that supposedly inspired one of the Bard's most indelible works, Hamlet. Jacobi was the first Jupe cast in Hamnet, playing the titular Shakespearean son.

	











	“I was like, damn, it sounds really good,” says Noah of hearing about the drama that would see his little brother directed by Oscar winner Chloé Zhao and starring opposite Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley. “I was calling him and hearing all about it and maybe a tad jealous.”


	“Maybe a bit more than a tad,” interrupts Jacobi with a shy laugh.


	Filming had been underway across Wales and England, with the production erecting a scale replica of the Globe Theatre, circa 1600. But Zhao still needed to cast the actor who would play the thespian portraying Hamlet in the play within the movie.


	Noah was on set in Greece when he got a call from his mom. “She was like, ‘Crazy question, but how would you feel about playing Hamlet?' ” Zhao was on the line too, visibly excited by the possibility. The idea of Noah playing Hamlet — opposite Jacobi's Hamnet — brought an unexpected emotional symmetry to the film.


	Unbeknownst to everyone, Jacobi was listening in on the call through the wall of a production tent. Says Noah, “Jacobi is too good at finding stuff out.”


	Both brothers have been singled out by critics for their performances in the film, Jacobi for his scene-stealing death performance and Noah for his cathartic reading of Shakespeare's most famous soliloquies (“To be or not to be …”). And both Jupes describe sharing the screen as a “surreal” experience.

	











	“When you're watching yourself, you judge yourself a lot,” Noah explains. “But with my brother, I know every bit of his face, I know every emotion he's ever had, and yet there is no judgment.”


	As for what's next: Noah has A24's The Death of Robin Hood and the new season of The Night Manager. Jacobi has the adaptation of the horror thriller Victorian Psycho — and then, he petitions, “I would really love to do a comedy, please.”


	For now, the brothers are just enjoying the novelty of finally sharing a frame.

The viral track, which used AI to alter its vocals, is in the center of a legal firestorm over allegations that it used singer Jorja Smith's voice without permission.


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


	Even before its release to streaming services, “I Run,” a dance/EDM track by the artist HAVEN., was a viral sensation online, amassing millions of plays on TikTok after it was teased on Oct. 10. “I love this song so much,” said one TikTok commenter. “DROP THIS RIGHT NOW PLEASEEEE,” commented another.


	For HAVEN., a new artist project from British producers Harrison Walker and Jacob Donaghue, who also makes music under the name Waypoint, it was the kind of debut that could change the trajectory of their lives. But now, a swirl of legal complaints and takedown notices have engulfed the song, resulting in it being removed and reuploaded to streaming services multiple times — and stopping its momentum just as it was poised to reach the Billboard charts.


	The frenzy of activity around “I Run” prompted multiple A&Rs at major and independent music companies to look into signing the track and the people that created it as it awaited official release. It also caught the attention of the popular UK R&B singer Jorja Smith. The uncredited female vocalist on “I Run” sounded eerily similar to Smith, prompting the singer to to post a video of herself on TikTok using it. She asked in the caption: “who actually is this?” and noted in a reply to a comment “it's not meeeee” when fans asked if she sang on the track or if it was AI. (The video has since been deleted). Around that time, HAVEN. jumped in, adding #jorjasmith to a now-deleted social post about the song, according to a member of their team. “It was more so just embracing that it does sound like her,” a spokesperson for HAVEN. said. “It became an organic trend.”


	That's when questions started circulating about the origins of HAVEN.'s viral track — and whether or not it was an unauthorized AI deepfake of Smith's voice. Ultimately, the song was released in late October by Isekai Records, Broke Records and AAO Records, and it continued to amass major listenership — so much so that it quickly reached #11 on the U.S. Spotify chart and #25 on Spotify globally. Meanwhile videos using the song kept going viral on social media, including one in which the rapper Offset apparently played the song during a Boiler Room DJ set, with the video overlaid with text that said, “Unreleased Jorja Smith.” (The song was not actually used during Offset's recent Boiler Room set.)


	Just as the song was taking off, it was taken down from streaming services. The Orchard — to whom Smith is signed — as well as the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and International Federation of the Phonograph Industry (IFPI), issued dozens of takedown notices for “I Run” upon its official release, according to screenshots of the notices, alleging various issues with the song, including that the song “misrepresents” another artist and that it constitutes copyright infringement.


	As a result of the dispute, the song has also been withheld from the Billboard charts, including the Billboard Hot 100, on which some chart prognosticators had predicted it would debut this week. Billboard reserves the right to withhold or remove titles from appearing on the charts that are known to be involved in active legal disputes related to copyright infringement that may extend to the deletion of such content on digital service providers.


	Broke Records tells Billboard that it filed dozens of counter-notices, asserting HAVEN.'s ownership of the song and noting that no lawsuit has been filed against them to date in association with the song. (The Orchard declined to comment.)


	Donaghue and Walker maintain that they wrote and produced the song in ProTools, sharing screenshots and videos of the ProTools session files and stems with Billboard. They admit, however, that “AI-assisted vocal processing” was used to “transform solely [their] voice” in the song. Specifically, they say they used AI music generator Suno to turn Walker's voice into that of a woman's — without referencing Smith. According to Suno prompts shared with Billboard, the producers wrote into the model a prompt that included, among other requests, “soulful vocal samples” to get the voice they ultimately used on the song.


	“It's been such an honor to see the love and support for ‘I Run' these past few weeks,” HAVEN. said in a statement to Billboard. “What started as something fun and experimental between two producers and music-lovers ended up taking the internet by storm. I'm aware that AI has become part of that storm. It shouldn't be any secret that I used AI-assisted vocal processing to transform solely my voice for ‘I Run.' As a songwriter and producer I enjoy using new tools, techniques and staying on the cutting edge of what's happening. To set the record straight, the artists behind HAVEN. are real and human, and all we want to do is make great music for other humans.”


	Suno does not allow users to request specific artist or song names. But the company is currently in the midst of a blockbuster lawsuit with the three major music companies — Sony, Universal and Warner — over allegations of widespread copyright infringement of the majors' sound recordings during the AI training process. Given Smith is signed to The Orchard, a Sony Music-owned distributor, it is possible her sound recordings were used in Suno's training. According to the lawsuit and to AI music expert Ed Newton-Rex in an article for Music Business Worldwide, users can find savvy or accidental ways to prompt Suno into providing results that seem to contain recognizable pieces of intellectual property from artists like ABBA, James Brown, Michael Buble and more.


	The takedowns list a variety of reasons for the request for removal, according to emails obtained by Billboard, including one from Spotify that says, “We have received a complaint that your content infringes the sound recording rights of a third party. While this claim is under investigation, the content has been removed.” Another from Spotify says the content “violates exclusive rights.” A third reads, “Spotify may remove content that misrepresents a track as originating from or featuring an artist or that uses an artist's name in a misleading way.” One from TikTok also lists the reason why the track is muted as “it contains unauthorized copyrighted music.”


	“Sound recording copyrights are not going to protect her voice if the voice sounded like her. There would have to be a sample of her sound recordings,” says Theresa Weisenberger, lawyer and co-lead at BakerHostetler's AI practice, adding that voices are only protected by publicity rights — the legal right that varies state-to-state in the U.S. which protects one's name, image and likeness from exploitation. 


	Historically, these rights have been mostly limited to commercial contexts, like misleading endorsements. The singer Bette Midler once famously sued the Ford Motor Co. over ads featuring a Midler impersonator who was hired by the company. Amid the boom in AI and deepfakes, however, lawmakers in Tennessee passed a new law, called the ELVIS Act, to dramatically expand the right to stop voice cloning in any context. And federally, lawmakers are currently considering a similar law, the NO FAKES Act, that would do the same thing nationally.


	“I think this ought to be a wake up call for people to look at the status of the NO FAKES Act and to deal with how long it will take to get that moving and into a national uniform law,” adds Kenneth Anderson, an attorney at Rimon Law who recently advised his client, Ben Folds, though a deepfake situation. “We have a problem that is rapidly overtaking the music industry. It's rampant and it's increasing.”


	To fight the takedowns, HAVEN.'s labels started reuploading the song over and over, leading to a seemingly endless game of whack-a-mole for both sides. The impact on “I Run” became even more pronounced when the song did not appear on The Official Charts in the U.K. or the Billboard charts.


	“Once that counter notice is filed and then a lawsuit is not filed, a platform is free to put the song back up if they want to,” explains Weisenberger. “But the fact that platforms aren't doing that might speak to the PR issue this song causes.”


	For Broke, an indie record label founded in 2023, “I Run” was gearing up to be their (and HAVEN.'s) biggest hit yet, and its founders tell Billboard they feel the song is being discriminated against by bigger industry players. “HAVEN., an independent producer-songwriter who created a global breakout hit on his own, is the one being fully de-platformed through a sophisticated campaign by a major label,” the label said in a statement to Billboard. “It is difficult to imagine this recording, if released by a major label, being treated in the same way as HAVEN.”


	The song has become a lightning rod for conversations around generative AI use in the creation of popular music. To date, some music streaming services still do not have AI-specific policies in place, and those that do, like Deezer and SoundCloud, tend to only penalize fully AI-generated works, not something like “I Run,” which contains significant human input. As Billboard reported in 2023, however, an increasing number of platforms have broadened the ability of rightholders to issue takedowns when publicity rights — the right to one's name image likeness and voice — are violated, due to the rise of AI-generated deepfakes. This is done on a voluntary basis and is not required by law.


	Spotify added to these publicity rights protections just last month when it announced that it was strengthening its policies against negative uses of AI. This included increased protections around impersonation, and according to a source close to the situation, the platform's impersonation rules did come into play with the takedowns for HAVEN.'s track specifically. The source adds that Spotify tends to side with the party that feels they have been deepfaked. (Spotify declined to comment.)


	Now, HAVEN. is gearing up to release a re-recording of the song, featuring the vocals of a singer named Kaitlin Aragon. She was discovered by the team after posting a TikTok video, covering “I Run” which sounds fairly similar to the original. The hope is, for HAVEN.'s team, that they can recapture the same buzz as they achieved with the last version of the song and restart HAVEN.'s career — but this time, with human vocals.

					By Peter White 

Executive Editor, Television


Tim Robinson, a master of weird and wonder worlds, is set for another conspiratorial adventure after HBO renewed The Chair Company for a second season.


	The move comes ahead of the show's finale on November 30 and is one of two comedy series renewals after the WBD network also picked up I Love LA for a second season.


	The series became HBO's most-watched comedy series debut in over five years, since the launch of Avenue 5, the Armando Iannucci-created series that launched in 2020. The Chair Company averaged 1.4M cross-platform viewers in the U.S. across its first three days after its premiere.

	











The Chair Company, which was created by I Think You Should Leave's Robinson and Zach Kanin, ostensibly follows Robinson's William Ronald Trosper, a project manager at a property development firm who becomes obsessed with uncovering an apparent conspiracy involving a chair manufacturing company. It is, however, even weirder than that sounds, as Trosper ends up in dark parking lots, bars and apparent acting classes searching for the people behind chair brand Tecca.

	Lake Bell stars as Trosper's wife Barb with his children played by Sophia Lillis and Will Price. Joseph Tudisco stars as Mike Santini, a security guard who helps Trosper search down the conspiracy. Lou Diamond Phillips recurs as Jeff Levjman, CEO of Trosper's company Fisher Robay.

	











	It's not clear whether season two will continue the Tecca chair conspiracy or a new conspiracy. Given SNL alum Robinson's predilection for unusual project, it could be anything.


The Chair Company is executive produced by Robinson and Kanin, Adam McKay and Todd Schulman for HyperObject Industries, Andrew DeYoung, and Igor Srubshchik.

The Duchess has arrived.

Meghan Markle's staff announces the royal before she enters a room — even if there are only two guests.

During an interview with Harper's Bazaar, writer Kaitlyn Greenidge said she and the Duchess of Sussex entered a New York City “grand” brownstone that belonged to one of Markle's friends.

“When I enter, the house manager announces, ‘Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,' even though we appear to be the only other two people in the house,” Greenidge wrote.

Elsewhere in the interview, Greenidge also said that someone announced Markle when she arrived at the La Brea Tar Pits, an active fossil-dig site and natural-history museum in Los Angeles, to meet with a group of girls from a local STEM school.

“A golf cart pulls up, the gravel crunching beneath its tires. ‘The Duchess of Sussex,' someone in the scrum announces,” Greenidge wrote.

“Meghan descends, dressed in wide-leg trousers, a silk blouse, and a small pair of pavé-diamond studs by the Ukrainian brand Guzema,” she added.

“They were a gift from her husband, Prince Harry, picked up on a recent trip to Kyiv with his Invictus Games Foundation.”

Elsewhere in the interview, Markle opened up about giving herself “grace” when it comes to mistakes.

“You learn not to do it again,” she shared. “If it all goes swimmingly, you don't learn from it. If you don't learn anything, you're not going to grow.”

Harry, 41, and Markle, 44, tied the knot in May 2018 and quit their royal duties two years later.

The couple, who have welcomed son Prince Archie, 6, and daughter Princess Lilibet, 4, now reside in a $14 million mansion in Montecito, Calif.

Though Markle and the Duke of Sussex left the royal family, they and their children were allowed to keep their titles.

In a March interview with People, the “Suits” alum said the Sussex name held a deeper significance since she became a mother.

“I love that that is something that Archie, Lili, [Harry] and I all have together. It means a lot to me,” she said of her family.

“I think as the kids get older, they're so excited about, ‘Oh my gosh, Mama and Papa, how did you meet?'” Markle continued. 

“I think that will come with time as they get older, but for right now a huge part of our love story is that we share the name Sussex.”

Cardi B gave birth to a baby boy on November 4. He is her fourth child and first with her boyfriend, Stefon Diggs, who is a wide receiver for the New England Patriots.

To commemorate the experience, the rapper turned to Mommy Made Encapsulation for their Umbilical Cord Keepsake.

The one-of-a-kind item is exactly what it sounds like: a keepsake made from the detached piece of an umbilical cord.

According to the company's website, it is “your baby's umbilical cord dehydrated in the shape of a heart, and then dipped in gold chrome.”

The stylized and preserved umbilical cord is relatively affordable at just $50. However, it is an add-on to the company's pricey $500 Placenta Encapsulation Service, which converts the temporary gestational organ into pill form to be ingested post-partum.

The 33-year-old also opted for a Placenta Print ($65); the shape is meant to evoke the Tree of Life.

The company posted a graphic video on Instagram that demonstrated how the umbilical cord is fed with a metal wire for shaping and then dehydrated for preservation. Commenters were still confused.

“It's giving… umbilical pretzel,” shared one. “This is so gross & so warming all at the same time! Love this 🔥🔥,” noted another.

The brand also shared a video of Cardi B's placenta, dyed blue, before being processed.

Summarizing the mixed sentiments, another Instagram fan wrote, “I'm all for memories, but keeping my babies fried, dyed, and dried umbilical cord is not one of them.”

The singer used Mommy Made for at least her third child, Blossom Belle Cephus, as the brand posted images of the 2024 procedure to their Instagram feed last year.

Cardi B is not the only famous parent who has used this service. The company shared that they had completed the same procedures for Megan Fox and  Vanessa Hudgens.

Cardi sparked engagement rumors when a diamond ring was spotted on her left hand in some of the images that she shared of the new baby.

She has yet to comment on her current relationship status with Diggs.

But, in the meantime, she has a new piece of gold jewelry — made from her baby's umbilical cord — that she can wear on repeat.

Kevin Jonas is setting the record straight on why viewers won't see him competing for the Mirrorball trophy anytime soon. The Jonas Brothers singer opened up in a new interview with InStyle about repeatedly passing on “Dancing With the Stars,” despite being invited almost every season for two decades. According to Kevin, he appreciates the offer every time, but joining the ballroom simply “isn't for me,” even though he still considers himself a “huge fan” of the ABC series.

Kevin said he and his family continue to watch the show regularly, noting that season 34 has been especially strong. While he won't be putting on dance shoes himself, he has favorites in the competition. Nick Jonas is rooting for Robert Irwin, while Kevin is pulling for Dylan Efron. He also teased that fans may hear Jonas Brothers music during the semifinals and finale, hinting that one of their songs is expected to be used in the upcoming episodes.

During the InStyle interview, Nick teased his brother about how often he gets asked to join the show, saying Kevin has been invited “pretty much every season for the last 20 years.” Kevin confirmed that the producers reach out often, but competing simply doesn't feel like the right fit. Even so, he praised the cast and performers this year, adding that ‘Dancing With the Stars' “is really back.”

Kevin's focus right now is on family, music and acting projects, which he says keep his schedule full. That includes promoting the Jonas Brothers' latest project, the holiday film “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie”, which features cameos from nearly the entire Jonas family. Kevin's wife, Danielle Jonas, and their daughters Alena and Valentina appear in the movie, along with Nick's wife Priyanka Chopra Jonas and their daughter Malti Marie. Kevin said having everyone together on set helped “set the tone” for the film and made the project feel meaningful from the start.

Alongside explaining why DWTS isn't for him, Kevin Jonas also opened up about the Jonas Brothers' new film “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie.” Nick Jonas told Deadline that the idea for a holiday movie first came up 15 years ago during their “Camp Rock” era, and the concept resurfaced while discussing “Camp Rock 3,” eventually leading Disney to green-light the project. 

The film follows Nick, Kevin and Joe as fictional versions of themselves who get stranded in Europe before Christmas after an encounter with a Santa look-alike played by Jesse Tyler Ferguson, forcing them to reconnect and work through old tensions to make it home.

The movie features cameos from Will Ferrell, Randall Park, Billie Lourd and KJ Apa, along with several Jonas family members. Joe also stars opposite Chloe Bennet, which led to an awkward first day on set when he filmed a kissing scene in front of his real family. The holiday film includes original music crafted with songwriter Justin Tranter and serves as a nostalgic return to the brothers' Disney roots ahead of the upcoming “Camp Rock 3.” 

“A Very Jonas Christmas Movie” is now streaming on Disney+.

In the case of Max Greenfield, you will like him when he's angry. No, the former “New Girl” and current “Neighborhood” star isn't joining the MCU as our latest (and undoubtedly most) Incredible Hulk, but in “A Man on the Inside” Season 2, he does play an academic forging a financially advantageous partnership with a rich, goateed jackass. And, more to the point, he's really, really funny. 

Greenfield plays Jack Beringer, the president of Wheeler College and a gleeful narcissist whose smug sense of superiority is so secure he doesn't even wait around for affirmation. Jack will backdoor-brag about his surgically enhanced calves or boast about a farcical flirtation with a celebrity seated next to him on a flight, then flee (or cease paying attention) before anyone has time to congratulate him (or cut him down a peg).

So it's striking whenever he slows down, as he does after a masked assailant plasters him with a bucket of mud. The public incident (on a stage, during his speech) sends Jack spiraling, and he directs his ire at the man hired to protect him: Charles Nieuwendyk (Ted Danson). “What if it's not mud next time?” Jack says, staring a hole through Charles' thick black spectacles. “What if it's… poo?!”

 










Between each rhetorical question, Greenfield punctuates Jack's silly worst-case scenario by stepping closer to Charles. But he doesn't break eye contact. He doesn't even blink. And when he drops the punchline, he pumps his eyebrows ever so slightly on the word “poo.” There's no questioning how serious Jack takes the situation, just as there's no doubting how unserious the situation actually is. That's the fun of the scene, magnified by Greenfield's concocted whirlwind coming to a full and sudden stop in order to deliver what, in his mind, is a frightening revelation, but to everyone else reads as an absurdly oblivious poop joke. It's wonderful. I love it. And I'll cherish it as long as my diminishing memory allows. 

But despite the four paragraphs I've dedicated to Greenfield's hysterical line reading, his is a small moment in “A Man on the Inside” Season 2, and Jack is a small character — not just small-minded, but short on screen time. He's not the main reason to watch Michael Schur's sweet, sly Netflix sitcom, but he does illustrate its excellence. Self-aware, adaptable, and smart, the series is the exact opposite of Jack Beringer, highlighted by the fact it knows exactly who Jack Beringer is and how to draw out the best of him. 

The mere fact that Season 2 makes time for Greenfield to max out speaks to its astute understanding of what makes for a great sitcom: Sometimes, like in Season 1, it's a combination of bright jokes and poignant humanity. Sometimes, like in Season 2, it's evolving without forgetting about the little flourishes that last in an audience's mind, endearing them not only to the ensemble, but to the show around them. 

 










In a season without the melancholic emotional core of its predecessor — when Charles was processing the loss of his wife — “A Man on the Inside” inhabits the same compassionate, curious, and chucklesome space as before, while fitting a new case, a new cast, and a new romance into Charles' evolving spy story. That it's premiering 364 days after the first season is another not-so-small blessing. (Thank you, veteran TV producers.) 

Season 2 picks up with Charles' first enticing assignment in some time. Wheeler College needs help. Admissions are down, expenses are up, and federal aid is all but non-existent. (Sound familiar?) For a quick fix, Jack turned to America's favorite lifeline — billionaires — and found Brad Vinick (Gary Cole): a Wheeler alumnus worth more than $6 billion who agreed to donate $400 million to his old stomping grounds.

“Agreed” is the key word there, because he hasn't handed over the dough just yet, and the administration has good reason to worry he won't: Someone stole Jack's laptop and is threatening to expose all his secrets if Wheeler accepts Brad's “blood money.” Fearing any knowledge of the scandal would scare off Vinick, Jack hires Charles and his boss, Julie (Lilah Richcreek), to find the laptop, identify the thief, and save Wheeler College. 

 










Simple enough, right? Once again, “A Man on the Inside” relies on a rather straightforward mystery to support its higher priorities: comedy, chemistry, and (light) social commentary. That may irk genre fans looking to do some serious sleuthing (from the safe remove of their living room sofa), but there are plenty of shows to scratch that itch, and far fewer that deftly balance so many characters and tones while still getting a well-earned laugh from a well-placed “poo.” 

To get as close as he can to the staff (all of whom are suspects), Charles joins Wheeler as a guest lecturer — a cover story so perfect he doesn't even need a fake name, since he used to teach engineering at a different university (and, as he may have mentioned, wrote a book on the subject). Instead, his mission grows complicated for personal reasons. Like a small-town freshman who can't navigate his huge new college campus, Professor Nieuwendyk misses most of his (fake) classes to spend time with Mona Margadoff (Mary Steenburgen), a music theory instructor whose impulsive spirit proves irresistible to the ever-sensible egghead. 

Danson and Steenburgen, whose offscreen marriage has inspired regular swooning over the last 30 years, are fantastic together. At times, it feels like the comic-mystery series has shifted into full rom-com mode, as Schur gives them plenty of scenes to flirt and fool around (in a joking sense, although when Mona poses as a nude model, the prim Charles flies into a hilarious fit of excessive modesty). Their relationship manages to give us exactly what we want while packing in a few savvy surprises — and pushing Charles forward. He's dating again! That's a big deal! (But that's not all his arc with Mona is out to accomplish.) 

 










Season 2 doesn't go off without a hitch. Trying to replicate Charles' uniquely moving emotional arc from Season 1 would've been a fool's errand, but Season 2 still feels emptier without comparable soul-searching. (Julie reconnecting with her ex-con mom ventures into similar territory, but its a B- or even C-plot and can't reach the same sentimental register). Also, balancing a cast as extraordinary and expansive as this is always going to be impossible, and with time at a premium in 30-minute sitcoms, a few favorites go neglected. (David Strathairn, as an English professor with an unshakable grudge against Charles, is a lovely, yet underserved, curmudgeon.)

But you'll always want more time with the people you love, and “A Man on the Inside” knows that well enough to make peace with it. Season 2 is solid on its own, and even better at proving the series' sustainability. Future editions can keep the friends and family who prove important to Charles (Stephen McKinley Henderson's Calbert and more Pacific View retirees return!) while continuing to expand his second career through new cases. At the same time, it keeps the door open for what those cases might be, who may be involved in working them, and who may be called in to flesh out Charles' personal life. 

With Danson on “the Inside” and Schur the “Man” behind the scenes, their series is a guaranteed good time. What makes it simultaneously rewarding and exciting is seeing how hard they work to make it more than that. Neither rests on their laurels (as Sam Malone and the creator of “Parks and Rec” certainly could), instead endeavoring to bring out the best in each other and those around them — whether that means casting their offscreen partner of 30 years as a crush-worthy onscreen girlfriend, or finding room for a brilliant supporting actor to get good and angry, it's a winning formula. 

 










“A Man on the Inside” Season 2 premieres Thursday, November 20 on Netflix. All eight episodes will be released at once.

	On Wednesday, Fox News Media announced in a splashy rollout that its religious vertical, Fox Faith, was expanding. 


	As part of a new tentpole project, the network is launching The Life of Jesus Podcast, a 52-episode series that will guide listeners “through the life, teachings, and miracles of Jesus Christ.” Hosted by Fox & Friends star Ainsley Earhardt, the press release boasted that more than 100 notable actors were signed on, including megastar Kristen Bell as the voice of Mary Magdalene. 


	But that was news to Bell, who was blindsided by the announcement as she had recorded the audio for a separate project 15 years ago. Her rep tells Rolling Stone that she only learned that Fox Faith had acquired the long-forgotten project and was spinning it into a brand-new podcast when her team received a request for her to appear on Fox & Friends a day before the announcement was blasted out. The rep adds that Bell never gave permission for the old audiobook to be repurposed into a new podcast series. 

	











	Originally, Bell voiced Mary Magdalene for The Truth and Life Dramatized Audio Bible, a New Testament audiobook released in 2010. A producer tied to the Bible audiobook has since partnered with Gulfstream Studios, which is licensing The Life of Jesus Podcast to Fox Faith, according to publicly available information. 


	What's more, the audio Bible includes the same celebrity names that are now being touted in Fox's press release, including Brian Cox, Sean Astin, Neal McDonough, Malcolm McDowell, John Rhys-Davies, and Julia Ormond. While some of the actors have been open about their Christian faith, Cox, who is voicing the role of God, has previously called Fox News “the devil.” A rep for Rhys-Davies also confirms to Rolling Stone that the actor only learned of the “repurposed” project earlier this week. (Rolling Stone has reached out to the other stars involved for further comment.)

	The network seems to have taken the 15-year-old, 23-hour audiobook and retooled it into a multipart podcast series, with the new additions coming from Earhardt. In a note obtained by Rolling Stone, a producer associated with the podcast has asked at least one celebrity star to “not mention that this audio New Testament Bible was produced years ago, we'd like it to feel like something that was produced more recently.” (Rolling Stone has reached out to Fox News Media for comment.) 


	The first batch of episodes for The Life of Jesus Podcast will air on Nov. 30.

		Karol says the responsibility of representing her community is “heavy” but adds, “I'm ready.”	








							By 

	Julyssa Lopez




D
espite the many peaks in Karol G's career since she broke out of the music scene in Medellín (where she began performing as a teenager and playing the quinceañera circuit with fellow locals like J Balvin), the 34-year-old singer still exudes a near-breathless incredulity when describing a few of the milestones she hit this year. “I've done legendary stages that never in my life I imagined I'd perform in, like the Vatican or Crazy Horse or at Victoria's Secret,” she says, every word vibrating with glee.


	Those moments — Karol duetting with Andrea Bocelli in St. Peter's Square or taking over the legendary Parisian cabaret — were all in some way or another the result of Tropicoqueta, the gamble of an album she released in June. It wasn't typical of Karol's albums, which have toggled between happy-go-lucky party queen and tough-talking bad bitch while launching reggaeton hit after reggaeton hit. Tropicoqueta was a deeper excavation of her roots in Colombia. She tried out traditional rhythms like folksy vallenato and ballads about profound heartbreak with Eighties legends like Mexican singer Marco Antonio Solís. “Songs like ‘Coleccionando Heridas' and ‘Ese Hombre Es Malo' remind me of the music that I used to listen to when I was in school,” she says. “I wanted this album to get to those feelings and that nostalgia.”

	











	Some people didn't get it — and still don't. Tropicoqueta was easily her most polarizing project, one that didn't fit into the commercial objectives that preceded it. She remembers just how intense the early reactions were: “‘I love the album, it's crazy.' ‘I hate the album.' ‘It's so special.' ‘The album is just garbage,'” she recounts. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But once she started focusing on her original intentions — how she wanted to celebrate the novelty dances at family parties called La Hora Loca, and to shout out her tias who used to dance in the kitchen — she saw how emotionally the project landed for so many people. On TikTok, girls posted videos singing the songs with their grandmothers; others proudly did choreography to the anthem “Papasito.” She wasn't just representing where she comes from, but also inspiring pride and encouraging fans to embrace their Latinidad. “I went back to my memories of being on tour,“ she says, “people bringing their flags in every single concert, flags from Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and me feeling that I was bringing a piece of home to every place I went.”

	That sense of joy and self-identity felt even more necessary in 2025, when immigration crackdowns and anti-Latino rhetoric pervaded the culture. Karol has been outspoken about what she's seen in the political arena, issuing a statement on her Instagram amid the ICE protests that swept the U.S. over the summer. How did it feel to shine a light on a community that was engulfed in so much ugliness? She pauses for a second. “Oh, that question made me a little emotional,” she confesses. “This year, I knew a lot of people that started feeling ashamed or shy to show that they were Latinos, and that was super hard to watch.… It felt so hard on my heart.”


	In a lot of ways, Karol has always understood the responsibility of being seen as a beacon for fans. Sure, she's known for her bubbly disposition, but there's a grit to her that's come from clawing her way through an unforgiving, male-dominated industry. It's part of the reason she wanted to dive into nonprofit work with her foundation, Con Cora, which supports women and girls in Latin America who have come from vulnerable or abusive backgrounds. Karol rebuilt her childhood school in Medellín in 2024, with the idea of creating a safe space. She understands that need intimately: Earlier this year, she released a Netflix documentary in which she tearfully recounted being harassed at just 16 by a former, much-older manager. “I can do 105 documentaries and a thousand interviews, and nobody is going to understand how hard it was to be a woman in a room with a lot of people with so much power that can make you feel really small,” she explains.

	So much of this year taught her to believe in herself, and it's ended on a high: Last week, Karol took home the award for Song of the Year at the 2025 Latin Grammys, winning for her chart-topping hit “Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido.” She used the opportunity to encourage anyone else who might be too afraid of criticism to chase his or her dreams. “There are so many people at home who think they're not good enough or professional enough to do what they want,” she said onstage, holding the trophy. ”Forget the world, forget the noise… Love and passion over talent, and passion and obsession for what you do.”

	And there's more left to do. Currently, Karol is developing a visual album version of Tropicoqueta, which she expects to come out in December. “I've been working on it since March, recording in different places around the world where it's kind of a movie,” she says. Then, in 2026, she'll become the first Latina to headline Coachella, another spotlight that will give thousands of people a chance to be seen. Karol admits that at first, she had some trepidation about accepting the offer. “When I got the call, I was like, ‘Am I ready?'” she remembers. “And then I was like, ‘Yeah. I really need to do this.'” She's been rehearsing the show since the beginning of the year, working on choreography done by Parris Goebel, who also had a hand in Lady Gaga's Coachella set.


	It's not lost on her what this next stage of her career means. “Feeling the responsibility of representing my community, it's heavy,” she admits. “But I feel like I'm ready.”

Ukrainian president's office issues statement after other officials condemn ‘absurd' plan to end conflict

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has said he will negotiate with Donald Trump on a US-backed peace plan that called on Kyiv to make painful concessions in order to end the Kremlin's invasion of his country.

Zelenskyy's office on Thursday confirmed that he had received the draft peace plan, which was prepared by US and Russian officials, and that he would speak with Trump in the coming days about “existing diplomatic opportunities and the main points that are necessary for peace”.

“We agreed to work on the points of the plan so that it would bring a worthy end to the war,” Zelenskyy's office said in a statement.

The cautious response from Ukraine's presidential administration followed angry denouncements of the plan by some Ukrainian officials who called it “absurd” and unacceptable. Zelenskyy's public statement came as he held talks on Thursday with a high-ranking US army delegation.

Other officials in Kyiv said the proposal reportedly drafted by Kirill Dmitriev, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, and Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff was a “provocation”, the aim of which was to stir up division and “disorientate” Ukraine's allies, they added.

“There are currently no signs that the Kremlin is ready for serious negotiations. Putin is trying to stall for time and avoid US sanctions,” said Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of Ukraine's foreign policy parliamentary committee. He dismissed Dmitriev as a “nobody”.

Ukraine's first deputy foreign minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, called the initiative unrealistic. He suggested it was a classic Soviet-style information operation to influence opinion and sow panic.

According to media reports, the sweeping 28-point proposal closely resembles demands made by Moscow soon after its full-scale invasion in early 2022. It was reportedly drawn up by Russian and US officials, with support from Donald Trump. Kyiv was not consulted. One European diplomat said they only learned of the plan when they turned on the news.

It envisages Ukraine giving up the northern part of the Donbas region, which it controls, to Russia, and cutting the size of its army in half. Ukraine would also be forced to relinquish its long-range weapons, used to strike military targets inside Russia.

No foreign troops would be allowed on Ukrainian soil, a condition that rules out a post-deal peacekeeping force led by the UK and France. But the US would provide unspecified security guarantees, according to Axios.

The Russian language and Russian Orthodox church would be given formal status under longstanding Kremlin demands.

Ukrainian officials said the document amounted to Ukraine's capitulation and an effective end to its sovereignty. It comes nearly four years after Russian troops tried, and failed, to seize Kyiv, and as efforts by the Trump administration to end the conflict remain stalled.

On Thursday, Zelenskyy met the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, whom Trump named last week as a “special representative”. Driscoll is on a fact-finding mission to Kyiv, with a brief to examine the war and Ukrainian drone production. It is unclear if the talks included the US's draft plan.

Keith Kellogg, Trump's special representative to Ukraine, has reportedly announced his resignation, saying he would leave in January after a year in the post. Kellogg is regarded as being broadly sympathetic to Ukraine and has been consequently left out of direct US-Russian talks.

The White House's renewed push to force Ukraine to make significant concessions in pursuit of “peace” comes at a difficult time for Zelenskyy, who is embroiled in the biggest political scandal since he became president in 2019.

His former business partner Timur Mindich and at least two government ministers are accused of involvement in a large-scale bribery scheme. Several deputies from Zelenskyy's own Servant of the People party have called on the president to dismiss Andriy Yermak, his powerful chief of staff.

One western diplomat said the Russians were seeking to take advantage of Ukraine's domestic crisis. “It seems Dmitriev has spun this plan at a time when Zelenskyy is weak. The Russians are good at exploiting things,” they said. “It feels like every other Russian plan. I don't think it's going to fly with Ukraine.”

The diplomat said the Kremlin's demands concerning the Russian language were a “hook” it could later exploit. The proposal did not offer the kind of security assurances Ukraine would need from the US and its European allies for any deal to stick, they added.

European leaders meeting in Brussels said they had not been warned in advance about the latest White House initiative. The Trump administration no longer provided direct military aid to Kyiv, a fact that reduced its ability to impose a Moscow-friendly peace settlement on Ukraine, one source noted.

“We commend peace efforts, but Europe is the main supporter of Ukraine and it's, of course, Europe's security that's at stake. So we expect to be consulted,” said Poland's foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski.

The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said Europe welcomed any efforts to achieve a long-lasting and just settlement of the war, but stressed: “For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.”

Kallas said the Dmitriev-Witkoff proposal did not envisage Russia making any concessions. “We have to understand that in this war, there is one aggressor and one victim. If Russia really wanted peace, it could have agreed to an unconditional ceasefire already some time ago.”

The British government said it backed Trump's desire to “bring this barbaric war to an end”. But it emphasised that “only the Ukrainian people can determine their future” and said Russia could end the fighting tomorrow by pulling out troops and ending its “illegal invasion”.

The White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, declined to comment on the peace plan. “I would agree that that's an issue which the president has continued to put at the forefront of our foreign policy goal, which is to reach a settlement in the Ukraine-Russia war, so that we can have peace in Europe and we can end the killing and the slaughter of so many innocents,” he said.

US efforts to broker peace have hit roadblocks since Trump met Putin in Alaska in August. The US president subsequently imposed sanctions on Russia's oil industry, in an apparent attempt to push Putin to the negotiating table.

Trump said last month that he was putting on hold his plan for a meeting with the Russian president in Budapest because he didn't want it to be a “waste of time”. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, met in Ankara, saying they were committed to finding a peaceful settlement.

In recent months Russia has increased its systematic attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, plunging much of the country into darkness. On Wednesday it bombed several western cities, including Ternopil, where 26 people, including three children, were killed in their homes.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

WASHINGTON (AP) — They gathered at the Washington National Cathedral on Thursday — former presidents, vice presidents, sworn political foes and newfound friends — in a show of respect and remembrance for Dick Cheney, the consequential and polarizing vice president who became an acidic scold of President Donald Trump.

Trump, who has been publicly silent about Cheney's death Nov. 3, was not invited to the memorial service.

Two ex-presidents came: Republican George W. Bush, who eulogized the man who served him as vice president, and Democrat Joe Biden, who once called Cheney “the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American history” but now honors his commitment to his family and to his values.

“Solid and rare and reliable,” Bush said at the service of his vice president, praising a man whose “talent and restraint” exceeded his ego. “Smart and polished, without airs.”

Bush and others noted the understated demeanor of a man who nevertheless wielded great influence in government. “Above all,” Bush said, “I wanted someone with the ability to step into the presidency without getting distracted by the ambition to seek it.”

Among the eulogists, Liz Cheney, the eldest daughter, only obliquely addressed what amounted to a father-daughter feud with the president — a man her dad had called a “coward” for trying to overturn his loss in the 2020 election.




She spoke of her father's conviction that when confronted with a choice between defending the country and a political party, the country must come first. “Bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she said.

Liz Cheney is a former high-ranking House member whose Republican political career was shredded by a MAGA movement angered by her investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Thursday, she chose not to speak directly of Trump.

She spoke of seeing clouds in the shape of angels just before her father died.

Moments before the service began, figures of recent but now receded power mingled: Bush and Biden and their wives sitting in a row together, former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris and Mike Pence chatting side by side in their pew with Al Gore and Dan Quayle together behind them. 

Biden greeted Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former longtime Senate leader, and his wife, former labor and transportation secretary Elaine Chao. Behind them sat Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who spent time talking with another former House speaker, Republican John Boehner. All gathered among the soaring interior columns of the grand cathedral known as “a spiritual home for the nation.”

Others delivering tributes at Thursday's funeral were Cheney's longtime cardiologist, Dr. Jonathan Reiner; former NBC News correspondent Pete Williams, who was Cheney's spokesman at the Pentagon; and several of the former vice president's grandchildren. 

“I'm happy to report that I haven't given many eulogies,” Reiner said in his remarks. “Nobody wants a doctor who is great at funerals.” 

Reiner recalled doctors telling Cheney decades ago, after the first of multiple heart attacks, that he should abandon his political ambitions then. Yet he kept winning elections as a Wyoming congressman for years after that.

Cheney, he said, was always the “calmest person in the room.”

Cheney had lived with heart disease for decades and, after the Bush administration, with a heart transplant. He died at age 84 from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said.

Trump's vice president, JD Vance, on stage at another event in the morning, was asked about Cheney and said: “Obviously there's some political disagreements there but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.”

Vance was also not invited to the funeral, according to a person familiar with the details who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The White House lowered its flags to half-staff after Cheney's death, as it said the law calls for, but Trump did not issue the presidential proclamation that often accompanies the death of notable figures, nor has he commented publicly on his passing.

The deeply conservative Cheney's influence in the Bush administration was legendary and, to his critics, tragic.

He advocated for the U.S. invasion of Iraq on the basis of what proved to be faulty intelligence and consistently defended the extraordinary tools of surveillance, detention and inquisition employed in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Bush credited him with helping to keep the country safe and stable in a perilous time.

After the 2020 election won by Biden, Liz Cheney served as vice chair of the Democratic-led special House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. She accused Trump of summoning the violent mob and plunging the nation into “a moment of maximum danger.”

For that, she was stripped of her Republican leadership position and ultimately defeated in a 2022 Republican primary in Wyoming. In a campaign TV ad made for his daughter, Dick Cheney branded Trump a “coward” who “tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.”

Last year, it did not sit well with Trump when Cheney said he would vote for the Democrat, Harris, in the presidential election.

Trump told Arab and Muslim voters that Dick Cheney's support for Harris should give them pause, because he “killed more Arabs than any human being on Earth. He pushed Bush, and they went into the Middle East.”

Emerging imaging spatial transcriptomics (iST) platforms and coupled analytical methods can recover cell-to-cell interactions, groups of spatially covarying genes, and gene signatures associated with pathological features, and are thus particularly well-suited for applications in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues. Here, we benchmark the performance of three commercial iST platforms—10X Xenium, Vizgen MERSCOPE, and Nanostring CosMx—on serial sections from tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 17 tumor and 16 normal tissue types for both relative technical and biological performance. On matched genes, we find that Xenium consistently generates higher transcript counts per gene without sacrificing specificity. Xenium and CosMx measure RNA transcripts in concordance with orthogonal single-cell transcriptomics. All three platforms can perform spatially resolved cell typing with varying degrees of sub-clustering capabilities, with Xenium and CosMx finding slightly more clusters than MERSCOPE, albeit with different false discovery rates and cell segmentation error frequencies. Taken together, our analyses provide a comprehensive benchmark to guide the choice of iST method as researchers design studies with precious samples in this rapidly evolving field.

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) tools measure the gene expression profiles of tissues or cells in situ. These approaches overcome the limitations of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods by negating the need for cell dissociation, thus maintaining both local and global spatial relationships between cells within a tissue. ST can recover cell-cell interactions, groups of spatially covarying genes, groups of cells predictive of cancer survival, and gene signatures associated with pathological features1,2. These advantages, coupled with rapidly emerging computational and analytical methods, have led to substantial excitement about deploying these platforms in fundamental biology studies and in the clinic for research and diagnostic purposes3,4,5.

ST tools can be split into two broad categories: sequencing (sST) and imaging (iST) based modalities. sST methods tag transcripts with an oligonucleotide address indicating spatial location, most commonly by placing tissue slices on a barcoded substrate; isolating tagged mRNA for next-generation sequencing; and computationally mapping transcript identities to locations6. In contrast, iST methods most commonly use variations of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) where mRNA molecules are tagged with hybridization probes, which are detected in a combinatorial manner over multiple rounds of staining with fluorescent reporters, imaging, and de-staining (Fig. 1a)7. Computational reconstruction then yields maps of transcript identity with single-molecule resolution. Compared to sST methods, iST methods are targeted to subsets of the transcriptome due to their reliance on pre-defined gene panels and they adopt the higher spatial resolution and sensitivity of FISH, yielding single-cell resolution data8.

a Overall approach for generating iST data. b Different amplification approaches for Xenium, MERSCOPE, and CosMx. c Overview of the tissue types and numbers of cores used in this study. BlC bladder cancer, BrC breast cancer, CRC colorectal cancer, HNSCC head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Mel Melanoma, NSCLC non-small cell lung cancer, OvC ovarian cancer, SCC squamous cell carcinoma. d DAPI images from the Xenium run of each TMA, including Tumor TMA 1(tTMA1), Tumor TMA 2(tTMA2), and Normal TMA(nTMA).

While the iST methods share some similarities, significant differences arise in primary signal detection and amplification, sample processing, and the subsequent fluorescent cycling chemistry (Fig. 1b)9,10,11. The need for amplification of signal is coupled to the sample processing, namely whether the sample is cleared, gel-embedded, or photobleached to quench autofluorescence. There are tradeoffs due to differences in sample processing for each iST method. For example, clearing of the sample increases signal quality but can prevent follow-up H&E staining and complicate immunostaining, which, in turn, can make cell segmentation more challenging. Finally, there are tradeoffs between imaging time, molecular plex, and imaging area covered, which result from the particular combination of the molecular protocol and the imaging hardware implementation12.

A key historic limitation in the widespread use of iST methods with human clinical samples was the incompatibility of most methods with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples13,14. FFPE is the standard format for clinical sample preservation for pathology due to its ability to maintain tissue morphology and sample stability at room temperature for decades, accounting for over 90% of clinical pathology specimens15. The ability to process FFPE samples with iST will enable the use of archival tissue banks for studies and obviate the need for specialized sample harvesting workflows. However, FFPE samples tend to suffer from decreased RNA integrity, particularly after having been stored in archives for extended periods of time16.

Three companies recently released the first FFPE compatible commercial iST platforms: 10x's Xenium, NanoString's CosMx, and Vizgen's MERSCOPE9,10,11,17. These three platforms each use different protocols, probe designs, signal amplification strategies, and computational processing methods, and therefore may potentially yield different sensitivities and downstream results. The main chemistry difference lies in transcript amplification: 10x Xenium uses a small number of padlock probes with rolling circle amplification; CosMx uses a low number of probes amplified with branch chain hybridization; and MERSCOPE uses direct probe hybridization but amplifies by tiling the transcript with many probes (Fig. 1b). However, no head-to-head performance comparisons on matched samples have been published. Understanding the key differences across platforms will allow users to make better-informed decisions regarding panel design, method choice, and sample selection as they design costly experiments, often on precious samples that have been bio-banked for years18.

In this study, we compared currently available FFPE-compatible iST platforms on matched tissue samples. We prepared a set of samples representative of typical archival FFPE tissues, comprised of 33 different tumor and normal tissue types, and acquired matched data from sequential sections according to the manufacturer's best practices at the time of writing, generating a dataset of >5.0 M cells. We analyzed the relative sensitivity and specificity of each method on shared transcripts and further quantified the concordance of the iST data across each platform with paired scRNA-seq data collected by 10x Chromium Single Cell Gene Expression FLEX. Then we focused on cell-level comparisons, evaluating the out-of-the-box segmentation for each platform based on detected genes and transcripts and coexpression patterns of known disjoint markers. Finally, we cross-compared the ability of each platform to identify cell type clusters with breast and breast cancer tissues as an example use case. Taken together, our work provides the first head-to-head comparison of these platforms across multiple archival healthy and cancerous FFPE tissue types.

To test the performance of the latest generation of FFPE-compatible iST tools, we sought to match gene expression and sample as much as possible given available panel configurations and manufacturer guidelines. To accomplish this, we used three previously generated multi-tissue tissue microarrays (TMAs) from multiple types of clinical discarded tissue (see Methods). We focused on FFPE tissues as the standard method for sample processing and archival in pathology. Tumor TMA 1 (tTMA1) consisted of one hundred and seventy 0.6 mm diameter cores (i.e., sampled regions) from seven different cancer types, with 3-6 patients per cancer type, and 3–6 cores per patient (Fig. 1c, d, Supplementary Table 1). Tumor TMA 2 (tTMA2) consisted of forty-eight 1.2 mm diameter cores from nineteen different cancer types, with each tissue type coming from one or two patients and represented in 2–3 cores (Fig. 1c, d, Supplementary Table 2). A normal tissue TMA (nTMA) contained forty-five 1.2 mm diameter cores spanning sixteen normal tissue types isolated with each tissue type coming from one patient and represented in 2–3 cores (Fig. 1c, d, Supplementary Table 3). CosMx and Xenium suggest pre-screening samples based on H&E, while MERSCOPE recommends a DV200 > 60%. Since our goal was to determine the compatibility of iST platforms under typical workflows for standard biobanked FFPE tissues from clinical pathology labs, and since TMAs are challenging to assay by DV200, samples were not prescreened based on RNA integrity. Samples were screened by H&E in the process of TMA assembly. TMAs were sliced into serial sections for processing by 10x Xenium, Vizgen MERSCOPE, and NanoString CosMx, following manufacturer instructions (see Methods).

The three different iST platforms offer different degrees of customizability and panel compositions. In terms of panel design, MERSCOPE and Xenium offer either fully customizable panels or standard panels with optional add-on genes, while CosMx offers a standard 1 K (substantially larger plex) panel with optional add-on genes (while this paper was in review Xenium and CosMx began providing options for 5000 and 6000 gene, respectively). We opted to run the CosMx 1 K panel as available commercially, as well as the Xenium human breast, lung, and multi-tissue off-the-shelf panels. We then designed two MERSCOPE panels to match the pre-made Xenium breast and lung panels, by filtering out any genes which could potentially lead to high expression flags in any tissue in the Vizgen online portal. This resulted in a total of six panels, with each panel overlapping the others on > 65 genes (Supplementary Table 4).

We carried out multiple runs with each panel following manufacturer instructions as provided in 2023 and 2024 (Supplementary Table 5), with efforts made to ensure that head-to-head comparisons were available at similar time points for each pair of platforms. 2023 data on tTMA1 and the nTMA were acquired with lung, breast, and multi-tissue panels for Xenium, MERSCOPE lung and breast panels, and the CosMx 1k panel. 2024 data was acquired on tTMA1 and tTMA2 with only the breast and 1k panels, along with reference single-cell transcriptomic data from sequential slices. In an intentional deviation from manufacturer instructions, the 2024 round of tTMA1 was intentionally carried out with matched baking times after slicing for a head-to-head comparison on equally prepared tissue slices. We note that between 2023 and 2024, CosMx updated its detection algorithms and Xenium improved its segmentation capabilities by adding additional membrane staining. The main part of this manuscript is thus based mostly on the 2024 data as more representative of the current capabilities of the technologies, while the results from 2023 are included in the Supplementary Figs. and tables as useful comparisons for previous datasets acquired on these platforms.

Each data set was processed according to the standard base-calling and segmentation pipeline provided by each manufacturer. The resulting count matrices and detected transcripts were then subsampled and aggregated to individual cores of the TMA (Methods). Across all datasets we generated 394,635,679 transcripts and 5,017,397 cells. Overall, we found that the cores from each TMA were generally well adhered to the tissue and detected transcripts. The total number of transcripts recovered for each run in 2024 was highest for CosMx, followed by Xenium, and then MERSCOPE (Supplementary Table 6). Based on the initially reported number of transcripts, tTMA1 appeared to provide more counts than tTMA2 and nTMA, which we ascribed to differences in tissue quality (Supplementary Table 6). We note that the total number of transcripts from the MERSCOPE nTMA run was below what would be typically thought of as a successful run. Such a sample would normally be excluded from analysis, but we continued with the data through all analyses to illustrate how low transcript capture affects downstream results (Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Figs. 1–4).

We next sought to directly compare the performance of each iST platform on matched genes. We began with a pseudo-bulk-based approach at the core level since this would not depend on differences in cell segmentation performance (see Methods)19.

First, we examined the reproducibility of the data across experiments using tTMA1 (23) and nTMA (23). When the same genes were evaluated by Xenium and MERSCOPE in sequential sections across different panels, we found that the total transcript count of all shared genes was highly correlated across data sets acquired with different panels, regardless of the tissue of origin (Supplementary Fig. 1a) Deviation in total transcript count was primarily driven by changes in morphology of a core from section to section (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c). However, explorations on a gene-by-gene basis, even in morphologically well-matched cores showed that some genes consistently had higher or lower expression in the breast or lung panel, up to 3-fold (Supplementary Fig. 1d,e). We ascribe these differences primarily to slight competition between probes but note that the magnitude of this effect is comparable to findings in bulk and single cell RNA-seq methods in FFPE tissue20. To explore technical replicability further we examined pseudo-bulk gene expression correlation for cores from the same patient and same tissue type in the same dataset and found that correlation was high (Spearman's r > 0.74) in almost all cases (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b), indicating good sample-to-sample reproducibility within a given platform. These correlation was similar to that observed when comparing the same core profiled across slides with different panels, suggesting that each platform was highly self-consistent and matching previous reports for MERSCOPE finding high section to section correlation21,22.

We also examined the correlation of the data from each platform between 2023 and 2024 using tTMA1 (23) and tTMA1 (24). Despite several differences in acquisition (age of sample, changes to the Xenium and CosMx analysis algorithms, and using matched baking conditions in 2024 vs manufacturer recommended conditions in 2023) we nonetheless found that the total transcript count of every shared gene from all matched cores was highly correlated (Spearman r = 0.99, 0.94, 0.95 for Xenium, MERSCOPE, and CosMx, respectively, Supplementary Fig. 2c–e). The correlation plots showed an average of only 18% median fold decrease in expression across all cores for Xenium in 2024 vs 2023; a four-fold increase for CosMx, and an eight-fold decrease for MERSCOPE—differences we ascribe primarily to the improved CosMx algorithm and changes in the baking time affecting MERSCOPE. Breaking down the correlations by core showed similar results regardless of the tissue of origin, though with more variance between the datasets for MERSCOPE and CosMx than for Xenium (Supplementary Fig. 2f–j). Thus, the correlation of gene expression across matched samples is high in all three technologies across a variety of conditions, but sensitivities could show significant differences.

To evaluate the relative sensitivity of each platform, we plotted the total transcript counts of every shared gene between all combinations of platform and panel, summed across all matched cores. We found generally linear relationships between all pairs of platforms (Fig. 2a–c, Supplementary Fig. 3). When we initially examined CosMx compared to Xenium data using tTMA1 (23) we noted an upward curve in the lower expression regime indicative of higher-than-expected calls associated with the low expression regime by CosMx, though this is no longer present in tTMA1(24) likely because of the updated base calling algorithm (Supplementary Fig. 3a,d,e). Since the three methods use variable number of probes per transcript, we broke these analyses down by gene length, but found no noticeable differences between the performance on short, medium, or long transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 4a–i). Xenium consistently showed higher expression levels on the same genes than CosMx in tTMA1 (24) when all slides were treated the same way, with the Xenium breast dataset having 2-fold more counts than the CosMx multi-tissue data sets (Fig. 2a). CosMx showed higher expression levels than MERSCOPE (median of 11-fold). (Fig. 2b). Finally, Xenium showed 20-fold higher median expression with the breast panels than MERSCOPE. In tTMA2 (24), where slide histology was carried out according to manufacturer protocols, we nonetheless found generally consistent results, though the MERSCOPE data set showed lower expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). Intriguingly, in the earlier round of experimentation, tTMA1 (23), while Xenium still showed higher counts than the other two platforms (Supplementary Fig. 3d–j), the MERSCOPE breast panel showed higher expression levels than CosMx levels, which were only 2.6-fold lower than Xenium's (Supplementary Fig. 3i). Considering the overall higher transcripts per cell across platforms for tTMA1 over tTMA2 and nTMA, and the differences in sample handling across rounds of experimentation (Supplementary Table 5), this suggests that MERSCOPE's ability to detect transcripts is highly sensitive to both sample quality and processing.

a Scatter plots of summed gene expression levels (on a logarithmic scale) of every shared gene between Xenium (breast) and CosMx (1k) data, captured from matched cores from tTMA1(24). Each data point corresponds to a gene. The red line represents the fitted regression (center), obtained from a first-order polynomial fit in log–log space and back-transformed to the original scale. The shaded band shows ±1.96× the standard deviation of residuals (linear scale) around this line. b Same as (a) but between MERSCOPE (breast) and CosMx(1k). c Same as (a) but between Xenium(breast) and MERSCOPE(breast). d Violin plot of percentage of all transcripts corresponding to genes relative to the total number of calls (including negative control probes and unused barcodes) averaged across cores of the same tissue type. Results are from Xenium's breast panel; MERSCOPE's breast panel; and CosMx's multi-tissue 1k panel. Each data point represents a TMA-tissue type combination, such as tTMA1(24)-BrC or tTMA2(24)-BlC. Violins show kernel density; interior lines denote quartiles (median = 2nd quartile). The full data is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a. e Violin plot of false discovery rate (FDR) where FDR(%) = (blank barcode calls / total transcript calls) x (Number of panel genes /Number of blank barcode) x 100. f Same as (e) but using negative control probes to replace blank barcodes. MERSCOPE is missing in this bar plot as it does not have negative control probes by design. g Violin plot of number of genes detected above noise, estimated as two standard deviations above average expression of the negative control probes. h Same as (g) but normalized to the number of genes in a panel or in percentage. Pairwise differences between platforms were assessed with two-sided Mann–Whitney U tests for (d–h); brackets show unadjusted p-values for each comparison.

We next wanted to assess the specificity of each platform. Each of the three platforms includes negative controls which are used to evaluate sample quality23,24. Xenium and CosMx include both negative probes (e.g., real probes targeting nucleic acids that are not present in human tissue) and negative barcodes (e.g., algorithmically allowable barcodes that are not associated with any probe in the experimental panel). MERSCOPE includes only negative barcodes by default. To determine specificity, first we calculated the fraction of all transcripts corresponding to targeted genes relative to the total number of calls (Fig. 2d). We found that Xenium consistently showed the highest on-target fraction, while CosMx was lowest across most tissue types except for bladder cancer and tonsil, where CosMx showed a higher on-target fraction than MERSCOPE (Supplementary Fig. 5a). However, this measurement is biased because of the relative numbers of controls and target barcodes. We therefore also adopted a false discovery rate (FDR) calculation which normalizes for these differences and is calculated against both the negative probes and negative barcodes (see Methods, Fig. 2e, f). We found that Xenium consistently showed the lowest FDR while CosMx showed the highest FDR in most cancer types (15 out of 22 TMA-cancer type combinations, see Supplementary Fig. 5b,c) regardless of whether we standardized to negative control barcodes or probes.

Finally, we used the negative control barcodes to evaluate the number of genes reliably detected by each platform in each tissue type. For each core, we calculated the number of genes that were detected two standard deviations above the average expression of the negative control probes. These numbers were then averaged for cores of the same tissue type. Because the CosMx panel was almost three times larger, it yielded a larger absolute number of detected genes in all 22 TMA-cancer type combinations (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Fig. 5d). CosMx also detected the highest fraction of genes in 15 out of 22 TMA-cancer type combinations, followed by Xenium (5 cancer types across two TMAs: breast cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, and SCC, see Supplementary Fig. 5e). The conclusions above are broadly the same when using 2023 protocols (Supplementary Figs. 6–7), except that the 2024 version of CosMx chemistry shows an almost 10-fold lower FDR in some tissues, with a corresponding increase in number of genes above noise, regardless of whether sample histology was carried out the same way or following manufacturer instructions—again in line with increased sensitivity from CosMx's updated data processing.

We next sought to determine whether a higher number of expressed genes is representative of increased sensitivity to real biology or increased false positive rates. First, we evaluated the correlation of iST data to reference RNA-seq data. We aggregated pseudo-bulk both tTMA1 (23 and 24) data from all panels of the three platforms and compared them to data from the TCGA25 program (see Methods)11. In Breast Cancer from tTMA1 (24), the Spearman correlation coefficients were 0.64 for Xenium, 0.55 for MERSCOPE, and 0.80 for CosMx (Fig. 3a). The performances across all other cancer types followed a similar trend, with CosMx showing the highest correlation coefficient for a particular tissue type followed by Xenium and then MERSCOPE (Supplementary Table 8). These results stand in contrast to results on tTMA1 (23) where each method was generally comparable in correlation coefficient (Supplementary Fig. 8a Supplementary Table 8). We also observed similar correlation coefficients across lung and multi-tissue gene panels relative to bulk RNA-seq expression data (Supplementary Fig 8b).

Insets are Spearman correlation coefficients. b Same as (a) but showing breast cores from nTMA (23) dataset versus averaged nTPM values from GTEx breast samples. c Scatter plots of overlapping genes, showing the aggregated expression of a gene in tTMA1 (23) across smooth muscle cells profiled by the indicated panel vs the gene expression from scRNA-seq. d Same as (c) but for tTMA1 (24). e Same as (c) but for tTMA2 (24). f Comparisons of residuals between single-cell and tTMA1 (23)/tTMA1 (24) for all platforms.

We also compared the pseudo-bulk results from nTMA(23) with bulk RNA-seq data obtained from GTEx12,26 The Xenium breast and CosMx data sets showed similar correlations to breast data obtained from GTEx, while the MERSCOPE had significantly lower correlation, consistent with a run which doesn't pass QC (Spearman's correlation coefficients of 0.33 vs 0.46, 0.57, respectively, Fig. 3b. Supplementary Table 9, Supplementary Fig 8c). These relative trends remained true across most normal tissue types, though we found that thyroid, pancreas, and lymph nodes showed the lowest correlations across all panels while prostate, tonsil, and liver showed the highest correlations (Supplementary Table 9). We also evaluated the expression of tissue-specific transcript markers across each platform by selecting marker genes from the GTEx database (see Methods). In nTMA (23), we found tissue-specific expression patterns of several of these markers across all selected panels when visualized across each healthy tissue type with Xenium showing the most distinct pattern followed by CosMx and finally MERSCOPE (Supplementary Fig. 8d). Overall, our comparison to TCGA and GTEx 2023 data suggests that while platforms may be more highly correlated to reference datasets in some cases, all are within a similar correlation regime regardless of tissue type. We next sought to validate the consistently higher correlation of CosMx vs Xenium vs MERSCOPE. Since TCGA and GTEx data are not generated from matched samples, we also performed a more stringent comparison by generating single-cell transcriptomic data for both tTMA1(24) and tTMA2(24), acquired on sequential sections (Fig. 3c–e, Supplementary Table. 5). This resulted in a matched single-cell reference dataset comprised of 14,945 and 17,749 high-quality single cells respectively for tTMA1 and tTMA2. Since TMAs include many cell types which are difficult to separate in single cell workflows, we decided to subset out vascular smooth muscle cells based on canonical marker genes identified (Methods). This cell type is readily recognizable in each platform and thus serves as a good basis of comparison of relative gene expression across modalities. The observed population's showed high expression of genes known to be associated with smooth muscle cells (but not used for selection) such as MYH11, DST, and LUM; while showing low expression of genes not associated with smooth muscle cells such as CSTG, CD86, and PDCD1LG2.

We then aggregated pseudo-bulk expression from all three spatial platforms and single-cell data and performed correlation analyses across all spatially measured genes in this cell type27. When we compared Spearman correlation coefficients, we recapitulated the trends observed in 2024 data compared to reference bulk RNA-seq: namely, CosMx had the highest correlation coefficients, followed by Xenium, and finally MERSCOPE (Fig. 3c–e). Importantly, this is true for both tTMA1 (23) and tTMA1 (24). We found that on tTMA1 (24), CosMx has significantly higher correlation coefficients relative to Xenium (0.77 vs 0.53, p = 1.2 × 10−10, Fisher's z transformation throughout) and MERSCOPE (0.6, p = 1.7 × 10−6) on tTMA1. This was consistent with results on tTMA2 (24): (CosMx: 0.78, Xenium: 0.72, p = 0.02, MERSCOPE: 0.23, p = 0) (Fig. 3d, e). However, when we restricted the same correlation analysis to only the expression of the common genes measured by each spatial platform relative to single-cell, the differences in correlation to single-cell data among the platforms were reduced and were no longer statistically significant on tTMA1 (24) (CosMx: 0.60, Xenium: 0.53, p = 0.23, MERSCOPE: 0.54, p = 0.20) while on tTMA2 (24) only the MERSCOPE difference remained significant (CosMx: 0.61, Xenium: 0.69, p = 0.84, MERSCOPE: 0.3, p = 1.9 × 10−3) (Supplementary Fig. 8e–g). We therefore conclude that the primary factor contributing to the higher correlation of CosMx was the larger panel size, which encompassed genes with a broader range of expression values.

The availability of a matched reference data set across several replicates allowed us to probe whether there were platform specific systematic biases in measuring certain genes. By comparing the residuals of the fits to single cell data we found that all three platforms consistently over- or undercounted- certain genes—largely non-overlapping sets—relative to single-cell measurements, presumably due to differences in sensitivities among probe designs and decoding chemistries (Fig. 3f). While the random noise between replicates could be of equal magnitude to this effect as evidence by genes with large residuals in one data set or another, this systematic effect could explain the spread in gene expression observed between platforms in Fig. 2a–c.

Next, we compared the performance of each iST method on a single-cell level. As of 2024, all three platforms generate cell boundaries based on a DAPI image combined with a membrane marker (Fig. 4a). Raw images are provided for these stains to facilitate custom cell segmentation approaches, but we opted to use out-of-the-box cell segmentation method for each individual platform to replicate a real-world use-case of these platforms. We evaluated the cell segmentation accuracy by comparing the segmentation outputs against manual annotations of a subset of tTMA1 (24). This subset included three TMA cores selected for their morphological similarity across platforms and their representation of different cellular structures (see Methods) and yielded > 31,400 annotated cells (see Methods) in total. We then computed precision, recall, and F1 score, across three distinct cellular scenarios: dense cells, sparse cells, and elongated cells (Fig. 4b). In dense cell distributions, CosMx and Xenium achieved significantly higher precision (0.90) than MERSCOPE (0.83, p < 0.01). Recall and F1 score results are consistent with precision across each platform. The segmentation accuracy of all three platforms decreased in elongated cells and followed by sparse cells but the relative performance of the platforms remained the same. The reduced performance is likely due to the complex and irregular shapes of elongated cells and the reduced contextual information surrounding sparse cells, increasing the likelihood of false positive and negatives. No significant performance difference was detected between CosMx and Xenium across the three scenarios.

a Top row: Subset of data showing DAPI (blue fill) and membrane staining (green fill) overlaid with cell segmentation boundaries (white outline) and manually annotated cell centroid (red point). Middle row: all the transcripts in green dots and EPCAM in blue dots. Bottom row: segmented cell boundaries (white outline) before and after filtration (Cyan outline: Cells kept after quality control; Orange outline: Cells excluded after quality control). We acquired imaging data from 263 TMA cores (170 from tTMA1, 48 from tTMA2, and 45 from nTMA) using Xenium, MERSCOPE, and CosMx, respectively. Segmentation was performed on three representative TMA cores for each IST platform, yielding a total of 9 cores and 31,384 annotated cells. b Segmentation accuracy evaluated by three metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, in various scenarios including dense cells, sparse cells, and elongated cells. Pairwise platform differences were tested using two-sided Tukey's HSD following one-way grouping by platform (per core and scenario). Reported p-values are Tukey-adjusted for multiple comparisons. Asterisks indicate significance thresholds (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001). Exact adjusted p-values are shown above brackets. c Heatmap of transcripts per cell after filtration. All available genes are considered here for each panel. We filtered out cells with fewer than 10 transcripts for Xenium and MERSCOPE, and fewer than 20 transcripts for CosMx, in accordance with each platform's recommended threshold. d Same as (c) but showing unique genes per cell. e Same as (c) but reanalyzed using only shared genes. f Same as (d) but reanalyzed using only shared genes. g Co-expression density map for three pairs of disjoint genes (rows) from all three platforms (columns) from tTMA1 (24). MERSCOPE breast dataset does not have enough cells to generate the 2D histogram for PPARG vs. CD68. All cells across all tissues which include at least one detected transcript of either of the indicated genes are plotted together, with color indicating the number of cells at the indicated expression levels of each gene. Data throughout is from tTMA1 (24) and tTMA2 (24).

We next filtered out empty regions of space and cells without any transcripts for downstream examination and quantified the fraction of cells containing differing numbers of transcripts per cell (Supplementary Fig. 10a). We chose a permissive threshold of removing cells with fewer than 10 transcripts for Xenium and MERSCOPE, and 20 transcripts for CosMx from downstream analysis as recommended by each technology11,28,29. tTMA1 (24) consistently had a greater fraction of cells passing filtration, with CosMx retaining the most cells (95.97%) followed by Xenium (94.28%) and MERSCOPE (27.97%) (Supplementary Table 6) while tTMA2 (24) had lower cell retention in Xenium (92.66%) and MERSCOPE (2.98%) but slightly higher cell retention in CosMx (96.30%). The relative order of the platforms based on the fractions of cells remained the same. Unsurprisingly, filtration decreased the number of retained cells per unit area for all platforms, with the smallest decrease coming for CosMx and Xenium (Supplementary Fig. 10b). The cells retained from CosMx and Xenium had similar areas, while filtration of the MERSCOPE data sets resulted in a higher average cell area (Supplementary Fig. 10c). This effect is largely driven by the removal of low-quality cells, specifically those with fewer than 10 detected transcripts.

After filtration, we compared the number of transcripts and the number of unique genes per retained cell across all tissues and all panels, focusing on tumor cores that were sampled by all three platforms (Fig. 4c–f). As expected, given its larger panel size, CosMx detected the highest number of transcripts per cell and the highest number of unique genes per cell in all tissue types, followed by Xenium breast panel and then MERSCOPE breast panel (Fig. 4c, d). If these analyses were restricted to only the shared genes across all panels, numbers were much lower (Fig. 4e, f), with the Xenium breast panel giving the highest numbers of transcripts per cell in 21 out of 22 TMA-cancer type combinations. The CosMx data showed the highest number of transcripts per cell in liver cancer and comparable transcript counts in testicular cancer to the Xenium breast panel. The MERSCOPE data generally had the lowest number of transcripts per cell, though pancreatic cancer approached the results from Xenium, and had higher transcripts per cell than CosMx (Fig. 4e). Xenium had the highest number of unique genes per cell across all tissue types and followed by CosMx and MERSCOPE (Fig. 4f). When we performed similar analyses for the 2023 datasets, even though these did not include membrane segmentation for Xenium (Supplementary Fig. 10d–g) and note that MERSCOPE showed significantly higher numbers of transcripts. This is consistent with our previous results (Supplementary Fig. 2i) showing that in certain conditions MERSCOPE could approach Xenium transcript counts.

We then determined how different iST platforms' segmentation algorithms perform by assessing the expression of canonical markers. We examined the co-expression of CD3E, a canonical T-cell marker, and EPCAM, a marker for epithelial cells30,31 across all filtered cells; the co-expression of CD4 and CD8A, markers of T-cell subsets32,33,34; and the co-expression of PPARG, a marker for adipocytes and CD68, a marker for macrophages35,36,37. We reasoned that all these marker gene pairs are disjointly expressed, and a well-performing segmentation algorithm should yield few cells expressing both markers. We pooled all the filtered cells from matched tTMA1 (24) cores of each platform and plotted the expression of one gene against the other and converted the scatter plot to a 2D histogram showing cell numbers in each co-expression bin. We found that Xenium showed clear patterns of disjoint expression, separating cells from different lineages, while MERSCOPE showed such a pattern for CD3E vs. EPCAM but not for the other two pairs (Fig. 4g). Higher quality MERSCOPE data from tTMA1 (23) showed such a pattern for CD3E vs. CD19, CD4 vs. CD8A, and CD3E vs. EPCAM (Supplementary Fig. 10h–i). Similarly, CosMx only showed such a pattern for PPARG vs. CD68 but not for the other two pairs. Nevertheless, since the CosMx panel is much higher plex, and retained similar numbers of transcripts and genes to Xenium, we next wondered how these two methods performed in terms of cell type recovery.

In a typical iST workflow, a key step is reducing the dimensionality of the data by identifying cell types, their unique states, and their expression patterns for further analysis leveraging spatial information38. To compare across platforms, we clustered the data from the filtered cells from all the cores for each TMA with a focus on breast tissues. The initial clustering of whole TMA datasets (except MERSCOPE normal tissue) showed expected batch effects caused by patients and tissue types with broadly similar cluster arrangements around morphological tissue features (Supplementary Fig. 11). We removed batch effects (see Methods) and then performed targeted clustering and cell type annotation for breast samples from tTMA1 (23), tTMA1 (24) and tTMA2 (24) for Xenium breast panel, MERSCOPE breast panel and CosMx multi-tissue panel (Supplementary Fig. 12).

When looking at tTMA1 (23), in breast cancer, after batch effect removal (Supplementary Fig. 12d–f), Xenium resulted in nine cell types (alveolar cells, B cells, basal cells, fibroblast, hormone-sensing cells, immune cells, myeloid, T cells, and vascular & lymphatic cells) (Fig. 5a). On the other hand, CosMx resulted in eight cell types (alveolar cells, basal cells, epithelial cells, fibroblast cells, hormone-sensing cells, immune cells, myeloid, and vascular & lymphatic cells). MERSCOPE resulted in six cell types, including alveolar cells, fibroblast cells, hormone-sensing cells, myeloid cells, T cells, and vascular & lymphatic cells. The cell type annotation of Xenium and CosMx was comparable in terms of both transcriptomic profile and subtype depth, with CosMx only unable to annotate immune cell subtypes (B cell and T cell). Gene expression of the same cell type from both platforms correlated well (Fig. 5a). MERSCOPE, on the other hand, identified most, but not all, the cell types recognized by Xenium and CosMx, including alveolar cells, fibroblast cells, hormone-sensing cells, myeloid, T cells, and vascular & lymphatic cells. MERSCOPE and Xenium showed a high correlation for almost all matching clusters. The correlation map shows a clearer one-to-one mapping between MERSCOPE and Xenium clusters than Xenium and CosMx clusters (Fig. 5a).

Correlation plot showing the correlation between cell types identified in CosMx and Xenium.

Results remained similar when the same sample was rerun with all spatial methods receiving the same slicing protocol a year later (Fig. 5b). Xenium identified all nine cell types as well as one additional cell type, epithelial cells, while CosMx and MERFISH identified the exact same set of cell types. Further, the cell types identified from tTMA1 (23) and tTMA1 (24), the two experiments, correlated well (Fig. 5c), where all cell types from tTMA1 (23) show high correlation with the same identifications in tTMA1 (24). However, CosMx, Xenium, and MERSCOPE exhibit differences in cell type annotations, particularly in the identification of cell subtypes. For example, in Core 99, Xenium appears blue in the center because many cells are identified as alveolar, while CosMx appears yellow due to the identification of epithelial cells. Alveolar cells are a subtype of epithelial cells, and closer examination of the heatmaps reveals that the transcriptomic profiles of alveolar cells identified in Xenium often exhibit high correlation with epithelial clusters in CosMx and MERSCOPE (Fig. 5b). While performing the cell type annotations independently for each platform, the markers provided by CosMx and MERFISH cannot support a confident classification of the cells as alveolar, unlike Xenium, which shows clear alveolar markers (Supplementary Fig. 13). This lack of specificity is also observed with immune cells: Xenium identifies more subtypes with distinct markers, whereas CosMx and MERSCOPE often only produce clusters broad enough to indicate immune cells without further subtyping. These limitations result in correlation heatmaps where cell type clusters do not always align one-to-one between platforms, such as seen in tTMA1 (24), where the Xenium alveolar cluster correlated with both alveolar and epithelial clusters in CosMx and MERSCOPE.

The results in tTMA1(24) stand in contrast to those in tTMA2 (24). In the Invasive Breast Cancer samples in tTMA2 (24) CosMx found seven cell types, including alveolar cells, basal cells, fibroblasts, hormone-sensing cells, immune cells, myeloid, and vascular & lymphatic cells; whereas Xenium only annotated five cell types, including basal cells, fibroblast cells, hormone-sensing cells, immune cells and vascular & lymphatic cells. MERSCOPE is not included due to its low number of transcripts. High correlation is again found between the cell types of CosMx and Xenium. In conclusion, for all TMAs in 23 and 24, all platforms are capable of generating results that support reasonable, consistent cell type annotations that would allow further biological analyses. We find that CosMx or Xenium can resolve higher numbers of cell types, with the relative performance likely dictated by the presence of key marker genes in the panel (more likely in the larger CosMx panel) vs the higher sensitivity and lower false positives (more likely in Xenium measurements).

In this study, we compared data obtained with three commercially available iST platforms with archival FFPE tissues to assess overall technical performance and help guide experimental design with human patient-derived samples that represent an important use case of these platforms. We focused our analyses on technical performance as a function of tissue source, including 17 different tumor types and 16 normal tissue types. Overall, we found that each iST platform presented various tradeoffs in terms of implementation, panel design and panel options, and resulting total transcript quantification and downstream analyses, including cell segmentation, cell quality, and biological interpretation. All these factors must be considered when designing iST experiments.

There are significant workflow differences between the different platforms which factor into the choice of method. Cutting samples onto MERSCOPE coverslips is more technically challenging than on standard microscope slides. The total hands-on time for running a slide on Xenium is 2–3 days compared to 5–7 days for MERSCOPE and 2 days on CosMx. We found that MERSCOPE and CosMx are well set up for batch processing in the wet lab, either due to built-in pause points or the instrument's ability to run multiple samples. Xenium is limited for batch processing by a need for a separate thermocycler for each slide pair processed in parallel. After staining, selecting regions of interest (ROIs) presented a surprising challenge for some systems: the Xenium platform could readily image the entire slide as a single ROI which easily covered entire TMAs, but the MERSCOPE ran into a 1 cm2 imaging area limit which meant cores in the addressable region were left unimaged, while the CosMx workflow required a demanding manual selection of ROIs for each core. These factors are likely to change as each company updates its protocol, but currently, Xenium offers the shortest, least hands-on workflow.

We analyzed each resulting dataset with a combination of manufacturer recommended processes for each platform and computational tools that can be implemented by the user downstream. These pipelines each result in count matrices and detected transcripts that can be analyzed using a suite of emerging tools. To facilitate the comparisons of iST platforms at a high level and enhance readability, we synthesized our findings into a qualitative summary table (Table 1).

When analyzed at a core level to abrogate the effects of individual cell-segmentation performance, we found that the total number of transcripts varied substantially across iST platform. With 2023 chemistry, Xenium yielded the highest number of transcripts, followed by CosMx and MERSCOPE, but with updated chemistry in 2024, CosMx showed higher total numbers of transcripts, consistent with a larger overall panel size. However, when this analysis was restricted to shared genes, Xenium generally had higher sensitivity for the same genes over CosMx and MERSCOPE across each tissue type, panel, sample, histological preparation, and acquisition round. The Xenium platform also showed the highest specificity by several false discovery rate metrics relative to CosMx and MERSCOPE.

The most prominent observation across these comparisons for CosMx was the improvement from 2024 to 2023 chemistry. With 2024 protocols, CosMx showed the smallest difference relative to Xenium, a roughly two-fold decrease in transcript counts in samples prepared the same way (tTMA1) and in samples prepared according to manufacturer instructions (tTMA2). This is a dramatic improvement over the ~12-15 fold difference in sensitivity observed with 2023 protocols. The improvement in sensitivity also comes with an improvement in specificity, which, for some tissues, reached almost a 10-fold difference. This suggests that the new version of the CosMx algorithm presents a substantial improvement and presents a choice in slightly lower specificity and sensitivity relative to Xenium vs higher molecular plex.

The most prominent observation for MERSCOPE was the large degree of variability between samples, TMAs, and protocols. Relative to Xenium, MERSCOPE sensitivities for shared genes varied between 2.6- and 100-fold lower. However, the highest MERSCOPE sensitivity obtained from the highest quality samples (tTMA1) measured at the earlier time point (2023) and following manufacturer recommended protocols. While the test case here was for typical archival tissues, these results underscore the importance of pre-screening samples for RNA-integrity for MERSCOPE to ensure high quality input tissue. This would require more tissue and limit the number of compatible samples, which can be weighed against the benefit of highly customizable panel design.

Across all methods, we note that because of the small number of replicates from each tissue we stop short of making blanket statements about relative performance across a particular tissue type. Instead, we conclude that Xenium shows the highest per-gene sensitivity on matched samples, though with updated protocols CosMx's sensitivity approaches Xenium and provides more overall transcripts when considering the larger panel size. MERSCOPE can achieve similar sensitivities relative to Xenium, but is highly sensitive to sample input quality and protocol deviations. While this paper was in review, two other comparison studies came to similar conclusions. A similar head-to-head comparison in FFPE tissue between CosMx and Xenium by Cook et al. found a similar difference in sensitivity to our results39. Interestingly, a comparison of public (unmatched) data from high quality mouse brain by Hartman and Satija found that MERSCOPE provided the highest sensitivities40, in line with the idea that this technique is highly sensitive to input tissue quality.

Regardless of these differences in specificity and sensitivity we found that on matched samples, all platforms were highly correlated to each other. Genes profiled across different panels within the same technology, at different time points, with different histology protocols, or even with different slicing rounds were all generally highly correlated. Similarly cores from the same patient were also highly correlated. This suggests that all three platforms can be trusted for normalized measurements of gene expression within a sample. Furthermore, all three platforms also show similar performance relative to orthogonal (non-spatial) technologies, finding comparable correlation of pseudo-bulk data to RNA-seq data from GTEx or the TCGA, as well as scRNA-seq data generated for tTMA1 and tTMA2, across each panel and platform. The correlation to orthogonal data was high but not perfect, and we found that each platform appeared to repeatedly over- or under-estimate the expression of a small number of genes (Fig. 3F)—suggesting, in some cases, middlingly-expressed genes could be seen as highly or lowly expressing.

A significant advantage of spatial transcriptomics data is the ability to map expression in single cells. We compared each platform on a cell-level basis by assessing cell identification and cell clustering. Overall, it appears that the out-of-the-box segmentation from CosMx and Xenium achieved better accuracy than MERSCOPE in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score across dense, sparse, and elongated cells. All platforms now use a membrane marker for segmentation, but the specific markers and segmentation algorithms are different, which could affect cell typing41,42,43,44, by misattributing marker genes to adjacent cells or by missing cells whose nuclei are out of the imaging plane. It is likely that segmentation performance could be improved on a sample-by-sample or tissue-type-by tissue-type basis, and future work should seek to assess cell segmentation tools and their performance across data from each platform to help inform the choice of analytical method where needed. After applying an expression level filter, CosMx overall retained the highest number of cells across various filtering stringencies. Xenium was able to effectively separate cells from different lineage markers, as judged by finding minimal coexpression of disjoint markers, while CosMx and MERSCOPE either showed more double positive cells or had fewer cells expressing the target genes overall).

To determine whether clearer identification of lineage markers resulted in improved ability to identify cell types, we performed clustering analyses specifically in breast cancer samples. We found that all three platforms had similar cell type annotation results and similar transcriptomic profile for tTMA1 (23) and tTMA1 (24). This consistency across platforms and over 2 years of sequencing highlights the reproducibility and robustness of our cell type annotations and transcriptomic profiling for TMAs. On the highest quality cores in tTMA1, MERSCOPE still successfully identified cell groups, capturing the patterns seen in other platforms, consistent with the trends in the overall transcript counts which show that high quality samples could achieve similar performance to the other platforms. We note that while similar numbers of cell types are recovered, the spatial component of the data shows that occasionally low expression of key marker genes can result in misannotation of a cell subtype which is identified in another technique.

Examining the latest protocols (2024 data), in some cases, Xenium showed larger number of annotated cell types while in others CosMx did. Since we used the full panel, not only the shared genes, when performing these clustering analyses, these differences are likely due to a balance between the benefit of more sensitive detection of tissue relevant genes and the possibility of missing informative genes in the larger panel. The number of genes included in a panel or plex is an important factor in ST experiments, and we recommend subsampling existing atlas data to determine whether the gene set which can be studied will be sufficient to cluster the cell types of interest and identify the necessary biological programs. We note that each of the manufacturers has released new products and now offer increased panel sizes since the completion of these experiments with panels now reaching 5000 genes for Xenium, 6000 genes for CosMx, and 1000 genes for MERSCOPE.

There are several limitations of our study. Our panel design for MERSCOPE required the removal of genes so the panel was compatible with all tissues, lowering the plexity slightly. This could have compromised MERSCOPE's ability to identify cell types relative to Xenium. Due to insufficient tissue, we were unable to run the same TMA across multiple years and multiple slicing and fixation protocols, requiring us to split our efforts between tTMA1 and tTMA2. Nonetheless, we were able to show both the effects on matched sample preparation and sample preparation following manufacturer recommendations. A similar limitation affected our ability to compare to single cell data. Because of insufficient tissue and the TMA design we could not achieve an equal level of sampling with single cell approaches as with spatial methods. Thus, while we were able to identify similar cell subpopulations for the purposes of exploring relative gene expression, we leave the question of the ability of spatial methods to perform generalized cell type clustering relative to single cell to other investigations. This limit did not apply to comparing clustering between spatial platforms, where we had similar numbers of cells and could identify tissues of origin based on TMA location.

Most importantly, we only attempted to compare the performance of iST platforms under typical use cases for clinical samples obtained from archival biobanks. Our results don't necessarily extend to non-human samples, frozen samples, and even FFPE samples which have been extensively validated for high RNA integrity. Indeed, there have been reports that MERSCOPE, in previous studies of the mouse brain, shows comparable or even superior results to those reported by 10x Xenium45. Given the large change in data quality between TMAs, and even the same sample run multiple times, we cannot exclude the possibility that in the highest quality samples MERSCOPE would provide higher transcript numbers, with the associated downstream benefits relative to Xenium and CosMx. However, the current guidance of DV200 > 0.6 restricts studies to the upper regime sample quality and limits archival investigations. Finally, we note that this study only compares the ability of spatial transcriptomic platforms to reveal transcriptional information. Specifically, we do not answer whether ST can predict protein expression of clinical biomarkers. Our preliminary exploration based on PD-L1 status annotation in tTMA1 did not show significant expression differences for any platform, but rigorous testing of this would require larger powered cohorts in each individual tissue type and clinical annotation.

Despite these limitations, our overall interpretation of these results is that amplification of RNA signal is especially important for recovery of transcript counts by iST in low-quality samples where RNA may be highly degraded and fewer landing sites are available for probes. Platforms (such as Xenium and CosMx) which rely on small numbers of landing sites and are subsequently heavily amplified are robust to RNA degradation and are thus more broadly compatible with a broad range of samples. On the other hand, when sample quality is high (as in some of our tumor samples) the gap between amplified and unamplified platforms' performance closes and most platforms can yield useful data for subsequent downstream spatial analysis.

Three TMAs were constructed using FFPE clinical discards at Brigham and Women's Hospital Pathology Core and were acquired with a waiver of consent for non-sequencing based readouts under IRB 2014P001026. The project adheres to all applicable ethical regulations, and the study protocol has been approved by the Human Research Committee of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Mass General Brigham. The samples included:

Tumor TMA 1(tTMA1): A tumor TMA of 170 cores, 0.6 mm in diameter, including a variety of cancer samples and healthy lymphoid tissue as a positive staining control. The TMA samples were selected from samples previously characterized by ImmunoProfile and were selected to encompass both high and low levels of the biomarkers in the ImmunoProfile panel [CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, Foxp3, tumor marker (Cytokeratin, Sox10, or PAX8)]. Annotations were performed by KF and SR based on H&E and immunofluorescence staining. Cores included both tumor and healthy control annotation, though for the purpose of this study, all were combined under their tumor label. Tumors were also chosen to be a mixture of PD-L1 high and PD-L1 low. This TMA had previously been studied by both H&E, and several highly multiplexed immunostaining approaches, and was known to be of high morphological integrity.

Tumor TMA 2 (tTMA2): A tumor TMA of 48 cores, 1.2 mm in diameter, including a variety of cancer. This TMA was chosen for the breadth of tissue lineages included and the relatively large core size.

Normal TMA(nTMA): A normal TMA of 45 cores 1.2 mm in diameter representing a broad range of normal tissues. Samples were sourced from the same patient in either duplicate or triplicate. This TMA was chosen for the breadth of tissue lineages included and the relatively large core size.

All samples were fully de-identified before assembly into TMAs. The breakdown of the number of samples per tissue and the number of cores per tissue is included in Supplementary Tables 1–3.

Sequential sections were prepared according to manufacturer instructions (“Tissue Preparation Guide Demonstrated Protocol CG000578” for Xenium, “91600112 MERSCOPE User Guide Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Tissue Sample Preparation RevB” for Vizgen, and “MAN-10159-01CosMx SMI Manual Slide Preparation Manual” for CosMx) at the Brigham and Women's Hospital Pathology Core. Prior to collecting samples, ~50 µm of each TMA were faced off to reach deeper into the sample where RNA integrity was likely higher. 5 µm sequential sections were then collected, floated in a 37 °C water bath, and adhered to Xenium slides (10x, PN 1000460), Vizgen FFPE coverslips (Vizgen, PN 10500102), or standard Superfrost+ slides for CosMx (Leica BOND PLUS slides, Leica Biosystems S21.2113.A). TMAs were sliced as close to the center of the active area as possible for each platform. Samples were baked at 42 °C for 3 h for Xenium, 55  °C for 15 minutes for MERSCOPE, and 60 °C for 16 h for CosMx. Sections were stored according to manufacturer instructions prior to processing, with 10x Xenium stored in a desiccator at room temperature, Vizgen MERSCOPE coverslips stored at −20 °C, and NanoString CosMx slides stored at 4 °C. To benchmark technologies under same preparation protocol, samples of tTMA1 (24) data were baked overnight and stored at room temperature. Samples for 10x Xenium and Vizgen MERSCOPE were brought to the Spatial Technology Platform at the Broad Institute for processing, while samples for NanoString CosMx were processed at the Wei lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

Pre-designed probe panels from Vizgen were not available at the time of the experiment. Therefore, we ordered custom gene panels to match the pre-released gene panels from 10x for the human breast and human lung panels. Gene lists were uploaded to the Vizgen panel design portal and were checked against all profiled tissues, removing genes that were overexpressed in any individual tissue based on Vizgen's design guidelines (FPKM > 900), and ensuring that the total panel FPKM did not exceed the allowed limit in any individual sample type. Panels were manufactured at the 300 gene scale as custom panels BP0892 and BP0893. The final gene lists, for all three iST modalities are available in Supplementary Table 4.

MERSCOPE samples were imaged according to manufacturer protocol “9160001 MERSCOPE Instrument User Guide RevF”. Samples were processed in two batches, the first of four samples, two of each TMA and with each library prepped in parallel; and a follow up sample of each TMA re-run with the breast panel. Samples were first hybridized with anchoring probes overnight before being embedded in a polyacrylamide gel. Samples were incubated for two hours with a digestion solution at 37 °C and then overnight at 47 °C overnight in a detergent clearing solution and proteinase K to remove native proteins while the anchoring probes kept nucleic acids bound to the gel. After clearing, samples were additionally photobleached using Vizgen's MERSCOPE Photobleacher for three hours at room temperature in the clearing solution. Samples were hybridized with encoding probes and a cell boundary stain (PN 10400118) and then imaged with imaging kits (PN 10400005). Samples were stored at 37 °C in clearing solution after hybridization and before final imaging. After an initial examination of the data, a second batch of both TMAs was run a second time with the human breast panel, increasing the set imaging capture thickness from 5 µm to 10 µm to capture more tissue from cores that had lifted during the gel embedding process. MERSCOPE data acquired with a 10 µm imaging depth (Supplementary Table 5), resulted in a median 3.0-fold increase in expression across all transcripts. We excluded the 5 µm MERSCOPE breast panel data from most comparisons have left references to the lung panel data in as an illustrative example of an unsuccessful run (indicated as such throughout the figures). Data was processed on premises through the standard Vizgen workflow to generate cell by gene and transcript by location matrices. We segmented the data with a built-in Cellpose method on the most accurate looking cell boundary stain.

10x Xenium samples were processed in three batches according to manufacturer protocols “Probe Hybridization, Ligation & Amplification, User Guide CG0000582” and “Decoding & Imaging, User Guide CG000584”. Samples were stained utilizing 10x's predesigned Human Breast (10x, PN 1000463), Human Multi-Tissue and Cancer (10x, PN 1000626), and Human Lung panels (10x, PN 1000601), as they became available from the manufacturer. Slides for both TMAs were processed in pairs according to which probe library they were receiving. Slides were stained with a Xenium imaging kit according to manufacturer instructions (10x, PN 1000460). Briefly, padlock probes were incubated overnight before rolling circle amplification and native protein autofluorescence was reduced with a chemical autofluorescence quencher. Slides were processed on a 10 Xenium Analyzer, with ROIs selected to cover the entire TMA region. Data was processed on premises through the standard 10x workflow to generate cell by gene and transcript by location matrices. The 10x multimodal segmentation kit and protocol was used for 2024 but not for 2023 data acquisition.

NanoString CosMx samples were prepared with one 1000 plex panel. Samples were hybridized with probes and stained with cell markers. Samples were loaded onto the CosMx SMI at the same time for imaging, during which branched fluorescent probes were hybridized onto the samples to amplify the signal above the background.

NanoString CosMx samples were prepared with Human Universal Cell Characterization 1000 Plex Panel (part number 122000157) according to manufacturer protocol “MAN-10159-01 CosMx SMI Manual Slide Preparation Manual”. Firstly, slides were baked at 60°C overnight for better tissue adherence. After baking, slides were treated sequentially with deparaffinization, target retrieval (15 min at 100°C), permeabilization (3 µg/mL proteinase K, 15 min at 40 °C), fiducials application, post-fixation, NHS-acetate application and then hybridized with denatured probes from universal panel and default add-on panel. After in situ hybridization (18 h at 37 °C), slides were washed and incubated with DAPI (15 min at RT) and marker stain mix (with PanCK, CD45, CD68 and cell segmentation marker CD298/B2M). Slides were washed and loaded onto the CosMx SMI for UV bleaching, imaging, cycling and scanning. Raw images were decoded by default pipeline on Atomx SIP (cloud-based service). Machine: CosMx_0020. Serial Number: INS2301H0020.

After data acquisition, the resulting outputs were uploaded to a Google bucket associated with a terra.bio Workspace for distribution and follow on analysis.

To facilitate standardized data formatting and subsequent analytical processes, we built a data ingestion pipeline with the following objectives: (a) to grab cell-level and transcript-level data from diverse platforms and normalize the data structure; (b) to tag each cell and transcript with essential metadata including tissue type, tumor status, PD-L1 status, among others (Supplementary Fig. 14); and (c) to transform the data into various formats tailored to the requirements of particularized analyses. Specifically, to tag the data, core centers in the TMA were manually identified using DAPI images (Xenium) or cell metadata that contains global coordinates (MERSCOPE and CosMx) using QGIS(version:3.16.10-Hannover). Cells or transcripts within a specified radius were then labeled with core metadata via spatial joining (implemented by GeoPandas, version:0.13.0). In instances where cores are in close proximity or when a uniform radius cannot be applied effectively, we manually generated the core boundary masks.

For each sample, two formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) curls (25 μm each) were dissociated using the Miltenyi Biotech FFPE Tissue Dissociation Kit (CG000632 RevA, 10X Genomics). The resulting cell suspension was divided equally into four centrifuge tubes, each containing approximately 300,000 cells. Cells in each tube were hybridized with a unique Probe Barcode, as per the instructions in the “Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling Reagent Kits for Multiplexed Samples” user guide (CG000527, 10X Genomics). Post-hybridization, cells from the four tubes were washed, counted, and pooled in equal proportions. Approximately 40,000 cells from the pooled suspension were loaded onto a Chromium Q chip (PN-1000422, 10X Genomics). Sequencing libraries were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq platform using paired-end dual-indexing (49 cycles for Read 1, 10 cycles for i7, 10 cycles for i5, and 90 cycles for Read 2). The sequencing data was demultiplexed using bcl2fastq (Illumina). The resulting FASTQ files were processed with Cell Ranger v7.0.1 (10X Genomics) using the multi pipeline and the GRCh38-2020-A reference genome.

To evaluate panel to panel reproducibility using tTMA1 (23) and nTMA (23) we summed the expression level of shared genes between indicated panels (breast vs. multi-tissue and breast vs. lung panels from Xenium and breast vs. lung panels from MERCOPE) over an individual core and plotted all cores present in each panel, before calculating a Spearman's correlation. The format of the data used is shown in Supplementary Table 10. To evaluate core to core reproducibility, the individual gene counts of replica 1 were plotted against those of replica 2 and a Spearman's correlation was calculated.

To further leveraged data from tTMA1 (24) to evaluate run-to-run reproducibility or check how consistent each platform's results were across different experiments, we compared the total gene expression levels of the same genes measured in 2023 and 2024 from the same panel using scatter plots. We did this for all matching tissue samples and calculated Spearman's correlation to quantify the reproducibility. The format of the data used is shown in Supplementary Table 10. To assess consistency between different but similar samples or sample-to-sample reproducibility, we performed the same comparison on a core basis for all the cores that have matching shapes and cellular structures when imaged in 2023 and 2024. We then summarize the Spearman's correlation values in boxplot to show the relative performance between different iST platforms. While a high correlation value shows that the gene expression patterns are similar, it doesn't account for the overall levels of expression. To get a more complete picture, we also calculated the average log2 fold change values of gene expression between 2024 and 2023 of a core and presented the results in a boxplot (Supplementary Fig. 2i,j).

To compare across panels and platforms, we subset all datasets to include only cores assayed in all runs. The fraction of on-target barcodes was calculated as a percentage of all transcripts corresponding to genes relative to the total number of calls (including negative control probes and unused barcodes or blank barcodes). These measurements were performed on individual cores and averaged across all cores of the same tissue type.

Because the difference in relative numbers of controls and target barcodes across different platforms, we adopted the false discovery rate (FDR) calculation to evaluate the specificity in a more normalized way (Fig. 2e, f, Supplementary Fig. 6b,c). We calculated the FDR of platform p panel m data in tissue t using the following Eq. (1) and cell level data (see example in Supplementary Table 11):

Where N is the total number of cores that belong to tissue type t, I is the total number of unique genes, J is the total number of negative control probes, \({g}_{{in}}\) is the gene expression of gene i in core n, \({{neg}}_{{jn}}\) is the total calls negative control probe j in core.

Since MERSCOPE does not include negative control probes, FDR was recalculated by substituting negative control with blank barcodes (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 6c) using the following Eq. (2):

Where N is the total number of cores that belong to tissue type t, I is the total number of unique genes, L is the total number of unused barcodes or blank barcodes, \({g}_{{in}}\) is the gene expression of gene i in core n, \({{blank}}_{{{\mathrm{ln}}}}\) is the total calls of unused barcode or blank barcode l in core n, specifically, we used “BLANK” for Xenium, “Blank” for MERSCOPE, and “SystemControl” for CosMx. We only used the data from matched cores, so N is same for different platform p.

Sensitivity was measured by the percentage of the total number of unique genes detected above noise level, where the noise was estimated as two standard deviations above average expression of the negative control probes.

Cell Ranger from 10x Genomics was used to demultiplex the raw sequencing data into FASTQ and to align the FASTQ files. R version 4.2.2 and Seurat version 4 were used for all downstream analyses. RNA sequencing results for tTMA1 and tTMA2 went through quality filtering where cells with greater than 5% mitochondrial gene expression or less than 200 expression counts were removed, resulting in 14,945 and 17,749 cells respectively. The number of features and percent mitochondrial can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 9. The data was scaled and normalized, and PCA with dim 1:20 as well as FindCluster with resolution 0.5 were used to find the cell clusters. No batch effect is observed. Markers for each cluster were found and used for cell type annotation. Cells that are used for RNA correspondence analysis are ACTA2-active cells (ACTA > 0), that are 526 and 1117 cells for tTMA1 and tTMA2 respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5c).

RNA TCGA cancer sample gene data summarizes 7932 samples from 17 different cancer types, and it provides FPKM for each gene documented. We used all samples which were annotated as BRCA (Breast cancer), BLCA (Bladder cancer), COAD and READ (colorectal cancer), HNSC (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma), LUAD and LUSC (non-small cell lung cancer), SKCM (melanoma), and OV (ovarian cancer). For GTEx, we selected the tissue types matching the annotation in our normal tissue TMA. For each panel, the genes probed by iST were averaged across all patients with the matching tissue label from the RNA-seq database.

To get pseudo-bulked iST values, the expression level of each gene in each core was normalized to the sum of all genes in that core and scaled by 100,000. We then averaged these scaled pseudo-bulk expression values across cores and plotted them against the averaged FPKMs from reference RNA-seq data sets.

ACTA2-active cells (ACTA > 0, 526 and 1117 cells for tTMA1 and tTMA2 respectively) from single-cell RNA sequencing experiment are also used to compare to the iST data. The single-cell gene expression is aggregated by summing the counts. We used the Cell x Gene portal46. to identify the top gene identifying smooth muscle cells which was contained in each panel: ACTA2-active cells (ACTA > 0) for Xenium and CosMx or MYLK-active cells (MYLK > 0) for MERSCOPE are extracted from the iST datasets. (ACTA2 was too highly expressed to include in the MERSCOPE panel.) Then, gene expression is also aggregated by summing the transcript counts. We use Spearman's correlation to compute the correlation coefficient, and lm (linear model) is used to fit the line.

To determine the assay's ability to specifically identify known lineage markers, we focused on the normal tissue TMA profiled with multi-tissue panel of Xenium, breast panel of MERSCOPE, and 1 K panel of CosMx. We selected genes with known canonical expression patterns using based on transcriptomics data from GTEx. If a gene had 20-fold higher expression in a specific tissue than every other tissue combined, this gene was considered to be a tissue marker and was used for assessing specificity for each platform. Counts for each gene were normalized to the total counts within the core, and then the Z-score of this gene across tissue types was plotted in a heatmap (Supplementary Fig. 8d). We calculated average expression of a gene across cores of the same tissue type and normalized to the total averaged expression of all genes. Z-scores were calculated with the mean and standard deviation across all averaged genes.

In this study, the cell segmentation accuracy of three iST platforms was systematically evaluated using manually annotated ground truth data (31384 cells in total) from 3 TMA cores. These cores were selected to represent 3 distinct cellular scenarios—dense, sparse, and elongated cell distributions—and were morphologically matched across the platforms. We employed both DAPI and membrane staining to identify cells, then marked their centroids using the open-source software QGIS (version 3.16.10-Hannover). The resulting shapefiles were subsequently processed in Python (version 3.10) with GeoPandas (version 0.13.1) for data analysis.

For each platform across three distinct cellular scenarios: dense cells, sparse cells, and elongated cells. Multiple segmentation instances were generated to account for variability and ensure statistical robustness. We used precision, recall, and F1 score as performance metrics. Precision was calculated as the ratio of correctly identified positive segments to the total predicted positive segments, reflecting the accuracy of positive predictions. Recall measured the ratio of correctly identified positive segments to the actual positive segments, indicating the platform's ability to capture all relevant segments. The F1 score, representing the harmonic mean of precision and recall, provided a balanced assessment of the segmentation performance by combining both metrics. To compare the performance across different platforms and core types, statistical analyses were performed using one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) post-hoc tests for pairwise comparisons.

To evaluate the biological performance of the segmentation, we plotted coexpression plots of gene pairs that are mutually exclusive including CD3E vs. EPCAM, CD4 vs. CD8, and PPARG vs. CD68. We pooled all the filtered cells from matched cores of each platform from tTMA1, dropped cells which do not express either gene, plotted the expression of one gene against the other, and converted the scatter plot to a 2D histogram showing cell numbers in each co-expression bin (Fig. 4g, Supplementary Fig. 10h,i).

Segmented cells were aggregated by TMA cores. For Xenium and MERSCOPE data, the estimation of tissue area was performed by calculating the area of a discernible circle, utilizing respective radius of 0.3 µm, 0.6 µm, and 0.6 µm for tTMA1, tTMA2, and nTMA, respectively. Conversely, for the CosMx dataset, the tissue area estimation was approached differently due to its square-like data presentation, a result of the FOV selection process. Here, the tissue area was deduced by multiplying the number of FOVs covered by each core with the area of a single FOV.

For cell filtering, cells with less than 10 transcript counts in MERFISH and Xenium datasets were removed, and cells with less than 20 transcript counts in CosMx datasets were removed. We followed standard processes to then cluster and annotate cell types across each dataset using Scanpy47. Briefly, data was normalized and scaled, dimensionality reduction was performed and cell clusters were identified48,49. To identify the cell type for each cluster, we used a t-test to find the markers for each Leiden cluster and annotated them according to previous literature50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57. These are some of the example markers used for cell type annotation: in breast samples, PIGR and KIT for alveolar cells, for B cells, KRT5, DST, and MYLK for basal cells, LUM, MMP2 and CXCL12 for fibroblast, etc. Heatmaps of the top 3 markers for each cluster are drawn for each dataset from all three panels (refer to Supplementary Fig. 13a–c). For datasets that showed batch effect with patients, Harmony was used to remove this variance58. Correlation heatmaps were generated over overlapping genes that exist in both datasets, and the Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated.

Older adults with diabetes who are not obese face significantly higher dementia risk than those without the chronic condition, according to new findings presented at the Gerontological Society of America (GSA) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting in Boston.

The findings suggest that cognitive risk related to diabetes may be less about excess weight and more about the underlying metabolic stress of the disease — raising concerns that a clinically overlooked group may be at a greater risk than previously believed.

“These results really challenge the assumption that obesity is the primary driver of cognitive complications in diabetes,” said Junyu Sui, PhD student in nursing and health innovation at the Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation at Arizona State University in Phoenix, who led the study. “For clinicians, the key takeaway is that a lower BMI does not mean lower risk. Nonobese, diabetic patients may actually need more proactive cognitive screening and more aggressive management strategies.”

Sui and his team analyzed data from the All of Us Research Program out of the National Institutes of Health. Diabetes and dementia cases were identified using Ninth and 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases codes, and obesity was classified using BMI thresholds and waist circumference cutoffs. The associations remained consistent whether obesity was defined by BMI or waist circumference.

The retrospective analysis of more than 268,000 US adults aged over 50 years followed for a median of 10 years; 2216 (0.8%) developed dementia. People who were not obese showed the highest risk of developing dementia.

Individuals with type 1 diabetes who were not obese showed a fourfold increased risk for dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 4.0; 95% CI, 2.86-5.6) compared with adults without diabetes. Type 2 diabetes without obesity was associated with an 82% higher risk (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.45-2.28) after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and health factors.

“This suggests a unique metabolic vulnerability in nonobese diabetes that warrants much closer clinical attention,” Sui said.

People with obesity and either type of diabetes showed a lower risk, including those with type 1 (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.36-2.12) or type 2 (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.24-1.55).

Fadi Ramadan, MD, geriatrician and assistant professor of medicine at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said the biological pathways linking diabetes to dementia are well established.

“Diabetes is among the vascular risk factors,” said Ramadan, who was not involved with the research. “We also [see] people with heart disease, and they're not obese; they have dementia. So I think any vascular risk factor can contribute to dementia risk.”

Ramadan said compounds produced by diabetes can accumulate in blood vessels and disrupt normal circulation and are “linked to diabetic dementia because they contribute to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, [and] protein dysfunction in the brain.”

Sui described similar mechanisms in his presentation, noting that what he called “lean diabetes” may reflect severe metabolic dysfunction despite normal body size.

Ramadan said the results are “very important” because a clinical gap persists in screening and catching these patients. Screening tools — such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment — would detect cognitive impairment in this population if they were used consistently, he said.

“Endocrinologists don't really screen for dementia. For primary care physicians, there's no time,” said Ramadan. “Diabetics fall through the cracks when it comes to dementia.”

The US Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend routine screening for cognitive impairment in asymptomatic adults.

Nancy Schoenborn, MD, associate professor of medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, described the study as thought-provoking but preliminary.

“I think this is interesting data,” Schoenborn said, “but not to a point that's mature enough to impact clinical practice.”

She added that the findings should spur further investigation.

“I'd wonder if this would lead to more research to understand what is happening biologically that's different in obese versus nonobese patients and if we should treat the nonobese diabetes patients differently,” Schoenborn said.

Sui and Ramadan reported having no relevant disclosures.

Lower baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) in individuals without a prior history of T2D and cardiovascular disease, and this association was largely independent of statin use.

""The lack of significant interaction of statin therapy on incident T2D for low LDL-C levels groups in the present study may imply that the reduction in plasma LDL-C concentration is accompanied by an increase in incident T2D largely independent on statin therapy,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Maria Lembo, Valentina Trimarco, Daniela Pacella, and Raffaele Izzo, ""Federico II"" University, Naples, Italy. It was published online on November 11, 2025, in Cardiovascular Diabetology.

The findings did not elucidate the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms connecting low LDL-C levels to an increased risk for incident T2D. This study lacked data on statin potency and dosage at baseline. Additionally, genetic analysis was not included in the assessment, and information about lifestyle factors — such as physical activity and dietary patterns — that could have influenced the risk for T2D was unavailable.

This study was funded by multiple sources, including the National Institutes of Health; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. The authors reported having no competing interests.

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Leclerc: 'The best thing I can do is keep doing my best'

Max Verstappen has given his assessment on his season, with the Red Bull driver taking pride in how he was able to reduce the significant points lead of his title rivals.

Max Verstappen feels that he and Red Bull can be “proud” after reducing the significant points gap that they faced earlier in the season, though the Dutchman acknowledged that the performance level was “not where I wanted it to be” for most of the campaign.

Following the Dutch Grand Prix in August – the first race after F1's summer break – Verstappen was more than 100 points adrift of then-championship leader Oscar Piastri. However, a strong run for the four-time World Champion saw him win three out of the four next Grands Prix, bolstering his points tally and bringing him back into the title fight.

While the margin is now at 49 points from Lando Norris – who retook the standings lead in Mexico – Verstappen is happy with how he managed to bounce back.

Asked ahead of the upcoming Las Vegas Grand Prix if he would rate this season as his best in Formula 1 in terms of what he has achieved behind the wheel, the 28-year-old responded: “It's been good, for sure.

“I think every season you want to try and be better, which is not always easy but you try to be more consistent. Otherwise we tried to really optimise everything we can with the car, and I think most of the time we really did that, so I'm pleased with that.

“It's not where I wanted it to be for most of the season, otherwise you're fighting all season for the title, which we haven't really. I enjoyed the highs and the wins that we did score, but at the same time of course the lows were also not fantastic.

“At the same time, in the middle of the season or after the summer break, we were looking at a points gap of more than 100 points and it really looked like it was only going to get bigger, and at one point we were really overturning that by quite a bit. A bit of luck in some places, but I think that's something we can be proud of, to still score some good results at the end of the season.”

Ahead of the final three rounds of the season, Verstappen insisted that his approach to the championship battle remains the “same as always”, adding: “It doesn't really change. It's a lot of points so I'm not really thinking about it too much.

“There's also not much I can do – we need a lot of luck now until the end to even have an opportunity, so personally I don't think about that.”

For now Verstappen's focus is on Round 22 in Las Vegas, a weekend that he arrives into off the back of an impressive comeback drive last time out in Sao Paulo that saw him climb from a pit lane start to a final result of P3.

Pushed on whether he could be in with a chance of challenging for victory should he get a similar feeling from the RB21 as in Brazil, Verstappen said: “Looking back at Brazil, yeah, I guess so, because the race pace was pretty decent.

“Of course I would have liked to start more at the front, but at the same time it was fun. I had a good time out there racing through the pack and fighting until the final lap. Of course it was only for P2, but I had good fun and I hope we can be competitive this weekend.”

The Duchess has arrived.

Meghan Markle's staff announces the royal before she enters a room — even if there are only two guests.

During an interview with Harper's Bazaar, writer Kaitlyn Greenidge said she and the Duchess of Sussex entered a New York City “grand” brownstone that belonged to one of Markle's friends.

“When I enter, the house manager announces, ‘Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,' even though we appear to be the only other two people in the house,” Greenidge wrote.

Elsewhere in the interview, Greenidge also said that someone announced Markle when she arrived at the La Brea Tar Pits, an active fossil-dig site and natural-history museum in Los Angeles, to meet with a group of girls from a local STEM school.

“A golf cart pulls up, the gravel crunching beneath its tires. ‘The Duchess of Sussex,' someone in the scrum announces,” Greenidge wrote.

“Meghan descends, dressed in wide-leg trousers, a silk blouse, and a small pair of pavé-diamond studs by the Ukrainian brand Guzema,” she added.

“They were a gift from her husband, Prince Harry, picked up on a recent trip to Kyiv with his Invictus Games Foundation.”

Elsewhere in the interview, Markle opened up about giving herself “grace” when it comes to mistakes.

“You learn not to do it again,” she shared. “If it all goes swimmingly, you don't learn from it. If you don't learn anything, you're not going to grow.”

Harry, 41, and Markle, 44, tied the knot in May 2018 and quit their royal duties two years later.

The couple, who have welcomed son Prince Archie, 6, and daughter Princess Lilibet, 4, now reside in a $14 million mansion in Montecito, Calif.

Though Markle and the Duke of Sussex left the royal family, they and their children were allowed to keep their titles.

In a March interview with People, the “Suits” alum said the Sussex name held a deeper significance since she became a mother.

“I love that that is something that Archie, Lili, [Harry] and I all have together. It means a lot to me,” she said of her family.

“I think as the kids get older, they're so excited about, ‘Oh my gosh, Mama and Papa, how did you meet?'” Markle continued. 

“I think that will come with time as they get older, but for right now a huge part of our love story is that we share the name Sussex.”
