                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, who has in the past has said he owns some bitcoin BTC$86,401.96, put a clearer figure on it, saying it's been about 1% of his portfolio for some time. However, the hedge fund mogul said bitcoin still faces significant structural challenges before it can realistically be considered a global reserve asset. "I have a small percentage of bitcoin,” he told CNBC on Thursday. Hindering its adoption as a reserve currency, said Dalio, are issues such as its traceability, transactional transparency and vulnerabilities in light of the progress of quantum computing. “I think the problem of bitcoin is it's not going to be a reserve currency for major countries because it can be tracked and it could be, conceivably with quantum computing controlled, hacked, and so on and so forth," Dalio said, stressing governments will not adopt financial products that record in a public and permanent way. He said it tracks multiple metrics, including leverage, money supply, and wealth concentration, to evaluate market vulnerability. Hedera's token slipped below key support levels as a late-session trading halt, collapsing volume, and failed recovery attempts point to mounting structural and liquidity stress.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has plunged by 31% since setting a new all-time high mark above $126,000 in early October. Overall crypto market liquidations have surged over the past hour, currently sitting at $933 million across all crypto assets over the last 24 hours, per CoinGlass. Stocks are similarly falling on the day, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both showing losses in excess of 1% as of this writing. Proposed Bitcoin for America Bill Would Enable BTC Tax Payments, Which Go to Reserve Optimism over a potential December rate cut—which Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell tried to temper hype for in late October—has fallen in recent days, with analysts and traders now betting against cuts. On prediction market Polymarket, the odds show a similar spread, with a 63% likelihood of no change, flipping on late Tuesday as optimism faded. That's better than expected, but analysts have said the report doesn't provide clarity for traders. "The September jobs report is a mixed bag," wrote Navy Federal Credit Union Chief Economist Heather Long on X. "It's encouraging that more people are looking for work (the labor force grew +470,000). "The Fed probably won't cut in December," she added. Editor's note: This story is breaking and will be updated with additional detail.</p>

Buterin warned that if BlackRock and other large institutions keep expanding their ethereum holdings, the network faces the possibility that those focused on decentralization get crowded out and base-layer choices are optimized for institutions, making it harder for regular users to run nodes, and in turn driving centralization. “We need to focus on the things that would otherwise be in short supply: global, permissionless, and censorship-resistant protocol." “Given the current staggering rate of hardware progress, I now think it's a live possibility that we'll have a fault-tolerant quantum computer running Shor's algorithm before the next U.S. presidential election,” quantum computer researcher Scott Aaronson wrote in blog post this month, referring to how a quantum computer could break the encryption that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”) has recently published guidance for the education sector on complying with data protection law when sharing data to safeguard children and young people. Education providers must identify a lawful basis before sharing information. In contrast, a private school or private nursery is more likely to rely on legitimate interests, which involves a three-part test: Education providers should note that the Data Use and Access Act 2025 introduces a new lawful basis of ‘recognised legitimate interest'. For certain public interest purposes, including safeguarding, this will remove the obligation to carry out the balancing test at step three above once these provisions come into force. The ICO has released initial guidance on this but more is expected to follow. Education providers should consider the capacity of the child or young person to exercise their own data protection rights when deciding whether to share information. The ICO suggests that, in many cases, it is reasonable to assume that a child has capacity from the age of 12. Where an education provider regularly shares information with other organisations, such as the local authority, a health and social care organisation or the police, the ICO recommends agreeing formal data sharing arrangements between those organisations. However, in emergency situations, the absence of a formal arrangement should not prevent an organisation from raising a safeguarding concern. In such cases, organisations should keep a detailed record of what was shared, with whom and why. Even where a formal arrangement exists, an education provider may not have time to follow the usual process in an emergency. The ICO has published 12 helpful case studies to show how these considerations may apply in practice. If you have any questions on the ICO's new guidance or how it may impact your organisation's safeguarding and data protection practices, please contact our education law experts for tailored advice.

He fumbled with his driver's license, standing inside an Augusta convenience store, trying to keep hold of the sack of cash tucked under his arm. After several attempts, he successfully set up a digital wallet and began feeding $10,000 into the machine — one $100 bill at a time. It took so long, this being his first purchase of cryptocurrency, that his wife came in after 45 minutes to check on him and helped to insert the remaining bills. Over the next seven months, from October 2023 to April 2024, Larry and Barbara Cook would repeat the same process over 30 times, unknowingly giving away $1.3 million from their retirement accounts in a government impersonation scam. The scammers introduced their ruse with accusations and threats and wound up convincing the Cooks to use their own money to help investigate and trap bad actors on the “dark web.” The scam would take the Cooks to gas stations and bodegas across Maine and in Florida, where they spend winters. They even booked a last-minute flight to Portland and drove through a snow storm to meet the scammers' demands. In the end they were handing over taped-up cardboard boxes filled with cash or gold bullion to strangers who came to their homes in broad daylight or the pitch black night. They would come to trust him, even appreciate his kindness, as he talked them through the painstaking process of gradually syphoning off their life savings. They were told all of it would be returned to them when the investigation ended. All the while, they thought they were helping the FTC catch criminals involved in identity theft and money laundering. They promised to keep their involvement secret, even fending off questions from a concerned family member and bank employees. They had receipts and letters signed by government officials — solid proof it was for real. They didn't notice the odd wording, faded government seals and chronic misspelling. “We had a letter signed by Janet Yellen,” Larry Cook said, referring to the former U.S. treasury secretary. Two years later, the Cooks are still dealing with fallout from the scam, trying to avoid losing their Social Security benefits and paying taxes on the money they lost, which counted as income in 2023 and 2024. The Internal Revenue Service recently agreed they don't have to pay federal income tax on the scammed money. Maine legislators are working on a plan so they won't have to pay state income taxes. But they're still on the hook for a $24,000 underpayment to Medicare and Medicaid. Before you judge them for falling prey to one of the fastest growing scams, they want you to know that they didn't think they would ever be conned like this either. But while people ages 30-39 reported the greatest incidence of fraud in 2024 — 178 scams per 100,000 population, with a median loss of $450 — people age 80 and up reported the greatest losses, in part because they have more savings — 85 scams per 100,000 population, with a median loss of $1,650, according to the FTC. They were shopping at the Augusta Walmart on Sept. 21, 2023, when Barbara Cook got a cellphone call from people who said they were security personnel with Amazon and TD Bank. She was having trouble accessing her Amazon account at the time and had sent several emails seeking help, which lent credence to the call. They said his name and Social Security number were being used on the dark web to make purchases in New York state and California, which the Cooks denied making. The calls continued for days, including from FTC representatives, who accused the Cooks of being involved in illegal financial activity and threatened to investigate their entire family. Trying a different tack, they also said the Cooks' savings were at risk of being stolen by cyber scammers and had to be moved into safer accounts. They would close all accounts associated with Larry Cook's current Social Security number and give him a new number. They emailed documents purportedly signed by Yellen and other officials to prove their legitimacy. Then they assigned Ryan Terry to handle the case. “He insisted that we cooperate with a current FTC criminal investigation involving money laundering, bank fraud and other issues,” Larry Cook wrote in an account of their experience. When the Cooks resisted his pressure, they said Ryan threatened them with a federal indictment, “which would involve heavy court costs, legal fees and the possibility of ruining not only (our) reputation, but also that of our two sons, both successful businessmen.” In a final appeal, Ryan told the Cooks it was their “patriotic duty” to assist in the investigation and prosecution of these perpetrators. In early October 2023, they signed and returned letters of consent bearing what appeared to be the insignia of the U.S. Treasury Department. “But we were warned that all activity and information would have to be kept in total confidentiality, including from family members, our accountant, our lawyer — everyone,” Larry Cook said. Throughout their ordeal, they never told a soul. The number of complaints about government impersonation scams increased 50% over the last three years, from 11,554 incidents worth $240.6 million in 2022 to 17,367 incidents worth $405.6 million in 2024, according to the FBI's cybercrime center. Among people age 60 and up, scams involving cryptocurrency more than tripled in the same period, from 9,991 incidents worth $1 billion to 33,369 incidents worth $2.8 billion. Once you get enmeshed in the situation, it's almost like Stockholm syndrome.” The Cooks describe themselves as hardworking, honest, Christian people who don't lie and expect others to tell the truth, especially those in authority. They began dating at 15 and married 61 years ago, when Larry was a senior in college. Larry Cook made his fortune early, working first for an auto parts manufacturer, then as vice president of human resources for Johnson Matthey, a multinational precious metals and chemicals company. He knew his earnings as a pastor would not be so robust, but he was raised to be a penny-pincher. Barbara Cook went back to work as an executive secretary. “I've always wanted to help people,” he said. The Cooks experienced many of the tools in the scammer's toolbox — high pressure, threats, intimidation, fast-talking, fast-moving, emotional manipulation and what seemed to be a deep knowledge of their personal finances, family life and day-to-day whereabouts. “They had information before we told them anything,” Larry Cook said. The couple isn't sure whether the scammers got their initial contact and financial information through Barbara's Amazon account or from TD Bank. He had a slight foreign accent and called them sir and madam, things that seem like yellow flags in retrospect. But he calmed them down when they were stressed and shared personal information about himself. The Cooks also came to believe Ryan was tracking them through a WhatsApp account he helped to install on their phones. “When I was driving to a bodega in Lewiston and couldn't find a parking space, he told me spaces were available right around the corner,” Larry Cook said. He and Christopher Chabris, a cognitive scientist, co-authored a book on scams, “Nobody's Fool: Why We Get Taken In and What We Can Do About It.” “There's a lot of information online that's available to everyone,” Simons said. Simons said most cyber scams are run by international crime syndicates from call centers in places like Myanmar, Pakistan and India. Often they're staffed by victims of human trafficking who have no choice in the matter. They only have to catch a few,” Simons said. “It's not just a lone con artist anymore. In September, Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued Athena Bitcoin, one of the largest operators of bitcoin ATMs, charging that it neglected to implement anti-fraud measures when his office found that 93% of its deposits came from scams. But we all want to believe that people are telling us the truth. “We tend to have a truth bias and it takes a lot of effort to counter that,” Simons said. Ryan kept moving the goal posts, telling the Cooks repeatedly that “this will be the last time.” They never did tell anyone, not even their 20-something grandson when he interrupted their first bitcoin purchase. He pressed them to know why they were buying bitcoin. “I told him, ‘You just have to trust me on this. They struggle to remember exactly where, saying the experience is too painful to remember details they'd rather forget. They went to different branches because most had limited amounts of cash on hand, and they succeeded in dissuading any serious intervention. “All of them asked if I was being scammed,” Larry Cook said. Six times “undercover” couriers picked up cardboard boxes filled with cash or gold — four times in Maine and twice in Florida. The value of each package ranged from $50,000 to $150,000. In early 2024, the scammers seemed to grow skittish, the Cooks said, and Ryan indicated that TD Bank might be audited. He had them open a savings account with Chase Bank, where they were treated well, Larry Cook said. “I was getting a lot of questions at TD Bank, so it became clear that we weren't going to get more than $20,000 at a time,” he said. In October 2024, TD Bank pleaded guilty and was fined $1.8 billion for failing to maintain an anti-money laundering program and conspiring to commit money laundering. “By making its services convenient for criminals, TD Bank became one,” U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. TD Bank declined to discuss its fraud prevention protocols. The last cash transfer took place on April 8, 2024. The Cooks fed $50,000 into a bitcoin machine in Florida. But when they tried to call Ryan to find out how and when their $1.3 million would be returned, his WhatsApp account had been deleted. Legitimate investigations simply don't work this way.” While the Cooks' seven-month ordeal was at turns terrifying, exhausting, all-consuming and ultimately traumatic, they admit they were deflated afterward. It had been exciting, especially when they were fully absorbed into their roles as operatives in a federal investigation. They have shared their story at church and community meetings in Maine and Florida, where audience members lined up afterward to tell their own scam stories. And they are grateful to still have some financial resources so they can move to a retirement community in Pennsylvania. Their home on China Lake is up for sale. The Cooks are now wrangling with income tax and Social Security impacts of an $802,000 increase in their 2023 income and a $508,000 increase in their 2024 income as a result of fraud. Maine Revenue Services is poised to write off $60,000 that the Cooks owe on their state tax returns, and legislators are planning to change state law so $40,000 that the couple paid up front may be refunded eventually. “This is a bipartisan, all-hands-on-deck situation,” said Rep. Dan Sayre, D-Kennebunk, House chair of the Legislature's taxation committee. “It's unfortunate that these scams are getting more sophisticated. But so far, Social Security has been intractable. Under federal law, the Cooks' financial losses cannot be deducted from their income in assessing Medicare and Medicaid premiums, an administrative law judge said in a letter to Larry Cook last month. The judge acknowledged the Cooks experienced a “significant hardship” but said being scammed isn't among the qualifying life-changing events that can trigger a recalculation of premiums, or allow an independent decision if the perpetrators haven't been convicted of fraud or theft. With little chance of that happening, Social Security is deducting a combined $1,000 from the Cooks' $3,300 monthly benefits in 2025 and 2026 to offset a $24,000 underpayment to Medicare and Medicaid, they said. “I'm not anti-government, but when this kind of thing happens — they say it's the law, but the law never imagined fraud like this.” Kelley writes about some of the most critical aspects of Maine's economy and future growth, including transportation, immigration, retail and small business, commercial development and tourism, with...

This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. The group - which is made up of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland - looked at that data, along with the saving rates and salary increases of low paid employees - and compared them to its customers. This was used to justify a lower pay award." Lloyds defended the practice, stating: "In these situations, any insights used are always aggregated and anonymised to ensure both compliance with important data protection regulations and to support our common practice of using data to underpin our decision making." That's not a legitimate reason under the Data Protection Act." This, writes, Affinity general secretary Mark Brown, "needs to be investigated as a matter of priority". Affinity - which is not recognised by Lloyds - has also taken aim at "in-house lap dogs" Accord and Unite unions. "Instead of breaking off pay negotiations to tell their members what Lloyds had done, Accord and Unite agreed to the pay increases instead," says Affinity.

Yesterday the UAE officially launched the mBridge cross border CBDC platform with a payment to China. The ceremony was attended by the UAE's Vice President and Deputy Prime Minister, His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who executed the transaction.

HH Sheikh Mansour also Chairs the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE), with both the Governors of the CBUAE and the People's Bank of China in attendance in person. mBridge enables direct cross border payments between banks, sidestepping the need to use correspondent banking, enabling near instant international transfers. In June last year mBridge entered the minimum viable product (MVP) phase, with this announcement signalling it is now live.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market often feels like a cosmic test of timing. Anyone who brushed off XRP under $0.20 remembers exactly when it exploded past $1, creating life-changing returns for early believers. Now that XRP is trading far above its early accumulation zone, investors are again seeking the next 1000x crypto presale with similar early-stage potential. The project has already raised over $2.1M, with more than 300 buyers stepping into Stage 1 at a base price of just $0.02. Unlike XRP's quiet beginnings, LivLive is launching with massive bonuses, timed incentives, and a narrative built around real-world utility that rewards early movers before the broader market reacts. Instead of slowing momentum, the downturn triggered its strongest bonus structure to date. Buyers can double or triple their allocations instantly, creating an environment where hesitation becomes costly and early participation becomes the engine for oversized upside before Stage 1 closes. LivLive's tech stack is engineered for real-world utility rather than speculative hype. Its augmented-reality engine transforms physical locations into interactive earning spaces, while blockchain-verified presence ensures that every action is genuine and free from bot manipulation. Supporting this innovation is a rapid reward pipeline connected to the upcoming LivLive wearable. The wristband verifies location, unlocks quests, and syncs AR interactions in real time, enabling frictionless participation. A scalable API layer also allows brands and venues to deploy campaigns inside the platform. Together, these components give LivLive a competitive moat few presales can match. LivLive introduces a rare mechanic with its $2.5M Treasure Vault, where more than 300 winners will be selected across multiple reward cycles. With a top prize of $1M, participants gain tangible financial upside even before the token launches. Buyers using EARLY100 can double their allocation, while BOOST200 triples it for purchases of $2,000 or more. This means a $2,000 buy can convert into more than $6,000 worth of tokens at the very earliest valuation. XRP remains one of the most established digital assets in the market, backed by enterprise adoption, global liquidity, and a loyal community that has endured regulatory turbulence. Its resilience through multiple market cycles has positioned it as a dependable asset with long-term relevance. However, mature strength comes with slower growth, limiting the explosive multiplier potential that new investors often seek. The era of XRP under $0.20, when early buyers quietly secured life-changing positions, is now long gone. For investors seeking asymmetric upside, early access, and ground-level pricing, the opportunity zone has shifted. LivLive's combination of real-world earning mechanics, AR-driven exploration, blockchain validation, and wearable integration sets it apart from ordinary presales. The rapid $2.1M raise showcases undeniable momentum, and its bonus structure positions early participants with an advantage rarely found in emerging projects. Every layer of the ecosystem fuels long-term scalability and meaningful user engagement. XRP remains a powerful, reliable asset, but its early-stage upside has already played out. Secure your LivLive Stage 1 tokens now before bonuses expire and prices climb. This content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kevin Tang and Wyatt Raich used to work in digital assets at BlackRock, where they helped the company pivot from its loud skepticism of crypto to being one of Wall Street's major players in the sector. During this time, they came to feel it was too difficult for people overseas to participate in common investment opportunities like purchasing U.S. stocks. That's why they co-founded HelloTrade, a mobile-first, blockchain-powered trading platform. The company announced on Thursday that it raised $4.6 million in a first round of funding from Dragonfly Capital, with backing from Mirana Ventures, along with angel investors. “We see a huge market opportunity to make these traditional assets such as stocks and commodities accessible to anyone around the world with an internet connection,” Tang, co-founder and CEO of HelloTrade, said in an interview with Fortune. For example, people in Vietnam or Indonesia may want to buy Tesla stock. But through their current brokerage systems, those aren't easily accessible. By using crypto technology, HelloTrade plans to solve that problem. The platform also offers perpetual futures, which give customers more exposure to an asset than they would have in cash on the platform. HelloTrade's value proposition is similar to that of trading platforms like Robinhood and Revolut. Tang says those companies can be clunky and hard to use, and that HelloTrade will focus on building a better user interface. Tang worked as senior director on its digital assets team, and Raich was the head of engineering at its digital asset lab. In a report from last month, the well known venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz's crypto arm found that workers coming into crypto tend to come from a traditional finance background. This blending of Wall Street and crypto coincides with President Donald Trump's friendly policies toward the sector. Since last year's election, big banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have developed their blockchain technology. Tang and Raich often heard a saying at BlackRock: you spend decades building up trust, and you can lose it in a matter of minutes.

Sundaresan, who also goes by Metakovan, is best known for his 2021 purchase of Beeple's nonfungible token (NFT) work Everydays: The First 5000 Days for $69.3 million, which helped to make NFTs mainstream within the art market. Sundaresan, who is based in Singapore, says Padimai is a heritage, contemporary art and research institution “dedicated to the question of how technology can function as cultural infrastructure. Sundaresan envisions his venue supporting projects that “don't fit neatly into gallery timelines or commercial expectations, supporting artists to work with technologists, archivists, coders and designers in ways that allow the work to evolve organically rather than being rushed toward display,” and also exploring the preservation of digital works. The space opens with an Olafur Eliasson exhibition, Your view matter—an adaptation of a virtual reality work the Norwegian-Danish artist made in 2022. It will involve visitors moving through six digital installations which respond to their movement—with each person's experience recorded and stored on a blockchain-based system devised by Sundaresan. “Rather than focusing on novelty or market trends, we are interested in projects that operate at the intersection of embodiment, memory and digital infrastructure,” he says. Sundaresan says his own collection will inform but not dominate the space. With the NFT market still a fraction of its recent heights, the auction house has reportedly let go of key staffers</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The four-month assessment, funded by Brink, a non-profit organization that supports open-source Bitcoin protocol development, and coordinated by the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF), focused on the peer-to-peer networking layer — the network's primary attack surface — as well as adjacent components, including mempool management, chain state, transaction validation, and consensus logic, according to a Wednesday announcement. Completed in September, the audit totaled 100 man-days of work conducted by three Quarkslab engineers, with technical support from Brink and Bitcoin research and development firm Chaincode Labs. Before the code review began, two auditors worked in person with Brink engineers to familiarize themselves with Bitcoin Core's architecture and development practices. The process combined manual code analysis, dynamic testing, and advanced fuzzing techniques drawn from Bitcoin's existing continuous integration workflows. Fuzzing is an automated software testing technique that attempts to break code by feeding it large volumes of unexpected, random, or malformed data. Quarkslab reported no critical, high, or medium-severity findings. The auditors did identify two low-severity issues and provided 13 informational recommendations, none of which qualified as security vulnerabilities under Bitcoin Core's classification standards. "No high-impact issues were found, but marginal gain was brought on existing fuzzing harnesses as well as new ones to cover untested scenarios like chain reorganization," Quarkslab said. "While no findings with critical, high, or medium security impact were identified during this engagement, this audit provided valuable feedback, insight, information, and testing improvements for Bitcoin," OSTIF added. The results reinforce long-standing views of Bitcoin Core as a mature and conservatively engineered system maintained by dozens of contributors and reviewed by multiple organizations. "Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation that powers the Bitcoin network and helps secure trillions of dollars in value," Brink said. Bitcoin, like most major blockchains, relies on elliptic curve digital signatures, which are secure against classical attacks but theoretically vulnerable to Shor's algorithm on a future large-scale quantum computer. If elliptic curve cryptography were broken, private keys could be derived directly from exposed public keys — not through brute-force guessing, which would remain infeasible, but through a mathematical shortcut enabled by quantum algorithms. Researchers continue to debate timelines for when post-quantum upgrades may become necessary, with estimates ranging from a few years to decades, prompting ongoing exploration of migration paths that would protect funds once public keys are revealed. Native SegWit Bitcoin address formats that start with "bc1q" are considered more resistant to quantum attacks because they do not reveal the public key until funds are spent. Only the hashed public key is visible onchain, which would be far harder for a quantum computer to attack. This means funds stored at these addresses remain protected from quantum key-recovery attacks as long as they have never been spent and the public key has not otherwise been exposed. Once that spend occurs, however, the public key becomes visible, and any remaining funds tied to that address would inherit the same vulnerability — reinforcing long-standing guidance to avoid address reuse and move the full balance when spending. Bitcoin Core's review also follows recent debate within the Bitcoin ecosystem over client diversity and the relationship between Bitcoin Core and Knots — a derivative implementation that maintains certain policy and configuration options modified in Core's latest v30 release last month. The often-heated debate highlighted differing views on how Bitcoin should balance conservatism, optionality, and decentralization in its software stack.

Attackers gained access to user wallets through third-party security lapses,” wrote WLFI in the X post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>High-performance blockchain's public token sale reaches 75% of $187 million target with three days remaining, facing headwinds from market conditions and community concerns Monad's public token sale has raised $140 million toward its $187 million target with three days remaining before the sale closes on Saturday, marking a more cautious reception than recent comparable offerings despite the project's technical ambitions. The fundraise follows MegaETH's $1.4 billion ICO last month, which filled its $50 million allocation within five minutes and concluded 28x oversubscribed. Bitcoin traded $110,000 during the MEGA sale, while it's exchanging hands at around $92,000 currently. Purchases are subject to KYC requirements and geographic restrictions, excluding certain jurisdictions including most of Europe and New York where Coinbase operates under regulatory constraints. Monad positions itself as a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain designed for speed without sacrificing security or decentralization while maintaining full Ethereum compatibility. The project has spent several years developing what it describes as "state-of-the-art financial infrastructure" to power applications for a global user base. "The mission is to power a new world economy, suitable for a world that is increasingly online and onchain," the foundation said, outlining pillars focused on developer experience, global reach, and technical excellence. If the sale is undersubscribed, unsold tokens will be reallocated to ecosystem development. Polymarket currently gives Monad an 81% probability of attracting more than $300 million in total commitments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BlackRock Forms New Trust Amid Early Uptake of Staking-Focused Ethereum ETFs BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, registered a new Delaware statutory trust, the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, on Wednesday. Delaware Division of Corporations records show that the trust was formed on November 19. Forming a Delaware statutory trust is a common early step for ETF issuers, particularly for commodity and crypto products. The preparatory move, however, does not indicate that a filing is imminent. Decrypt has reached out to BlackRock and its registered agent for further information. Grayscale, meanwhile, became the first U.S. issuer to add staking to an exchange-listed Ethereum product in October, following the SEC's approval of generic crypto ETP listing standards, which enabled the firm to incorporate native staking into its Ethereum ETFs. The REX-Osprey ETH + Staking ETF, for example, reported about $2.4 million in assets as of mid-November, with trading activity remaining light since its launch. In Ethereum, staking means locking up Ethereum while staked so the network can choose users to validate transactions, in return for earned rewards. Staking remains a point of regulatory caution because it involves active participation in network validation and introduces operational, slashing, and custody risks that differ from simple asset holding. Issuers seeking to stake inside a registered product have had to detail validator selection, liquidity management, custody segregation, and how rewards will be accounted for under securities rules.
