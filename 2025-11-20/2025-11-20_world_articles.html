                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For more than six decades, the actor Dick Van Dyke has been pilloried for his attempts at a British accent in Mary Poppins (1964). Speaking on the Today TV programme in the US, Van Dyke, who turns 100 next month, said that Bond producer Albert Broccoli approached him after his performance in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in 1968 to ask if he fancied being a successor to Sean Connery. “Would you like to be Bond?” Van Dyke recalls Broccoli saying, to which he replied: “Have you heard my British accent?” In press since, Van Dyke has credited his notoriously inaccurate attempt in Mary Poppins to an Irish dialect coach, while also suggesting that cast and crew, including Julie Andrews, should have flagged with him any shortcomings. Van Dyke continued by saying that he is still actively seeking acting work, saying: “I don't want to [retire], I mean, it's my life. The star, who won three Emmys for The Dick Van Dyke Show, as well as a Tony award for Bye Bye Birdie, is promoting a new book, 100 Rules for Living to 100: An Optimist's Guide to a Happy Life. Three years later, he was rescued from a burning car on the California freeway, and in 2023 came another close call, when he lost control of his Lexus in rainy weather and crashed into a gate. Although Scottish, Irish and Australian stars have taken on the role, no American since Van Dyke is thought to have been in contention. Should he again fail to secure the role, Callum Turner, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Theo James are believed to be the frontrunners. Also, Julie Andrews was incorrectly described as being “London-born”.</p>

Trump, for example, called the disgraced New York financier a lifelong Democrat who “donated Thousands of Dollars to Democrat Politicians” — a statement that is true. Trump also downplayed his attempt to obstruct the release of files. “As everyone knows, I asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, to pass this Bill in the House and Senate, respectively,” Trump wrote. However, Trump only made that decision after months of describing calls for the files to be released a “hoax” against him, changing his mind only when it became evident that the legislation had enough bipartisan votes for passage. Trump's name reportedly appears within the Epstein files, but to what extent remains unclear. In July, after his Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that there would be no further investigation into Epstein — and that the files would remain private — Trump vehemently rejected calls for their release, taking on a deeply adversarial tone toward those who disagreed with him. However, some critics are concerned that Trump could still limit what will be available, as he has many options to restrict files. Trump could, for example, limit the release of files that relate to ongoing federal investigations. Indeed, Trump ordered Bondi to open new inquiries into several of his political adversaries just days before he announced support for the bill. Trump could also issue an executive order deeming certain documents' release as dangerous for national security or foreign policy reasons. DNC chair Ken Martin similarly expressed skepticism over Trump's sudden change of heart, stating: We can see where this is headed: He's already threatening to play games with the files that are released and those that are withheld. According to an Economist/YouGov survey published this week, four in five voters (80 percent) said they backed the release of the files, with only 7 percent opposed. Meanwhile, a plurality of respondents — nearly half, at 49 percent — believe Trump is trying to cover up Epstein's crimes.

BRUSSELS, November 20. /TASS/. Rome supports the use of frozen Russian assets of Ukraine and a reliable legal base is needed for that, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Italy Antonio Tajani told reporters.

"It is important to find a solution to use the frozen Russian assets. There is a need to find a legal basis that will make it possible to do this. Therefore, it is exclusive a legal matter and not a political one," Tajani said.

The stability of the Eurozone should be guaranteed and all the decisions must be analyzed together with the European Central Bank, he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel's forced removal of tens of thousands of Palestinians from refugee camps in the occupied West Bank earlier this year amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has alleged. According to a 105-page report released by the non-profit organization, 32,000 Palestinians were expelled by Israeli forces from three camps in January and February, while international attention was focused on Israel's war in Gaza, and they have not been allowed to return. As part of its research, HRW said it interviewed 31 displaced Palestinian refugees from Jenin, Tulkarem and Nur Shams refugee camps. The organization also analyzed satellite imagery and Israeli military demolition orders, as well as verified video and images of Israeli military operations. The HRW report claims that Israel stormed Jenin refugee camp on January 21, with Apache helicopters, drones, bulldozers, and armored vehicles carrying ground forces, to oust the Palestinians living there. It was like a movie scene – some had masks and they were carrying all kinds of weapons,” one 54-year-old woman told HRW. The displaced Palestinians have not been permitted to return home, the report found, adding that Israeli soldiers fired upon those who did attempt to re-enter. Only a few have been allowed to collect their belongings, it said, while HRW analysis of satellite imagery six months on found that more than 850 homes and other buildings had been damaged or destroyed across the camps. Instead, people were left to fend for themselves, seeking shelter wherever they could, including crowding into the homes of relatives or friends, or arriving at mosques or local charities. All three camps date back to the early 1950s, when they were established by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to house Palestinians who were expelled from their homes or forced to flee following Israel's creation in 1948. Those refugees and their descendants had resided there ever since. “Israeli authorities in early 2025 forcibly removed 32,000 Palestinians from their homes in West Bank refugee camps without regard to international legal protections and have not permitted them to return,” Nadia Hardman, a senior migrant rights researcher at HRW, said. “With global attention focused on Gaza, Israeli forces have carried out war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing in the West Bank that should be investigated and prosecuted.” Dozens of Israeli settlers launch arson attack in West Bank as attacks against Palestinians surge Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law. HRW is now calling for senior Israeli officials to be investigated over the expulsions, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth, the Central Command commander who oversaw West Bank military operations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian president's office issues statement after other officials condemn ‘absurd' plan to end conflict The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has said he will negotiate with Donald Trump on a US-backed peace plan that called on Kyiv to make painful concessions in order to end the Kremlin's invasion of his country. Zelenskyy's office on Thursday confirmed that he had received the draft peace plan, which was prepared by US and Russian officials, and that he would speak with Trump in the coming days about “existing diplomatic opportunities and the main points that are necessary for peace”. Zelenskyy's public statement came as he held talks on Thursday with a high-ranking US army delegation. Other officials in Kyiv said the proposal reportedly drafted by Kirill Dmitriev, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, and Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff was a “provocation”, the aim of which was to stir up division and “disorientate” Ukraine's allies, they added. “There are currently no signs that the Kremlin is ready for serious negotiations. Putin is trying to stall for time and avoid US sanctions,” said Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of Ukraine's foreign policy parliamentary committee. Ukraine's first deputy foreign minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, called the initiative unrealistic. He suggested it was a classic Soviet-style information operation to influence opinion and sow panic. According to media reports, the sweeping 28-point proposal closely resembles demands made by Moscow soon after its full-scale invasion in early 2022. It was reportedly drawn up by Russian and US officials, with support from Donald Trump. No foreign troops would be allowed on Ukrainian soil, a condition that rules out a post-deal peacekeeping force led by the UK and France. But the US would provide unspecified security guarantees, according to Axios. It comes nearly four years after Russian troops tried, and failed, to seize Kyiv, and as efforts by the Trump administration to end the conflict remain stalled. On Thursday, Zelenskyy met the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, whom Trump named last week as a “special representative”. Keith Kellogg, Trump's special representative to Ukraine, has reportedly announced his resignation, saying he would leave in January after a year in the post. Kellogg is regarded as being broadly sympathetic to Ukraine and has been consequently left out of direct US-Russian talks. His former business partner Timur Mindich and at least two government ministers are accused of involvement in a large-scale bribery scheme. Several deputies from Zelenskyy's own Servant of the People party have called on the president to dismiss Andriy Yermak, his powerful chief of staff. One western diplomat said the Russians were seeking to take advantage of Ukraine's domestic crisis. “It seems Dmitriev has spun this plan at a time when Zelenskyy is weak. I don't think it's going to fly with Ukraine.” The Trump administration no longer provided direct military aid to Kyiv, a fact that reduced its ability to impose a Moscow-friendly peace settlement on Ukraine, one source noted. So we expect to be consulted,” said Poland's foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said Europe welcomed any efforts to achieve a long-lasting and just settlement of the war, but stressed: “For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.” Kallas said the Dmitriev-Witkoff proposal did not envisage Russia making any concessions. If Russia really wanted peace, it could have agreed to an unconditional ceasefire already some time ago.” But it emphasised that “only the Ukrainian people can determine their future” and said Russia could end the fighting tomorrow by pulling out troops and ending its “illegal invasion”. Trump said last month that he was putting on hold his plan for a meeting with the Russian president in Budapest because he didn't want it to be a “waste of time”. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, met in Ankara, saying they were committed to finding a peaceful settlement. In recent months Russia has increased its systematic attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, plunging much of the country into darkness.</p>

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. The Gaza Strip is facing an ever-deepening crisis in medical care and rehabilitation. By September 2025, that number had almost doubled: More than 41,800 people in Gaza now require long-term rehabilitation due to injuries. With restrictions on the entry of medical equipment, prosthetic limbs and mobility aids such as wheelchairs and crutches have become nearly inaccessible. These are beloved people who have lost parts of their bodies — not just numbers in UN reports. During a visit to Shuhada Al-Aqsa Hospital to check on my friend after her home was struck by an Israeli missile, I met Nour, whose hands were injured, and her little sister Alaa, a 5-year-old girl whose arm and leg were amputated. That day, shrapnel hit my hand, back, and face. One fragment lodged near a nerve in my hand, where it still remains, a constant reminder of what so many of us have endured. There were no wheelchairs or crutches in the hospital. It was also the crushing feeling of helplessness and total dependence on others at a time when she should have been receiving care and emotional support. In times of war, caring for a wounded child who cannot even relieve themselves without help becomes an unbearable burden, even for those who love them deeply. Recently, reports spread about a young woman from Gaza named Nibal Al-Hissi, who pleaded through media and social networks for a medical referral that would allow her to travel abroad to receive prosthetic limbs. She spoke to me through tears, her voice heavy with grief and longing for a life she had lost — “I had so many dreams and ambitions…” Al-Hissi, 25 years old, lived in northern Gaza with her 2-year-old daughter, Rita. During one Israeli airstrike, their home was bombed while she was holding Rita in her arms, trying to shield her from the blast. Since that day, Al-Hissi has been unable to hold or feed her daughter, yet she continues to fight every day through pain, isolation, and a fragile hope of getting treatment. Now, she depends entirely on her family for everything — eating, drinking, moving, and even basic personal care. Al-Hissi says that everything in her life has become difficult, from the unhealed wounds to the loneliness that her disability has imposed, to the postponed dream of receiving prosthetic limbs that would restore even a small part of her independence. Despite the growing number of those needing complex surgeries or prosthetics, medical referrals remain scarce and heavily bureaucratic, often taking months for approval if they ever arrive at all. The Rafah crossing, the only real gateway for patients, opens and closes unpredictably due to political and security conditions, leaving thousands of wounded people trapped in endless waiting. Behind every referral request lies a human story suspended between hope and despair. Patients wait for a phone call or a travel permit that could mean life itself, as their days fade away in pain and immobility inside hospitals lacking even the most basic resources. And if death sometimes seems easier than losing a part of yourself, then choosing to live afterward, despite it all, is the purest form of resistance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The International Practical Science Forum "Without a Statute of Limitations: Nuremberg, 80 Years On" has become a platform for shaping a unified stance against Nazism in today's day and age and demonstrated that the legacy of Nuremberg remains a relevant principle of the global order, TASS Director General Andrey Kondrashov said at the forum's opening. "Today marks another step along the long road of the No Statute of Limitations project. It is a path of truth, memory, and justice that began in Nuremberg 80 years ago and continues today, in our time. This forum has become a venue for interdepartmental dialogue and for developing a unified position rejecting Nazism - both in historical retrospect and in the present day," he said. Kondrashov, who moderated the opening session, expressed deep gratitude to Yelena Malysheva, head of the National Center for Historical Memory under the Russian president. He praised her for "the path of truth, memory, and justice she is leading us on today," emphasizing that "she is a true activist who will not allow our history to be distorted." He also underscored the crucial role of media coverage in preserving historical truth. The task of the media is to build strong public immunity to historical revisionism," he noted. The International Practical Science Forum "Without a Statute of Limitations: Nuremberg, 80 Years On" is timed to the anniversary of the start of the international military tribunal against the main Nazi war criminals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A.S. Hamrah is a writer and resident film critic for the New York-based n+1 literary magazine.Supplied It is deceptively easy to label A.S. Hamrah a doomsayer. Written in diary fashion, Last Week collects one example after another of the contemporary film industry's self-imposed injuries, from its disastrous love affair with AI to the ongoing hubris of Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav (whose cocky, sunglasses-clad mug adorns the book's cover). Yet speaking with Hamrah the other week as he promotes both Last Week and Algorithm of the Night, his deeply satisfying and frequently hilarious collection of n+1 writing from 2019 to 2025, it becomes clear that the critic isn't a cynical fatalist so much as a till-death-do-we-part champion of movie-going, a true cinephile whose unerring and cutting criticism makes the cultural world feel less empty and doomed than it may appear. Both of these books strike me as some of the most depressing things I've ever read, but in an invigorating and almost existentially hopeful way. This is all stuff I've been feeling in the air, but collected into two concise collections of writing. The diary-like form of Last Week had a particularly cumulative effect on me. It started in March of 2024, when I was reading the news and there were four ridiculous things that caught my eye. So I posted them on my Instagram stories, just examples of the stupidity of what's going on in the film industry right now, and my followers seemed to like it. That turned into a newsletter, and before you know it I had 1,000 subscribers, and now a book. It can get a little depressing, especially when we get to the L.A. wildfires, the death of David Lynch. And you're always careful to check in with Warner's David Zaslav about whatever ridiculous thing he's up to. It's an interesting time to be talking about Zaslav, especially as we're in the midst of Warner Bros. being either swallowed up by another studio, maybe disappearing altogether into Netflix's catalogue. There's something particularly depressing about the potential Warner Bros. sale. When Disney bought Fox a while ago, for some reason that didn't register as very depressing, though it was. But with Zaslav you get the sense that he's this kind of villainous character, who maybe his plan all along was to lead to some kind of consolidation that's going to lead to a worse product that costs more money for the moviegoer. All this stuff should be much more regulated than it is. When you published your previous book of collected essays in 2018, The Earth Dies Streaming, you described the times as “very bleak,” yet they only feel bleaker now. How do you reconcile that mood with your work as a critic, trying to make sense of the art that is put out into the world at such a tremulous time? The landscape that I described back then has gotten worse, yes. But at the same time, because it's gotten worse, the year after my book came out, 2019, now appears as a somewhat golden age for cinema. The pandemic of course was a real opportunity for studios to make a fundamental change in their business regarding streaming, and I feel it was a kind of gleeful moment because they could really envision the end of theatrical exhibition, which they don't like because they can't really control it to the extent that they wish they did. In the first book, I was talking about a world in which streaming was going to take over the world. Now, they've moved on and want to do away with the cinema altogether by turning it into a fully automated assembly line using, at every step in the process, with artificial intelligence, with as few humans involved as possible. But the question was about how do I continue working as a critic, yeah? There are very good films made all over the world. It's not an important component of the cinema in general. I feel it's important to document that as a critic. And most criticism today doesn't do that, so much. It can be more service-oriented, in a way ... It's just responding to films on a case-by-case basis, pretending that there are no problems in the industry. Vanity Fair just got rid of their film critic. But I also keep my overhead very low.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine has identified a Russian commander it accuses of “systematic and coordinated war crimes” in Bucha, near Kyiv, where hundreds of civilians were murdered during its brief occupation by Russian troops in 2022. Yurii Vladimirovich Kim, the commander of a platoon in Russia's 76th Air Assault Division, is accused of ordering his troops to murder civilians between March 7 and April 1 2022, according to an indictment from Ukraine's Prosecutor General. Hundreds of civilians were found buried in mass graves, others were tortured and executed in basements. Lawyers from Global Rights Compliance, assisting Ukrainian officials in evidence gathering, said the case against Kim is founded on witness testimonies, forensics, crime scene reconstructions, identity parades, maps and open source intelligence. Kim is also accused of ordering the bodies of victims to be burned to cover up the crimes. “The case highlights a methodical approach to war crimes committed by Russian forces, indicating that many atrocities in Bucha were part of a highly coordinated criminal plan that implicates Russian leadership,” Global Rights Compliance wrote in a statement. Ukraine has previously named soldiers and at least one commander it says is guilty of mass murder in Bucha. “We have moved beyond bringing low-ranking perpetrators to account — now we are uncovering the chain of command decisions through which ordinary orders turned into mass executions of civilians,” Maksym Tsutskiridze, First Deputy Head of the National Police of Ukraine wrote in a statement issued by the lawyers. The Kremlin has denied its troops killed civilians in Bucha and has accused Ukraine of creating fake images of civilian bodies in the town. CNN has approached the Russian government for comment. This story has been updated to remove the line saying Kim was the first commander to be issued with a Notice of Suspicion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global markets rose in a relief rally after AI chip giant Nvidia released forecast-topping earnings yesterday and as traders assessed delayed U.S. jobs data out this morning. A U.S Labor Department report showed nonfarm payrolls increased in September by 119,000, compared with an estimate of a 50,000 rise. On Wall Street, markets are watching earnings from Walmart Inc., Intuit Inc. and NetEase Inc. “It's fair to say that Nvidia's results have completely changed the market mood and pushed out any bubble fears for another day,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said. Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.87 per cent in morning trading. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei closed 2.65 per cent higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.02 per cent. Oil prices advanced after falling yesterday as a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles offset speculation that a U.S. push to end the Russia-Ukraine war may add barrels to an amply supplied market. Brent crude futures were up 0.9 per cent to US$64.08 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were 0.9 per cent higher at US$59.95. NG analysts cautioned in a note that Ukraine was unlikely to back the plan as it could see it favouring Russia, but “signs that the U.S. is still trying to work on a deal eases some concerns over further sanctions against Russia and also how strongly current curbs will be enforced.” In other commodities, spot gold was steady at US$4,074.09 an ounce. U.S. gold futures for December delivery fell 0.2 per cent to US$4,073.70 an ounce. The Canadian dollar was little changed against its U.S. counterpart. The day range on the loonie was 71.06 US cents to 71.22 US cents in early trading. The U.S. dollar index, which weighs the greenback against a group of currencies, was down 0.04 per cent to 100.19.

The government is set to raise fees for residence procedures for foreign nationals to levels comparable to those in Europe and the United States in the next fiscal year, according to government and ruling party sources. Revenue from the fee increase will fund policy initiatives related to foreigners, including to improve conditions for the rapidly growing foreign resident population and to deport illegal residents. The government is considering including the following statement in its soon-to-be-drafted economic package: “In fiscal 2026, we will review and raise fees related to foreign residents and visa fees, taking into account the levels in major countries.” Residence permit fees were raised by ¥2,000 in April this year, setting them at ¥6,000 for changing residence status and renewing stays and ¥10,000 for those applying for permanent residence. This reflects rising prices and labor costs. The government is considering a plan that would raise fees for changing residence status and renewing stays of one year or longer to somewhere between ¥30,000 and ¥40,000, and that would increase the cost for a permanent residency permit to ¥100,000 or more. As the law currently sets a maximum fee of ¥10,000, an amendment will be required. In the United States, changing or renewing one's work permit costs $420 to $470 (about ¥65,000 to ¥73,000), and in Britain it costs £827 (about ¥169,000). In June, Japan's foreign resident population stood at a record high of about 3.96 million people, according to the Immigration Services Agency. The government aims to use the revenue from higher fees to improve conditions for foreign residents, such as by speeding up immigration screening and enhancing Japanese language education. Measures to deal with the roughly 70,000 illegal residents will also be strengthened. Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry plans to raise fees for visas to levels comparable to Europe and the United States in the next fiscal year. If implemented, this would be the first increase since 1978. Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. According to Brovdi, 1st Separate Center for Unmanned Systems "Magyar's Birds" hit the Ryazan oil refinery overnight. "Gasoline is now gradually becoming a scarce commodity in Russia, while gas and oil are quickly running out," Brovdi said Due to falling debris, a fire broke out on the territory of one enterprise," Governor Pavel Malkov claimed. Ryazan, the region's capital, is located 180 kilometers (120 miles) southeast of Moscow and about 450 kilometers (280 miles) from Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia along Sumy Oblast. Russia's oil and gas production has continued to come under attack as Kyiv attempts to cripple Moscow's primary source of funding for its war in Ukraine. Ukraine's General Staff reported on Nov. 16 that Ukrainian forces struck the Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery in Russia's Samara Oblast and a drone storage site belonging to Russia's elite Rubikon unit. Volodymyr Ivanyshyn is a news editor for The Kyiv Independent. He is pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, majoring in political science with a minor in anthropology and human geography. Volodymyr holds a Certificate in Business Fundamentals from Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto. He previously completed an internship with The Kyiv Independent. During a joint press conference with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Nov. 19, Merz said that Germany is "doing everything possible" to equip Ukrainian army with long-range weapon systems. An oil refinery was reportedly hit in Ryazan Oblast overnight on Nov. 20, local residents claimed. The Russian attack on Ternopil killed at least 26 people, including three children, and injured 93 others, among them 18 children, according to Ukraine's Emergency Service. Kellogg's exit will leave Ukraine without its chief advocate in the Trump White House as the country faces escalating Russian attacks and a domestic corruption crisis. Rescue operations are still underway as authorities search for 26 people believed to be trapped under the rubble of a destroyed apartment building in Ternopil, western Ukraine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. The State Department has significantly reduced its staff and programming. In The New York Times, Jamie Shea, a former NATO official, referred to these sweeping changes as the United States' “soft power suicide.” Many experts and commentators have interpreted the United States' loss as China's gain. The two countries take distinct approaches to building soft power: China has tended to rely on drawing in other countries with pragmatic benefits, whereas the United States has placed ideals and values at the center of its outreach. Recipient countries, especially those in the so-called global South, have perceived Chinese and U.S. offerings as complementary, accepting both rather than seeing a need to choose one over the other. Over the last three years, and especially since Trump's reelection, China's relative position has undoubtedly improved. But this has not turned China into a global leader in soft power. Beijing is generally looked upon more favorably than before, yet that change in attitude varies significantly from region to region, and even the countries that hold the most positive views of China regard its actions with a mix of appreciation and resentment. China may be passively gaining stature from the United States' soft-power retreat, but that is not enough to guarantee greater global influence in the years ahead. Chinese interpretations of soft power differ from Nye's original definition, which emphasizes culture, values, and foreign policy as the key ingredients of a country's ability to influence others without coercion. In Chinese writings, cultural power is fused together with material power: Beijing considers its economic development model, technological innovation, and material assistance to developing countries, not just its traditional culture and principles, to be vectors of soft power. When Chinese leaders try to appeal to developing countries, they consistently underscore China's pursuit of mutual economic benefit and its understanding of human rights as a concept rooted in economic rights and material well-being, rather than in individual and political freedom. Diplomacy is about offering something practical to other countries, whether that is trade deals (which are often announced with some kind of cultural spectacle), infrastructure projects, or training and educational programs that bring thousands of officials, policymakers, journalists, and students to China. Steep U.S. tariffs have ensured that China, which still embraces trade (even if it is criticized for its unfair practices), is the more economically accessible of the two countries. Yet China does not appear to be ramping up its developmental assistance, even though Trump's policies provide it an opportunity. Beijing's recent pledges of lending assistance to developing countries have been smaller than in the past, and there is little sign so far of that trend changing. At a May summit between China and the 33-country Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, for instance, Beijing promised members of the bloc $9.2 billion in credit—less than half of what it pledged at the same summit in 2015. These reductions reflect Beijing's effort to “revise” its Belt and Road Initiative by focusing on “small and beautiful” projects—downsizing, in effect—which is likely a response to both China's domestic economic pressures and the soaring debt that many BRI countries have accumulated. There are few signs that China aims to fill other gaps left by USAID, either. Prior to 2025, China's foreign-aid budget (separate from its development finance funds) was a fraction of the United States' pre-2025 budget, and much of it was disbursed as concessional loans, rather than grants. This year, only in a handful of cases—such as increasing its contributions to Cambodia's largest demining organization and offering informal assurances that it will provide humanitarian aid to Nepal—has Beijing jumped in to meet the needs of countries affected by the USAID cuts. These isolated examples do not add up to a wholesale reorientation of Chinese diplomacy. The United States has also reduced its promotion of democratic values and human rights abroad, no longer taking pains to position itself as an aspirational democracy. This leaves another vacuum that China could, in theory, fill with an ideological agenda of its own—but Beijing may not be willing or able to do so. China's approach to soft power has generally focused less on the promotion of political ideals and values than that of the United States. This may be slowly changing, particularly as Chinese officials talk about principles such as noninterference and promote an alternative path to modernization and democracy in summit diplomacy and in the training sessions they run for foreign-policy makers. But China's messaging does not offer, as the United States' messaging once did, a clear vision of the country's role in the global order, nor a coherent model to “export.” This may be intentional, as it gives China flexibility and helps it present itself as a less imposing global power than the United States has been. A main theme of Beijing's ideological promotion today is to differentiate China from the West. In a comment in Russian media in July, for example, China's ambassador to Russia criticized the United States for abandoning the postwar global order and described China, by comparison, as a country able to keep its promises. The Chinese-led SCO, for instance, has expanded its agenda from border security to global diplomacy, and has grown from a group of six countries in 2001 to one with ten full members, 14 dialogue partners, and two observers today, with more countries waiting to join. Yet China's messaging does not go much further than criticizing the dominance of the United States and demanding more say in international institutions and governance mechanisms. It falls short of delineating and inspiring an alternative world order. As I found in a study of training seminars for African policymakers, Chinese educators and officials do not try to sell the Chinese political system as something wholly different, but instead adopt and invert Western concepts to promote it. The Chinese leaders of these training sessions, moreover, rarely provide a roadmap for how to imitate China, even when it comes to topics such as poverty alleviation in which China is widely regarded as successful. In one striking scene at a seminar in Addis Ababa, an Ethiopian official asked the Chinese lecturer to at least provide some specific advice on how Ethiopia could mimic China's accomplishments. Technical trainings related to agriculture or Chinese technology transfers likely do offer more specific lessons, but African officials and journalists have told me that concrete suggestions about China's broader developmental and political experience are limited. In recent months, the growing popularity of Chinese popular culture products such as Labubu dolls, the animated film Ne Zha 2, and several popular video games, along with Chinese technologies including the artificial intelligence platform DeepSeek, have inspired such headlines as “How China became cool.” This kind of cultural influence can translate to greater affinity for China's values and governance principles, especially when foreign publics latch onto films and video games that glorify Chinese history, traditions, and futuristic technology. Exports such as Labubu dolls and DeepSeek more plainly relate to commercial and technological acumen—something that can bolster China's material soft power but will not necessarily spread its vision. One approximation is public opinion polls, which have shown China receive at least a passive boost in popularity since Trump's reelection. A July Pew survey across 24 countries found that more people still view the United States favorably than they do China, but the gap is closing. The United States has suffered a large decline in positive perceptions since spring 2024—favorable views of the country dropped 20 percentage points in Canada, for instance—whereas China has made marginal gains. In another recent survey across five major Latin American countries, more people preferred China to the United States as an economic partner in every country polled. In these regions, concern about the security threat Beijing poses likely outweighs attraction to the economic opportunities it has to offer, even as Washington pulls back. Ethiopian officials who took part in diplomatic training programs in China told me that they admired China's economic prowess and appreciated its material offerings, but they remained skeptical of Beijing's promises of cooperation bringing mutual gain, asking, “Is it a win-win or a China win?” Many struggled to articulate China's perspective on global affairs beyond a pursuit of self-interest. Even in a country such as Ethiopia, which is more favorably disposed toward China, university students across the country have expressed to me a mix of approval and apprehension about the long-term implications of Belt and Road projects. Many invoked the high debt owed to China (Ethiopia is China's second-largest loan recipient in Africa) and the possibility that China could end up taking over critical projects and sectors if Ethiopia can't pay back its loans. In Central Asia, where many countries are also relatively pro-China, organized protests against Chinese infrastructure and energy projects, among other issues, have grown more common in the last decade. Among countries that prefer to hedge between major powers or to avoid alignment, the withdrawal of the United States generates even more unease, as it leaves China's presence uncontested. For now, Beijing seems to be holding back rather than fully taking advantage of the United States' decline. China's ideological message still draws largely on resentment toward the West, rather than presenting a compelling alternate international vision or offering concrete, replicable policy lessons. Many foreign publics remain wary of China, especially when it comes to global leadership. Yet Beijing's conservative approach may be strategic, rather than a sign of weakness or disregard for soft power. China is avoiding overcommitment and opening itself up to greater scrutiny over its domestic politics and global vision while still enjoying passive gains from the U.S. withdrawal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. ELLIOTT ABRAMS is a Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. He served as Special Representative for Venezuela in the first Trump administration and as Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America in the Reagan administration. And Why Regime Change Is the Only Way Forward in Venezuela On the last day of October, CBS's 60 Minutes asked U.S. President Donald Trump about his policy on Venezuela and his thoughts about that country's dictator, Nicolas Maduro. “Are Maduro's days as president numbered?” asked Norah O'Donnell. This phlegmatic response was a good summary of current U.S. policy: Washington favors Maduro's downfall, but its position lacks clarity and is not backed by the actions—including military strikes inside Venezuela—that would bring about the outcome U.S. officials appear to want. And therein lies the danger for Trump and his administration: that after a great deal of chest-thumping and a show of naval force aimed at Maduro, they will leave him in place. In that scenario, Maduro would emerge as the survivor who bested Trump and showed that American influence in the Western Hemisphere is limited at best. Regime change would result in reduced migration to the United States, less drug trafficking, more freedom and prosperity in Venezuela, and an end to the country's cooperation with China, Cuba, Iran, and Russia, which gives countries hostile to U.S. interests a base of operations on the South American mainland. The use of American military force to overthrow Maduro would not be without risk. But regime change would not require any ground deployments of U.S. forces except, at most, Special Forces raids against regime figures who have already been indicted for narcoterrorism by U.S. law enforcement. Most recently, Trump has left open the possibility of more talks with Maduro while also signaling that deploying U.S. troops to Venezuela remained an option, as well. Nearly 60 countries joined the United States in recognizing Juan Guaidó, who had been National Assembly speaker, as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela. But those U.S. efforts failed, because economic and diplomatic pressure was simply insufficient against a regime willing to use violence and brutal repression against the Venezuelan people to stay in power. When Trump left office in 2021, Maduro was still ruling Venezuela. In the ensuing years, the repression, economic ruin, refugee flows, and trafficking in drugs, gold, and human beings have continued. Back in 2020, Maduro had been indicted by U.S. federal prosecutors, who charged him with, among other things, conspiring to commit narcoterrorism and leading a drug-trafficking organization known as Cartel de los Soles, or “cartel of the suns.” The State Department announced a $15 million reward for information that led to his arrest; this past January, that amount was raised to $25 million. In addition to this diplomatic, political, economic, and legal pressure, the Trump administration has added more direct forms of coercion. And a lack of enthusiasm for and commitment to the goal of bringing down the regime (plus perhaps a lack of capability) meant that Washington took no effective covert actions, either. Typically, the U.S. Fourth Fleet, covering Latin America and adjacent waters, has no vessels permanently assigned to it and has only four to six surface ships under its command. This suggests that the list will expand to include targets inside Venezuela. “We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,” Trump said in mid-October. Around the same time, U.S. officials told The New York Times that Trump had authorized the CIA to carry out a program of covert action inside Venezuela, although its parameters and objectives remain secret. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio put it, “This is a counterdrug operation.” The New York Times recently reported that Rubio held a private meeting with House and Senate leaders earlier this month during which he “insisted that ousting Mr. Maduro was not the administration's objective.” But if Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela and is instead a narcoterrorist and a cartel kingpin, it would be difficult to understand why the Trump administration would surround the country with a gigantic armada only to leave him in power. As a result, this “Chevron exception” to the sanctions helps him stay in power. In effect, this means the Trump administration is telling them to return to a country for which the State Department's travel warning tells Americans this: “Do not travel to or remain in Venezuela due to the high risk of wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, and poor health infrastructure. All U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents in Venezuela are strongly advised to depart immediately.” It continues: “Violent crimes, such as homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, are common. Police and security forces have instituted a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy or anti-regime demonstrations.” Describing Venezuela as a hell on earth led by a vicious criminal and then ending temporary protected status suggests mixed motives and no clear policy. In Trump's first term, the administration received reliable reports about Iranian plans to transfer missiles to Venezuela—which the administration concluded would be unacceptable and would be stopped, with the use of force, if need be. Iranian drones that can reach Israel from Iranian territory can also reach U.S. territory from Venezuela—potentially hitting Puerto Rico and U.S. facilities there. Today, Iran uses Venezuela as a base for Hezbollah activity, money laundering, acquisition of blank passports for use by its agents, and other actions that Trump should stop by putting an end to the regime that enables them. As for Cuba, the Maduro regime gives it between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil per day, on average, for free or with a huge discount—a critical source of support for the communist regime in Havana. A democratic government in Caracas would end that subsidy for repression. The doubling of the reward for Maduro was clearly meant to incentivize regime officials or military leaders to break with him now. Presumably, one of the CIA's jobs is to convey to them that Maduro is going down—but they need not go down with him. That messaging should include discussion of a potential amnesty (something that has accompanied every Latin American transition to democracy) and assurances that, under a democratic government, the Venezuelan military would be better equipped and more professional, with plenty of room for advancement when some top Maduro cronies are weeded out. Over the years, there has been plenty of military unrest in Venezuela, and hundreds of officers have been arrested and remain in the regime's hellish prisons (or have died there). Last year, a former Venezuelan army lieutenant who became a dissident, Ronald Ojeda, was murdered while living in exile in Chile—a killing that Chile's leftist government blamed on “instructions or orders given by the Venezuelan authorities.” The case shows not only the criminal and terrorist nature of the Maduro regime but the extent of its nervousness about any military dissidence. But the regime has had decades to coup-proof itself with massive help from Cuba. Merely starving it will not be enough: it must be forced out of power with military strikes, which will throw the regime's support structures, including in the military, into disarray and make them fear for their own futures. They will see the beginning of the use of force by the United States, but they will not know where it might end: they will be left wondering whether there will be more strikes at military targets or at regime physical assets, whether Washington will use Special Forces to apprehend indicted regime leaders, and whether the United States might even carry out a small invasion. The goal is to replace regime confidence with fear, and insiders' displays of loyalty with their search for escape hatches. Soldiers are also Venezuelan citizens, after all, who have seen how their own families and neighbors have been forced to live or flee under Maduro's reign. But creating the conditions for Maduro's overthrow will require hitting more than just drug-trafficking boats in international waters, because such strikes do not telegraph to Venezuelans that the regime is truly under great threat of losing power. First, Washington should expand its target list to include drug-trafficking speedboats in ports in addition to those on the high seas, because the threat must be brought home to the Venezuelan military. To protect U.S. planes that may strike targets in Venezuela (and to demonstrate that such strikes are planned), U.S. forces should destroy Venezuela's air defense systems, F-16 fighter aircraft at the Palo Negro Air Base, and Sukhoi jets at the air base located on La Orchila, an island about 100 miles off the coast. Airstrikes should also target small airstrips in western Venezuela used for drug trafficking and bases in western Venezuela used by the National Liberation Army (known by its Spanish acronym, ELN), a Colombian terrorist group aligned with Maduro and also engaged in narcotics traffic. No single step would have a greater effect on the Venezuelan military, intelligence services, and police than removing Diosdado Cabello, the regime's chief thug, who is currently serving as interior minister and thus controls the police. Cabello was indicted in New York in 2020 for conspiracy to commit narcoterrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine, and the U.S. State Department has offered a reward of $25 million for information leading to his capture owing to his participation “in a corrupt and violent narco-terrorism conspiracy between the Cartel of the Suns . and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.” Removing him from power would show everyone in the regime's security organs that they were not safe, and that its power to protect itself and them was fast eroding. It is not likely that his regime could withstand such an assault. No such policy is without risk—including the fact that failure could leave Maduro in power and weaken American credibility and prestige. That outcome would strengthen not only Maduro and other leaders of his ilk, such as Miguel Díaz-Canel in Cuba and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, it would guarantee more drug trafficking and more migration from Venezuela. “Regime change” is hardly a phrase associated with Trump, but the goals he has stated in Venezuela require it. The Maduro regime depends on illicit activities to remain in power, and U.S. descriptions of Maduro as a criminal are accurate. The military juntas of the past were amenable to negotiated agreements with democratic political parties wherein they left power in exchange for some form of amnesty for their coups and related crimes. Maduro and his top lieutenants, by contrast, are drug traffickers, under U.S. indictment for narcoterrorism and other crimes such as money laundering. While, in theory, all the indictments could be quashed in return for their leaving power—the deal that was rejected by Panama's Manuel Noriega—only the clear U.S. intent to remove the regime will make Venezuela's criminal leaders even consider such an alternative outcome. And they know that even if the United States agrees to end criminal prosecutions, Venezuela or the International Criminal Court may come after them. Such negotiations can be tried but are an illusory path; this criminal regime must be forced from power if Venezuela is to have a decent future. Venezuela is a far better candidate for regime change and a return of democracy than were countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. The country has no significant ethnic or religious divisions. It has a long tradition of close financial, commercial, social, educational, and military contacts with the United States. Trump is obviously reluctant to launch strikes inside Venezuela. It's a fair guess that it isn't the problem of how to legally justify and defend such strikes that is deterring him, but his own doubts about the chances of success. And if Trump backs down, he would not acknowledge defeat; he would instead claim that his only goal had been to depress drug trafficking. He would declare victory and cite statistics showing that the number of drug shipments on boats in the Caribbean had gone down—which it would have. But once the U.S. fleet is withdrawn, those shipments will inexorably rise again—and the Cartel de los Soles and its putative leader, Maduro, will be back in business with the wind in their sails. So although Trump may feel he is not yet committed, in fact his own prestige and American credibility are already on the line. His advisers should persuade him that he's already past the point of no return: the game is on, and either he wins or Maduro wins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. U.S. President Donald Trump is mounting yet another push to end Russia's war against Ukraine, as Washington begins testing a new peace framework that has already sparked unease among Ukrainian officials. A source in the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent that a new peace plan is being crafted by U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, who's been in direct contact with Kirill Dmitriev, Russia's senior economic negotiator. Washington has signaled that Ukraine is expected to accept a framework for ending the war that would require Kyiv to give up territory and relinquish certain weapons systems. The reported proposals also include reducing Ukraine's army, among other concessions. A source in the President's Office was decidedly unenthusiastic about the possible plan when speaking to the Kyiv Independent, adding that Washington appears to be shifting toward a framework aligned with Moscow's demands. During previous rounds of talks, the Kremlin had softened some of its maximalist demands, limiting its focus to territorial concessions from Ukraine. The demands previously dropped, however, seem to be resurfacing. Speaking the same day, Trump made it clear that he still hopes to stop the war in Ukraine, despite nearly 10 months of mediation yielding no tangible results. "I have another one to go with (Vladimir) Putin. The last direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow took place nearly four months ago. Kyiv, backed by European governments, is pushing for a ceasefire along the existing front line. Moscow continues to insist on Ukraine ceding eastern Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Asked about recent diplomatic activity, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Nov. 19 that nothing has changed since Putin and Trump met earlier in Alaska. Following his trip to Turkey, Zelensky said in a post on X that "only President Trump and the U.S. have sufficient strength for the war to finally end," adding that Ukraine has supported "every strong and fair proposal to end this war" in recent months. Zelensky welcomed Turkey's willingness to engage in diplomatic efforts and noted Kyiv is "ready to work in any other meaningful formats that can yield results."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The exit of the retired general and key Ukraine advocate will be unwelcome news as Kyiv comes under pressure to cede territory to Russia Donald Trump's Ukraine envoy Lt Gen Keith Kellogg is leaving the role, it has emerged hours after a US plan to end the war leaked. His position as special presidential envoy is a temporary designation, and such envoys in theory must be confirmed by the US Senate to stay in their positions past 360 days. But as he approaches that time limit, Lt Gen Kellogg has indicated to his associates that January would be a natural departure point, according to Reuters. The 28-point plan was thrashed out between the US and Russia in a recent flurry of secretive talks, renewing fears that Ukraine is being frozen out of discussions about its future. Russia would pay an undisclosed rental fee for de-facto control of the region. Initially feared to be something of a Ukraine sceptic, Lt Gen Kellogg quickly became one of Kyiv's few allies in the White House, viewed as a sympathetic ear in an administration that has at times leaned toward Moscow's view on the origins of the war in Ukraine. At times, it put him at odds with Steve Witkoff, the president's lead negotiator, who has advocated a lopsided territorial swap as part of a long-term peace deal. Among the retired general's successes was facilitating the release of dozens of hostages held by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko in return for limited sanctions relief. But for all the warm welcomes, Lt Gen Kellogg had concluded that there were too many administration officials working on Ukraine, according to one person familiar with his thinking. A lack of acknowledgement within the administration that Russia – not Ukraine – is stalling peace talks had led him to become increasingly frustrated. Insiders suggest Mr Trump had picked him because the US president viewed his sympathetic ear as a valuable tool to keep Ukraine at the negotiating table while Witkoff carved out a deal with Putin. Earlier this month, his deputy, John Coale, left to become the US special envoy for Belarus. It was not immediately clear who, if anyone, would replace the retired general.</p>
