                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — They gathered at the Washington National Cathedral on Thursday — former presidents, vice presidents, sworn political foes and newfound friends — in a show of respect and remembrance for Dick Cheney, the consequential and polarizing vice president who became an acidic scold of President Donald Trump. Trump, who has been publicly silent about Cheney's death Nov. 3, was not invited to the memorial service. Two ex-presidents came: Republican George W. Bush, who eulogized the man who served him as vice president, and Democrat Joe Biden, who once called Cheney “the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American history” but now honors his commitment to his family and to his values. Bush and others noted the understated demeanor of a man who nevertheless wielded great influence in government. She spoke of her father's conviction that when confronted with a choice between defending the country and a political party, the country must come first. “Bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she said. Liz Cheney is a former high-ranking House member whose Republican political career was shredded by a MAGA movement angered by her investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Thursday, she chose not to speak directly of Trump. Moments before the service began, figures of recent but now receded power mingled: Bush and Biden and their wives sitting in a row together, former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris and Mike Pence chatting side by side in their pew with Al Gore and Dan Quayle together behind them. Behind them sat Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who spent time talking with another former House speaker, Republican John Boehner. Others delivering tributes at Thursday's funeral were Cheney's longtime cardiologist, Dr. Jonathan Reiner; former NBC News correspondent Pete Williams, who was Cheney's spokesman at the Pentagon; and several of the former vice president's grandchildren. “Nobody wants a doctor who is great at funerals.” Reiner recalled doctors telling Cheney decades ago, after the first of multiple heart attacks, that he should abandon his political ambitions then. Yet he kept winning elections as a Wyoming congressman for years after that. Trump's vice president, JD Vance, on stage at another event in the morning, was asked about Cheney and said: “Obviously there's some political disagreements there but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.” Bush credited him with helping to keep the country safe and stable in a perilous time. In a campaign TV ad made for his daughter, Dick Cheney branded Trump a “coward” who “tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.” Last year, it did not sit well with Trump when Cheney said he would vote for the Democrat, Harris, in the presidential election. Trump told Arab and Muslim voters that Dick Cheney's support for Harris should give them pause, because he “killed more Arabs than any human being on Earth. He pushed Bush, and they went into the Middle East.” Associated Press writer Michelle L. Price contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Epstein files: The Justice Department has 30 days to release its Jeffrey Epstein-related files after President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan bill last night directing it to do so. • Trump accuses Democrats: The president called for the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who urged troops to disobey illegal orders that might be issued by the administration, calling it “seditious” and “punishable by death.” Democratic House leadership condemned what they described as death threats, while House Speaker Mike Johnson defended Trump's post. • Cheney's funeral: Elsewhere in Washington, political leaders from both sides of the aisle gathered to pay respects to former Vice President Dick Cheney. Former Rep. Liz Cheney said her father chose to defend the Constitution over political partisanship. Neither Trump nor Vice President JD Vance were invited, according to a source. In a joint statement, the six Democratic lawmakers who President Donald Trump accused of engaging in “seditious behavior, punishable by death” over their video urging troops to not obey unlawful orders said they “will not be intimidated.” Our servicemembers should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. Additionally, Slotkin said during a conference that “I'm not going to shut up because Donald Trump is threatening me.” Slotkin said she was accompanied by security to the NewDEAL's 15th annual Leaders Conference in Washington, DC. Past presidents and politicians of both parties gathered in Washington, DC, for former Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral. The service at the Washington National Cathedral featured tributes from his family, former President George W. Bush and others who worked closely with Cheney during his decades in politics. There is a provision in the law that allows the Trump administration to withhold documents that are part of an ongoing investigation. “I expect the administration to block release of anything that puts the Trump administration or Trump himself in a bad light,” he told CNN. “Given the scope of who is involved in this, I'm just really shocked that you can't prosecute more people,” Hawley said. As Dick Cheney's funeral service comes to a close, elsewhere in DC, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended President Donald Trump's call for the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials in a video to disobey illegal orders. You have leading members of Congress telling troops to disobey orders. I think that's unprecedented in American history,” Johnson said. They don't need that kind of nonsense from people in Congress. Pressed on Trump saying the Democrats' actions should be punishable by death, the speaker said, “I'm gonna let others define what it is, but it's wildly inappropriate.” Johnson a bit later expanded on his thoughts, saying he took Trump's suggestion to be the president simply explaining sedition. When it came to choosing between his party and the Constitution, it was an easy choice for Dick Cheney, his daughter and former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney said. “For him, a choice between defense of the Constitution and defense of your political party was no choice at all,” she said. Liz Cheney said her father was “inspired to service” by a speech from former President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat, despite him joining the Republican Party. “He knew that bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she added. May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest,” Cheney added, referencing the line from Shakespeare's “Hamlet.” Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman and one of Dick Cheney's daughters, recalled that her father attributed the path he'd traveled to being “born an American — a blessing, surely, among life's greatest.” “My dad's devotion to America was deep and substantive. He spent his life studying the history of our great republic. He knew you couldn't truly appreciate what it means to live in freedom if you didn't understand the sacrifices of the generations who came before. He spent the drive giving her advice as she was set to start her freshman year and reminisced on the times he drove his own kids to university. Driving along an open road and telling me stories about his life while talking about the family that he loved so dearly,” she said. Richard Perry said one thing he and his grandfather both had in common was that they played high school football. “Every Christmas, Grandpa would cook our dinner while we hung out in the kitchen watching his favorite John Wayne movies, year after year,” he said. But above all, Richard Perry said he remembered the way his grandfather would look at him. He didn't have to say anything, but “you could just feel his love.” To put love and our families first,” Richard Perry said. Grace Perry shared her own memories and lessons she learned from Cheney. Attendees at former Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral include the current and former top-ranking Senate Republicans: John Thune of South Dakota and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Trump and Vice President JD Vance were not invited. McConnell has become a fierce Trump critic and is retiring from the Senate. Former President George W. Bush called Dick Cheney, a “true man of the West, ” as he described his former vice president's demeanor on the campaign trail. “If any voters came looking for a kind word and a hug, they'd have to settle for the kind word,” Bush joked. He said Cheney was an “old breed of public servant, defined by their substance and character.” “Across 40 years, his service was consistent, faithful and noble.” As Dick Cheney's funeral is underway at the Washington National Cathedral, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are reacting to President Donald Trump calling six congressional Democrats “traitors” over a video they posted urging troops to disobey illegal orders. Republican Sen. Rand Paul warned the president against using violent rhetoric, saying he doesn't “think it's a really a good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.” The Republican senator added that people who are “not stable” could see this kind of rhetoric and attack those Democrats. It stirs up people among us who may not be stable, who may think, ‘Well, traitors, what do we do with traitors? Maybe I'll just take matters into my own hands,' which is not something we should be encouraging,” said Paul. “So I have a lot of disagreement with Democrats, but I try to keep it on the civil, civil level, and try not to call any of them traitors or anything like that, because I think that is something that could incite some people among us who aren't stable to commit violence.” While searching for a running mate, former President George W. Bush enlisted the help of a trusted source to lead the effort: Dick Cheney. We talked over the various qualities I was looking for in a vice president: preparedness, mature judgment, rectitude and loyalty. Pete Wiliams, who worked closely with former Vice President Dick Cheney, talked about his humility and character as a leader during his decades of public service. Williams, the press secretary for Cheney when he was defense secretary, told a story about when then-President George H. W. Bush was trying to reach a nuclear weapons agreement with the Soviet Union. He could have told President Bush that it was our fault, but he took the blame and saved us from ourselves,” Williams said. This story was just one example of how Cheney “demonstrated that kind of decency and concern for all the people who served him during his more than 40 years in public life.” Williams also talked about Cheney's love of fly fishing and the outdoors. Former President George W. Bush, who is eulogizing his former vice president, Dick Cheney, joked that he discovered in 2000 that “when you choose one Cheney, you get four.” Dr. Jonathan Reiner, Dick Cheney's cardiologist for 27 years, described the late former vice president as the model patient as he recounted Cheney's lifelong battle with heart disease, starting with a heart attack at age 37, during his first run for Congress. He prompted laughter from the crowd when he drew an implicit comparison to the opaque statements issued by President Donald Trump's doctors. “He never allowed politics to influence his personal health care decisions, and not once in all my time as his doctor did he try to to write or change a single word of a statement I issued,” Reiner said. Previous vice presidents and lawmakers of both parties have gathered inside the Washington National Cathedral for Dick Cheney's funeral. Former Vice President Mike Pence is also in the front row. Former President George W. Bush, who is expected to give the eulogy, and his wife Laura Bush are seated next to the Bidens. Joe Biden and Laura Bush were seen having a long conversation. Lawmakers such as the Republican former Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, and the Democratic former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, are also in attendance. Meanwhile in New York City, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is previewing his Friday meeting in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump. He said at a press conference that their meeting was an “opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers.” Mamdani was questioned repeatedly about how he would approach Trump, who has used a series of Oval Office meetings this year to provide dressing-downs of foreign heads of state, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, an episode Mamdani was asked about. “I'll stand up for New Yorkers, every single day,” Mamdani responded. It's about a relationship between New York City and the White House.” “I view this meeting as an opportunity for me to make my case. And I'll make that case to anyone, frankly, as we've been doing over the course of the campaign, and now as I will be the next mayor of this city, it behooves me to ensure that I leave no stone unturned in looking to make this city more affordable,” Mamdani said. “My condolences go to Dick Cheney and his family,” Vance said during an appearance at a Breitbart News event. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.” Neither Vance nor Trump were invited to Cheney's memorial service on Wednesday, where a slew of former presidents and vice presidents were expected to attend. His daughter, former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, also clashed repeatedly with Trump, serving as a chief supporter in Congress of Trump's impeachment over the riot at the Capitol. Both Cheney and Pence had high-profile breaks with President Donald Trump. Pence's came in the wake of his refusal to attempt to reject electoral college votes on January 6, 2020; he later ran against Trump for the 2024 GOP nomination. Cheney in 2024 endorsed the Democratic nominee, former Vice President Kamala Harris, as he warned that Trump was a threat to the republic. Pence would not directly address whether Cheney's warnings have come true. “I would never begrudge the late vice president his opinions or political judgment,” he said. And in a very real sense, as we go forward, I think people will continue to be inspired by his devotion to our military, his devotion to our national defense, and a lifetime of service — and that's where we should focus today.” Former Vice President Mike Pence says Cheney called him after the 2016 presidential election and shared two pieces of “sage advice.” “It was a way that he said, ‘You will be better equipped to be able to advise the president if you know in advance what's coming and can run that through the filter of the president's priorities,'” Pence told Zeleny before Cheney's funeral. Cheney also advised Pence to “spend a lot of time on Capitol Hill” — which both vice presidents, who were members of the House and held the same Republican leadership post, made a regular practice. “He was the one that said to me, ‘Don't just go to Capitol Hill when the administration is looking for something; looking for a vote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — Washington National Cathedral on Thursday hosted a bipartisan show of respect and remembrance for Dick Cheney, the consequential and polarizing vice president who in later years became an acidic scold of fellow Republican President Donald Trump. Trump, who has been publicly silent about Cheney's death Nov. 3, was not invited to the memorial service. Two ex-presidents came: Republican George W. Bush, who eulogized the man who served him as vice president, and Democrat Joe Biden, who once called Cheney “the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American history” but now honors his commitment to his family and to his values. Among the eulogists, Liz Cheney, his eldest daughter, only obliquely addressed what amounted to a father-daughter feud with the president — a man her dad had called a “coward” for trying to overturn his loss in the 2020 election. She spoke of her father's conviction that when confronted with a choice between defending the country and a political party, the country must come first. “Bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and some of his agents have left Charlotte, North Carolina, according to a Homeland Security official. The departure is likely a relief to the city, which saw businesses close, children kept out of school, hundreds arrested, and many living in fear during “Operation Charlotte's Web,” which lasted nearly a week. Immigration enforcement will continue in the area, similar to what happened in Chicago after Bovino and his team departed, other law enforcement officials told CNN. Bovino and his agents are expected to launch an operation in New Orleans after the Thanksgiving holiday. Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden issued a statement Thursday saying federal officials confirmed to him that the Customs and Border Protection operation in Charlotte is over. As a result, the statement said, there will be no CBP operations in Charlotte on Thursday. “We will continue to build relationships, mend bridges, and listen to the voices of everyone in our community,” McFadden said. “As we move forward, I want the city of Charlotte to know, I will keep fighting for clarity, accountability, and trust. I will continue to protect this city and every single one of its citizens.” McFadden noted that while the CBP operation known as “Charlotte's Web” has ended, ICE will continue its own enforcement efforts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Thursday accused half a dozen Democratic lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” after the lawmakers — all veterans of the armed services and intelligence community — called on U.S. military members to uphold the Constitution and defy “illegal orders.” The 90-second video was first posted early Tuesday from Sen. Elissa Slotkin's X account. In it, the six lawmakers — Slotkin, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan — speak directly to U.S. service members, whom Slotkin acknowledges are “under enormous stress and pressure right now.” “The American people need you to stand up for our laws and our Constitution,” Slotkin wrote in the X post. Trump on Thursday reposted messages from others about the video, amplifying it with his own words. Some Democrats accused him of acting like a king and trying to distract from soon-to-be-released files about disgraced financier and sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein. With pieces of dialogue spliced together from different members, the lawmakers introduce themselves and their background. They go on to say the Trump administration “is pitting our uniformed military against American citizens. Although the lawmakers didn't mention specific circumstances in the video, its release comes as the Trump administration continues attempts at deployment of National Guard troops into U.S. cities for various roles, although some have been pulled back, and others held up in court. However, while commanders have military lawyers on their staffs to consult with in helping make such a determination, rank-and-file troops who are tasked with carrying out those orders are rarely in a similar position. Broad legal precedence holds that just following orders, colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defense” as it was used unsuccessfully by senior Nazi officials to justify their actions under Adolf Hitler, doesn't absolve troops. However, the U.S. military legal code, known as the Uniform Code of Military Justice or UCMJ, will punish troops for failing to follow an order should it turn out to be lawful. Troops can be criminally charged with Article 90 of the UCMJ, willfully disobeying a superior commissioned officer, and Article 92, failure to obey an order. On Thursday, Trump reposted to social media an article about the video, adding his own commentary that it was “really bad, and Dangerous to our Country.” ?” He also called for the lawmakers' arrest and trial, adding in a separate post that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.” Democrats were swift to react to Trump's words, with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warning in a floor speech that the president was “lighting a match in a country soaked with political gasoline.” Speaker Mike Johnson said he did not believe Trump was calling for violence in the social media posts, saying Trump was merely “defining a crime,” and calling the Democrats' video “wildly inappropriate.” On X, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth commented on the video Tuesday as “Stage 4 TDS,” referring to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a term used by Trump to describe voters so angry and opposed to him that they are incapable of seeing any good in what he does. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell challenged the theory that illegal orders were being issued.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Specialist Michael Pistillo, left, and trader Fred Demarco work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025. NEW YORK (AP) — Big swings keep rocking Wall Street, and U.S. stocks erased a huge morning gain on Thursday as skittishness continues to dominate the market following weeks of doubts and erratic moves. The S&P 500 dropped to a loss of 0.7% after initially soaring 1.9%, which would have marked its best day since May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 231 points, or 0.5%, as of 12:15 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1% lower. Technology stocks, cryptocurrencies and other areas of the market that had been soaring with nearly relentless momentum, as traders feared missing out on more gains, dropped. Bitcoin fell below $87,000, down from nearly $125,000 last month, for example. The market had been shaky coming into Thursday, largely because of twin worries: Nvidia and other superstar stocks caught up in the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology may have simply shot too high, and the Federal Reserve may be done delivering the invigorating cuts to interest rates that Wall Street loves. Nvidia initially appeared to tamp down the worries about a potential bubble for AI stocks after reporting another big profit for the summer that topped analysts' expectations, along with a forecast for coming revenue that easily cleared analysts' estimates. By delivering big profits and indicating more are coming, Nvidia can justify its stock's price gains and make it look less expensive. Given the forecasts that Nvidia gave late Wednesday, “it is very hard to see how this stock does not keep moving higher from here,” according to analysts at UBS led by Timothy Arcuri. They also said “the AI infrastructure tide is still rising so fast that all boats will be lifted.” Nvidia jumped to an early gain of 5% but then dropped to a loss of 1.5%, sending it again 10% below its record. Worries about a potential AI bubble aren't gone. Yes, Nvidia expects to sell another $65 billion of chips in the coming three months, which is more than analysts expected. But will all those chips turn into much bigger profits for Amazon and other companies using them? The most recent survey of global fund managers by Bank of America showed a record percentage of investors saying companies are “overinvesting.” That helped make a potential AI bubble the No. 1 risk that they saw for the market, one with a lower probability of happening but a chance of very big damage. Financial markets initially seemed to pick the data apart for encouraging signals, according to Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. The report showed hiring by U.S. employers was stronger in September than economists expected, which may suggest the economy remains solid. But it also said the unemployment rate worsened slightly, which could give the Fed reason to cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in December. Traders still see a December rate cut as relatively unlikely, giving it a roughly 40% probability, according to data from CME Group. What the Fed does is critical for the stock market because prices ran to records in part because of expectations for continued cuts to rates. But lower rates can also worsen inflation, which has stubbornly remained  above the Fed's 2% target. It reported strong sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations as it continues to lure cash-strapped Americans nervous about the economy and prices. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 2.6%, and South Korea's Kospi rose 1.9% for two of the bigger gains.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Cheney's funeral: Political leaders from both sides of the aisle gathered to pay respects to former Vice President Dick Cheney at the Washington National Cathedral. • Epstein files: Trump signed the bill last night that directs the Department of Justice to publicly release all of its Jeffrey Epstein-related files after a stunning reversal in his position. As Dick Cheney's funeral service comes to a close, elsewhere in DC, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended President Donald Trump's call for the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials in a video to disobey illegal orders. You have leading members of Congress telling troops to disobey orders. I think that's unprecedented in American history,” Johnson said. They don't need that kind of nonsense from people in Congress. Pressed on Trump saying the Democrats' actions should be punishable by death, the speaker said, “I'm gonna let others define what it is, but it's wildly inappropriate.” Johnson a bit later expanded on his thoughts, saying he took Trump's suggestion to be the president simply explaining sedition. When it came to choosing between his party and the Constitution, it was an easy choice for Dick Cheney, his daughter and former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney said. “For him, a choice between defense of the Constitution and defense of your political party was no choice at all,” she said. Liz Cheney said her father was “inspired to service” by a speech from former President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat, despite him joining the Republican Party. “He knew that bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she added. May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest,” Cheney added, referencing the line from Shakespeare's “Hamlet.” Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman and one of Dick Cheney's daughters, recalled that her father attributed the path he'd traveled to being “born an American — a blessing, surely, among life's greatest.” “My dad's devotion to America was deep and substantive. He spent his life studying the history of our great republic. He knew you couldn't truly appreciate what it means to live in freedom if you didn't understand the sacrifices of the generations who came before. He spent the drive giving her advice as she was set to start her freshman year and reminisced on the times he drove his own kids to university. Driving along an open road and telling me stories about his life while talking about the family that he loved so dearly,” she said. Richard Perry said one thing he and his grandfather both had in common was that they played high school football. “Every Christmas, Grandpa would cook our dinner while we hung out in the kitchen watching his favorite John Wayne movies, year after year,” he said. But above all, Richard Perry said he remembered the way his grandfather would look at him. He didn't have to say anything, but “you could just feel his love.” To put love and our families first,” Richard Perry said. Grace Perry shared her own memories and lessons she learned from Cheney. Attendees at former Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral include the current and former top-ranking Senate Republicans: John Thune of South Dakota and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Trump and Vice President JD Vance were not invited. McConnell has become a fierce Trump critic and is retiring from the Senate. Former President George W. Bush called Dick Cheney, a “true man of the West, ” as he described his former vice president's demeanor on the campaign trail. “If any voters came looking for a kind word and a hug, they'd have to settle for the kind word,” Bush joked. He said Cheney was an “old breed of public servant, defined by their substance and character.” “Across 40 years, his service was consistent, faithful and noble.” As Dick Cheney's funeral is underway at the Washington National Cathedral, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are reacting to President Donald Trump calling six congressional Democrats “traitors” over a video they posted urging troops to disobey illegal orders. Republican Sen. Rand Paul warned the president against using violent rhetoric, saying he doesn't “think it's a really a good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.” The Republican senator added that people who are “not stable” could see this kind of rhetoric and attack those Democrats. It stirs up people among us who may not be stable, who may think, ‘Well, traitors, what do we do with traitors? Maybe I'll just take matters into my own hands,' which is not something we should be encouraging,” said Paul. “So I have a lot of disagreement with Democrats, but I try to keep it on the civil, civil level, and try not to call any of them traitors or anything like that, because I think that is something that could incite some people among us who aren't stable to commit violence.” While searching for a running mate, former President George W. Bush enlisted the help of a trusted source to lead the effort: Dick Cheney. We talked over the various qualities I was looking for in a vice president: preparedness, mature judgment, rectitude and loyalty. Pete Wiliams, who worked closely with former Vice President Dick Cheney, talked about his humility and character as a leader during his decades of public service. Williams, the press secretary for Cheney when he was defense secretary, told a story about when then-President George H. W. Bush was trying to reach a nuclear weapons agreement with the Soviet Union. He could have told President Bush that it was our fault, but he took the blame and saved us from ourselves,” Williams said. This story was just one example of how Cheney “demonstrated that kind of decency and concern for all the people who served him during his more than 40 years in public life.” Williams also talked about Cheney's love of fly fishing and the outdoors. Former President George W. Bush, who is eulogizing his former vice president, Dick Cheney, joked that he discovered in 2000 that “when you choose one Cheney, you get four.” Dr. Jonathan Reiner, Dick Cheney's cardiologist for 27 years, described the late former vice president as the model patient as he recounted Cheney's lifelong battle with heart disease, starting with a heart attack at age 37, during his first run for Congress. He prompted laughter from the crowd when he drew an implicit comparison to the opaque statements issued by President Donald Trump's doctors. “He never allowed politics to influence his personal health care decisions, and not once in all my time as his doctor did he try to to write or change a single word of a statement I issued,” Reiner said. Previous vice presidents and lawmakers of both parties have gathered inside the Washington National Cathedral for Dick Cheney's funeral. Former Vice President Mike Pence is also in the front row. Former President George W. Bush, who is expected to give the eulogy, and his wife Laura Bush are seated next to the Bidens. Joe Biden and Laura Bush were seen having a long conversation. Lawmakers such as the Republican former Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, and the Democratic former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, are also in attendance. He said at a press conference that their meeting was an “opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers.” Mamdani was questioned repeatedly about how he would approach Trump, who has used a series of Oval Office meetings this year to provide dressing-downs of foreign heads of state, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, an episode Mamdani was asked about. “I'll stand up for New Yorkers, every single day,” Mamdani responded. It's about a relationship between New York City and the White House.” “I view this meeting as an opportunity for me to make my case. And I'll make that case to anyone, frankly, as we've been doing over the course of the campaign, and now as I will be the next mayor of this city, it behooves me to ensure that I leave no stone unturned in looking to make this city more affordable,” Mamdani said. “My condolences go to Dick Cheney and his family,” Vance said during an appearance at a Breitbart News event. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.” Neither Vance nor Trump were invited to Cheney's memorial service on Wednesday, where a slew of former presidents and vice presidents were expected to attend. His daughter, former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, also clashed repeatedly with Trump, serving as a chief supporter in Congress of Trump's impeachment over the riot at the Capitol. Both Cheney and Pence had high-profile breaks with President Donald Trump. Pence's came in the wake of his refusal to attempt to reject electoral college votes on January 6, 2020; he later ran against Trump for the 2024 GOP nomination. Pence would not directly address whether Cheney's warnings have come true. “I would never begrudge the late vice president his opinions or political judgment,” he said. And in a very real sense, as we go forward, I think people will continue to be inspired by his devotion to our military, his devotion to our national defense, and a lifetime of service — and that's where we should focus today.” Former Vice President Mike Pence says Cheney called him after the 2016 presidential election and shared two pieces of “sage advice.” “It was a way that he said, ‘You will be better equipped to be able to advise the president if you know in advance what's coming and can run that through the filter of the president's priorities,'” Pence told Zeleny before Cheney's funeral. Cheney also advised Pence to “spend a lot of time on Capitol Hill” — which both vice presidents, who were members of the House and held the same Republican leadership post, made a regular practice. “He was the one that said to me, ‘Don't just go to Capitol Hill when the administration is looking for something; looking for a vote. More than 1,000 guests are expected at Cheney's invitation-only funeral this morning at Washington's National Cathedral — including all four living former vice presidents and two former presidents. Who's going: Former presidents George W. Bush and Joe Biden will pay their respects, along with former vice presidents Kamala Harris, Mike Pence, Al Gore and Dan Quayle. There are also expected to be a number of Supreme Court justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Elena Kagan. A large number of past and present Cabinet members from both Republican and Democratic administrations will also attend, as well as congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. Some context: While official Washington funerals usually include invites to the White House, excluding Trump should not be a surprise. Trump has not publicly expressed his condolences or commented on Cheney's death. Both Cheney and his daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney, have been fierce critics of Trump since the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, and Trump's attempts to get his supporters to stop the peaceful transfer of power. President Donald Trump on Thursday called for the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials to disobey illegal orders that might be issued by the administration, calling it “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” He was referring to half a dozen members of Congress who previously served in the military or intelligence community who posted a video on X earlier this week urging the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.” “Their words cannot be allowed to stand - We won't have a Country anymore!!! An example MUST BE SET,” Trump wrote, going on to add in a subsequent Truth Social post, “LOCK THEM UP?? He added “punishable by DEATH!” in yet another post later Thursday morning, after reposting another user's post that read: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD ! Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Wednesday that the Justice Department will be taking a “very close look” at these lawmakers' actions, calling it a “disgusting and inappropriate display of supposed leadership from the Democrat party.” This post has been updated with additional Truth Social posts. Waking up to the news that President Donald Trump signed a bill to release the full Department of Justice case files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a survivor of Epstein's abuse told CNN she felt mixed emotions. “But, you know, of course there's a part of me that wants to be full-on happy, but … I do have reservations because, you know, he's become very unpredictable, especially with the Epstein files,” she said, referring to Trump. “I think it's appalling that he keeps referring to all this as a hoax when him and I both know this is not a hoax,” Robson said. Robson said she expects the biggest impact will be a fuller picture of the “diabolical abuse of children through using coercive control and sexual abuse.”</p>

A California mother and father were convicted on Tuesday of stabbing and decapitating their 13-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son, then forcing their two younger children to look at the bodies, authorities said. Natalie Sumiko Brothwell, 48, and Maurice Jewel Taylor Sr., 39, were found guilty of murdering their 13-year-old daughter, Maliaka, and 12-year-old son, Maurice, inside the family's Lancaster home on Nov. 29, 2020, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. "This was a monstrous act of cruelty that shattered an entire family," Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan J. Hochman said in a news release on Tuesday. "Two innocent children were brutally murdered, and their young brothers were left to live through unimaginable horror." Firefighters discovered the bodies five days later while responding to a possible gas leak, FOX11 Los Angeles reported. Brothwell, Taylor, and the couple's other two sons, then aged 8 and 9, were also inside the home. Natalie Sumiko Brothwell, 48, was convicted of two felony counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances and two felony counts of child abuse on Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025. Prosecutors said that after Brothwell and Taylor committed the murders, they forced the younger boys to view their siblings' decapitated bodies and then confined them to their bedrooms without food for days. Maurice Jewel Taylor Sr., 39, was convicted of two felony counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances and two felony counts of child abuse on Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025. The two are facing life in prison without the possibility of parole, along with a consecutive sentence of six years and four months. They are scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 13. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan J. Hochman called the murders of the two children "a monstrous act of cruelty." "The jury's verdict delivers justice for these victims and sends a powerful message: Those who commit such evil acts will be held fully accountable," Hochman said.

The Stony Brook Yacht Club parking lot is better known for kayak launches and wedding photos than crime scene tape, but police allege that Kacy Corso, who lived in nearby Setauket, was involved in the stabbing death of Christopher Millwater, of Selden. The altercation began in the parking lot across from 21 Shore Road, used by visitors to a pair of marinas and also a restaurant and wedding venue, the Three Village Inn, about 60 miles east of New York City. A number of late-season boats remain in the Stony Brook Yacht Club marina on Nov. 16, 2025. The yacht club itself is surrounded by cameras, with several affixed to each light pole, and sources tell Fox News Digital much of the violence was caught on video. Under New York law, that's the charge for intentional murder. It was not immediately clear whether additional charges were expected. Christopher Millwater, pictured in an undated selfie taken in a mirror, was killed outside the Stony Brook Yacht Club. A July post from a Facebook account in Corso's name appears to show she knew Millwater before his death. Millwater "liked" one of her posts from days earlier. Court records show she racked up unrelated charges at another boat launch in the area earlier this year. A number of late-season boats remain in the Stony Brook Yacht Club marina on Nov. 16, 2025. On May 5, she was charged with illegally accessing the boat ramp parking lot in the neighboring town of Smithtown and with entering or remaining in a park or beach area after dark. According to Millwater's Facebook page, he was given an "all clear" in October following a battle with cancer. His sister told the local TV station, News 12, that Stony Brook was his favorite place to go fishing. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts weigh in on parents struggling to decipher Gen Z's slang words. It is a phenomenon that has swept the nation, seemingly coming out of nowhere in our country's middle schools. The bewildering phrase "6-7" has been amusing kids and annoying parents for months now, but in fact, this expression dates to the 14th century and is one of modern English's oldest. When my 15-year-old son patiently tried to explain to me that "6-7" meant nothing, but was just something you say as a joke when you hear the numbers together, while making a weighing gesture with your hands, I asked him if it meant the same as "being at sixes and sevens?" He didn't know what that expression meant, and to be fair it is rather arcane. I probably read too much PG Wodehouse, but it got me thinking that maybe this "6-7" thing didn't actually pop up out of nowhere. Turns out, that was a good instinct. The first usage of "6-7" dates back to the 1300s, which is about as old as modern English gets. It referred to a dice game called Hazard that would eventually develop into what we know as craps. In the game, a player would call out the number he was trying to shoot for, or make, with two six-sided dice. Five, eight and nine were the most likely results. Six and seven, gamblers quickly discovered either through math or experience, offered lower odds and hence less chance of winning. Several of the most-searched slang terms revolve around looks and attractiveness, like "mogging" and "chopped." It can be found in the works of Chaucer, and has marched quite steadily down through the centuries. Almost 300 years later, in 1595, William Shakespeare would use the expression in his play "Richard II," with the Duke of York uttering, "I should to Plashy too, but time will not permit. Over the next few centuries, the phrase would become plural and popularized as "being at sixes and sevens," meaning being worried or confused, as in, "My check is late and my rent is due, I am at sixes and sevens over it." What does the endurance of this symbol, this expression that has been with our native tongue since its birth really mean? What can it tell us, beyond being just a little fun fact of history? A double-digit combination set the social media sphere ablaze among teens in 2025, leaving parents and teachers befuddled -- and now it has officially been crowned Dictionary.com's "Word of the Year": 67. But even the organization that unveiled the winning word -- pronounced "six-seven" and never "sixty-seven" -- admitted it was not exactly sure about its meaning. It tells us that we are much more closely linked intellectually to those who spoke our language 700 years ago than we think, that we almost never invent, we almost always borrow or repurpose, as Shakespeare, our greatest writer, did himself. Here we have the English language stubbornly demanding for centuries that these two numbers have a special meaning. This is why it is vital to read old books and to make kids read old books. So, the next time your kid starts giggling and saying "6-7," just imagine them on the old-timey streets of Elizabethan London doing it, because the people there and then would know exactly what it means, even better than we do. The history of English-speaking people is much shorter than it feels, we are much more closely related to those long gone than we recognize. So, as we march into the future of artificial intelligence, and brave new worlds, let us remember, we find our real meaning, our real selves and what we are, in the past, not in the future, and just as with "6-7," the past will always find a way.

UConn head coach Dan Hurley was pretty blunt in his assessment of the team's 71-67 loss to No. 4 Arizona on Wednesday night at Gampel Pavilion. Hurley's squad was without two of its top players – senior center Tarris Reed Jr. and five-star freshman Braylon Mullins – in the close loss, and the two-time champion head coach ripped up the stat sheet in disgust. "We just f---ing blew a chance to beat one of the best teams, down two studs," Hurley said postgame at his press conference. UConn Huskies head coach Dan Hurley watches from the sideline as his team takes on the Columbia Lions at Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut, on Nov. 10, 2025. Hurley expressed his displeasure with the team's lack of fight. "We should have been minus-10 on the glass today. It's going to be a bad film session coming out of here where there are people; there's a street fight going on in the paint and men can't watch fights," Hurley said.

"You know, men, you can't stand on the outside when your buddies are in a fight. And I think we're going to see a lot of clips where guys were not in the fight with their teammates." Despite being outrebounded and committing more fouls (the Huskies had 21 fouls to the Wildcats' 16), they went stride for stride with Arizona. UConn clawed back to tie the game at 60-60 after trailing by 13 with 13:44 left in the game.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientific information on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website was replaced on Wednesday with anti-vaccine talking points that don't rule out a link between vaccines and autism, despite an abundance of evidence that there's no connection. Bullet points on the top of the page now state that “vaccines do not cause autism is not an evidence-based claim” because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism. However, the preponderance of scientific evidence shows this is not true, according to a position statement from the Autism Science Foundation. “The science is clear that vaccines do not cause autism. No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines. This includes vaccine ingredients as well as the body's response to vaccines,” the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement on Thursday. Other CDC bullets say studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have been ignored by health authorities. There are many well done, credible studies that find no such relationship. The page also says HHS has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links. The footnote seems to refer to a commitment by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and Republican from Louisiana, during his confirmation process that language on the CDC website “pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism” would not be removed. HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said Thursday, “We are updating the CDC's website to reflect gold standard, evidence-based science.” In a post on social media late Wednesday night, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as director of the CDC's National Center on Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, called the changes “a national embarrassment.” This is the latest move by the Trump administration to alter long-standing US vaccine policy and practice and cast doubt on vaccinations. Kennedy has hired long time anti-vax allies, including David Geier, a discredited researcher who was once disciplined by the Maryland State Board of Physicians for practicing medicine without a license, and Lyn Redwood, a nurse who was the president of the World Mercury Project, which later became Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group Kennedy ran before campaigning for office, to undertake new evaluations of government data in an effort to prove conspiracy theories that hazards of vaccines have long been hidden from the public. The rate of routine childhood vaccinations has dropped in the United States, allowing preventable diseases including measles and whooping cough to surge. This year the United States has seen its highest numbers of measles cases in 25 years. In a call with state health officials on Monday, the CDC disease detectives leading the measles response suggested that the United States status as a country that has eliminated continuous measles spread was in jeopardy as cases continue to rise. This is a breaking news story and will be updated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republicans may be facing a “worst-case scenario” in their redistricting fight with Democrats after a three-judge federal court panel ruled that Texas cannot use a racially gerrymandered congressional map hastily drawn this summer at President Donald Trump's urging. Trump's public push for Texas and other red states such as Indiana to revise their maps ahead of the 2026 elections to boost the GOP headcount in the House of Representatives spurred Democrats in California and Virginia to redraw their own. California's Proposition 50 was initially justified as a parallel action to that of Texas. There was even language in the measure indicating that California would only move forward with its redistricting plans if Texas proceeded with its own plans. However, that language was removed from the measure before it reached Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) desk for him to sign it into law. “This is something of a worst-case scenario for Republicans, because there was no clause when voters passed Prop 50 that it would it would be tabled if Texas was invalidated,” Dave Wasserman, the senior editor and elections analyst for the Cook Political Report, told the Washington Examiner. “So the net result is that Democrats could come out ahead in this redistricting fight if the decision in Texas is upheld. Following the Texas decision, Newsom, who is reportedly considering a 2028 White House bid, posted on X: “Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned — and democracy won. The situation in Texas also ramps up pressure on Indiana Republicans to produce and pass a new map that favors the GOP, despite state Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray saying last week that there are not enough votes to pass a new map. Republicans already hold a 7-2 advantage in the state's congressional delegation, but Trump wants to secure more seats. He has singled out Bray and state Sen. Greg Goode. Soon after, Goode was the victim of a swatting call that brought sheriff's deputies to his home on the pretense of a “domestic violence emergency.” Goode has not publicly stated his position on redistricting but has said he will wait until he sees a map. Bray announced Friday that the state Senate would be out until January 2026. Mike Braun (R-IN) said the Indiana Senate needs to have a public discussion surrounding redistricting and look at maps that are “going to hopefully come from” the Indiana House. Despite the pressure, there has been little to no actual movement on Indiana passing new maps. “The idea that we could have gone from Republicans creating an impenetrable map for themselves to, like, the Democrats now potentially gaining seats if this Texas court thing stays is an unbelievable turn of events in a short period of time,” Tim Miller, host of The Bulwark Podcast, said. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School, said that most “law around redistricting is up to the state, not the federal government, not federal law, and we just changed state law.” He added that he did not think “there are many grounds for a legal challenge against Prop. Last week, the Justice Department joined a GOP-led lawsuit attempting to block California's new map. The Trump administration argued that the new districts violate the Constitution because Proposition 50 was “a rush-job rejiggering California's congressional district lines,” and argued that “race cannot be used as a proxy to advance political interests, but that is precisely what the California General Assembly did with Proposition 50.” Proposition 50 shifted five GOP-represented House districts into the competitive or easily winnable category for Democrats. The new map eliminated Calvert's Inland Empire district and created a new seat in Los Angeles County that skewed heavily toward Democrats.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? It would take about 30 minutes for a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to travel from Russia to the United States. If launched from a submarine, it could arrive even faster than that. At that point, the commander-in-chief might have about two or three minutes at most to decide whether to launch hundreds of America's own ICBMs in retaliation or risk losing the ability to retaliate at all. This is an absurd amount of time to make any consequential decision, much less what would potentially be the most consequential one in human history. While countless experts have devoted countless hours over the years to thinking about how a nuclear war would be fought, if one ever happens, the key decisions are likely to be made by unprepared leaders with little time for consultation or second thought. And so it shouldn't be a surprise that the people in charge of America's nuclear enterprise are interested in finding ways to automate parts of the process — including with artificial intelligence. But for those who are concerned about either AI or nuclear weapons as a potential existential risk to the future of humanity, the idea of combining those two risks into one is a nightmare scenario. There's wide consensus on the view that, as UN Secretary General António Guterres put it in September, “until nuclear weapons are eliminated, any decision on their use must rest with humans — not machines.” By all indications, though, no one is actually looking to build an AI-operated doomsday machine. US Strategic Command (STRATCOM), the military arm responsible for nuclear deterrence, is not exactly forthcoming about where AI might be in the current command-and-control system. (STRATCOM referred Vox's request for comment to the Department of Defense, which did not respond.) At a landmark summit last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping and then-US President Joe Biden “affirmed the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons.” There are no indications that President Donald Trump's administration has reversed this position. Many experts believe that even if humans are still the ones making the final decision to use nuclear weapons, increasing reliance on AI by humans to make those decisions will make it more, not less, likely that those weapons will actually be used, particularly as humans start to place more and more trust in AI as a decision-making aid. A rogue AI killing us all is, for now at least, a far-fetched fear; a human consulting an AI on pressing the button is the scenario that should keep us up at night. “I've got good news for you: AI is not going to kill you with a nuclear weapon anytime soon,” said Peter W. Singer, a strategist at the New America think tank and author of several books on military automation. “I've got bad news for you: it may make it more likely that humans will kill you with a nuclear weapon.” To understand exactly the threat AI's involvement in our nuclear system poses, it is important to first grasp how it's being used now. It may seem surprising given its extreme importance, but many aspects of America's nuclear command are still surprisingly low-tech, according to people who've worked in it, in part due to a desire to keep vital systems “air-gapped,” meaning physically separated, from larger networks to prevent cyber attacks or espionage. (The floppy disks were replaced with a “highly secure solid-state digital storage solution.”) Cotton has identified AI as being “central” to this modernization process. In testimony earlier this year, he told Congress that STRATCOM is looking for ways to “use AI/ML [machine learning] to enable and accelerate human decision-making.” He added that his command was looking to hire more data scientists with the aim of “adopting AI/ML into the nuclear systems architecture.” Some roles for AI are fairly uncontroversial, such as “predictive maintenance,” which uses past data to order new replacement parts before the old ones fail. While there are advocates for a system like this, the US has not taken any steps toward building one, as far as we know. In another public appearance, Gen. Cotton referred to the 1983 film WarGames, in which a computer system called WOPR goes rogue and nearly starts a nuclear war: “We do not have a WOPR in STRATCOM headquarters. Nor would we ever have a WOPR in STRATCOM headquarters.” And those who believe that a superintelligent AI system could attempt on its own to destroy humanity understandably want to keep these systems far away from the most efficient methods humans have ever created to do just that. Most of the ways AI is likely to be used in nuclear warfare fall somewhere between smart maintenance and full-on Skynet. But that isn't it,” said Herb Lin, an expert on cyber policy at Stanford University. One of the most likely applications for AI in nuclear command-and-control would be “strategic warning” — synthesizing the massive amount of data collected by satellites, radar, and other sensor systems to detect potential threats as soon as possible. This means keeping track of the enemy's launchers and nuclear assets to both identify attacks when they happen and improve options for retaliation. “Does it help us find and identify potential targets in seconds that human analysts may not find for days, if at all? If it does those kinds of things with high confidence, I'm all for it,” retired Gen. Robert Kehler, who commanded STRATCOM from 2011 to 2013, told Vox. AI could also be employed to create so-called “decision-support” systems, which, as a recent report from the Institute for Security and Technology put it, don't make the decision to launch on their own but “process information, suggest options, and implement decisions at machine speeds” to help humans make those decisions. “On the nuclear planning side, there's two pieces: targets and weapons,” he said. But in the unbelievable pressure of a live nuclear warfare situation, would we actually know what role AI is playing? (An unarmed one in a training exercise, thankfully.) Pilots flying nuclear bombing training missions, he said, were given the option of bringing an eyepatch. “It was a suicidal mission, and people understood that,” Shanahan told Vox. Having seen both nuclear strategy and the Pentagon's push for automation from the inside, Shanahan is concerned that AI will find its way into more and more aspects of the nuclear command-and-control system, without anyone really intending it to or fully understanding how it's impacting the overall system. “As more and more of this gets added to different parts of the system, in isolation, they're all fine, but when put together into sort of a whole, is a different issue.” In fact, it has been malfunctioning technology, more than hawkish leaders, that has more often brought us alarmingly close to the brink of nuclear annihilation in the past. In 1979, National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski was woken up by a call informing him that 220 missiles had been fired from Soviet submarines off the coast of Oregon. (As he had rushed to get the president on the phone, Brzezinski decided not to wake up his wife, thinking that she would be better off dying in her sleep.) Four years later, Soviet Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov elected not to immediately inform his superiors of a missile launch detected by the Soviet early warning system known as Oko. It turned out, the computer system had misinterpreted sunlight reflected off clouds as a missile launch. Given that Soviet military doctrine called for full-scale nuclear retaliation, his decision may have saved billions of lives. Just a few weeks after that, the Soviets put their nuclear forces on high alert in response to a US training exercise in Europe called Able Archer 83, which Soviet commanders believed may actually have been preparations for a real attack. Their paranoia was based in part on a massive KGB intelligence operation that used computer analysis to detect patterns in reports from overseas spies. The model might spit out something that sounds unbelievably credible, but is it justified?” Today's AI reasoning models are far more advanced, but still prone to error. AI models could also be vulnerable to cyberattacks or subtler forms of manipulation. Russian propaganda networks have reportedly seeded disinformation aimed at distorting the responses of Western consumer AI chatbots. And even if all the information collected by the system is valid, there are reasons to be concerned about AI systems recommending courses of action. AI models are famously only as useful as the data that's fed into them, and their performance improves when there's more of that data to process. But when it comes to how to fight a nuclear war, “there are no real-world examples of this with the exception of two in 1945,” Shanahan points out. The model might spit out something that sounds unbelievably credible, but is it justified?” Stanford's Lin points out that studies have shown humans often give undue deference to computer-generated conclusions, a phenomenon known as “automation bias.” The bias might be especially difficult to resist in a life-or-death scenario with little time to make critical decisions — and one where the temptation to outsource an unthinkable decision to a thinking machine could be overwhelming. “It's still a black box,” said Alice Saltini, a leading scholar on AI and nuclear weapons, referring to the internal operations of advanced reasoning models. “What we do know is that it's highly vulnerable to cyberattacks and that we can't quite align it yet with human goals and values.” And while it's still theoretical, if the worst predictions of AI skeptics turn out to be true, there's also the possibility that a highly intelligent system could deliberately mislead the humans relying on it to make decisions. The notion of keeping a human “in control over the decision to use nuclear weapons,” as Biden and Xi vowed last year, might sound comforting. But if a human is making a decision based on data and recommendations put forward by AI, and has no time to probe the process the AI is using, it raises the question of what control even means. For Adam Lowther, arguments like these miss the point. A nuclear strategist, past adviser to STRATCOM, and co-founder of the National Institute for Deterrence Studies, Lowther caused a stir among nuke wonks in 2019 with an article arguing that America should build its own version of Russia's “dead hand” system. Ideally, that would discourage any adversary from attempting such a strike. The system is believed to still be in operation and former President Dmitry Medvedev referred to it in a recent threatening social media post directed at the Trump administration's Ukraine policies. An American Perimeter-style system, Lowther says, would not be a ChatGPT-type program generating options on the fly, but an automated system carrying out commands that the president had already decided on in advance based on various scenarios. In the event the president was still alive and in a position to make decisions during a nuclear war, they would likely be choosing from a set of attack options provided by the nuclear “football” that travels with the president at all times, laid out on laminated sheets said to resemble a Denny's menu. (This “menu” is shown in the recent Netflix film House of Dynamite.) Lowther believes AI could help the president make a decision in that moment, based on courses of action that have already been decided. It's that it would likely be less wrong than a human would be under the most high-pressure situation imaginable. “If your argument is, ‘I don't trust humans to design good AI,' then my question is, ‘Why do you trust them to make decisions about nuclear weapons? The encroachment of AI into nuclear command-and-control systems is likely to be a defining feature of the so-called third nuclear age, and may be already underway, even as national leaders and military commanders are adamant that they have no plans to give authority to use the weapons over to the machines. But Shanahan is concerned the allure of automating more and more of the system may prove hard to resist. “It's just a matter of time until you're going to have well-meaning senior people in the Department of Defense saying ‘Well, I've got to have this stuff. “They're going to be snowed by some big pitch” from defense contractors. The report warrants skepticism — “making the oceans transparent” is a long-anticipated capability that is still probably a long way off — but experts believe it's safe to assume Chinese military planners are looking for opportunities to use AI to improve their nuclear capabilities, as they work to build up their arsenal to catch up with the United States and Russia. It's entirely possible that one or more of the world's nuclear powers could increase automation in parts of their nuclear command-and-control systems simply to keep up with the competition. But Shanahan, reflecting on his own time within America's nuclear enterprise, still believes decisions with such grave consequences for so many humans should be left with humans. “Humans have their own flaws, but in this world, I'm still more comfortable with humans making these decisions than a machine that may not act in ways that humans ever thought they are capable of acting.” Ultimately, it's fear of the consequences of nuclear escalation, more than anything else, that may have kept us all alive for the past 80 years. For all AI's ability to think fast and synthesize more data than a human brain ever could, we probably want to keep the world's most powerful weapons in the hands of intelligences that can fear as well as think.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A half-dozen Democratic veterans in Congress released a joint video urging U.S. service members to disobey unlawful orders, though they did not specify what those would be. Trump blasts ‘seditious' Democratic veterans: ‘Punishable by death' “We are standing by our troops, our service members who are often put in very difficult positions and Donald Trump has put them in very difficult positions and has alluded to putting them in even more difficult positions in the months and years ahead, so we are reminding folks about what the uniform code of military justice says, what the Constitution says, what the law of war says,” Crow said on Fox News on Wednesday afternoon. He cited President Donald Trump's musings during his first term about whether service members could shoot U.S. protesters in the leg, his more recent decisions to send the National Guard into several U.S. cities to crack down on illegal activities, and possibly sending U.S. troops to election polling stations. “I don't want to wait until that happens to remind our troops of this obligation because then it will be too late.” Sen. Marsha Blackburn said on Fox, “It is inconceivable that you would have elected officials that are saying to uniformed members of the military who have taken an oath that they would defy the orders that they have been given to execute their mission.” Similarly, War Secretary Pete Hegseth responded to the video on social media, saying, “Stage 4 [Trump Derangement Syndrome].” Since early September, the military has carried out roughly 20 lethal airstrikes on vessels they claim were carrying drugs intended for the United States, killing more than 80 people. Service members are required to follow lawful orders in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and they can face prosecution for following unlawful orders. Ernest Medina, who was later court-martialed and ultimately acquitted, had directed him to kill everyone in the village.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Justice has charged Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-FL) with stealing $5 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds and laundering it, and using the proceeds for her 2021 congressional campaign. A federal grand jury in Miami handed down the indictment. Cherfilus-McCormick and her brother's family healthcare company allegedly received a $5 million overpayment from FEMA in 2021 and hid the money through multiple accounts before rerouting a “substantial portion” of it to her congressional campaign. Cherfilus-McCormick and her 2021 tax preparer, David K. Spencer, are also accused of conspiring to file a false federal tax return because they allegedly “falsely claimed political spending and other personal expenses as business deductions and inflated charitable contributions in order to reduce her tax obligations.” Cherfilus-McCormick is the second House Democrat to be charged with a crime this year after Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ) was charged with impeding federal officers in June. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is from Florida, condemned Cherfilus-McCormick's actions. “No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain. We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.” The Washington Examiner reported that the OCE recommended the Ethics Committee look into whether she requested community project funding for a for-profit entity, accepted campaign contributions linked to an official action, and whether her office either made payments to an entity or her campaign accepted and failed to report in-kind contributions The DOJ said Cherfilus-McCormick faces up to 53 years in prison if convicted.</p>
