                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kimi Antonelli has revealed that "a bit of a tough" meeting earlier in the season has spurred him on to a run of strong results recently, with the Mercedes driver eyeing another this weekend in Las Vegas. The Formula 1 rookie claimed his best result so far last time out in Sao Paulo, finishing second having also finished runner-up in the Sprint as well that weekend. Ahead of the Las Vegas GP this weekend, Antonelli said that a meeting with Mercedes management allowed him to refocus and put his season back on track. "It really helped me to reset and to refocus on the task and on the important things, so I think it was a new beginning after the difficult period. He added: "Obviously, after Monza, after the meeting, I recognised that I needed to change something, and that's why I reset and realised again what to focus on, what task, and also on the basics, trying to drive well and put things together. I know that if I do all of these things right, the result will come by itself.” Las Vegas has been a strong track for Mercedes since it was added to the calendar in 2023, with the cold conditions suiting the German manufacturer's car as George Russell took victory 12 months ago, leading home team mate Lewis Hamilton. Despite it being a new venue for Antonelli, the 20-year-old was optimistic on his chances. “It's another new track, so it's always very exciting coming into a new track," he said. "Obviously, it's very different conditions to what we've been used to recently; it's very cold and unexpectedly wet. It doesn't mean we're going to be good this year as well, but I really hope we can be as strong as last year, and on my side, I'll try to deliver the best result possible and to enjoy it as well.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Check out the odds for this weekend's Las Vegas Grand Prix, from pole position to the Grand Prix victory. Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet. The Drivers' Championship leader, Lando Norris, has upped his game in recent rounds to win back-to-back races convincingly. In Mexico, he crossed the line 30.324 seconds ahead of runner-up Charles Leclerc, and in Brazil he was 10.388 seconds clear of Kimi Antonelli. The McLaren driver is also developing a reputation for winning from pole, having prevailed five times in six starts from the front row this term. Recent races would suggest that Norris' biggest threat will come from the RB21 of Max Verstappen. The Dutchman will start in Nevada with seven consecutive rostrums to his name, including three victories in the same period. However, minor placings won't help his cause in the title fight, as he needs to recover 49 points on the leader. Despite the mountain ahead, he holds fond memories of this circuit, taking top honours in 2023. On the value end of the scale, George Russell is a worthy selection, given his success on street circuits this campaign. The Mercedes racer took victories on the streets of Montreal and Singapore, racking up five podiums in seven races on similar circuits. He'll also arrive in Nevada as the defending race winner. Piastri arrives in the States with three consecutive fifth-place returns to his name, but he knows how to win on the streets, collecting first prize in Jeddah and Miami earlier this year. As it stands, Leclerc is their best chance of that, arriving with two in his past three outings. Credit is due to the rookie, Antonelli, who snatched his second career top-three down in South America, and his best finish, a runner-up behind Norris. We need to dedicate some space to young Ollie Bearman, who has been nothing short of sensational in the latter part of the calendar. One factor that counts against the rookie, however, is his performance on street tracks this year, where his best return was ninth in Singapore. Seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton continues his tough maiden season at Ferrari. He also enjoyed a successful visit here in 2024, finishing second behind his then-team mate Russell. Then we get the Williams duo of Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon, who are more than capable of a top-six finish. The issue for them is consistency, both from a driver's standpoint and car performance. If they show up in Las Vegas, you can expect them to challenge for points, but we'll find out which Williams fares better. Moving away from youngsters, we settle on Fernando Alonso, who has driven himself into this category eight times this year, twice in the last five Grands Prix. Sticking with the veterans, Nico Hulkenberg produced his seventh top-10 performance of 2025 last time out. It was the second such result in three races, and still, he offers value for money. Liam Lawson continues to show grit, despite an uncertain future in the sport's top flight. Finally, Pierre Gasly collected welcome points for Alpine down in South America for his fifth Grand Prix score of the campaign. However, he's struggled with street layouts this year and will likely endure another tough weekend in Las Vegas. He now trails Verstappen by one in the Pirelli Pole Position Award. He is closely followed by Norris, and last year's Grand Prix victor, Russell. Both of Russell's pole positions this season have occurred on street circuits, that being Canada and Singapore respectively – both races that he went on to win. And while Piastri's form might have seemingly dipped lately, he has qualified fastest on five occasions this term, the last one arriving in the Netherlands. Red Bull have found their groove late in the season and still hold a long shot of producing the Drivers' Champion. The Austrian-owned team have collected five triumphs this campaign, courtesy of Verstappen, and provided the victorious car at this event in 2023.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following the Dutch Grand Prix in August – the first race after F1's summer break – Verstappen was more than 100 points adrift of then-championship leader Oscar Piastri. While the margin is now at 49 points from Lando Norris – who retook the standings lead in Mexico – Verstappen is happy with how he managed to bounce back. Asked ahead of the upcoming Las Vegas Grand Prix if he would rate this season as his best in Formula 1 in terms of what he has achieved behind the wheel, the 28-year-old responded: “It's been good, for sure. “I think every season you want to try and be better, which is not always easy but you try to be more consistent. “It's not where I wanted it to be for most of the season, otherwise you're fighting all season for the title, which we haven't really. “At the same time, in the middle of the season or after the summer break, we were looking at a points gap of more than 100 points and it really looked like it was only going to get bigger, and at one point we were really overturning that by quite a bit. “There's also not much I can do – we need a lot of luck now until the end to even have an opportunity, so personally I don't think about that.” For now Verstappen's focus is on Round 22 in Las Vegas, a weekend that he arrives into off the back of an impressive comeback drive last time out in Sao Paulo that saw him climb from a pit lane start to a final result of P3. Pushed on whether he could be in with a chance of challenging for victory should he get a similar feeling from the RB21 as in Brazil, Verstappen said: “Looking back at Brazil, yeah, I guess so, because the race pace was pretty decent. “Of course I would have liked to start more at the front, but at the same time it was fun. Of course it was only for P2, but I had good fun and I hope we can be competitive this weekend.”</p>
