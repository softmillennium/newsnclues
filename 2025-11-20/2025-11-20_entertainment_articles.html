In the case of Max Greenfield, you will like him when he's angry. No, the former “New Girl” and current “Neighborhood” star isn't joining the MCU as our latest (and undoubtedly most) Incredible Hulk, but in “A Man on the Inside” Season 2, he does play an academic forging a financially advantageous partnership with a rich, goateed jackass. Greenfield plays Jack Beringer, the president of Wheeler College and a gleeful narcissist whose smug sense of superiority is so secure he doesn't even wait around for affirmation. Jack will backdoor-brag about his surgically enhanced calves or boast about a farcical flirtation with a celebrity seated next to him on a flight, then flee (or cease paying attention) before anyone has time to congratulate him (or cut him down a peg). Related Stories ‘Cover-Up' Trailer: Laura Poitras and Mark Obenhaus Interrogate Seymour Hersh — and America Itself ‘Sisu: Road to Revenge' Review: Russian Planes, Trains, and Automobiles Get Blown Up in a Gleefully Violent Sequel So it's striking whenever he slows down, as he does after a masked assailant plasters him with a bucket of mud. The public incident (on a stage, during his speech) sends Jack spiraling, and he directs his ire at the man hired to protect him: Charles Nieuwendyk (Ted Danson). “What if it's not mud next time?” Jack says, staring a hole through Charles' thick black spectacles. Between each rhetorical question, Greenfield punctuates Jack's silly worst-case scenario by stepping closer to Charles. That's the fun of the scene, magnified by Greenfield's concocted whirlwind coming to a full and sudden stop in order to deliver what, in his mind, is a frightening revelation, but to everyone else reads as an absurdly oblivious poop joke. But despite the four paragraphs I've dedicated to Greenfield's hysterical line reading, his is a small moment in “A Man on the Inside” Season 2, and Jack is a small character — not just small-minded, but short on screen time. The mere fact that Season 2 makes time for Greenfield to max out speaks to its astute understanding of what makes for a great sitcom: Sometimes, like in Season 1, it's a combination of bright jokes and poignant humanity. Sometimes, like in Season 2, it's evolving without forgetting about the little flourishes that last in an audience's mind, endearing them not only to the ensemble, but to the show around them. That it's premiering 364 days after the first season is another not-so-small blessing. Season 2 picks up with Charles' first enticing assignment in some time. For a quick fix, Jack turned to America's favorite lifeline — billionaires — and found Brad Vinick (Gary Cole): a Wheeler alumnus worth more than $6 billion who agreed to donate $400 million to his old stomping grounds. “Agreed” is the key word there, because he hasn't handed over the dough just yet, and the administration has good reason to worry he won't: Someone stole Jack's laptop and is threatening to expose all his secrets if Wheeler accepts Brad's “blood money.” Fearing any knowledge of the scandal would scare off Vinick, Jack hires Charles and his boss, Julie (Lilah Richcreek), to find the laptop, identify the thief, and save Wheeler College. Once again, “A Man on the Inside” relies on a rather straightforward mystery to support its higher priorities: comedy, chemistry, and (light) social commentary. That may irk genre fans looking to do some serious sleuthing (from the safe remove of their living room sofa), but there are plenty of shows to scratch that itch, and far fewer that deftly balance so many characters and tones while still getting a well-earned laugh from a well-placed “poo.” To get as close as he can to the staff (all of whom are suspects), Charles joins Wheeler as a guest lecturer — a cover story so perfect he doesn't even need a fake name, since he used to teach engineering at a different university (and, as he may have mentioned, wrote a book on the subject). Instead, his mission grows complicated for personal reasons. Like a small-town freshman who can't navigate his huge new college campus, Professor Nieuwendyk misses most of his (fake) classes to spend time with Mona Margadoff (Mary Steenburgen), a music theory instructor whose impulsive spirit proves irresistible to the ever-sensible egghead. Danson and Steenburgen, whose offscreen marriage has inspired regular swooning over the last 30 years, are fantastic together. At times, it feels like the comic-mystery series has shifted into full rom-com mode, as Schur gives them plenty of scenes to flirt and fool around (in a joking sense, although when Mona poses as a nude model, the prim Charles flies into a hilarious fit of excessive modesty). Their relationship manages to give us exactly what we want while packing in a few savvy surprises — and pushing Charles forward. (But that's not all his arc with Mona is out to accomplish.) Season 2 doesn't go off without a hitch. Trying to replicate Charles' uniquely moving emotional arc from Season 1 would've been a fool's errand, but Season 2 still feels emptier without comparable soul-searching. (Julie reconnecting with her ex-con mom ventures into similar territory, but its a B- or even C-plot and can't reach the same sentimental register). But you'll always want more time with the people you love, and “A Man on the Inside” knows that well enough to make peace with it. Season 2 is solid on its own, and even better at proving the series' sustainability. Future editions can keep the friends and family who prove important to Charles (Stephen McKinley Henderson's Calbert and more Pacific View retirees return!) while continuing to expand his second career through new cases. At the same time, it keeps the door open for what those cases might be, who may be involved in working them, and who may be called in to flesh out Charles' personal life. Neither rests on their laurels (as Sam Malone and the creator of “Parks and Rec” certainly could), instead endeavoring to bring out the best in each other and those around them — whether that means casting their offscreen partner of 30 years as a crush-worthy onscreen girlfriend, or finding room for a brilliant supporting actor to get good and angry, it's a winning formula.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As part of a new tentpole project, the network is launching The Life of Jesus Podcast, a 52-episode series that will guide listeners “through the life, teachings, and miracles of Jesus Christ.” Hosted by Fox & Friends star Ainsley Earhardt, the press release boasted that more than 100 notable actors were signed on, including megastar Kristen Bell as the voice of Mary Magdalene. But that was news to Bell, who was blindsided by the announcement as she had recorded the audio for a separate project 15 years ago. Her rep tells Rolling Stone that she only learned that Fox Faith had acquired the long-forgotten project and was spinning it into a brand-new podcast when her team received a request for her to appear on Fox & Friends a day before the announcement was blasted out. The rep adds that Bell never gave permission for the old audiobook to be repurposed into a new podcast series. Originally, Bell voiced Mary Magdalene for The Truth and Life Dramatized Audio Bible, a New Testament audiobook released in 2010. What's more, the audio Bible includes the same celebrity names that are now being touted in Fox's press release, including Brian Cox, Sean Astin, Neal McDonough, Malcolm McDowell, John Rhys-Davies, and Julia Ormond.

Kevin Spacey Says He Has ‘No Home' After Sexual Misconduct Allegations Brandi Carlile and Patty Loveless Pay Tribute to Vince Gill at 2025 CMA Awards In a note obtained by Rolling Stone, a producer associated with the podcast has asked at least one celebrity star to “not mention that this audio New Testament Bible was produced years ago, we'd like it to feel like something that was produced more recently.” (Rolling Stone has reached out to Fox News Media for comment.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cardi B gave birth to a baby boy on November 4. According to the company's website, it is “your baby's umbilical cord dehydrated in the shape of a heart, and then dipped in gold chrome.” The stylized and preserved umbilical cord is relatively affordable at just $50. However, it is an add-on to the company's pricey $500 Placenta Encapsulation Service, which converts the temporary gestational organ into pill form to be ingested post-partum. The company posted a graphic video on Instagram that demonstrated how the umbilical cord is fed with a metal wire for shaping and then dehydrated for preservation. The brand also shared a video of Cardi B's placenta, dyed blue, before being processed. Summarizing the mixed sentiments, another Instagram fan wrote, “I'm all for memories, but keeping my babies fried, dyed, and dried umbilical cord is not one of them.” Cardi B is not the only famous parent who has used this service. Cardi sparked engagement rumors when a diamond ring was spotted on her left hand in some of the images that she shared of the new baby. She has yet to comment on her current relationship status with Diggs. But, in the meantime, she has a new piece of gold jewelry — made from her baby's umbilical cord — that she can wear on repeat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The viral track, which used AI to alter its vocals, is in the center of a legal firestorm over allegations that it used singer Jorja Smith's voice without permission. Even before its release to streaming services, “I Run,” a dance/EDM track by the artist HAVEN., was a viral sensation online, amassing millions of plays on TikTok after it was teased on Oct. 10. “I love this song so much,” said one TikTok commenter. For HAVEN., a new artist project from British producers Harrison Walker and Jacob Donaghue, who also makes music under the name Waypoint, it was the kind of debut that could change the trajectory of their lives. But now, a swirl of legal complaints and takedown notices have engulfed the song, resulting in it being removed and reuploaded to streaming services multiple times — and stopping its momentum just as it was poised to reach the Billboard charts. The frenzy of activity around “I Run” prompted multiple A&Rs at major and independent music companies to look into signing the track and the people that created it as it awaited official release. She asked in the caption: “who actually is this?” and noted in a reply to a comment “it's not meeeee” when fans asked if she sang on the track or if it was AI. jumped in, adding #jorjasmith to a now-deleted social post about the song, according to a member of their team. That's when questions started circulating about the origins of HAVEN. 's viral track — and whether or not it was an unauthorized AI deepfake of Smith's voice. Ultimately, the song was released in late October by Isekai Records, Broke Records and AAO Records, and it continued to amass major listenership — so much so that it quickly reached #11 on the U.S. Spotify chart and #25 on Spotify globally. Billboard reserves the right to withhold or remove titles from appearing on the charts that are known to be involved in active legal disputes related to copyright infringement that may extend to the deletion of such content on digital service providers. Broke Records tells Billboard that it filed dozens of counter-notices, asserting HAVEN. 's ownership of the song and noting that no lawsuit has been filed against them to date in association with the song. They admit, however, that “AI-assisted vocal processing” was used to “transform solely [their] voice” in the song. Specifically, they say they used AI music generator Suno to turn Walker's voice into that of a woman's — without referencing Smith. “It's been such an honor to see the love and support for ‘I Run' these past few weeks,” HAVEN. “What started as something fun and experimental between two producers and music-lovers ended up taking the internet by storm. It shouldn't be any secret that I used AI-assisted vocal processing to transform solely my voice for ‘I Run.' As a songwriter and producer I enjoy using new tools, techniques and staying on the cutting edge of what's happening. Suno does not allow users to request specific artist or song names. Given Smith is signed to The Orchard, a Sony Music-owned distributor, it is possible her sound recordings were used in Suno's training. According to the lawsuit and to AI music expert Ed Newton-Rex in an article for Music Business Worldwide, users can find savvy or accidental ways to prompt Suno into providing results that seem to contain recognizable pieces of intellectual property from artists like ABBA, James Brown, Michael Buble and more. The takedowns list a variety of reasons for the request for removal, according to emails obtained by Billboard, including one from Spotify that says, “We have received a complaint that your content infringes the sound recording rights of a third party. While this claim is under investigation, the content has been removed.” Another from Spotify says the content “violates exclusive rights.” A third reads, “Spotify may remove content that misrepresents a track as originating from or featuring an artist or that uses an artist's name in a misleading way.” One from TikTok also lists the reason why the track is muted as “it contains unauthorized copyrighted music.” There would have to be a sample of her sound recordings,” says Theresa Weisenberger, lawyer and co-lead at BakerHostetler's AI practice, adding that voices are only protected by publicity rights — the legal right that varies state-to-state in the U.S. which protects one's name, image and likeness from exploitation. Historically, these rights have been mostly limited to commercial contexts, like misleading endorsements. Amid the boom in AI and deepfakes, however, lawmakers in Tennessee passed a new law, called the ELVIS Act, to dramatically expand the right to stop voice cloning in any context. And federally, lawmakers are currently considering a similar law, the NO FAKES Act, that would do the same thing nationally. “I think this ought to be a wake up call for people to look at the status of the NO FAKES Act and to deal with how long it will take to get that moving and into a national uniform law,” adds Kenneth Anderson, an attorney at Rimon Law who recently advised his client, Ben Folds, though a deepfake situation. “We have a problem that is rapidly overtaking the music industry. 's labels started reuploading the song over and over, leading to a seemingly endless game of whack-a-mole for both sides. “But the fact that platforms aren't doing that might speak to the PR issue this song causes.” For Broke, an indie record label founded in 2023, “I Run” was gearing up to be their (and HAVEN. 's) biggest hit yet, and its founders tell Billboard they feel the song is being discriminated against by bigger industry players. “It is difficult to imagine this recording, if released by a major label, being treated in the same way as HAVEN.” The song has become a lightning rod for conversations around generative AI use in the creation of popular music. To date, some music streaming services still do not have AI-specific policies in place, and those that do, like Deezer and SoundCloud, tend to only penalize fully AI-generated works, not something like “I Run,” which contains significant human input. As Billboard reported in 2023, however, an increasing number of platforms have broadened the ability of rightholders to issue takedowns when publicity rights — the right to one's name image likeness and voice — are violated, due to the rise of AI-generated deepfakes. Spotify added to these publicity rights protections just last month when it announced that it was strengthening its policies against negative uses of AI. is gearing up to release a re-recording of the song, featuring the vocals of a singer named Kaitlin Aragon. She was discovered by the team after posting a TikTok video, covering “I Run” which sounds fairly similar to the original. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meghan Markle's staff announces the royal before she enters a room — even if there are only two guests. During an interview with Harper's Bazaar, writer Kaitlyn Greenidge said she and the Duchess of Sussex entered a New York City “grand” brownstone that belonged to one of Markle's friends. Elsewhere in the interview, Greenidge also said that someone announced Markle when she arrived at the La Brea Tar Pits, an active fossil-dig site and natural-history museum in Los Angeles, to meet with a group of girls from a local STEM school. “A golf cart pulls up, the gravel crunching beneath its tires.

The couple, who have welcomed son Prince Archie, 6, and daughter Princess Lilibet, 4, now reside in a $14 million mansion in Montecito, Calif. Though Markle and the Duke of Sussex left the royal family, they and their children were allowed to keep their titles. It means a lot to me,” she said of her family. “I think as the kids get older, they're so excited about, ‘Oh my gosh, Mama and Papa, how did you meet? “I think that will come with time as they get older, but for right now a huge part of our love story is that we share the name Sussex.”</p>

RELATED: Is ‘House Of The Dragon' Ending With Season 4? A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms also produces shorter seasons consisting of six half-hour episodes each vs 8-10 hourlong episodes a season for HoD. RELATED: ‘Task' Renewed For Season 2 By HBO With Mark Ruffalo Set To Return HBO‘s Head of Drama Series and Films Francesca Orsi told Deadline in February that A Knight of Seven Kingdoms is done on a smaller, more “intimate” scale than the other Game of Thrones series. She also confirmed that the show is still on track for a three-season run spanning Martin's three Dunk and Egg books.“You're going be so impressed by Peter Claffey and Dexter Sol Ansell as Dunk and Egg, the two leads,” she said at the time. RELATED: HBO Boss Casey Bloys Says IP Push With Titles Such As ‘IT: Welcome To Derry' Helps Fill “Void” Left By Fewer Movie Deals A Knight of Seven Kingdoms stars Claffey as Ser Duncan “Dunk” the Tall, Ansell as Egg, Daniel Ings, Bertie Carvel, Danny Webb, Sam Spruell, Shaun Thomas, Finn Bennett, Edward Ashley, Tanzyn Crawford, Henry Ashton, Youssef Kerkour, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor and Daniel Monks. Martin and Ira Parker are co-creators/executive produces, with the latter serving as showrunner. Set a century before the events of Game of Thrones and 72 years after House of the Dragon, A Knight of Seven Kingdom follows two unlikely heroes wandering Westeros … a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall (Claffey), and his diminutive squire, Egg (Ansell) … Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends. (You can watch a trailer below, which shows Martin's ambition for the series to feature “the best jousting sequences that were ever done on film.”) RELATED: ‘Task' Renewed For Season 2 By HBO With Mark Ruffalo Set To Return Along with the A Knight of Seven Kingdom renewal, HBO on Thursday also gave an early Season 4 pickup to House of the Dragon to premiere in 2028. “Together, House of the Dragon and A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms reveal just how expansive and richly imagined George R. R. Martin's universe continues to be. In January, I think audiences will be delighted by the inspiring underdog tale of Dunk and Egg that George and Ira Parker have captured so beautifully.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As “The Real Housewives of Orange County” prepares to celebrate its 20th season, Bravo fans are buzzing about which familiar faces — and potential new ones — will shape the milestone year. According to a tip sent to Bravo and Cocktails, Vicki Gunvalson is set to join Tamra Judge, Heather Dubrow, Shannon Beador, Gina Kirschenheiter, and Jennifer Pedranti as full-time cast members in season 20. Emily Simpson, Katie Ginella, and Gretchen Rossi are still “on the bubble,” with their returns being evaluated based on storyline direction and chemistry. The tip also claims Evolution Media is interested in having Rossi return — which would explain the recent effort to help her clean up a social-media scandal storyline — but producers remain uncertain whether she could realistically film alongside Judge after their long-running tension. In addition to determining which veterans will be full-time Housewives, the production team is seeking to introduce one brand-new cast member for the upcoming season. Several familiar alumni — including Jeana Keough, Jo De La Rosa, Lauri Peterson, Kimberly Bryant, and Alexis Bellino — are reportedly expected to appear in special guest scenes throughout season 20. Judge — recently back on good terms with Gunvalson — celebrated the moment, signaling fresh potential for a Tres Amigas revival with Beador. But not all former cast relationships are on the mend. Speaking to Us Weekly at BravoCon, Judge said she sees no path forward with Rossi. She's accused me of things I've never done. She came in and could not move on.” Meanwhile, Ginella offered a candid look at her own standing with the cast during an Entertainment Tonight interview. I was hoping that neurotic Vicki would never return. How many times is she going to cry wolf? I never want to see Alexis, Jeana Keough or Joe de la Rosa return. Andy & Bravo allowing the bullying from that sewer rat is mind blowing. Anyone else notice how different Shannon looks in this picture? I could do without Emily and Gina as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The telcom giant becomes the latest to shed thousands of staff, but also sets up a training program for employees it is handing pink slips to. If this is the year of publicly-traded companies signaling to Wall Street that they're going to do more with less, in preparation for an AI-driven economy, add Verizon to the list of giants cutting a substantial number of jobs in a pivot. The company, newly led by former PayPal mogul Dan Schulman, said Thursday that it is reducing its workforce by 13,000 employees and cutting its outsourced and outside labor expenses. The cuts are not unusual: Amazon revealed it was slashing 14,000 jobs, Microsoft has exited 15,000 employees, Paramount's new ownership is cutting roughly 2,000 roles and many other blue-chip companies have seen a thousand-plus staffers cut this year. “To help our people prepare for their future, we have established a $20 million Reskilling and Career Transition Fund for employees departing Verizon,” Schulman wrote in a public memo. “This fund will focus on skill development, digital training and job placement to help our people take their next steps. It is my intent to also work with other companies and the public sector to address the opportunities and challenges in a world where technology will impact all of us.” During Vestberg's tenure he effectively shuffled Verizon out of the media business, selling Yahoo and AOL to private equity giant Apollo for $5 billion. During Schulman's first earnings call as CEO on October 29, he candidly set expectations for a major shake-up. “For the past few years, our financial growth has relied too heavily on price increases, a strategic approach that relies too much on price without subscriber growth is not a sustainable strategy,” Schulman added. “We have barely scratched the surface of how AI-powered innovation can transform our customer experience. Year-to-date Verizon stock has been mostly flat, as of Nov. 20 it's trading at $40.78 a share and is up about 1 percent for the year. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump has renewed his beef with late night show host Jimmy Kimmel with a call for ABC to take him off the air, again. “Why does ABC Fake News keep Jimmy Kimmel, a man with NO TALENT and VERY POOR TELEVISION RATINGS, on the air? His social media post followed Kimmel in a late night show monologue suggesting Trump “loses his mind” every time he is asked why he hadn't released the so-called Jeffrey Epstein files. Asking for Kimmel to be yanked also comes two days after Trump called for ABC's broadcast license to be revoked after an ABC News reporter asked again why he had chosen not to release the government's files on the late convicted sex offender Epstein. Saudi Arabia Leads Effort to Pour $900 Million Into Hollywood AI Firm, Giving Kingdom a Foothold In Future of Entertainment That was followed by successful votes on Capitol Hill to get all government Epstein files released and Trump in a reversal signing the legislation when it came to his desk at the White House. Reigniting the feud with Kimmel also followed Disney's ABC deciding to temporarily preempt its marquee late night show in September following monologue comments he made in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination. His benching came in the wake of monologue jokes referencing MAGA Republicans scrambling to distance their politics from the ideologies of conservative pundit Kirk's alleged shooter Tyler Robinson. The remarks were interpreted by many on the right as an incorrect classification of Robinson's beliefs and a direct or indirect placement of blame for Kirk's murder on extreme-right politics. Kimmel made an emotional return to hosting his late night show, before getting back to his normal programming that routinely mocks Trump during opening monologues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats came roaring back in the 2025 off-year elections, flipping seats from governor to positions in state and county legislatures, with the GOP failing to win any real pick-ups under the weight of Donald Trump's plummeting popularity. But Democrats need to learn the lessons from their big November night. Because whatever sugar high they may be feeling will soon collide with the fact that their party's approval rating is still stubbornly lower than Trump's, according to multiple polls compiled by CNN. Over in New Jersey and Virginia, Governors-elect Mikie Sherril and Abigail Spanberger won victories, both with 57 percent of the vote, in states that often elect Republican governors. Yes, they benefited from backlash against Trump, but crucially they made gains among middle-class moderates in the suburbs, and even improved margins in rural areas. Here's the key stat to keep in mind: Mamdani won barely 50 percent of the vote in a city that's six to one Democrat. When all the votes are counted, he could well dip below majority support – which is academic to the extent that his opposition was split between red beret Republican Curtis Sliwa and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, running half-heartedly as an independent. But for the Democratic nominee to barely break 50 percent in NYC is not a massive mandate. Yes, Mandami succeeded in inspiring a young liberal base. More than a million people turned out to support him. Those are clear lessons that Democrats across the spectrum can learn from. They refused to get drawn into divisive culture war debates. They also share a broad political profile which can help Democrats expand their appeal nationally. Both women were decidedly centrist members of Congress with national security street cred: Sherril was a former Navy helicopter pilot and Spanberger was a former CIA analyst. He has never worked in the private sector and has no record of military service or executive experience – which is a practical challenge for managing a $117 billion budget. As my friend, New York 1 anchor Errol Louis has joked: Mamdani is everything the Tea Party accused Barack Obama of being: born in Africa; a Muslim and a socialist. 'SNL' Weekend Update Roasts Andrew Cuomo's Failed Campaign, 'Suspicious' RFK Jr. 'SNL' Cold Open: Trump Ignores Oval Office Emergency to Grouse About Mamdani's Win Jimmy Kimmel Celebrates Trump's Reaction to Democratic Wins: ‘Everything He Touched Was a Loser' This Children's Book Celebrates Zohran Mamdani's Historic New York City Mayoral Race Part of the genius of Mamdani's campaign is that he may have been an avatar for identity politics, but he never played that card hard. While he resisted criticizing policies or people to his left (only half-heartedly distancing himself from calls to “globalize the intifada” and his own past tweets calling to defund the police), Mamdani offered a relentlessly upbeat demeanor and famously smiling face that inspired hope in many at a time when that is in short supply. His success was a prime example of Maya Angelou's admonition that people might not remember what you said but they remember how you made them feel. Spanberger called for “pragmatism over partisanship” in a state that has suffered under Trumpism's right-wing policies. After the Bloomberg years, New York's last two mayors have left office in the doghouse with voters, with Bill de Blasio barely showing up for work and Eric Adams beset by a steady stream of corruption allegations from his crony circle. Donald Trump's team has tried to normalize the idea that any victory — no matter how narrow — is a mandate to impose their extreme ideological vision on the nation, believing that might makes right. Democrats have correctly if belatedly focused on the issue of affordability. The basic social contract which says if you work hard and play by the rules you'll get ahead has been broken, and that righteous frustration is fueling populist fire. Kevin Spacey Says He Has 'No Home' After Sexual Misconduct Allegations Brandi Carlile and Patty Loveless Pay Tribute to Vince Gill at 2025 CMA Awards But that passion needs to be channeled in a constructive direction or it will burn the whole house down. Democrats should not defend a broken status quo but they need to offer reforms in ways that attract more people than they alienate — focusing on rebuilding the middle class and the middle of our politics while ditching the culture war obsessions that drag them down. This month's election results show that Democrats can win big in swing districts, kicking out candidates who suck up to Trump and excuse his unhinged excesses.

The former Hallmark actress and current Great American Family star is aware that, like any relationship, there will be highs and lows, and she has revealed how they navigate any challenges that arise in their marriage. In an episode of the “Stay True” podcast on Monday, November 17, the “Full House” actress discussed her marriage to Bure. She also discussed how essential it was to have flexibility in marriage and how having children put pressure on the relationship. “And the rhythms are going to keep changing.” Cameron Bure continued, “So having flexibility not only in schedule but with each other as husband and wife, because that's the first thing that's going to go. Your marriage gets put to the test because first of all, you have kids that come in and they demand all of you. Then they get a little older, and then they pit you against your husband, and you don't even realize it.” Cameron Bure discussed what she meant about the children pitting her and her husband against each other by giving a relatable example. And he's like, ‘Well, I didn't know that. In the interview, Cameron Bure also discussed what she found worked for her and her husband, helping them keep their 29-year marriage strong. She spoke about finding “rhythms” and the importance of spending time together. She also stressed how important it is to have “time with you and your husband are going to be regardless, of career, but just in terms of children.” Cameron Bure continued to offer advice. “If I could lend you some advice that would be it is that you have to prioritize the relationship,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Take, for instance, news today, when Variety reported that Dave Erickson—who co-created spin-off series Fear The Walking Dead, which ran for eight seasons on AMC—had lodged a lawsuit against the network claiming that he got screwed out of millions of dollars in profit participation on the spin-off. Erickson has now become the seventh high-level Walking Dead producer to sue the network, as his lawsuit joins a currently pending federal one from his co-creator Robert Kirkman, series executive producer Gale Anne Hurd, and several others, focused on the original series—which, in turn, followed one from original showrunner Frank Darabont that AMC actually settled (to the tune of $200 million) back in 2021. There has been a lot of suing attached to this franchise, is our point. Erickson's argument will be familiar to anyone who's looked into those other suits: He claims that he was promised 5 percent of the modified adjusted gross receipts from Fear, an amount that has apparently added up to a whopping zero dollars. Or, to put it in legal-ese: “When a vertically integrated conglomerate like AMC both produces a series and licenses it to its various affiliates, domestic and international, cable and streaming, concerns about improper self-dealing abound. Erickson brings this action to rectify AMC's egregious misconduct and to obtain the tens of millions of dollars in profits he is rightfully owed.” (Among other things, Erickson is claiming that AMC's calculations for what count as “modified adjusted gross receipts” didn't line up with industry standards, and were “the worst possible definition for a hit show in the history of television.”) The network, meanwhile, has already fired back with the same ire (and, indeed, some of the same language) it's been using to fight back against Kirkman's multiple suits—and, before that, Darabont's, which it fought for roughly a decade before ultimately relenting. “The contracts here were negotiated by the most experienced and sophisticated legal talent in Hollywood,” AMC's lawyer said in a statement. “And AMC has fully paid what is owed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new blog post, Robert Kyncl shared his list of non-negotiables in licensing talks with AI companies and said the new technology will further democratize music creation. Warner Music Group CEO Robert Kyncl has detailed the company's approach to generative AI in a new blog post published Wednesday (Nov. 19). The missive arrived just hours after WMG announced a settlement and licensing deal with Udio, effectively ending its part in a blockbuster copyright infringement lawsuit against the AI music company, which it brought alongside the other two majors. Cristela Alonzo Announces 'Midlife Mixtape' Tour for 2026: Full Details In Kyncl's address, he stressed that while it's “early days” for AI, “this is the moment to shape the business models, set the guardrails and pioneer the future for the benefit of artists and songwriters.” The CEO also revealed his thought process when going into meetings with AI companies, saying that his three non-negotiables include “partners who commit to licensed models”; economic terms that benefit and “reflect the value of music”; and giving the company's signees a choice to “opt-in” to any use of their names, images, likenesses or voices in new AI-generated songs. Kyncl also stated his belief that AI tools will further democratize music creation, adding that to stand out “in a sea of AI-generated content, real artistry identity and vision” is needed. Investment is surging, talent is pouring in, and a crop of new, ambitious startups are working with music again for the first time in more than a decade. We're approaching this new era with one priority above all else: protecting and empowering the artists and songwriters who are our reason for being. Every AI deal we make is guided by three non-negotiable principles: We will only make agreements with partners who commit to licensed models;2. And, most importantly, artists and songwriters will have a choice to opt-in to any use of their name, image, likeness, or voice in new AI-generated songs. Now, we are entering the next phase of innovation. We believe Generative AI will lead to a new explosion in creative and commercial opportunities, and that authentic talent will be even more in demand for two reasons We lobby for legislation that sets clear guidelines. Licensing is how we can safeguard our artists and songwriters, while collaborating with tech partners, to propel new fan experiences that drive additional revenue. The partnerships we forge will offer a variety of specific use cases. Each of them adheres to our principles, winning important protections for artists and songwriters, while ensuring that they share in every dollar that's earned. Past lessons teach us that delaying only lets others define our future. And the film & TV industries are still regretting not embracing streaming sooner. So for artists and songwriters to win, the music industry needs to be a leading force in the formative stages of AI, not a passive participant. We will steer the course in this new era to deliver greater value for our artists, songwriters, and their music. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
