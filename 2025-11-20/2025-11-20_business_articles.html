                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack on Thursday gave indications that she thinks the central bank could be nearing the end of what could be a brief rate-cutting cycle. The policymaker told CNBC that she thinks the current level of interest rates is "barely restrictive, if at all" when it comes to the economic impact. Restrictiveness is a key metric for Fed officials, who are divided ideologically over whether labor market weakness or inflation is a bigger threat. Hammack has been more in the hawkish camp when it comes to inflation, preferring higher rates and more restrictive policy as a bulwark against another surge in prices. "I think that we need to maintain a modestly, somewhat restrictive stance of policy to make sure that we are continuing to bring inflation back down to our 2% objective," she told CNBC's Steve Liesman on "Squawk on the Street." Hammack added that she thinks the current federal funds rate, targeted in a range between 3.75%-4%, is "right around a neutral rate," indicating it does not need to come down much further. As a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year, Hammack serves as a key policy voice. The Fed next meets Dec. 9-10, and market expectations have swung from a near-certainty that the committee would approve a third consecutive quarter percentage point reduction to now pricing in about a 60% probability that the committee will stand pat, per the CME Group's FedWatch tracker of futures prices. While focused on inflation, Hammack expressed concern over current price levels, noting that interviews she and her staff have conducted around the Cleveland area indicate labor market pressures as well as inflation concerns that are causing difficulty for households to make ends meet. "What we hear from the workers is that they're holding on to their jobs for dear life, if they have them," she said. But what I also heard ... was that the money that they have coming in is just not stretching as far as it used to. What used to cost $30 now costs $5, and so ... that inflationary pressure is still very salient for them." Addressing the September nonfarm payrolls report released Thursday, Hammack called the picture "mixed" as it showed both higher-than-expected payrolls growth and a tick up in the unemployment rate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google on Thursday rolled out Nano Banana Pro, its latest image editing and generation tool, continuing the company's momentum after launching its new Gemini artificial intelligence model earlier this week. The product is built on Gemini 3 Pro, which was announced on Tuesday and contributed to record-breaking stock highs. Josh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs and Gemini, told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa that the Nano Banana Pro's capabilities expand beyond its original iteration, which launched in late August. It can take up to 14 different images, or five different characters, and sort of keep that character consistency," he said. He added that internal users have experimented with the feature by inputting code snippets and even LinkedIn resumes to create infographics. "I think this ability to visualize things that were previously maybe not something you would think of as a visual medium that tends to be one of the magic things people are finding with it," Woodward said. The original Nano Banana went viral on social media as users turned photos of themselves or their pets into hyperrealistic 3D figurines. Nano Banana Pro is currently available in the Gemini app, with limited free quotas, Google's writing assistant, NotebookLM, as well as the company's developer, enterprise and advertising products. Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will have access to the product in Google's search features AI Mode. The feature will later also roll out to Ultra subscribers first in Flow, Google's AI filmmaking tool. Google introduced another feature in the Gemini app that allows users to upload any image to find out if it was generated by Google AI. Images generated on free Nano Banana accounts will have a watermark, but it will be removed for Google AI Ultra tier subscribers. Google has been working to gain ground on OpenAI in the generative AI race, which ignited after the release of ChatGPT in 2022. Last week, OpenAI announced two updates to its GPT-5 model to make it "warmer by default and more conversational" as well as " more efficient and easier to understand in everyday use," the company said. ChatGPT currently tops the list of free apps on Apple's App Store, with Gemini in the second spot. The Gemini app currently has over 650 million monthly active users per month, and Gemini-powered AI Overviews has 2 billion monthly users, Google said in a release. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in October that ChatGPT had reached 800 million weekly active users. Woodward said Google AI products have had growing demand, with many users signing up for Gemini's subscription plan to have "higher limits with some of these advanced models." The company is looking to continue scaling its AI offerings, Woodward said, highlighting Flow, Google's AI filmmaking tool, and Genie, a "world building" model that is currently available as a limited research preview.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the U.S. Department of Education announced this week that it would transfer much of its programs to other agencies, it didn't appear that the country's federal student loan portfolio would be impacted. However, financial aid experts and consumer advocates are still worried for borrowers. More than 40 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. "What is concerning is the destabilization of the Department of Education and Federal Student Aid at the very moment when consistent, technically skilled oversight is most needed," said Carolina Rodriguez, director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York. More than 5 million people are in default on their education debt, and President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminates several long-standing affordable repayment plans and relief options. "Student loan eligibility and repayment involve multiple systems working together, and institutions need that process to be seamless, current and accurate," said Melanie Storey, president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. "As the delivery of other programs moves to other agencies, these dependencies must be carefully considered." On Tuesday, Trump administration officials said they had signed agreements with four federal agencies, including the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, to start managing programs currently under the Education Department. Education Secretary Linda McMahon has argued that the recent government shutdown proved that the department is not needed. Earlier this year, the Trump administration laid off nearly half of the Education Department's staffers. "They are attempting to hollow out the U.S. Department of Education, leaving behind a shell of the original organization," said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. But it may be trying to offload the debt. Student loan borrowers have faced even more problems in the private market than with the government, consumer advocates said. When private companies played a bigger role in federal student lending in the past under the Federal Family Education Loan, of FFEL, program, Rodriguez said, "borrowers saw their debt balloon with no end in sight due to loan mismanagement." Any major loan transfer "will also result in errors that could harm borrowers and push relief further out of reach," said Aissa Canchola Banez, the policy director at Protect Borrowers. Currently, private lenders account for 8% of all student loans but are the subject of more than 40% of student debt complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, lawmakers recently wrote in a letter to Trump officials.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While artificial intelligence spending is forming a bubble in the market, investors don't need to give up their positions, according to Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio. "Don't sell just because there's a bubble," Dalio said Thursday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." Dalio's comments come as AI darling Nvidia surged more than 5% Thursday on the back of better-than-expected earnings and guidance. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang brushed off bubble concerns, telling analysts on Wednesday that "we see something very different." The Morning Squawk newsletter by Alex Harring is your rundown of five things to know before the stock market opens. Nvidia's rally lifted the stock market, with Wall Street appearing to move past fears around the AI trade faltering that weighed on stocks in recent sessions. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite has climbed nearly 17% in 2025, propelled by gains in megacap tech stocks amid continued excitement around AI. While Dalio sees a bubble forming, he said there would also need to be something to pop it. The billionaire investor said it's unlikely to be tighter monetary policy, but it could come from higher wealth taxes. "The picture is pretty clear, in that we are in that territory of a bubble," Dalio said. Dalio said market participants should look to diversify their portfolios through investments like gold. The metal — which has long been viewed as a safe-haven trade — has surged to all-time highs this year. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia on Wednesday reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat expectations, and provided a strong forecast for the current quarter. Other stocks in the so-called artificial intelligence trade also saw a boost. A closer look at Nvidia's report shows that it continues to dominate the market for AI chips called GPUs, and CEO Jensen Huang sounded confident in the company's products and bullish on the company's outlook during a call with analysts. That would be 65% growth on an annual basis. Here are three key takeaways from Nvidia's earnings: On Wednesday's earnings call with analysts, Huang began his comments by rejecting the premise of an "AI bubble" held by some investors who are concerned about the billions of dollars being spent on Nvidia chips and potential return on investment. "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Huang said. "From our vantage point, we see something very different." Huang said there were three different kinds of uses for AI that are currently growing, and that all three are contributing to the boom in infrastructure investments. He said that non-AI software, like for data processing, was increasingly being run on the company's GPUs, that AI will create new kinds of apps, and that "agentic AI" which doesn't need user input, will require additional computing power. Huang said that people will soon start appreciating what's happening underneath the surface of the AI boom, versus "the simplistic view of what's happening to CapEx and investment." Bernstein analysts said in a note that Huang's comments helped settle investor fears of a bubble after a recent pullback in AI names, saying "perhaps the AI trade is not yet dead after all." "More than just good numbers, we believe investors needed some hand-holding from Jensen which he provided in spades," the analysts wrote. Any long-term outlook from Nvidia is important to the technology industry because Nvidia counts many of the most powerful technology customers as customers. Nvidia said on Wednesday that its order backlog didn't even include a few recent announcements, like the company's deal with Anthropic or the expansion of a deal with Saudi Arabia this week. "We see the opportunity to grow for quite some time," Huang said. "We don't expect every AI bear to be satisfied, but these results and added context from management around demand outlook should offer some near-term reprieve," the analysts wrote. Some analysts projected the China business could be worth $50 billion per year to Nvidia. The company eventually got the licenses this summer after Huang personally met with President Donald Trump and struck a deal to give the U.S. government 15% of China sales. "Sizable purchase orders never materialized in the quarter due to geopolitical issues and the increasingly competitive market in China," Kress said. Nvidia has argued that the U.S. government should allow exports of the most advanced chips because it's better for national security if Chinese developers get used to Nvidia technology, rather than being forced to use Chinese chips and make them better. The H20 is old technology, but Nvidia wants to gain approval to send a version of its current-generation Blackwell chip in China. "While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the US and China governments and will continue to advocate for America's ability to compete around the world," Kress said. "Currently Nvidia isn't delivering to China and we are not counting on this situation to get straightened out," the firm said. CNBC's Sam Subin contributed to this story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Business leaders, including Elon Musk and AMD CEO Lisa Su, joined a dinner with President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House on Tuesday. Here is a list of US executives who attended the high-profile dinner. Elon Musk made a rare public appearance at the White House since his falling-out with Trump earlier this year, after stepping down as the informal head of the White House DOGE Office. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang attended the White House dinner as one of the most influential figures in artificial intelligence and chipmaking. Nvidia's CEO's presence underscored the pivotal role of advanced computing in US-Saudi economic relations and the global competition to dominate AI technology. Apple chief Tim Cook joined the White House dinner as one of the most powerful figures in global business, representing a tech giant that shapes everything from consumer tech to privacy standards. His appearance highlighted Apple's pivotal role in US innovation — and its importance to any conversation about the future of tech and trade. As the leader driving fierce competition in semiconductors — a sector vital to both AI development and global supply chains — Su's inclusion signaled the critical importance of her industry to US strategy. Late on Wednesday evening, Su shared photos from the dinner, including one of her sitting with Ronaldo. Thank you @POTUS and @FLOTUS for hosting an amazing evening. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman attended the White House dinner as one of Wall Street's most outspoken figures. OpenAI president Greg Brockman joined the White House dinner as a key architect behind the modern AI revolution. His invitation underscored the growing importance of artificial intelligence in diplomacy and economic strategy, with OpenAI's technology now at the center of global debates about innovation and regulation. Venture capitalist and White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks was among the attendees at the dinner, reflecting his growing influence at the intersection of tech, politics, and finance. In December, Trump appointed Sacks as White House's AI and crypto czar, guiding the government on policy and regulation around the digital asset industry. His presence showed the increasing importance of digital assets in global finance and the White House's commitment to engaging with fintech leaders who are shaping the future of money.</p>

One analyst has taken a dimmer view of two AI kingmakers this week. Alex Haissl, an analyst at Rothschild & Co Redburn, is a lonely dissenting voice among research analysts when it comes to shares of Amazon and Microsoft. Investors look like they're valuing Amazon and Microsoft's capex plans as "as if cloud-1.0 economics still applied," Haissl wrote, referring to the low-cost structure of cloud-based services that allowed Big Tech firms to boom in the 2010s. But there are a few problems that suggest the AI boom likely won't play out in the same way, and it is is probably far more costly than investors realize, he said. "But after turning over every stone, we no longer see a credible path back to cloud 1.0 economics. The market, however, still prices in that outcome, implying returns we believe are no longer achievable," he added. There are key differences between the business model for "cloud 1.0" and generative AI, Haissl said. According to Rothchild's analysis, a GPU costs firms around $40 billion in capex per gigawatt of power. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Apple are on track to spend around $349 billion in capex this year, much of which is directed toward AI infrastructure, according to company statements. "We are not concerned about operating margins; those can be managed. Second, AI chips are also known to have a short lifespan, another factor that can make projects costly. If a GPU were to be replaced every three years, projects would turn "value destructive," according to Rothchild's estimates, implying losses for the owners of the chips. Third, hyperscalers have limited pricing power, Haissl said, pointing to the expenses associated with AI hardware, which is largely provided by tech startups. "Passing higher costs on to startups would simply deepen their losses unless those costs could be pushed through to end users; if not, hyperscaler economics deteriorate further," he said. "While there may still be some upside to growth, we believe it is limited relative to buy-side expectations and, more importantly, less relevant given the low value of that growth," Haissl said. That's not to say the firm is turning completely negative on Amazon and Microsoft. It's a fragile time for the AI trade, with tech stocks sinking in recent weeks as investors take stock of high valuations and begin to doubt the billions being sown into AI-related investments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia's blockbuster earnings just blew a hole through Wall Street's AI bubble anxieties. Nvidia's stock rose more than 5% in premarket trading on Thursday. "Fears of an AI bubble are way overstated," Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote after the print. "This is another validation point for the AI revolution," Ives wrote. Thomas Monteiro, a senior analyst at Investing.com, said Nvidia's report shows the AI revolution is "nowhere near its peak," with both demand and supply chain scaling continuing. Despite concerns that ballooning capital expenditures — estimated at more than $400 billion across top cloud platforms — could lead to a slowdown, Monteiro said Nvidia's numbers show that tech companies remain committed to scaling their data centers. Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said investors remain wary of what he calls the "three C's" — capex sustainability, circular financing, and rising competition. "While these issues were not put to rest, the recent print does give investors confidence that Nvidia is still executing at a high level," he wrote. Nvidia's results suggest those fears can at least be "punted" into the next quarter, he added. EMARKETER tech analyst Jacob Bourne told Business Insider that while Nvidia "delivered another blockbuster quarter," investors are increasingly focused on whether physical constraints — including power availability, land, and grid access — may limit how quickly hyperscalers can turn GPU capacity into actual revenue. "We'll probably be taking more orders," said Colette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, noting that new customers — including Anthropic following its recent deal — would add demand. "There's definitely an opportunity for us to have more on top of the $500 billion that we announced," she added. CEO Jensen Huang revealed at Nvidia's October GTC conference that the company has $500 billion worth of AI-chip orders booked for 2025 and 2026, including orders for Blackwell, its most powerful chip, and Rubin, which is set to surpass it when it launches next year. "Nvidia answered the bell with GB300 shipments driving healthy upside to estimates," they wrote. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." Some tech leaders have been warning that AI may be in bubble territory. "The value is extremely high, just like creating the internet ended up being, in net, very valuable," Gates said in an appearance on CNBC's "Squawk Box". And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they'll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive." "There are a ton of these investments that will be dead ends," he added. Michael Burry, the contrarian investor who called and profited from the 2008 financial crisis, has also been warning about AI market mania — and betting against Nvidia. Others, like Huang, have pushed back on the AI bubble narrative. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said in July that the AI frenzy may resemble a bubble, but that doesn't mean it is one in reality. "I think it's unlikely, based on my experience, that this is a bubble," Schmidt said during an appearance at the RAISE Summit in Paris. "It's much more likely that you're seeing a whole new industrial structure." Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said both sides of the debate could take something away from Nvidia's earnings. "Overall the bulls got what they wanted last night, while bearish investors (hello, Michael Burry) will still be able to argue that such exuberant spending will ultimately end in tears," he said.</p>

The Sam Altman-founded company behind the "Orb," a volleyball-sized metal sphere that scans irises to prove people's humanity, had a message for employees: work weekends and ignore anything outside your job — for the good of humanity. During a January all-hands with employees of the startup, Tools for Humanity, CEO Alex Blania laid out his expectations. "We will neither fail, nor will we be an average outcome, and that's what we want and that's all I care about every day and all you should care about every day, and nothing else should matter," Blania said, according to a recording reviewed by Business Insider. The company's mission is to build a global digital identity system that can verify who is human in an increasingly AI-driven world. "We don't care about politics, we don't care about DEI, we don't care about anything, we just care about how can we achieve the mission through merit, performance, and excellence," said Blania, who also told staffers he had recently attended President Donald Trump's inauguration in Washington, DC. Several "team values" displayed on a television screen in the start-up's now-former San Francisco office echoed Blania's messaging, a February video viewed by Business Insider shows. We believe this is a once in a lifetime project and that success is important for humanity," one read. Other values included a warning that the company doesn't "tolerate slowness and comfort," as well as the idea that "we have no place for talkers, ideology, or politics. The values were written by Blania, according to a former employee. "The organization's transparency about its values and operating principles has resulted in building a team that is passionate and focused on its increasingly urgent mission of ensuring every human benefits from the age of AI," a Tools for Humanity spokesperson told Business Insider. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. The company's philosophy reflects a broader corporate trend toward hardcore culture. John Stankey, AT&T's CEO, sent the company's managers a frank memo about its return-to-office policy and told workers to prioritize performance and accountability over loyalty or comfort. Business Insider previously reported on Amazon's "hardcore culture reset." He has described the company's overarching goal as reaching a billion users. Business Insider previously reported that, so far, Tools for Humanity has verified around 17.5 million people — a little under 2% of its target. "We're here as a company that's trying to solve problems in the AI world," said Damien Kieran, whose LinkedIn describes him as the company's chief legal and privacy officer. To address this, he said, the IT team was negotiating a new deal with ChatGPT Enterprise — the large language model sold by Altman's OpenAI. Business Insider has reported that there were also discussions around integrating Tools for Humanity's cryptocurrency World project with OpenAI to verify those using its services. OpenAI didn't respond to a request for comment. ChatGPT wasn't the only artificial intelligence tool being employed by Tools for Humanity. Staffers were told that another AI model — which directly competes with Altman's flagship venture — would soon be accessible.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Duduzile Zuma, daughter of former President Jacob Zuma, is at the centre of a growing scandal after different families revealed she helped send young Southern African men to Russia, where they were later deployed to the war in Ukraine. The allegations have raised concerns within South Africa's government, which recently launched a formal investigation into the recruitment of its citizens for foreign military service. According to relatives of the recruits, approximately 20 men were approached by Duduzile Zuma and told they would participate in a bodyguard training programme for Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MKP). Photographs reviewed by Bloomberg show the group in Russia, first traveling together and later wearing camouflage alongside instructors. WhatsApp messages between Duduzile Zuma and some parents indicate that the recruits were assured they would not be sent into combat. In one exchange, a recruit wrote: “As we speak now, we are packing and preparing to move to the war zone,” with Duduzile Zuma replying: “It's not the frontline. They are just scaring you… you may just patrol or be put on cooking duties or gun cleaning,” adding she would retrieve them “personally” if required. Although South African law has prohibited citizens from serving as mercenaries or fighting for foreign governments since 1998, reports of its citizens being recruited to join Russia's war effort have risen sharply this year. Economic hardship and high unemployment have made young people across the continent increasingly vulnerable to offers of “training” or well-paid security jobs abroad. Similar recruitment cases have emerged in Kenya, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Nigeria and several other countries. Prior to these disclosure, Business Insider Africa reported that the South African government had received distress calls from 17 citizens trapped in Ukraine after joining Russian forces. In response, President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered a formal investigation. Officials have confirmed that diplomatic efforts are ongoing to secure the safe return of those involved. At the same time, relatives and available evidence suggest that Duduzile Zuma has previously shared pro-Russian content on social media, including images from Russia and posts critical of President Cyril Ramaphosa. She is also currently facing trial for allegedly inciting violence on social media during the 2021 unrest. South African news outlets report that Jacob Zuma wrote to Russia's defence minister requesting the removal of 18 South Africans from the combat zone, citing that they had been misled into signing infantry contracts in Pskov, near Estonia. According to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, at least 1,436 individuals from 36 African countries are currently fighting alongside Russian forces. This figure excludes Africans who were already residing in Russia prior to the war and subsequently volunteered or were recruited to join the conflict.

Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang pushed back against fears of an AI bubble on the company's blowout earnings call on Wednesday. "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Huang said. "From our vantage point, we see something very different." Coming from the world's most valuable company that powers nearly every major AI data center, that vantage point matters. The first stems from the slowdown of Moore's Law — a trend that's seen computer chips double in power roughly every two years. As that progress stalls, companies are shifting from traditional chips to GPUs, which Nvidia specializes in building to power AI systems. Huang also cited the rise of generative AI, which is transforming search and recommendations at companies like Meta. "Nvidia is chosen because our singular architecture enables all three transitions and does so for any form and modality of AI across all industries," Huang said. Before Nvidia's earnings report, concerns about a potential AI bubble were swirling. Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus, wrote that a key concern was that spending by major cloud companies may be "moving into bubble territory" and could prove difficult to sustain. Beyond Huang's remarks, the company's earnings spoke volumes. Nvidia reported record quarterly revenue of $57 billion, up 62% year-over-year. Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor each rose more than 7% in after-hours trading, while AMD climbed over 6% and Oracle gained more than 5%.</p>
