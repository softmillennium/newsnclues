                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JTA — Every day, it can seem, brings a fresh headline about how AI chatbots are spreading hateful ideas. But researchers tasked with understanding antisemitism and how it can be stopped say they have found evidence that AI chatbots can actually fight hate. Researchers affiliated with the Anti-Defamation League's Center for Antisemitism Research trained a large-language model, or LLM, on countering antisemitic conspiracy theories, then invited people who subscribed to at least one of those theories to interact with it. “What's remarkable about these findings is that factual debunking works even for conspiracy theories with deep historical roots and strong connections to identity and prejudice,” David Rand, a Cornell University professor who was the study's senior author, said in a statement. “Our artificial intelligence debunker bot typically doesn't rely on emotional appeals, empathy-building exercises, or anti-bias tactics to correct false beliefs,” Rand continued, referring to practices frequently employed by advocates seeking to fight antisemitism, including at the ADL. “It mostly provides accurate information and evidence-based counterarguments, demonstrating that facts still matter in changing minds.” Matt Williams, who has headed the Center for Antisemitism Research since its founding three years ago, says the study builds on a growing body of research that views contemporary antisemitism as primarily a misinformation problem, rather than a civil rights problem. The study emerges from the ADL's relatively new effort to come up with evidence-based ways to reduce antisemitism, working with dozens of researchers across a slew of institutions to design and carry out experiments aimed at turning a robust advocacy space into less of a guessing game. The new experiment, conducted earlier this year, involved more than 1,200 people who said on a previous ADL survey that they believed at least one of six prominent antisemitic conspiracy theories, such as that Jews control the media or the “Great Replacement” theory about Jewish involvement in immigration. The people then were randomly assigned three different scenarios: A third chatted with an LLM programmed by the researchers to debunk such theories, built within Microsoft's Claude AI model; another third chatted with Claude about an unrelated topic; and the final third were simply told that their belief represented a “dangerous” conspiracy theory. DebunkBot was hardly a panacea for antisemitism: The study found that those who believed in more antisemitic conspiracy theories experienced less change. But he said any strategy that can cut against what researchers believe has been a widespread explosion of belief in conspiracy theories is a good thing. “To me, the increase in that level of saturation is far more concerning than any particular conspiracy theory moving through different generations,” he said. “I don't think that we're going to ever create a world in which we go under 15% — but going from 45 back to 30 or 25 seems more doable.” The new study comes as AI models vault into widespread use among Americans, raising concerns about their implications for Jews. When Elon Musk launched a model of his own earlier this year called Grok, it immediately drew criticism for amplifying antisemitism — kicking off a pattern that has played out repeatedly. Criticism of Grok is still widespread, but it no longer praises Hitler — though even this week it reportedly told one user that the Nazi gas chambers were not designed for mass killing, prompting an investigation by French authorities. Chatbot training is seen as essential for delivering high-quality AI results. DebunkBot can be found online on its own website now, but Williams said efforts were underway within the ADL to convince the companies operating major AI platforms to incorporate its expertise. “There's far more receptivity than not, by any stretch of the imagination,” he said, while noting that the work was early and he could not share many details. Whatever happens with that effort, Williams said, the new research demonstrates that combating what's sometimes called the world's oldest hatred is possible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“She sees them as a pathological liar because the prediction didn't come true,” Nizza said. It's that the source of psychic information is deeply deceptive. “She doesn't realize that psychics get their information from demons,” Nizza warned. Nizza explained that while psychics can seem accurate at times, their so-called “insight” comes from demons who have observed human behavior for centuries and are able to make educated guesses. “The predictions will not always be correct,” she said. Yes, just from the planting of seeds and self-fulfilling counterfeit prophecy. She said these demonic influences often pretend to be deceased loved ones — in Kardashian's case, her late father Robert Kardashian — in order to create an emotional connection and deepen the deception. While Kardashian may feel justified in calling psychics frauds, Nizza believes the greater danger is that millions are still turning to them without understanding the spiritual trap. “You and I can make predictions… but we're not God,” Nizza said. The former medium warned that people who chase psychic readings often end up drifting further from Christ. In their pursuit of answers, she said, they are “kept away from the only way, truth and life, and his name is Jesus Christ.” Instead of finding peace, they begin “walking in the false light,” layering one New Age practice on top of another until they find themselves spiritually oppressed — or worse. Nizza emphasized that spiritual chaos doesn't just affect someone's faith. She hopes Kardashian — and others drawn to psychics — will turn instead to the God who knows the future and offers true guidance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Check for daily updates on your sun sign I'm always looking for ways to weave my favorite spirituality practices into everyday life. I've tested (more than) my fair share over the years: astrology chart deep dives, human design readings, akashic records, and dozens of psychic sessions with tarot readers, mediums, and intuitives—but I'm also very particular with my time and energy, and I'm not about to waste hours on practices or tools that don't offer a true takeaway. On a quest to find the most beneficial daily practices, I've been dipping my toe into the waters of spirituality apps. Most recently, I tested Nebula, one of the top spiritual platforms with both astrology and psychic insights. So, how did Nebula astrology and Nebula psychic readings compare to those that I've had in the past? Keep reading for my full Nebula review after testing the platform for a couple of weeks, including my final verdict on whether Nebula is legit. Nebula is an all-in-one spiritual guidance platform with a strong focus on astrology insights and psychic readings. It's transaction and subscription-based, with various payment options available. Once you set up your account and answer a few brief intake questions, you'll find daily horoscopes, birth chart analyses, compatibility tools, tarot, numerology, and more. The majority of the Nebula app and desktop site feel like a choose-your-own-adventure, allowing you to dive deep into many aspects of your astrological birth chart on your own. But for those who prefer more one-to-one guidance, there's also an option to chat directly with a psychic. Nebula has more than 1,000 spiritual advisors on the platform, and each one has their own experience level and area of focus. Both offer free basic features, but a subscription unlocks the full experience. While all horoscopes, astrology, and compatibility features are included in your subscription to the Nebula platform, you'll have to pay more for the one-on-one psychic readings. Your first three minutes are free, and then the cost per minute varies depending on which psychic you choose. In my experience, the average cost per minute was $3.99 for speaking with a psychic with anywhere from two to 20+ years of experience. When you first sign up for the Nebula, you'll be prompted to enter your birth details (date, time, and location) to generate a personalized astrology chart. There are also a few brief questions about what you are looking for guidance on (love, career, work, etc. From there, you can navigate between five categories: Horoscopes, Psychics, Compatibility, Chatroom, and Readings. At the top of the screen, you'll see a brief overview of your astrology signs (sun, moon, and rising—in my case: Taurus, Scorpio, Capricorn) along with a link to click to view your full birth chart (more on that in a minute! In your daily horoscope, there's a fun breakdown of your “energy levels” in key life areas (career, love life, health, and family) for that day. The yearly horoscope outlines five key themes to guide your 2025, along with a deeper dive into what to expect for the full year and a look at your month by month insights and predictions. There is a lot of information here and it's all personalized based on your actual birth chart, not just your sun sign (like a lot of astrology platforms). If you do click into your birth chart, you'll go even deeper into personalized insights and easy-to-comprehend explainers on your chart placements, what they mean, and how to use them to (for lack of a better term) live your best life. You'll see all your available options of who is currently online, broken down into sections based on who is the best match for your profile, who is the most accurate, and who is the best in certain areas (love, career, etc. The Compatibility tab is also exactly what it sounds like: a tool to determine your astrological compatibility with someone. Once you've entered that information, you'll get an overview of how compatible you are in a few key areas: love, sex, family, and friendship, along with your overall compatibility. Lastly, the Readings tab is filled with various blogs and resources such as guided meditations and manifestation tips. As much as I love all things intuition and spirituality, horoscopes are the one thing that just always felt too gimmicky for me. I have never been able to get on board with the idea that everyone who was born within 30 days of each other (in any year!) Every horoscope and astrology insight the app provides is based on your entire birth chart. I really did notice a difference in how relevant my daily horoscopes were when compared to the average astrology app that just looks at your sun sign. Of course, there are many ways to pull your chart for free online—but Nebula sets itself apart by pulling out digestible insights for all aspects of your chart. I really enjoyed building this morning routine that didn't take too much time but gave me such a great mindset (and a lot of helpful insights) entering into the day. This tool was more of a fun activity than anything else, but a few of the insights were very spot on. Nebula psychics are available either via chatroom or with audio chat. While I love face-to-face readings or a phone call, I definitely have friends who prefer a chatroom. The chatroom is nice because if you just have one or two brief questions, you can be in and out in a few minutes. Otherwise, you can chat long with your Nebula psychic to get more info. I also really appreciated the vast array of options and how quickly each person responded. Plus, there were always a few hundred other options to choose from! The one-stop-shop nature of the Nebula platform makes it a great option for just about anyone who is interested in spirituality and astrology. It's a fun and insightful tool for astrology enthusiasts who are looking for more than just a generic daily horoscope. Nebula is also a great option for beginners who are curious about tarot, astrology, numerology, and psychic readings and don't know where to begin. In particular, if you prefer chat-based communication, Nebula psychic readings are definitely worth checking out. I love the daily horoscopes and the detailed astrology insights it provides, with guidance that genuinely feels aligned. If you're looking for an all-in-one spirituality app that's easy to use and can improve your daily life, I recommend giving this one a try. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using South Africa's MeerKAT radio telescope, researchers captured faint absorption lines shortly after the object reappeared from behind the Sun, sparking excitement online about a potential artificial signal. But detailed analysis has now confirmed these frequencies match standard cometary chemistry, not alien communication. The findings quieten weeks of speculation fuelled by unusual behaviour, shifting brightness and bold theories from high-profile commentators, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The new results centre on two faint absorption lines at 1,665 MHz and 1,667 MHz, recorded on 24 October, shortly after 3I/ATLAS completed its perihelion. According to the International Business Times UK, these frequencies correspond to hydroxyl (OH) radicals created when sunlight breaks down water molecules in a comet's coma. Coverage in LiveScience adds that the measured frequencies are textbook examples of comet outgassing, not transmission patterns from engineered technology. The Indian Express likewise reports that, while speculation swirled online, observational evidence points decisively to a natural origin. As IBTimes UK previously noted, the alignment between the detected lines and known OH absorption behaviour leaves virtually no scientific room for an artificial explanation. The detection was publicised through an astronomer telegram, prompting curiosity because the object had already shown erratic brightness and unusual polarisation. Signal', reviving theories aired by Loeb that 3I/ATLAS might be a probe or beacon, as Newsweek reported. Wired explains why the pattern confused some observers: MeerKAT didn't detect a signal being sent. Beyond radio data, multiple instruments have strengthened the case that 3I/ATLAS is simply an unusual interstellar comet. Ultraviolet observations from NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected OH emissions, a classic signature of water activity. Meanwhile, spectroscopy from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed that the coma is extraordinarily enriched in CO₂—among the highest concentrations ever seen in a comet—alongside carbon monoxide, water and dust, according to an arXiv preprint. Polarimetric studies add a twist: the object displays 'extreme negative polarisation', an unusual trait that may indicate a distinct class of interstellar comet. But even this quirk points to exotic dust properties rather than alien engineering. Researchers cited by Primetimer note that no evidence points to propulsion, metallic structure or engineered behaviour. Although MeerKAT's findings are robust, scientists say continued monitoring is warranted. As Wired highlights, Loeb has suggested that NASA's Juno spacecraft may detect low-frequency interactions when 3I/ATLAS passes closer to Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

    Durham Law School's Professor Michael Bohlander contributes to blog published by the Global Policy Journal entitled “Don't look up?“ – Why it is past time for serious holistic research into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena.
  

The highly respected Global Policy Journal has published a blog entitled “Don't look up?“ – Why it is past time for serious holistic research into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, written by Karin Austin (Director of the Center for the Impossible, Rice University, and of the John Mack Institute), Michael Bohlander (Chair in Global Law and SETI Policy at Durham University) and Kimberly S. Engels (Associate Professor of Philosophy at Molloy University and Research Director of the John Mack Institute).

They argue that UAP research needs to be taken more seriously, domestically and on the international level, and should encompass all aspects of the phenomenon, not just the technological side. The enormity of the implications for humanity if some of the UAP are indeed of non-human origin is nothing short of existential. 

It is important and encouraging that serious and rigorous major mainstream academic journals are beginning to include the topic in their wider discussion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This might have something to do with the fact that I'm a sucker for a period piece. Or maybe it's because of the genre's super distinctive aesthetic. Maybe it's because I'm a horse girl at heart. Whatever the reason, I can't get enough. But despite my affection for the frontier, I admit that Westerns tend to follow a pretty standard storyline. So when a Western has some supernatural elements, it stands out immediately to me as a horror fan as well. That movie is Pale Rider, which is streaming for free on Tubi (alongside some other Western-horror gems). Directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, the film was released during a transitional moment for the Western genre due to the failure of Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate. He's simply known as the Preacher (Clint Eastwood). I first discovered Pale Rider on Reddit after I saw a post claiming that it's “a lowkey supernatural slasher.” I hate admitting it, but they were right: The ambiguity is what makes this such an interesting watch. When the Preacher starts dispatching the town's tormentors with brutal, almost slasher-like efficiency in the film's climax, it becomes clear that this town is dealing with something beyond their comprehension. In one of my favorite scenes, the Preacher is sitting in a restaurant, calmly drinking coffee with his back to the gang; he suddenly vanishes only to reappear beside the armed men who didn't see or hear him approach. It's such classic slasher staging, which makes me wonder if Eastwood is a secret horror fan. Pale Rider leaves every possibility open, which makes it fun to discuss with friends afterwards. If you're in the mood for something that feels both familiar and unsettling all at once, then Pale Rider is the perfect pick.
