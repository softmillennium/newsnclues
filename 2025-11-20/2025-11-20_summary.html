As the veteran actor turns 100 he reveals that he was approached to play the British spy in the 60s, but realised his accent wouldn't have been up to scratch

For more than six decades, the actor Dick Van Dyke has been pilloried for his attempts at a British accent in Mary Poppins (1964). Now, the actor who has since apologised for the “most atrocious cockney accent in the history of cinema” as chimney sweep Bert in the Disney classic has revealed he was in the running to play another UK icon on screen: James Bond.

Speaking on the Today TV programme in the US, Van Dyke, who turns 100 next month, said that Bond producer Albert Broccoli approached him after his performance in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in 1968 to ask if he fancied being a successor to Sean Connery.

“Would you like to be Bond?” Van Dyke recalls Broccoli saying, to which he replied: “Have you heard my British accent?”

In press since, Van Dyke has credited his notoriously inaccurate attempt in Mary Poppins to an Irish dialect coach, while also suggesting that cast and crew, including Julie Andrews, should have flagged with him any shortcomings.

Van Dyke continued by saying that he is still actively seeking acting work, saying: “I don't want to [retire], I mean, it's my life. I love it.”

The star, who won three Emmys for The Dick Van Dyke Show, as well as a Tony award for Bye Bye Birdie, is promoting a new book, 100 Rules for Living to 100: An Optimist's Guide to a Happy Life.

The star is a famously garrulous chatshow guest. In 2010, then 84, he recalled how he was rescued from drowning by porpoises who pushed his surfboard back to shore after he nodded off on the waves.

Three years later, he was rescued from a burning car on the California freeway, and in 2023 came another close call, when he lost control of his Lexus in rainy weather and crashed into a gate.

The actor who will become the next cinema Bond is still to be announced, after Daniel Craig's departure and rights to the franchise being handed over to Amazon.

Although Scottish, Irish and Australian stars have taken on the role, no American since Van Dyke is thought to have been in contention. Should he again fail to secure the role, Callum Turner, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Theo James are believed to be the frontrunners.

 This article was amended on 20 November 2025. An earlier version said Dick Van Dyke was approached to play James Bond in the franchise's first film; in fact, Van Dyke was asked about replacing Sean Connery in the role. Also, Julie Andrews was incorrectly described as being “London-born”. This has been removed.

In announcing his signature of the bill, Trump omitted his own connections to the alleged child sex trafficker.

On Wednesday night, the White House announced that President Donald Trump had signed the bill passed by Congress earlier this week to release the files on the federal investigation into alleged child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. 

Shortly after, Trump himself shared the news on Truth Social. Trump's message was rife with misleading statements, likely meant to divert attention from his former longtime relationship with Epstein.

Trump, for example, called the disgraced New York financier a lifelong Democrat who “donated Thousands of Dollars to Democrat Politicians” — a statement that is true. But Trump made no mention of his own personal friendship with Epstein, which lasted from the 1980s through the early 2000s.

Trump also downplayed his attempt to obstruct the release of files.

“As everyone knows, I asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, to pass this Bill in the House and Senate, respectively,” Trump wrote.

However, Trump only made that decision after months of describing calls for the files to be released a “hoax” against him, changing his mind only when it became evident that the legislation had enough bipartisan votes for passage.

Indeed, in his evening missive, Trump continued to describe the entire ordeal as a “hoax,” disregarding Epstein's victims, who have been demanding the release of the files for years. 

Trump's name reportedly appears within the Epstein files, but to what extent remains unclear. During the 2024 presidential race, Trump had campaigned on releasing the files, capitalizing on conspiracy theories popular amongst his base. Upon taking office, however, the president's position on the matter changed dramatically. In July, after his Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that there would be no further investigation into Epstein — and that the files would remain private — Trump vehemently rejected calls for their release, taking on a deeply adversarial tone toward those who disagreed with him. 

The law stipulates that most of the Epstein files must be released to the public, in a searchable database created by the Justice Department, within the next 30 days (around December 18). However, some critics are concerned that Trump could still limit what will be available, as he has many options to restrict files.

Trump could, for example, limit the release of files that relate to ongoing federal investigations. Indeed, Trump ordered Bondi to open new inquiries into several of his political adversaries just days before he announced support for the bill. Trump could also issue an executive order deeming certain documents' release as dangerous for national security or foreign policy reasons.

“It would be naive of any of us to think that Trump has really had a conversion,” Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vermont) said. “He does not want the information out.”

DNC chair Ken Martin similarly expressed skepticism over Trump's sudden change of heart, stating:

We can see where this is headed: He's already threatening to play games with the files that are released and those that are withheld. Here's our call: Protect survivors, withhold nothing. Trump's Department of Justice must release ALL of the Epstein Files immediately.

Polling shows widespread support for the release of the Epstein documents, though there is still some skepticism regarding Trump's role in the matter. According to an Economist/YouGov survey published this week, four in five voters (80 percent) said they backed the release of the files, with only 7 percent opposed. 

Meanwhile, a plurality of respondents — nearly half, at 49 percent — believe Trump is trying to cover up Epstein's crimes.

BRUSSELS, November 20. /TASS/. Rome supports the use of frozen Russian assets of Ukraine and a reliable legal base is needed for that, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Italy Antonio Tajani told reporters.

"It is important to find a solution to use the frozen Russian assets. There is a need to find a legal basis that will make it possible to do this. Therefore, it is exclusive a legal matter and not a political one," Tajani said.

The stability of the Eurozone should be guaranteed and all the decisions must be analyzed together with the European Central Bank, he added.

            Israel's forced removal of tens of thousands of Palestinians from refugee camps in the occupied West Bank earlier this year amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has alleged.
    


            According to a 105-page report released by the non-profit organization, 32,000 Palestinians were expelled by Israeli forces from three camps in January and February, while international attention was focused on Israel's war in Gaza, and they have not been allowed to return.
    


            As part of its research, HRW said it interviewed 31 displaced Palestinian refugees from Jenin, Tulkarem and Nur Shams refugee camps. The organization also analyzed satellite imagery and Israeli military demolition orders, as well as verified video and images of Israeli military operations.
    


            In response to the report, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN in a statement that the military launched what it called Operation “Iron Wall” in the three camps ten months ago “in light of the security threats posed by these camps and the growing presence of terrorist elements within them.”
    


            The IDF said it destroyed “rows of buildings” to create “new access routes inside the camps.” The military said the decision to demolish the buildings “was made based on operational necessity, with careful consideration and only after alternative options to achieve the same military advantage were examined.”
    


            The IDF said the “demolitions were conducted lawfully, based on military necessity and with the required proportionality” and that “terrorism in Judea and Samaria has decreased by 70%” since the start of the operation, using the biblical term for the West Bank.
    


            The HRW report claims that Israel stormed Jenin refugee camp on January 21, with Apache helicopters, drones, bulldozers, and armored vehicles carrying ground forces, to oust the Palestinians living there.
    


            Similar operations were carried out at Tulkaram on January 27, and Nur Shams on February 9.
    


            Israeli soldiers “were yelling and throwing things everywhere…. It was like a movie scene – some had masks and they were carrying all kinds of weapons,” one 54-year-old woman told HRW.
    


            The displaced Palestinians have not been permitted to return home, the report found, adding that Israeli soldiers fired upon those who did attempt to re-enter. Only a few have been allowed to collect their belongings, it said, while HRW analysis of satellite imagery six months on found that more than 850 homes and other buildings had been damaged or destroyed across the camps.
    


            No shelter or humanitarian assistance was offered to displaced residents by the Israeli military, the report found. Instead, people were left to fend for themselves, seeking shelter wherever they could, including crowding into the homes of relatives or friends, or arriving at mosques or local charities.
    


            All three camps date back to the early 1950s, when they were established by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to house Palestinians who were expelled from their homes or forced to flee following Israel's creation in 1948. Those refugees and their descendants had resided there ever since.
    


            “Israeli authorities in early 2025 forcibly removed 32,000 Palestinians from their homes in West Bank refugee camps without regard to international legal protections and have not permitted them to return,” Nadia Hardman, a senior migrant rights researcher at HRW, said.
    


            “With global attention focused on Gaza, Israeli forces have carried out war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing in the West Bank that should be investigated and prosecuted.”
    


Dozens of Israeli settlers launch arson attack in West Bank as attacks against Palestinians surge



            Since the Hamas-led attacks of October 7, 2023, the Israeli military has intensified operations across the West Bank, targeting Palestinian militant cells, imposing checkpoints, and cutting communities off from the outside world.
    


            There has also been an escalation in Israeli settler attacks and land grabs in the territory. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law.
    


            HRW is now calling for senior Israeli officials to be investigated over the expulsions, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth, the Central Command commander who oversaw West Bank military operations.
    


            Where found responsible, they should be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity, the organization said.

Ukrainian president's office issues statement after other officials condemn ‘absurd' plan to end conflict

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has said he will negotiate with Donald Trump on a US-backed peace plan that called on Kyiv to make painful concessions in order to end the Kremlin's invasion of his country.

Zelenskyy's office on Thursday confirmed that he had received the draft peace plan, which was prepared by US and Russian officials, and that he would speak with Trump in the coming days about “existing diplomatic opportunities and the main points that are necessary for peace”.

“We agreed to work on the points of the plan so that it would bring a worthy end to the war,” Zelenskyy's office said in a statement.

The cautious response from Ukraine's presidential administration followed angry denouncements of the plan by some Ukrainian officials who called it “absurd” and unacceptable. Zelenskyy's public statement came as he held talks on Thursday with a high-ranking US army delegation.

Other officials in Kyiv said the proposal reportedly drafted by Kirill Dmitriev, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, and Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff was a “provocation”, the aim of which was to stir up division and “disorientate” Ukraine's allies, they added.

“There are currently no signs that the Kremlin is ready for serious negotiations. Putin is trying to stall for time and avoid US sanctions,” said Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of Ukraine's foreign policy parliamentary committee. He dismissed Dmitriev as a “nobody”.

Ukraine's first deputy foreign minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, called the initiative unrealistic. He suggested it was a classic Soviet-style information operation to influence opinion and sow panic.

According to media reports, the sweeping 28-point proposal closely resembles demands made by Moscow soon after its full-scale invasion in early 2022. It was reportedly drawn up by Russian and US officials, with support from Donald Trump. Kyiv was not consulted. One European diplomat said they only learned of the plan when they turned on the news.

It envisages Ukraine giving up the northern part of the Donbas region, which it controls, to Russia, and cutting the size of its army in half. Ukraine would also be forced to relinquish its long-range weapons, used to strike military targets inside Russia.

No foreign troops would be allowed on Ukrainian soil, a condition that rules out a post-deal peacekeeping force led by the UK and France. But the US would provide unspecified security guarantees, according to Axios.

The Russian language and Russian Orthodox church would be given formal status under longstanding Kremlin demands.

Ukrainian officials said the document amounted to Ukraine's capitulation and an effective end to its sovereignty. It comes nearly four years after Russian troops tried, and failed, to seize Kyiv, and as efforts by the Trump administration to end the conflict remain stalled.

On Thursday, Zelenskyy met the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, whom Trump named last week as a “special representative”. Driscoll is on a fact-finding mission to Kyiv, with a brief to examine the war and Ukrainian drone production. It is unclear if the talks included the US's draft plan.

Keith Kellogg, Trump's special representative to Ukraine, has reportedly announced his resignation, saying he would leave in January after a year in the post. Kellogg is regarded as being broadly sympathetic to Ukraine and has been consequently left out of direct US-Russian talks.

The White House's renewed push to force Ukraine to make significant concessions in pursuit of “peace” comes at a difficult time for Zelenskyy, who is embroiled in the biggest political scandal since he became president in 2019.

His former business partner Timur Mindich and at least two government ministers are accused of involvement in a large-scale bribery scheme. Several deputies from Zelenskyy's own Servant of the People party have called on the president to dismiss Andriy Yermak, his powerful chief of staff.

One western diplomat said the Russians were seeking to take advantage of Ukraine's domestic crisis. “It seems Dmitriev has spun this plan at a time when Zelenskyy is weak. The Russians are good at exploiting things,” they said. “It feels like every other Russian plan. I don't think it's going to fly with Ukraine.”

The diplomat said the Kremlin's demands concerning the Russian language were a “hook” it could later exploit. The proposal did not offer the kind of security assurances Ukraine would need from the US and its European allies for any deal to stick, they added.

European leaders meeting in Brussels said they had not been warned in advance about the latest White House initiative. The Trump administration no longer provided direct military aid to Kyiv, a fact that reduced its ability to impose a Moscow-friendly peace settlement on Ukraine, one source noted.

“We commend peace efforts, but Europe is the main supporter of Ukraine and it's, of course, Europe's security that's at stake. So we expect to be consulted,” said Poland's foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski.

The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said Europe welcomed any efforts to achieve a long-lasting and just settlement of the war, but stressed: “For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.”

Kallas said the Dmitriev-Witkoff proposal did not envisage Russia making any concessions. “We have to understand that in this war, there is one aggressor and one victim. If Russia really wanted peace, it could have agreed to an unconditional ceasefire already some time ago.”

The British government said it backed Trump's desire to “bring this barbaric war to an end”. But it emphasised that “only the Ukrainian people can determine their future” and said Russia could end the fighting tomorrow by pulling out troops and ending its “illegal invasion”.

The White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, declined to comment on the peace plan. “I would agree that that's an issue which the president has continued to put at the forefront of our foreign policy goal, which is to reach a settlement in the Ukraine-Russia war, so that we can have peace in Europe and we can end the killing and the slaughter of so many innocents,” he said.

US efforts to broker peace have hit roadblocks since Trump met Putin in Alaska in August. The US president subsequently imposed sanctions on Russia's oil industry, in an apparent attempt to push Putin to the negotiating table.

Trump said last month that he was putting on hold his plan for a meeting with the Russian president in Budapest because he didn't want it to be a “waste of time”. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, met in Ankara, saying they were committed to finding a peaceful settlement.

In recent months Russia has increased its systematic attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, plunging much of the country into darkness. On Wednesday it bombed several western cities, including Ternopil, where 26 people, including three children, were killed in their homes.

Shrapnel from a tank shell lodged near a nerve in my hand in 2024. It remains there, a reminder of what I have endured.

The Gaza Strip is facing an ever-deepening crisis in medical care and rehabilitation.

In September 2024, the World Health Organization estimated that nearly a quarter of the injured — more than 22,000 people — had sustained wounds that resulted in the loss of limbs or permanent disabilities. By September 2025, that number had almost doubled: More than 41,800 people in Gaza now require long-term rehabilitation due to injuries. 

With restrictions on the entry of medical equipment, prosthetic limbs and mobility aids such as wheelchairs and crutches have become nearly inaccessible.

As a result, thousands of wounded people — including children, women, and the elderly — face an uncertain future, deprived of any real chance of treatment or recovery.

Behind these horrifying statistics are real faces, real names, and real stories.

These are beloved people who have lost parts of their bodies — not just numbers in UN reports.

During a visit to Shuhada Al-Aqsa Hospital to check on my friend after her home was struck by an Israeli missile, I met Nour, whose hands were injured, and her little sister Alaa, a 5-year-old girl whose arm and leg were amputated.

Walking through the hospital corridors, the smell of medicine and the sound of pain took me back to June 8, 2024, the day I was wounded by a tank shell.

That day, shrapnel hit my hand, back, and face. One fragment lodged near a nerve in my hand, where it still remains, a constant reminder of what so many of us have endured.

Alaa and I shared the same pain — the pain of the body and the pain of loss.

When I first saw her, she was crying softly, whispering through her tears: “I wish I could eat with my right hand again … play and color with my friends.”

Her simple words captured the tragedy of an entire generation deprived of its most basic right — to live a normal childhood.

Whenever Alaa needed to go to the bathroom or undergo medical tests, her sisters had to carry her in their arms.

There were no wheelchairs or crutches in the hospital.

Her suffering wasn't only physical. It was also the crushing feeling of helplessness and total dependence on others at a time when she should have been receiving care and emotional support.

In times of war, caring for a wounded child who cannot even relieve themselves without help becomes an unbearable burden, even for those who love them deeply.

Not because they don't want to help, but because they themselves are struggling to survive.

As the siege continues and medical supplies remain restricted, Israel compounds the pain of the wounded, adding psychological torment to physical suffering and leaving children and women to face their pain with no tools to ease it, no devices to help them move.

Recently, reports spread about a young woman from Gaza named Nibal Al-Hissi, who pleaded through media and social networks for a medical referral that would allow her to travel abroad to receive prosthetic limbs.

I couldn't wait. I reached out to her myself, hoping her voice could be heard by the world.

She spoke to me through tears, her voice heavy with grief and longing for a life she had lost — “I had so many dreams and ambitions…”

Al-Hissi, 25 years old, lived in northern Gaza with her 2-year-old daughter, Rita.

During one Israeli airstrike, their home was bombed while she was holding Rita in her arms, trying to shield her from the blast.

The child miraculously survived, but her mother lost both of her arms.

Since that day, Al-Hissi has been unable to hold or feed her daughter, yet she continues to fight every day through pain, isolation, and a fragile hope of getting treatment.

Now, she depends entirely on her family for everything — eating, drinking, moving, and even basic personal care.

Al-Hissi told me she longs for the moments when her daughter, little Rita, would ask her for something simple, but what hurts her most is that she can no longer meet any of her child's needs.

Her pain deepened when her husband left her after the incident, believing she could no longer care for their child or their home.

Al-Hissi says that everything in her life has become difficult, from the unhealed wounds to the loneliness that her disability has imposed, to the postponed dream of receiving prosthetic limbs that would restore even a small part of her independence.

To the tragedy of Gaza's wounded, another layer of suffering is added: the near-impossible task of securing medical referrals and traveling for treatment outside the Strip.

Despite the growing number of those needing complex surgeries or prosthetics, medical referrals remain scarce and heavily bureaucratic, often taking months for approval if they ever arrive at all.

The Rafah crossing, the only real gateway for patients, opens and closes unpredictably due to political and security conditions, leaving thousands of wounded people trapped in endless waiting.

Behind every referral request lies a human story suspended between hope and despair. Patients wait for a phone call or a travel permit that could mean life itself, as their days fade away in pain and immobility inside hospitals lacking even the most basic resources.

War does not only kill. It steals. It steals land, homes, and loved ones. It steals limbs. It steals souls.

Pain does not end with survival; it begins when you are left to live with what's missing, with what's broken, with a body that will never be the same again.

And if death sometimes seems easier than losing a part of yourself, then choosing to live afterward, despite it all, is the purest form of resistance.

MOSCOW, November 20. /TASS/. The International Practical Science Forum "Without a Statute of Limitations: Nuremberg, 80 Years On" has become a platform for shaping a unified stance against Nazism in today's day and age and demonstrated that the legacy of Nuremberg remains a relevant principle of the global order, TASS Director General Andrey Kondrashov said at the forum's opening.

"Today marks another step along the long road of the No Statute of Limitations project. It is a path of truth, memory, and justice that began in Nuremberg 80 years ago and continues today, in our time. This forum has become a venue for interdepartmental dialogue and for developing a unified position rejecting Nazism - both in historical retrospect and in the present day," he said.

Kondrashov, who moderated the opening session, expressed deep gratitude to Yelena Malysheva, head of the National Center for Historical Memory under the Russian president. He praised her for "the path of truth, memory, and justice she is leading us on today," emphasizing that "she is a true activist who will not allow our history to be distorted."

He also underscored the crucial role of media coverage in preserving historical truth. "The entire planet is crisscrossed by the trenches of information warfare. The task of the media is to build strong public immunity to historical revisionism," he noted.

The International Practical Science Forum "Without a Statute of Limitations: Nuremberg, 80 Years On" is timed to the anniversary of the start of the international military tribunal against the main Nazi war criminals. Throughout the event, experts will examine modern challenges and threats to the preservation of historical truth and the memory of the Great Patriotic War and World War II in the context of the Nuremberg trials.

In the year marking the 80th anniversary of the Great Victory and the Year of the Defender of the Fatherland, the forum serves as a natural continuation of broad efforts to preserve the historical memory of the genocide committed against the Soviet people by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Great Patriotic War.

TASS is the forum's information partner.

Cyril Ramaphosa says US has had ‘change of mind' but does not confirm Trump's attendance in Johannesburg

The US has changed its mind about attending the G20 summit in Johannesburg, South Africa's president has said, without confirming whether Donald Trump, who had said the US would boycott the event, now wanted to come.

Trump has claimed that South Africa racially discriminates against the minority white Afrikaner community, which led the country during the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.

Earlier this month, the US president alleged there were “abuses” of white farmers, including violence and land confiscation, and said it was a “disgrace” that South Africa was hosting the G20. South Africa's government has vehemently denied the accusations and pressed ahead with its plans to host the first G20 summit in Africa. The two-day summit opens in Johannesburg on Saturday.

At a press conference with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen and the European Council's president, António Costa, Cyril Ramaphosa said: “We have received notice from the United States, a notice which we are still in discussions with them over about a change of mind, about participating in one shape, form or other in the summit.

“This comes at the late hour before the summit begins and so therefore we do need to … see how practical it is and what it finally really means. In a way we see this as a positive sign, very positive, because as I've often said, boycott politics never work.”

Earlier on Thursday, Chrispin Phiri, a spokesperson for South Africa's foreign ministry, had accused the US of trying to coerce the country, after media reported that a US diplomatic note sent to South Africa said no final statement by G20 leaders could be issued without its presence.

“Washington's absence negates its role over the G20's conclusions,” Phiri said. “But we cannot allow coercion by absentia to become a viable tactic; it is a recipe for institutional paralysis and the breakdown of collective action.”

The note from the US embassy in Pretoria, sent last weekend, said the US would accept only a “chair's statement” rather than a leaders' declaration, according to AFP.

The note read: “South Africa's G20 priorities run counter to US policy views, and we cannot support consensus on any documents negotiated under your presidency. The US opposes issuance of any G20 summit outcome document under the premise of a consensus G20 position without US agreement.”

South Africa's priorities for its G20 presidency include improving debt sustainability for low-income countries and more finance for a “just energy transition” away from fossil fuels. It has invited an additional 22 countries to the summit and tried to present itself as a mature champion of multilateralism, the global south and Africa.

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said in February that South Africa's G20 themes of “solidarity, equality, & sustainability” amounted to “anti-Americanism”.

The US, which is taking over the presidency of the G20 next year, has also criticised the forum's expansion from its initial focus on global financial and economic issues when it was founded in 1999.

The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said at an Oval Office event: “We have whittled down the G20 back to basics … the G20 had become basically the G100 this past year. So it will be a concentrated group in Miami, seeing the best America has to offer, with American leadership.”

In a separate event on Thursday, Ramaphosa responded: “My retort is, no, we didn't convene the G100; we have convened the G million, if you like, the G20 million.

“Because if we are to create a world that is prosperous, a world that is caring, a world that is more equal, a world that is underpinned by solidarity, we do believe that it is important to involve the people who are going to be affected by the decisions that the leaders' summit are going to take.”

Ramaphosa also told reporters last week that he didn't want to hand the G20 presidency over to an “empty chair”.

“But the empty chair will be there, probably symbolically hand over to that empty chair and talk to President Trump and say, ‘Even though you are not here, I am now handing over to you the reins of chairing or being president of the G20.' Because the G20 as an entity continues, whether they are here or not.”

The G20, which includes 19 of the world's largest economies and the European Union, traditionally issues a communique at the end of the leaders' summit every year. Last year, Ukraine and its western allies criticised the final statement for not mentioning that Russia had invaded Ukraine.

A.S. Hamrah is a writer and resident film critic for the New York-based n+1 literary magazine.Supplied

It is deceptively easy to label A.S. Hamrah a doomsayer. 

Flipping through Last Week in End Times Cinema, one of the two new books coming out this season from the acclaimed writer and resident film critic for the New York-based n+1 literary magazine, you get the sense that Hamrah is acutely attuned to the very worst instincts of modern Hollywood. Written in diary fashion, Last Week collects one example after another of the contemporary film industry's self-imposed injuries, from its disastrous love affair with AI to the ongoing hubris of Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav (whose cocky, sunglasses-clad mug adorns the book's cover). 

Yet speaking with Hamrah the other week as he promotes both Last Week and Algorithm of the Night, his deeply satisfying and frequently hilarious collection of n+1 writing from 2019 to 2025, it becomes clear that the critic isn't a cynical fatalist so much as a till-death-do-we-part champion of movie-going, a true cinephile whose unerring and cutting criticism makes the cultural world feel less empty and doomed than it may appear. 

Ahead of the publication of both Last Week in End Times Cinema and Algorithm of the Night, The Globe and Mail spoke with Hamrah about the state of the seventh art.

Supplied

Both of these books strike me as some of the most depressing things I've ever read, but in an invigorating and almost existentially hopeful way. This is all stuff I've been feeling in the air, but collected into two concise collections of writing. The diary-like form of Last Week had a particularly cumulative effect on me. 

It started in March of 2024, when I was reading the news and there were four ridiculous things that caught my eye. So I posted them on my Instagram stories, just examples of the stupidity of what's going on in the film industry right now, and my followers seemed to like it. That turned into a newsletter, and before you know it I had 1,000 subscribers, and now a book. It can get a little depressing, especially when we get to the L.A. wildfires, the death of David Lynch. 

Books we're reading and loving in November

And you're always careful to check in with Warner's David Zaslav about whatever ridiculous thing he's up to. 

And Bob Iger at Disney, Tony Vinciquerra at Sony, all the studio heads say absolutely absurd things and spin half-truths and obfuscations about their bad products. 

It's an interesting time to be talking about Zaslav, especially as we're in the midst of Warner Bros. being either swallowed up by another studio, maybe disappearing altogether into Netflix's catalogue. How close to the bone are you cutting by using “End Times” in the title? 

There's something particularly depressing about the potential Warner Bros. sale. When Disney bought Fox a while ago, for some reason that didn't register as very depressing, though it was. But with Zaslav you get the sense that he's this kind of villainous character, who maybe his plan all along was to lead to some kind of consolidation that's going to lead to a worse product that costs more money for the moviegoer. All this stuff should be much more regulated than it is. 

When you published your previous book of collected essays in 2018, The Earth Dies Streaming, you described the times as “very bleak,” yet they only feel bleaker now. How do you reconcile that mood with your work as a critic, trying to make sense of the art that is put out into the world at such a tremulous time? 

The landscape that I described back then has gotten worse, yes. But at the same time, because it's gotten worse, the year after my book came out, 2019, now appears as a somewhat golden age for cinema. The pandemic of course was a real opportunity for studios to make a fundamental change in their business regarding streaming, and I feel it was a kind of gleeful moment because they could really envision the end of theatrical exhibition, which they don't like because they can't really control it to the extent that they wish they did. In the first book, I was talking about a world in which streaming was going to take over the world. Now, they've moved on and want to do away with the cinema altogether by turning it into a fully automated assembly line using, at every step in the process, with artificial intelligence, with as few humans involved as possible. But the question was about how do I continue working as a critic, yeah?

Supplied

Well, yes. In the face of such opposing forces and the ever-increasing sense of dread. 

So many people who write about films have turned to writing about older films now, classic Hollywood, avant-garde films. But I think it's the obligation of the critic to write about the films of their time, and I'm very dedicated to doing that. And it doesn't bother me at all that that's the subject matter presented to me. There are very good films made all over the world. And any kind of films made independently will move the cinema forward going into the future. But the health of the film industry in America? It's not an important component of the cinema in general. I feel it's important to document that as a critic.

A new wave of literary satire tackles the sociopolitical issues of our time with sharp wit

And most criticism today doesn't do that, so much. It can be more service-oriented, in a way ... 

It's just responding to films on a case-by-case basis, pretending that there are no problems in the industry. I don't like to do that. I try to do a kind of anti-Rotten Tomatoes style of criticism. ... This extends not only to daily newspapers but to major market magazines. Vanity Fair just got rid of their film critic. There's a giant feeling of, “Who cares?” I'm able to do this because of n+1, because they're the opposite of that kind of thinking. But I also keep my overhead very low. I've made a lot of personal sacrifices. Being an independent critic is important. Being fully a critic is also important. I'm not an academic. I don't have a job at an arts institution, I'm not programming. This is what I do. I'm just a writer. And if you're committed, you have to roll with the punches.

            Ukraine has identified a Russian commander it accuses of “systematic and coordinated war crimes” in Bucha, near Kyiv, where hundreds of civilians were murdered during its brief occupation by Russian troops in 2022.
    


            Yurii Vladimirovich Kim, the commander of a platoon in Russia's 76th Air Assault Division, is accused of ordering his troops to murder civilians between March 7 and April 1 2022, according to an indictment from Ukraine's Prosecutor General.
    


            Bucha, where the Russian retreat revealed the bodies of children and the elderly lying in the streets, has become synonymous with the brutality of Moscow's ongoing war in Ukraine. Hundreds of civilians were found buried in mass graves, others were tortured and executed in basements.
    


            Ukraine accuses Kim, who is not in custody, of criminal responsibility in 17 killings and four instances of ill-treatment by troops under his command in Bucha. Lawyers from Global Rights Compliance, assisting Ukrainian officials in evidence gathering, said the case against Kim is founded on witness testimonies, forensics, crime scene reconstructions, identity parades, maps and open source intelligence.
    


            Kim is also accused of ordering the bodies of victims to be burned to cover up the crimes.
    


            “The case highlights a methodical approach to war crimes committed by Russian forces, indicating that many atrocities in Bucha were part of a highly coordinated criminal plan that implicates Russian leadership,” Global Rights Compliance wrote in a statement.
    


            Ukraine has previously named soldiers and at least one commander it says is guilty of mass murder in Bucha.
    


            “We have moved beyond bringing low-ranking perpetrators to account — now we are uncovering the chain of command decisions through which ordinary orders turned into mass executions of civilians,” Maksym Tsutskiridze, First Deputy Head of the National Police of Ukraine wrote in a statement issued by the lawyers.
    


            The Kremlin has denied its troops killed civilians in Bucha and has accused Ukraine of creating fake images of civilian bodies in the town.
    


            CNN has approached the Russian government for comment.
    


This story has been updated to remove the line saying Kim was the first commander to be issued with a Notice of Suspicion.

Global markets rose in a relief rally after AI chip giant Nvidia released forecast-topping earnings yesterday and as traders assessed delayed U.S. jobs data out this morning.

A U.S Labor Department report showed nonfarm payrolls increased in September by 119,000, compared with an estimate of a 50,000 rise.

Wall Street futures extended their gains on the news: Dow futures were up 0.8 per cent, S&P 500 futures gained 1.41 per cent and Nasdaq futures were 1.88 per cent higher as of 8:40 a.m. ET.

TSX futures also pointed higher.

On Wall Street, markets are watching earnings from Walmart Inc., Intuit Inc. and NetEase Inc.

“It's fair to say that Nvidia's results have completely changed the market mood and pushed out any bubble fears for another day,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said.

Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.87 per cent in morning trading. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.75 per cent, Germany's DAX advanced 1.18 per cent and France's CAC 40 gained 0.92 per cent.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei closed 2.65 per cent higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.02 per cent. 

Oil prices advanced after falling yesterday as a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles offset speculation that a U.S. push to end the Russia-Ukraine war may add barrels to an amply supplied market.

Brent crude futures were up 0.9 per cent to US$64.08 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were 0.9 per cent higher at US$59.95.

NG analysts cautioned in a note that Ukraine was unlikely to back the plan as it could see it favouring Russia, but “signs that the U.S. is still trying to work on a deal eases some concerns over further sanctions against Russia and also how strongly current curbs will be enforced.”

In other commodities, spot gold was steady at US$4,074.09 an ounce. U.S. gold futures for December delivery fell 0.2 per cent to US$4,073.70 an ounce.

The Canadian dollar was little changed against its U.S. counterpart.

The day range on the loonie was 71.06 US cents to 71.22 US cents in early trading. The Canadian dollar was down about 0.41 per cent against the greenback over the past month. 

The U.S. dollar index, which weighs the greenback against a group of currencies, was down 0.04 per cent to 100.19. 

The euro slid 0.07 per cent to US$1.1530. The British pound rose 0.26 per cent to US$1.3093. 

In bonds, the yield on the U.S. 10-year note was last down at 4.135 per cent.

NEW DELHI, November 20. /TASS/. Russia and India are working on the mutual deployment of ground stations for their navigation systems, Russia's GLONASS and India's NavIC, Russian Ambassador to New Delhi Denis Alipov said in an interview with TASS.

"Work is underway on the mutual parity placement of ground stations for collecting measurements of the Russian global navigation satellite system GLONASS and the Indian regional navigation satellite system NavIC," he said.

Cooperation in space research remains one of flagship areas of bilateral cooperation between the two countries, the diplomat said, adding that a close dialogue has been established in three major areas: manned space programs, including the Gaganyaan mission, propulsion engineering, and satellite navigation.

Speaking about other areas of scientific and technical cooperation between Russia and India, the ambassador noted the successful development of cooperation in biomedicine, physics, chemistry, healthcare, and materials science. "We are seeing great interest from our Indian partners in advancing polar research. Quantum technologies occupy a special place in bilateral cooperation, with both countries having significant developments in this area," he said.

"More and more specialized scientific organizations and startups in Russia and India are showing interest in collaborating on artificial intelligence. Experts believe that, as part of expanding such cooperation, it would be appropriate to focus on the joint development of AI algorithms for biometrics," Alipov added.

If you want to use popular digital services, chances are you're also fuelling the AI products that these companies then sell back to you. 

Paying a privacy price for online services isn't new. In 2019, Canada found that Facebook took more of your data than the value it gave back. Today, that data extraction goes further: Instead of information being used to “target” ads, increasingly, it is used to train proprietary AI models by default. 

The open web is being incrementally enclosed behind opaque AI training loops. Now, if you want your website to appear in Google's search results, you have to allow Google's crawler to index it. Historically, that was a pretty fair trade, as indexing brought visibility. But now, Google says that anything indexed for search can also be used to train its generative AI models. Decline the AI crawler, and your site effectively disappears from search. Publishers, authors and creators are being held hostage. 

AI bot recorded doctors' meeting, sent patient info to current and former hospital staff, watchdog says

These are old-school market structure problems. Economically, this behaviour resembles tying – a practice where access to one product is conditional on accepting another. When a dominant platform can tie essential services to compulsory data extraction, it undermines competition and erodes user agency. 

This extractive scenario is increasingly common. Soundcloud updated their terms last year to allow content uploaded on the site to be used as training data for AI. Zoom's terms give the company broad rights to use “service-generated data” – such as usage patterns and behavioural metrics – to train its AI models, even if users decline to share their actual meeting content. 

While Zoom insists it won't use video, audio or chat transcripts without explicit consent, simply using the platform still allows certain data to feed into its algorithmic systems. 

Similarly, Anthropic has recently announced that the consumer version of its AI assistant, Claude, will use chats and coding sessions to train models unless the user opts out. LinkedIn just updated its terms to state that it can use member data in many jurisdictions to train content-generating AI models. While you can opt out, all data collected from the years prior remain in training data sets. Reddit is licensing major deals to allow external use of its content for AI training, capitalizing on the information that Redditors freely contribute. 

Just 2% of Canadian businesses got return on generative AI investments, survey shows

Canadian regulators don't seem alive to these abuses, but other jurisdictions are. In the United States and the European Union, digital businesses have taken legal action against Google, citing its coercive collection of data from websites to generate its AI overviews. 

Chegg, an online education platform, sued Google for using its website content to train its generative AI models. The lawsuit highlights that Google's use of website content beyond indexing is “reciprocal dealing,” a form of tied selling and an unlawful leveraging of Google's monopoly powers. 

In Europe, the Independent Publishers Alliance submitted a complaint to the European Commission that Google is abusing its dominant position in online search by appropriating web content to generate its AI overviews. In Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority has opened a strategic market status investigation into Google search, a move that could compel the company to separate its search business from its AI training operations.

That would be a tectonic shift, re-establishing a line between indexing for visibility and harvesting for model training.

Canada should do the same. Our privacy law already requires that consent be voluntary and appropriate. Our Competition Bureau has the authority to examine when bundling consent for multiple uses becomes anti-competitive or unconscionable. Enforcing that line would send a powerful signal: that Canada is a fair place for AI markets.

Doing so could create a powerful competitive advantage. Cloudflare's chief executive suggested that we imagine Canada as the “Delaware of the internet” – a jurisdiction where data relationships are governed by fairness and transparency. If we required search engines to decouple from AI training, publishers worldwide might route their servers through Canada to avoid the coercive extraction of their content. It would give authors the leverage they currently lack.

The last time Canada tried to challenge Big Tech's extraction logic through the Online News Act, Meta retaliated by blocking news entirely. But that shouldn't stop us from acting again, this time on firmer ground: competition and consent. 

Canada has the opportunity to define the terms of a more open and trustworthy digital economy. There's no better time to reject extractive consent models from American Big Tech companies that use our participation as raw material for their profit.

Donald Trump and JD Vance reportedly not invited to the former vice-president's funeral; Clintons and Obamas notably absent from the event

Donald Trump and JD Vance snubbed for Dick Cheney's funeral

Several US dignitaries, including former presidents Joe Biden and George W Bush, are attending the funeral of Dick Cheney at the National Cathedral in Washington DC today.

The former vice-president died earlier this month at the age of 84. His daughter, former congresswoman Liz Cheney, will speak at today's service. As we noted earlier, Donald Trump and JD Vance were reportedly not invited to the funeral. However, all former living vice-presidents will be in attendance. This includes Mike Pence, who served as Trump's right hand during his first administration.

My colleague, David Smith, will be at the cathedral and providing updates.

In her eulogy, which appeared to carry subtle digs at Donald Trump – who was reportedly not invited to Dick Cheney's funeral, Liz Cheney spoke of her father's devotion to the US, which she called “deep and substantive.”

“He spent his life studying the history of our great republic. He knew you couldn't truly appreciate what it means to live in freedom if you didn't understand the sacrifices of the generations who came before, and he made sure that his children and grandchildren understood this too,” she said.

Cheney, who has previously condemened Trump over his involvement in the January 6 riots across Capitol Hill and has called him a “fascist,” went on to talk about memories from her father as he flew over Washington DC after becoming secretary of defense in 1989.

“He described departing from the Pentagon. ‘As my helicopter lifted off the Pentagon helipad, I could look across the river to the great monuments of Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, to the White House and the Capitol building where all the great decisions that have shaped 200 years of American history were made. And I could look directly out on Arlington national cemetery and remember what a terrible price 1000s of brave Americans have paid so that all of us could enjoy the blessings of liberty,'” Cheney said.

Cheney , a vocal critic of Trump's administrations, served as the Republican vice chair of the House January 6 special committee despite political peril which saw her ostracized from the Republican party. She has also said that Trump's “election fraud claims were false,” adding: “No president can defy the rule of law and act this way in a constitutional republic, period – comments that stand in stark contrast to her eulogy that hailed father's public service towards the US.

Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz Cheney, just delivered her eulogy.

“He wouldn't force his opinion on you or demand you do things his way. He might not share his opinion at all if he didn't ask. In fact, he was known to go long stretches of time without saying a single word,” said Liz Cheney.

“But if you watched closely, if you asked questions, you listened when he did speak, you had the experience of seeing the world opening up in front of you, of looking at things in new ways, of benefiting from his clarity of thought, his ability to crystallize what was important and what wasn't,” she continued.

Liz Cheney went on to say: “Though he was inspired to service by president [John F] Kennedy, Dick Cheney became a Republican, but he knew that bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans. For him, a choice between defense of the Constitution and defense of your political party was no choice at all.”

One of Cheney's seven grandchildren, Elizabeth Perry, just noted that the former vice-president “was tough with a kind heart”.

“Dick Cheney wasn't just my grandpa. He was my best friend, my hero, my role model, and the most influential person in my life,” said Perry, who is the daughter of former congresswoman Liz Cheney.

JD Vance, who is not attending Dick Cheney's funeral today, offered his condolences to the former vice-president's family.

“Obviously there are some political disagreements there, but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving,” Vance said, while speaking at an event hosted by the far-right news outlet, Breitbart.

Bush recalls that Cheney offered to step aside as vice-president in 2004, in case the 43rd president wanted to replace him.

“I thought about it for a while,” Bush said today. “But after four years of seeing how he treated people, how he carried responsibility, how he handled pressure and took the hits, I arrived back at the conclusion that they do not come any better than Dick Cheney.”

Bush noted that “in a profession that attracts talkers” Cheney was “a thinker and a listener”.

Speaking now, former president George W Bush remembers Dick Cheney – who served as his vice-president for his entire administration – as a “a stoical man”.

“As I quickly discovered in 2000, when you choose one Cheney, you get four,” Bush quipped of the close relationship his vice-president had with his wife, Lynne, and their two daughters, Liz and Mary. “His busy and purposeful life was an adventure they experienced together. In a family so close you dread the day when the circle is broken.”

Reiner added that Cheney showed “a genuine fortitude” in the face of “true mortal terror” that he faced while suffering with heart disease for most of his adult life.

We're now hearing from Dr Jonathan Reiner, Dick Cheney's cardiologist.

“I want to acknowledge the many doctors and nurses here with us today who took such magnificent care of the vice-president over a span of 27 years,” Reiner said. A reminder, that Cheney suffered from several heart attacks during his life, and ultimately died from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.

Cheney's casket is now being placed in front of the altar, and his family are taking their seats.

While there are several high-profile political figures at Dick Cheney's funeral today, notably absent are Bill and Hillary Clinton and Barack and Michelle Obama.

A spokesperson for Bill Clinton said that former president had an unavoidable scheduling conflict which prevented him from attending today's service.

Covered in the American flag, Cheney's casket was just carried into the National Cathedral by the military honor guard. Walking behind were members of his family, including his widow Lynne and elder daughter Liz Cheney.

In the first row at Dick Cheney's funeral, former vice-president Kamala Harris and her predecessor, Mike Pence, sit next to each other.

We're expecting former president George W Bush, who Cheney served as vice-president, to deliver a speech today.

NEW DELHI, November 20. /TASS/. The Bank of Russia will soon open its representative office in India, Russian Ambassador to New Delhi Denis Alipov said in an interview with TASS.

"A representative office of the Bank of Russia will be opened soon, becoming the second one abroad after China," he said. According to the ambassador, "the need to deepen the financial dialogue is driven by the active expansion of bilateral trade and economic relations" between the two countries. "Negative external factors contribute to the closer alignment of independent settlement mechanisms," he added.

Much has already been achieved along this path, the diplomat noted. "Domestic banks have successfully adjusted to the freezing of accounts in the US and EU and disconnection from the SWIFT system. Indian banks have learned to minimize the risks of secondary sanctions. As a result, mutual settlements between Russia and India have become more secure and diversified," he said.

"In terms of direct settlements between our countries, the share of national currencies is approaching 95%. We have moved to a qualitatively new level of banking interaction based on national payment systems. There are no longer any so-called frozen payments," Alipov stated.

VTB and Sberbank maintain branches in India. Representative offices of VEB.RF and Gazprombank have also been established. Commercial Indo Bank, a subsidiary of the State Bank of India, operates in Russia. As part of efforts to internationalize the rupee, Russian banks can open Special Rupee Vostro Accounts (SRVA). "This mechanism significantly enhances the possibilities of using rupees in mutual settlements for cross-border trade," the ambassador said.

"The integration of payment systems, the Russian Financial Messaging Platform (SPFS) and the Indian Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS), is gradually developing. Projects for retail payments using QR codes are under development. We are continuing the dialogue on the integration of central bank digital currency platforms (CBDC).

The government is set to raise fees for residence procedures for foreign nationals to levels comparable to those in Europe and the United States in the next fiscal year, according to government and ruling party sources.

It intends to submit a bill to amend the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Law to the regular Diet session next year. Revenue from the fee increase will fund policy initiatives related to foreigners, including to improve conditions for the rapidly growing foreign resident population and to deport illegal residents.

The government is considering including the following statement in its soon-to-be-drafted economic package: “In fiscal 2026, we will review and raise fees related to foreign residents and visa fees, taking into account the levels in major countries.”

Residence permit fees were raised by ¥2,000 in April this year, setting them at ¥6,000 for changing residence status and renewing stays and ¥10,000 for those applying for permanent residence. This reflects rising prices and labor costs.

The government is considering a plan that would raise fees for changing residence status and renewing stays of one year or longer to somewhere between ¥30,000 and ¥40,000, and that would increase the cost for a permanent residency permit to ¥100,000 or more. As the law currently sets a maximum fee of ¥10,000, an amendment will be required. This would be the first legal revision to increase the fees since 1981.

Fees in Western countries are higher than in Japan. In the United States, changing or renewing one's work permit costs $420 to $470 (about ¥65,000 to ¥73,000), and in Britain it costs £827 (about ¥169,000). In Germany, changing or renewing one's residence permit costs €93 to €98 (about ¥16,000 to ¥17,000).

In June, Japan's foreign resident population stood at a record high of about 3.96 million people, according to the Immigration Services Agency. The government aims to use the revenue from higher fees to improve conditions for foreign residents, such as by speeding up immigration screening and enhancing Japanese language education. Measures to deal with the roughly 70,000 illegal residents will also be strengthened.

Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry plans to raise fees for visas to levels comparable to Europe and the United States in the next fiscal year. If implemented, this would be the first increase since 1978. The government is expected to allocate the revenue to countering overtourism, among other measures.

A single-entry visa currently costs ¥3,000, and a multiple-entry visa runs at ¥6,000. For comparison, short-stay visas cost $185 (about ¥28,000) in the United States and £127 (about ¥25,000) in Britain. The ministry will reference these figures in determining how much to raise the fees.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

An oil refinery was hit in Ryazan Oblast overnight on Nov. 20, Robert "Madyar" Brovdi, commander of Ukraine's Drone Systems Forces confirmed on Nov. 20.

According to Brovdi, 1st Separate Center for Unmanned Systems "Magyar's Birds" hit the Ryazan oil refinery overnight. It sold 13 million tons of fuel last year.

"Gasoline is now gradually becoming a scarce commodity in Russia, while gas and oil are quickly running out," Brovdi said

Local authorities have not reported damage to the Ryazan oil refinery, but have confirmed that a drone attack took place overnight.

"Last night, air defense and electronic warfare destroyed drones over the territory of the Ryazan Oblast. Due to falling debris, a fire broke out on the territory of one enterprise," Governor Pavel Malkov claimed.

Ukraine regularly launches strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia and occupied territories as Moscow continues to wage its war.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the reports.

Ryazan, the region's capital, is located 180 kilometers (120 miles) southeast of Moscow and about 450 kilometers (280 miles) from Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia along Sumy Oblast.

Russia's oil and gas production has continued to come under attack as Kyiv attempts to cripple Moscow's primary source of funding for its war in Ukraine.

Ukraine's General Staff reported on Nov. 16 that Ukrainian forces struck the Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery in Russia's Samara Oblast and a drone storage site belonging to Russia's elite Rubikon unit.

 China's Cautious Response to America's Retreat

 Maria Repnikova

Since the start of his second term, U.S. President Donald Trump has been dismantling the traditional channels of American soft power. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is no longer operational, and Voice of America is tied up in legislative and court battles. The State Department has significantly reduced its staff and programming. Restrictive new visa and immigration policies have made the United States less accessible and less attractive to potential visitors, and Washington's coercive and transactional dealings with U.S. allies have damaged trust abroad. In The New York Times, Jamie Shea, a former NATO official, referred to these sweeping changes as the United States' “soft power suicide.”

Many experts and commentators have interpreted the United States' loss as China's gain. The late political scientist Joseph Nye, who developed the concept of soft power, cautioned earlier this year that China “stands ready to fill the vacuum that Trump is creating.” Yanzhong Huang, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, similarly contended that the Trump administration's actions have “boosted China's charm offensive.”

But as I argued in 2022 in Foreign Affairs, the U.S.-Chinese soft-power competition is not a zero-sum quest for influence. The two countries take distinct approaches to building soft power: China has tended to rely on drawing in other countries with pragmatic benefits, whereas the United States has placed ideals and values at the center of its outreach. Recipient countries, especially those in the so-called global South, have perceived Chinese and U.S. offerings as complementary, accepting both rather than seeing a need to choose one over the other.

Over the last three years, and especially since Trump's reelection, China's relative position has undoubtedly improved. As the United States retreats, China looks to the world like the more accessible and reliable partner. But this has not turned China into a global leader in soft power. Although Beijing still emphasizes its pragmatic offerings in its diplomacy, it has reduced, rather than expanded, its international assistance to lower-income countries, and has shown few signs of stepping in to replace USAID. Nor is China positioning itself to fill the United States' former role of promoting a particular governance model to the world. Beijing is generally looked upon more favorably than before, yet that change in attitude varies significantly from region to region, and even the countries that hold the most positive views of China regard its actions with a mix of appreciation and resentment. China may be passively gaining stature from the United States' soft-power retreat, but that is not enough to guarantee greater global influence in the years ahead.

Chinese interpretations of soft power differ from Nye's original definition, which emphasizes culture, values, and foreign policy as the key ingredients of a country's ability to influence others without coercion. In Chinese writings, cultural power is fused together with material power: Beijing considers its economic development model, technological innovation, and material assistance to developing countries, not just its traditional culture and principles, to be vectors of soft power.

When Chinese leaders try to appeal to developing countries, they consistently underscore China's pursuit of mutual economic benefit and its understanding of human rights as a concept rooted in economic rights and material well-being, rather than in individual and political freedom. Diplomacy is about offering something practical to other countries, whether that is trade deals (which are often announced with some kind of cultural spectacle), infrastructure projects, or training and educational programs that bring thousands of officials, policymakers, journalists, and students to China.

And with the arrival of the Trump administration, developing countries have few alternatives to what China is offering. According to the Lowy Institute, a think tank in Australia, the administration's cuts to USAID have made China's bilateral development assistance commitments the largest in the world. Steep U.S. tariffs have ensured that China, which still embraces trade (even if it is criticized for its unfair practices), is the more economically accessible of the two countries. China's openness to international visitors—it now allows 30-day visa-free entry to citizens of more than 70 countries—also sharply contrasts the increasingly restrictive United States.



Yet China does not appear to be ramping up its developmental assistance, even though Trump's policies provide it an opportunity. Beijing's recent pledges of lending assistance to developing countries have been smaller than in the past, and there is little sign so far of that trend changing. At a May summit between China and the 33-country Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, for instance, Beijing promised members of the bloc $9.2 billion in credit—less than half of what it pledged at the same summit in 2015. In September, China pledged $1.4 billion in loans to the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a ten-country economic and security association, down from the $5 billion it pledged in 2014. These reductions reflect Beijing's effort to “revise” its Belt and Road Initiative by focusing on “small and beautiful” projects—downsizing, in effect—which is likely a response to both China's domestic economic pressures and the soaring debt that many BRI countries have accumulated. Although China is still offering loans to many neighboring, resource-rich countries, as well as to higher-income countries, such as the United States and Russia, it is increasingly wary of over-lending to developing countries. In some cases, such as in Ethiopia, it has paused new loans entirely.

There are few signs that China aims to fill other gaps left by USAID, either. Prior to 2025, China's foreign-aid budget (separate from its development finance funds) was a fraction of the United States' pre-2025 budget, and much of it was disbursed as concessional loans, rather than grants. This year, only in a handful of cases—such as increasing its contributions to Cambodia's largest demining organization and offering informal assurances that it will provide humanitarian aid to Nepal—has Beijing jumped in to meet the needs of countries affected by the USAID cuts. These isolated examples do not add up to a wholesale reorientation of Chinese diplomacy.

China is not holding back economically across the board. In recent years, Chinese trade with and private investment in countries across Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia have increased. The primary drivers of this expansion, however, have been commercial actors, rather than the state (although the lines between the two can be blurry).

The United States has also reduced its promotion of democratic values and human rights abroad, no longer taking pains to position itself as an aspirational democracy. This leaves another vacuum that China could, in theory, fill with an ideological agenda of its own—but Beijing may not be willing or able to do so. China's approach to soft power has generally focused less on the promotion of political ideals and values than that of the United States. This may be slowly changing, particularly as Chinese officials talk about principles such as noninterference and promote an alternative path to modernization and democracy in summit diplomacy and in the training sessions they run for foreign-policy makers. But China's messaging does not offer, as the United States' messaging once did, a clear vision of the country's role in the global order, nor a coherent model to “export.” This may be intentional, as it gives China flexibility and helps it present itself as a less imposing global power than the United States has been.

A main theme of Beijing's ideological promotion today is to differentiate China from the West. In speeches and public commentaries, Chinese officials often denounce Western hegemony and portray China as a responsible and stable major power. In a comment in Russian media in July, for example, China's ambassador to Russia criticized the United States for abandoning the postwar global order and described China, by comparison, as a country able to keep its promises. In September, at the SCO summit in Tianjin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for a “fairer” world order, and launched the Global Governance Initiative to demonstrate his commitment to advancing the goal of multipolarity.

In discussions with African leaders and policymakers, Chinese academics and diplomats tend to contrast the nonintrusive, benevolent China with the more interventionist and impulsive United States. China's approach to modernization, for example, is presented as inclusive of national differences rather than dictating a set of Western rules. Highlighting the unfairness of U.S. policies, both real and perceived, can foster grievance-based unity that can bring some countries closer to China. The Chinese-led SCO, for instance, has expanded its agenda from border security to global diplomacy, and has grown from a group of six countries in 2001 to one with ten full members, 14 dialogue partners, and two observers today, with more countries waiting to join. Yet China's messaging does not go much further than criticizing the dominance of the United States and demanding more say in international institutions and governance mechanisms. It falls short of delineating and inspiring an alternative world order.



Similarly, the recent tumult in U.S. democracy would seem to give China an opportunity to promote its governance model to a more receptive international audience. What constitutes this model, however, is not entirely clear. As I found in a study of training seminars for African policymakers, Chinese educators and officials do not try to sell the Chinese political system as something wholly different, but instead adopt and invert Western concepts to promote it. China is presented as just another version of democracy, but one that is more efficient and adaptive to public feedback. The Chinese leaders of these training sessions, moreover, rarely provide a roadmap for how to imitate China, even when it comes to topics such as poverty alleviation in which China is widely regarded as successful. In one striking scene at a seminar in Addis Ababa, an Ethiopian official asked the Chinese lecturer to at least provide some specific advice on how Ethiopia could mimic China's accomplishments. Another Chinese expert chimed in to say, “We are not here to give advice,” shutting down further discussion. Technical trainings related to agriculture or Chinese technology transfers likely do offer more specific lessons, but African officials and journalists have told me that concrete suggestions about China's broader developmental and political experience are limited. Without them, Beijing may present its own example as something to aspire to, but not as a model for other countries to follow.

This is not to say that China is not making new inroads. In recent months, the growing popularity of Chinese popular culture products such as Labubu dolls, the animated film Ne Zha 2, and several popular video games, along with Chinese technologies including the artificial intelligence platform DeepSeek, have inspired such headlines as “How China became cool.” This kind of cultural influence can translate to greater affinity for China's values and governance principles, especially when foreign publics latch onto films and video games that glorify Chinese history, traditions, and futuristic technology. Exports such as Labubu dolls and DeepSeek more plainly relate to commercial and technological acumen—something that can bolster China's material soft power but will not necessarily spread its vision.

Soft power is always challenging to measure definitively. One approximation is public opinion polls, which have shown China receive at least a passive boost in popularity since Trump's reelection. A July Pew survey across 24 countries found that more people still view the United States favorably than they do China, but the gap is closing. The United States has suffered a large decline in positive perceptions since spring 2024—favorable views of the country dropped 20 percentage points in Canada, for instance—whereas China has made marginal gains. In another recent survey across five major Latin American countries, more people preferred China to the United States as an economic partner in every country polled.

But these positive signs come with caveats. Perceptions of China still vary significantly. Unlike in Africa and Latin America, where opinion toward China is generally favorable, China's reputation is overwhelmingly negative in the Asia-Pacific and in Europe. In these regions, concern about the security threat Beijing poses likely outweighs attraction to the economic opportunities it has to offer, even as Washington pulls back.

Moreover, appreciation of China as an economic partner does not translate to trust in China's global leadership. In the Pew survey in July, a median of 66 percent of respondents across 25 countries did not have confidence in Xi “to do the right thing regarding world affairs.” Such contrasting views of China on economic and ideological levels also come up in conversations with policymakers. Ethiopian officials who took part in diplomatic training programs in China told me that they admired China's economic prowess and appreciated its material offerings, but they remained skeptical of Beijing's promises of cooperation bringing mutual gain, asking, “Is it a win-win or a China win?” Many struggled to articulate China's perspective on global affairs beyond a pursuit of self-interest.



Subtle resentments and fears of China's economic power rarely get captured in surveys, but they do show up in other ways. Even in a country such as Ethiopia, which is more favorably disposed toward China, university students across the country have expressed to me a mix of approval and apprehension about the long-term implications of Belt and Road projects. Many invoked the high debt owed to China (Ethiopia is China's second-largest loan recipient in Africa) and the possibility that China could end up taking over critical projects and sectors if Ethiopia can't pay back its loans. In Central Asia, where many countries are also relatively pro-China, organized protests against Chinese infrastructure and energy projects, among other issues, have grown more common in the last decade. Among countries that prefer to hedge between major powers or to avoid alignment, the withdrawal of the United States generates even more unease, as it leaves China's presence uncontested.

It would be premature to declare the relative improvement in China's soft-power position a definitive victory for the country. For now, Beijing seems to be holding back rather than fully taking advantage of the United States' decline. It presents itself as a reliable and accessible developmental partner, as it did before the second Trump administration, but it has also been cautious about expending more resources abroad. China's ideological message still draws largely on resentment toward the West, rather than presenting a compelling alternate international vision or offering concrete, replicable policy lessons. Many foreign publics remain wary of China, especially when it comes to global leadership.

Yet Beijing's conservative approach may be strategic, rather than a sign of weakness or disregard for soft power. China is avoiding overcommitment and opening itself up to greater scrutiny over its domestic politics and global vision while still enjoying passive gains from the U.S. withdrawal. Unlike the Washington of the past, Beijing is more interested in legitimizing its distinctive path than in convincing others to follow in its footsteps. Highlighting the stark contrasts between China and the United States may suffice for now.

 And Why Regime Change Is the Only Way Forward in Venezuela

 Elliott Abrams

On the last day of October, CBS's 60 Minutes asked U.S. President Donald Trump about his policy on Venezuela and his thoughts about that country's dictator, Nicolas Maduro. “Are Maduro's days as president numbered?” asked Norah O'Donnell. “I would say yeah,” Trump replied. “I think so, yeah.”

This phlegmatic response was a good summary of current U.S. policy: Washington favors Maduro's downfall, but its position lacks clarity and is not backed by the actions—including military strikes inside Venezuela—that would bring about the outcome U.S. officials appear to want. And therein lies the danger for Trump and his administration: that after a great deal of chest-thumping and a show of naval force aimed at Maduro, they will leave him in place. In that scenario, Maduro would emerge as the survivor who bested Trump and showed that American influence in the Western Hemisphere is limited at best.

Removing Maduro, on the other hand, would advance Washington's interests, protect U.S. national security, and benefit Venezuelans and their neighbors. Regime change would result in reduced migration to the United States, less drug trafficking, more freedom and prosperity in Venezuela, and an end to the country's cooperation with China, Cuba, Iran, and Russia, which gives countries hostile to U.S. interests a base of operations on the South American mainland.

The use of American military force to overthrow Maduro would not be without risk. It could fail to end the Maduro regime and could incite demonstrations against the United States. But regime change would not require any ground deployments of U.S. forces except, at most, Special Forces raids against regime figures who have already been indicted for narcoterrorism by U.S. law enforcement. The potential gain for the United States from the collapse of the Maduro regime far outweighs the risk, because it would end a brutal dictatorship that relies on drug trafficking to stay afloat and would open the door to Venezuelan economic recovery. That would end the mass migration of Venezuelans and reduce the role of Venezuela in cocaine flows to the United States.

Most recently, Trump has left open the possibility of more talks with Maduro while also signaling that deploying U.S. troops to Venezuela remained an option, as well. The Trump administration should eliminate this ambiguity and make clear that it intends to deal not only with the symptoms of the problem—trafficking in gold, drugs, and human beings; mass migration; violent crime; and instability—but with their root cause: the Maduro regime.

In 2019, toward the end of his first term, Trump initiated a pressure campaign against the Maduro regime. At the time, I served as special representative for Venezuela in the U.S. State Department and helped organize diplomatic efforts and severe economic sanctions to delegitimize and undermine Maduro. Nearly 60 countries joined the United States in recognizing Juan Guaidó, who had been National Assembly speaker, as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela. The theory was that the presidency was vacant because Maduro had stolen the 2018 presidential election—which he had.

But those U.S. efforts failed, because economic and diplomatic pressure was simply insufficient against a regime willing to use violence and brutal repression against the Venezuelan people to stay in power. When Trump left office in 2021, Maduro was still ruling Venezuela. In the ensuing years, the repression, economic ruin, refugee flows, and trafficking in drugs, gold, and human beings have continued. But in the 2024 presidential election, the opposition figure Edmundo González crushed Maduro in a landslide, making clear that Venezuelans want an end to the dictator's rule. Still, Maduro refused to accept the result.

Back in 2020, Maduro had been indicted by U.S. federal prosecutors, who charged him with, among other things, conspiring to commit narcoterrorism and leading a drug-trafficking organization known as Cartel de los Soles, or “cartel of the suns.” The State Department announced a $15 million reward for information that led to his arrest; this past January, that amount was raised to $25 million. Last summer, the Department of the Treasury sanctioned the cartel as a specially designated global terrorist entity, and the reward amount was doubled, to $50 million.

In addition to this diplomatic, political, economic, and legal pressure, the Trump administration has added more direct forms of coercion. In the Trump first term we used to say “all options are on the table,” but the administration made no military moves against Maduro. And a lack of enthusiasm for and commitment to the goal of bringing down the regime (plus perhaps a lack of capability) meant that Washington took no effective covert actions, either. By contrast, in the past few months, the United States has struck nearly two dozen ships in the Caribbean and the western Pacific, and its largest and most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, arrived there on November 16.

Typically, the U.S. Fourth Fleet, covering Latin America and adjacent waters, has no vessels permanently assigned to it and has only four to six surface ships under its command. Today, about a dozen surface ships including the Gerald R. Ford and a nuclear attack submarine, plus a considerable amount of airpower assets, have been sent to the region. This suggests that the list will expand to include targets inside Venezuela. “We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,” Trump said in mid-October. Around the same time, U.S. officials told The New York Times that Trump had authorized the CIA to carry out a program of covert action inside Venezuela, although its parameters and objectives remain secret.



So far, the Trump administration has characterized all these steps as intended to stop the Maduro regime's drug trafficking, not to overthrow the dictator. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio put it, “This is a counterdrug operation.” The New York Times recently reported that Rubio held a private meeting with House and Senate leaders earlier this month during which he “insisted that ousting Mr. Maduro was not the administration's objective.” But if Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela and is instead a narcoterrorist and a cartel kingpin, it would be difficult to understand why the Trump administration would surround the country with a gigantic armada only to leave him in power.

This is not the only anomaly in the current policy. Despite stringent U.S. economic sanctions, Trump continues to permit Chevron to drill for oil in Venezuela—and give some of it to the Maduro regime, as a form of tax payment. Maduro then sells that oil for cash. As a result, this “Chevron exception” to the sanctions helps him stay in power.

Trump has also withdrawn the temporary protected status that the Biden administration conferred on hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who sought refuge in the United States. In effect, this means the Trump administration is telling them to return to a country for which the State Department's travel warning tells Americans this: “Do not travel to or remain in Venezuela due to the high risk of wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, and poor health infrastructure. All U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents in Venezuela are strongly advised to depart immediately.” It continues: “Violent crimes, such as homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, are common. . . . Police and security forces have instituted a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy or anti-regime demonstrations.” Describing Venezuela as a hell on earth led by a vicious criminal and then ending temporary protected status suggests mixed motives and no clear policy.

Finally, leaving Maduro in place also leaves in place his ties with China, Cuba, Iran, and Russia. In Trump's first term, the administration received reliable reports about Iranian plans to transfer missiles to Venezuela—which the administration concluded would be unacceptable and would be stopped, with the use of force, if need be. That threat was conveyed to Venezuela and Iran, and the transfers were never made. Iranian drones that can reach Israel from Iranian territory can also reach U.S. territory from Venezuela—potentially hitting Puerto Rico and U.S. facilities there. Today, Iran uses Venezuela as a base for Hezbollah activity, money laundering, acquisition of blank passports for use by its agents, and other actions that Trump should stop by putting an end to the regime that enables them. Otherwise they will continue, and they will grow whenever it is to Iran's advantage. As for Cuba, the Maduro regime gives it between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil per day, on average, for free or with a huge discount—a critical source of support for the communist regime in Havana. A democratic government in Caracas would end that subsidy for repression. It would also remove the Russian military personnel usually in the country to train Venezuelan forces, and it would end the country's reliance on Russian and Chinese military equipment.

So far, Trump's approach mostly resembles a psychological operation, also known as a psyop. The public revelation that there is a covert CIA program seems to be part of that. If an electricity transformer blows up in some part of Venezuela, it would be hard to say whether it was the result of years of poor maintenance or an act of sabotage. The doubling of the reward for Maduro was clearly meant to incentivize regime officials or military leaders to break with him now. Presumably, one of the CIA's jobs is to convey to them that Maduro is going down—but they need not go down with him. That messaging should include discussion of a potential amnesty (something that has accompanied every Latin American transition to democracy) and assurances that, under a democratic government, the Venezuelan military would be better equipped and more professional, with plenty of room for advancement when some top Maduro cronies are weeded out. The current strikes on boats and the consequent reduction in maritime drug traffic may help reduce the cash Maduro has to continue buying military support.

But Venezuela's military is permeated with Cuban and Cuban-trained intelligence agents whose precise task is to avoid coups. Over the years, there has been plenty of military unrest in Venezuela, and hundreds of officers have been arrested and remain in the regime's hellish prisons (or have died there). Last year, a former Venezuelan army lieutenant who became a dissident, Ronald Ojeda, was murdered while living in exile in Chile—a killing that Chile's leftist government blamed on “instructions or orders given by the Venezuelan authorities.” The case shows not only the criminal and terrorist nature of the Maduro regime but the extent of its nervousness about any military dissidence.

Trump's actions thus far have raised the stakes for him and for the United States, and the Venezuelan democratic opposition is fully behind him. María Corina Machado, the leader of the opposition and recent Nobel Peace Prize winner, called Trump's moves “absolutely correct” and called Maduro “the head of this narcoterror structure that has declared war on the Venezuelan people and [on] democratic nations in the region. . . . Maduro started this war, and President Trump is ending that war.”

But victory for the democratic opposition and Trump, and the end of the regime, are not guaranteed. It is possible that if the U.S. flotilla can be kept in place and economic sanctions tightened, the regime's income will steadily decline and, with it, the ability to keep buying support. But the regime has had decades to coup-proof itself with massive help from Cuba. Merely starving it will not be enough: it must be forced out of power with military strikes, which will throw the regime's support structures, including in the military, into disarray and make them fear for their own futures.



The point of military action should be to cripple the regime's drug trafficking and demonstrate to the top leaders of the Venezuelan military and everyone except the small Maduro inner circle that the game is up, that Maduro is doomed, and that the best way for them to protect their own futures is to remove him and negotiate the installation of the next government. They will see the beginning of the use of force by the United States, but they will not know where it might end: they will be left wondering whether there will be more strikes at military targets or at regime physical assets, whether Washington will use Special Forces to apprehend indicted regime leaders, and whether the United States might even carry out a small invasion. Trump is wise to say he has not ruled anything out because the limited use of force is in its way another psyop, threatening something larger if Maduro is not removed. The goal is to replace regime confidence with fear, and insiders' displays of loyalty with their search for escape hatches.

And the escape hatch should be clear: Maduro's departure from power, followed by the installation of the legitimate government led by González, followed by economic recovery, free elections, and the kind of negotiated amnesty (for all but the top figures of the regime) and national reconciliation that has been possible in other Latin American countries after dictators have fallen. The loyalty of the army and police to the new government cannot be assumed, of course, but if it can pay them using frozen assets or loans, their fealty to the departed Maduro will rapidly disappear. Soldiers are also Venezuelan citizens, after all, who have seen how their own families and neighbors have been forced to live or flee under Maduro's reign.

It would be neither wise nor necessary to deploy U.S. ground forces to Venezuela. But creating the conditions for Maduro's overthrow will require hitting more than just drug-trafficking boats in international waters, because such strikes do not telegraph to Venezuelans that the regime is truly under great threat of losing power. First, Washington should expand its target list to include drug-trafficking speedboats in ports in addition to those on the high seas, because the threat must be brought home to the Venezuelan military. To protect U.S. planes that may strike targets in Venezuela (and to demonstrate that such strikes are planned), U.S. forces should destroy Venezuela's air defense systems, F-16 fighter aircraft at the Palo Negro Air Base, and Sukhoi jets at the air base located on La Orchila, an island about 100 miles off the coast. Airstrikes should also target small airstrips in western Venezuela used for drug trafficking and bases in western Venezuela used by the National Liberation Army (known by its Spanish acronym, ELN), a Colombian terrorist group aligned with Maduro and also engaged in narcotics traffic.

No single step would have a greater effect on the Venezuelan military, intelligence services, and police than removing Diosdado Cabello, the regime's chief thug, who is currently serving as interior minister and thus controls the police. Cabello was indicted in New York in 2020 for conspiracy to commit narcoterrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine, and the U.S. State Department has offered a reward of $25 million for information leading to his capture owing to his participation “in a corrupt and violent narco-terrorism conspiracy between the Cartel of the Suns . . . and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.” Removing him from power would show everyone in the regime's security organs that they were not safe, and that its power to protect itself and them was fast eroding.

Maduro rules over a country with a collapsed economy, 270 percent inflation, vast poverty, and a populace that voted in a landslide to end his days in power. It is not likely that his regime could withstand such an assault. No such policy is without risk—including the fact that failure could leave Maduro in power and weaken American credibility and prestige. That outcome would strengthen not only Maduro and other leaders of his ilk, such as Miguel Díaz-Canel in Cuba and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, it would guarantee more drug trafficking and more migration from Venezuela. But the risks of the status quo are even greater.

“Regime change” is hardly a phrase associated with Trump, but the goals he has stated in Venezuela require it. The Maduro regime depends on illicit activities to remain in power, and U.S. descriptions of Maduro as a criminal are accurate. Unlike the South American regimes that returned to the barracks during democratic transitions in the Reagan years (when I served as assistant U.S. secretary of state for Latin America), the Maduro regime isn't a military dictatorship. The military juntas of the past were amenable to negotiated agreements with democratic political parties wherein they left power in exchange for some form of amnesty for their coups and related crimes. Maduro and his top lieutenants, by contrast, are drug traffickers, under U.S. indictment for narcoterrorism and other crimes such as money laundering. They will not peacefully negotiate the end of their rule because they know that doing so would mean prison. That is why they must be forced from power if Venezuela is to have a decent future. While, in theory, all the indictments could be quashed in return for their leaving power—the deal that was rejected by Panama's Manuel Noriega—only the clear U.S. intent to remove the regime will make Venezuela's criminal leaders even consider such an alternative outcome. And they know that even if the United States agrees to end criminal prosecutions, Venezuela or the International Criminal Court may come after them. Such negotiations can be tried but are an illusory path; this criminal regime must be forced from power if Venezuela is to have a decent future.

Venezuela is a far better candidate for regime change and a return of democracy than were countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. After bringing down the dictator Marcos Pérez Jimenez in 1958, Venezuelans enjoyed two generations of democracy and built a large and educated middle class until Hugo Chávez and Maduro brought repression and ruin. The country has no significant ethnic or religious divisions. It has a long tradition of close financial, commercial, social, educational, and military contacts with the United States. It is the alienation from the United States in the last 20 years—and the links to China, Cuba, Iran, and Russia—that is anomalous. Rebuilding democratic institutions, clearing out the Cuban influences in the intelligence service, and attacking the country's vast corruption will take years of hard work. But that is what a huge majority of Venezuelans voted for last year, despite all the efforts of the Maduro regime to intimidate them and to rig the election.

The only way for Trump to be able to declare victory credibly is for Maduro to go. Trump is obviously reluctant to launch strikes inside Venezuela. It's a fair guess that it isn't the problem of how to legally justify and defend such strikes that is deterring him, but his own doubts about the chances of success. And if Trump backs down, he would not acknowledge defeat; he would instead claim that his only goal had been to depress drug trafficking. He would declare victory and cite statistics showing that the number of drug shipments on boats in the Caribbean had gone down—which it would have.

But once the U.S. fleet is withdrawn, those shipments will inexorably rise again—and the Cartel de los Soles and its putative leader, Maduro, will be back in business with the wind in their sails. Moreover, refugee flows from Venezuela would continue, and Venezuelans would not return home in large numbers, while Maduro would remain in power. So although Trump may feel he is not yet committed, in fact his own prestige and American credibility are already on the line. His advisers should persuade him that he's already past the point of no return: the game is on, and either he wins or Maduro wins.

U.S. President Donald Trump is mounting yet another push to end Russia's war against Ukraine, as Washington begins testing a new peace framework that has already sparked unease among Ukrainian officials. 

A source in the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent that a new peace plan is being crafted by U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, who's been in direct contact with Kirill Dmitriev, Russia's senior economic negotiator.

An Axios source in the Trump administration confirmed that the U.S. is already briefing representatives from Ukraine and Europe on the plan.

Washington has signaled that Ukraine is expected to accept a framework for ending the war that would require Kyiv to give up territory and relinquish certain weapons systems. 

The reported proposals also include reducing Ukraine's army, among other concessions.

A source in the President's Office was decidedly unenthusiastic about the possible plan when speaking to the Kyiv Independent, adding that Washington appears to be shifting toward a framework aligned with Moscow's demands.

During previous rounds of talks, the Kremlin had softened some of its maximalist demands, limiting its focus to territorial concessions from Ukraine. 

The demands previously dropped, however, seem to be resurfacing.

A Kyiv Independent source familiar with the U.S. proposal said the Kremlin has hardened its maximalist conditions, sensing Ukraine's worsening position on the front lines and exploiting the fallout from a major corruption scandal involving people close to President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Zelensky on Nov. 18 announced he would travel to Turkey to "reinvigorate negotiations" with Russia, signaling renewed attempts to engage multiple channels.

Speaking the same day, Trump made it clear that he still hopes to stop the war in Ukraine, despite nearly 10 months of mediation yielding no tangible results.

"I've stopped eight wars," the U.S. president said. "I have another one to go with (Vladimir) Putin. I'm a little surprised at Putin. It's taken longer than I thought."

Against the backdrop of the talks ongoing at the political level, a parallel military-led peace track now appears to be also taking shape.

The Kyiv Independent has learned that a military-led delegation will report findings back to the White House after getting a firsthand look at the reality in Ukraine. The delegation is then expected to travel to Moscow to hold talks with Russian officials.

The last direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow took place nearly four months ago.

The fundamental positions of both sides remain unchanged.

Kyiv, backed by European governments, is pushing for a ceasefire along the existing front line. Moscow continues to insist on Ukraine ceding eastern Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

Asked about recent diplomatic activity, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Nov. 19 that nothing has changed since Putin and Trump met earlier in Alaska.

"No, there are no developments to report at this time," Peskov said.

Following his trip to Turkey, Zelensky said in a post on X that "only President Trump and the U.S. have sufficient strength for the war to finally end," adding that Ukraine has supported "every strong and fair proposal to end this war" in recent months.

Zelensky welcomed Turkey's willingness to engage in diplomatic efforts and noted Kyiv is "ready to work in any other meaningful formats that can yield results."

The main way to stop "the bloodshed and achieve a lasting peace" is for Ukraine to work with its allies and for U.S. leadership "to remain effective, strong, and to bring about a peace that will last long and provide security," he said.

Donald Trump's Ukraine envoy Lt Gen Keith Kellogg is leaving the role, it has emerged hours after a US plan to end the war leaked.

Lt Gen Kellogg, 81, is expected to step down as US special envoy in January in a departure that will deal a hammer blow to Kyiv's diplomatic efforts to end the war on favourable terms.

The retired general has been a key advocate for Ukraine inside the Trump administration at a time when the White House's support for Kyiv has dwindled.

His position as special presidential envoy is a temporary designation, and such envoys in theory must be confirmed by the US Senate to stay in their positions past 360 days.

But as he approaches that time limit, Lt Gen Kellogg has indicated to his associates that January would be a natural departure point, according to Reuters.

His exit will come as unwelcome news to Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, who is being pressured to give up territory to Russia.

News of his resignation came just hours after an unfavourable draft agreement to end the war was leaked to the media.

Under the US proposal, Ukraine would be forced to give up all of its territory in the eastern Donbas region and slash the size of its military in half.

The 28-point plan was thrashed out between the US and Russia in a recent flurry of secretive talks, renewing fears that Ukraine is being frozen out of discussions about its future.

The Telegraph understands that the draft proposal could see Ukraine give up the territory but maintain legal ownership in a cash-for-land deal.

Russia would pay an undisclosed rental fee for de-facto control of the region.

Initially feared to be something of a Ukraine sceptic, Lt Gen Kellogg quickly became one of Kyiv's few allies in the White House, viewed as a sympathetic ear in an administration that has at times leaned toward Moscow's view on the origins of the war in Ukraine.

At times, it put him at odds with Steve Witkoff, the president's lead negotiator, who has advocated a lopsided territorial swap as part of a long-term peace deal.

Among the retired general's successes was facilitating the release of dozens of hostages held by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko in return for limited sanctions relief.

In a sign of his appreciation in Ukraine, he would often be greeted by Mr Zelensky with a hug when the pair met in Washington or Kyiv.

But for all the warm welcomes, Lt Gen Kellogg had concluded that there were too many administration officials working on Ukraine, according to one person familiar with his thinking.

A lack of acknowledgement within the administration that Russia – not Ukraine – is stalling peace talks had led him to become increasingly frustrated.

While his departure will be viewed as unwelcome news in Europe, in Washington, it will come as little surprise.

Insiders suggest Mr Trump had picked him because the US president viewed his sympathetic ear as a valuable tool to keep Ukraine at the negotiating table while Witkoff carved out a deal with Putin.

He has become notably absent from key decision-making meetings and did not travel to the peace summit in Alaska in August.

Earlier this month, his deputy, John Coale, left to become the US special envoy for Belarus.

It was not immediately clear who, if anyone, would replace the retired general.

The US has yet to appoint a Senate-confirmed ambassador to Ukraine.

WASHINGTON (AP) — They gathered at the Washington National Cathedral on Thursday — former presidents, vice presidents, sworn political foes and newfound friends — in a show of respect and remembrance for Dick Cheney, the consequential and polarizing vice president who became an acidic scold of President Donald Trump.

Trump, who has been publicly silent about Cheney's death Nov. 3, was not invited to the memorial service.

Two ex-presidents came: Republican George W. Bush, who eulogized the man who served him as vice president, and Democrat Joe Biden, who once called Cheney “the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American history” but now honors his commitment to his family and to his values.

“Solid and rare and reliable,” Bush said at the service of his vice president, praising a man whose “talent and restraint” exceeded his ego. “Smart and polished, without airs.”

Bush and others noted the understated demeanor of a man who nevertheless wielded great influence in government. “Above all,” Bush said, “I wanted someone with the ability to step into the presidency without getting distracted by the ambition to seek it.”

Among the eulogists, Liz Cheney, the eldest daughter, only obliquely addressed what amounted to a father-daughter feud with the president — a man her dad had called a “coward” for trying to overturn his loss in the 2020 election.




She spoke of her father's conviction that when confronted with a choice between defending the country and a political party, the country must come first. “Bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she said.

Liz Cheney is a former high-ranking House member whose Republican political career was shredded by a MAGA movement angered by her investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Thursday, she chose not to speak directly of Trump.

She spoke of seeing clouds in the shape of angels just before her father died.

Moments before the service began, figures of recent but now receded power mingled: Bush and Biden and their wives sitting in a row together, former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris and Mike Pence chatting side by side in their pew with Al Gore and Dan Quayle together behind them. 

Biden greeted Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former longtime Senate leader, and his wife, former labor and transportation secretary Elaine Chao. Behind them sat Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who spent time talking with another former House speaker, Republican John Boehner. All gathered among the soaring interior columns of the grand cathedral known as “a spiritual home for the nation.”

Others delivering tributes at Thursday's funeral were Cheney's longtime cardiologist, Dr. Jonathan Reiner; former NBC News correspondent Pete Williams, who was Cheney's spokesman at the Pentagon; and several of the former vice president's grandchildren. 

“I'm happy to report that I haven't given many eulogies,” Reiner said in his remarks. “Nobody wants a doctor who is great at funerals.” 

Reiner recalled doctors telling Cheney decades ago, after the first of multiple heart attacks, that he should abandon his political ambitions then. Yet he kept winning elections as a Wyoming congressman for years after that.

Cheney, he said, was always the “calmest person in the room.”

Cheney had lived with heart disease for decades and, after the Bush administration, with a heart transplant. He died at age 84 from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said.

Trump's vice president, JD Vance, on stage at another event in the morning, was asked about Cheney and said: “Obviously there's some political disagreements there but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.”

Vance was also not invited to the funeral, according to a person familiar with the details who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The White House lowered its flags to half-staff after Cheney's death, as it said the law calls for, but Trump did not issue the presidential proclamation that often accompanies the death of notable figures, nor has he commented publicly on his passing.

The deeply conservative Cheney's influence in the Bush administration was legendary and, to his critics, tragic.

He advocated for the U.S. invasion of Iraq on the basis of what proved to be faulty intelligence and consistently defended the extraordinary tools of surveillance, detention and inquisition employed in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Bush credited him with helping to keep the country safe and stable in a perilous time.

After the 2020 election won by Biden, Liz Cheney served as vice chair of the Democratic-led special House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. She accused Trump of summoning the violent mob and plunging the nation into “a moment of maximum danger.”

For that, she was stripped of her Republican leadership position and ultimately defeated in a 2022 Republican primary in Wyoming. In a campaign TV ad made for his daughter, Dick Cheney branded Trump a “coward” who “tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.”

Last year, it did not sit well with Trump when Cheney said he would vote for the Democrat, Harris, in the presidential election.

Trump told Arab and Muslim voters that Dick Cheney's support for Harris should give them pause, because he “killed more Arabs than any human being on Earth. He pushed Bush, and they went into the Middle East.”

Live Updates


            • Epstein files: The Justice Department has 30 days to release its Jeffrey Epstein-related files after President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan bill last night directing it to do so. Some lawmakers worry the Trump administration may try to hinder the process by slowing the release or redacting information.
    


• Trump accuses Democrats: The president called for the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who urged troops to disobey illegal orders that might be issued by the administration, calling it “seditious” and “punishable by death.” Democratic House leadership condemned what they described as death threats, while House Speaker Mike Johnson defended Trump's post.
    


            • Cheney's funeral: Elsewhere in Washington, political leaders from both sides of the aisle gathered to pay respects to former Vice President Dick Cheney. Former Rep. Liz Cheney said her father chose to defend the Constitution over political partisanship. Neither Trump nor Vice President JD Vance were invited, according to a source.
    


            In a joint statement, the six Democratic lawmakers who President Donald Trump accused of engaging in “seditious behavior, punishable by death” over their video urging troops to not obey unlawful orders said they “will not be intimidated.”
    


            Sens. Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan urged others to “unite and condemn the President's calls for our murder and political violence.”
    


                    “What's most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law. Our servicemembers should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty,” according to the statement.  
                





            Additionally, Slotkin said during a conference that “I'm not going to shut up because Donald Trump is threatening me.”
    


            Slotkin said she was accompanied by security to the NewDEAL's 15th annual Leaders Conference in Washington, DC.
    


            Past presidents and politicians of both parties gathered in Washington, DC, for former Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral.
    


            The service at the Washington National Cathedral featured tributes from his family, former President George W. Bush and others who worked closely with Cheney during his decades in politics. Notably, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance were not invited.
    


            Speakers talked about his love for his family and his country, and told personal stories about how he loved fly fishing and the outdoors.
    


Here are some of the notable moments:



            The bill ordering the release of the full Justice Department case files on Jeffrey Epstein is now law — but some in Congress remain skeptical that the documents will be made public.
    


            There is a provision in the law that allows the Trump administration to withhold documents that are part of an ongoing investigation. President Donald Trump asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Epstein's ties to many high-profile Democrats last week.
    


            Lawmakers like Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who co-sponsored a version of the bill in the upper chamber, said he “doesn't trust this administration to follow the law at all.”
    


                    “I expect the administration to block release of anything that puts the Trump administration or Trump himself in a bad light,” he told CNN.
                





            He doesn't think there will be anyone inside the administration ensuring the DOJ follows the law as it's written, including providing the required explanations for why certain documents are being withheld.
    


            Meantime, GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said he expects the DOJ to “fully comply,” warning that it would be a “mistake” for the administration to hold up the disclosure.
    


                    He said he knows Bondi well, and “I'd expect her to follow the law completely. And they need to do so swiftly.”
                





            The former Missouri attorney general also encouraged the DOJ to look into mounting more prosecutions related to the Epstein case. “Given the scope of who is involved in this, I'm just really shocked that you can't prosecute more people,” Hawley said.
    


            As Dick Cheney's funeral service comes to a close, elsewhere in DC, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended President Donald Trump's call for the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials in a video to disobey illegal orders.
    


                    “I know the DOJ and the Pentagon are looking into the legality of all that, but what I can address is what everybody knows. That was wildly inappropriate. It is very dangerous. You have leading members of Congress telling troops to disobey orders. I think that's unprecedented in American history,” Johnson said. 
                





            The speaker noted his son attends the Naval Academy, and said, “I know young soldiers, airmen, sailors. They don't need that kind of nonsense from people in Congress. It is very dangerous.”
    


            Pressed on Trump saying the Democrats' actions should be punishable by death, the speaker said, “I'm gonna let others define what it is, but it's wildly inappropriate.”
    


            Johnson a bit later expanded on his thoughts, saying he took Trump's suggestion to be the president simply explaining sedition.
    


            “What I read was he was defining the crime of sedition. That is a factual statement, but obviously attorneys have to parse the language and determine all that,” he told reporters.
    


            When it came to choosing between his party and the Constitution, it was an easy choice for Dick Cheney, his daughter and former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney said.
    


                    “For him, a choice between defense of the Constitution and defense of your political party was no choice at all,” she said.
                





            Liz Cheney said her father was “inspired to service” by a speech from former President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat, despite him joining the Republican Party.
    


            “He knew that bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she added.
    


            Liz Cheney closed her eulogy by recalling her father's final words after a night in which she said the skies above her parents' house “filled with clouds in the shape of winged angels.”
    


            “As my dad left this earth, his last words were to tell my mother he loved her,” she said.
    


            “And now all of us who loved him so dearly, say to him: Good night, sweet Dad. May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest,” Cheney added, referencing the line from Shakespeare's “Hamlet.”
    


            Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman and one of Dick Cheney's daughters, recalled that her father attributed the path he'd traveled to being “born an American — a blessing, surely, among life's greatest.”
    


            “My dad thought deeply about what this blessing meant, about the duties it imposed,” she said.
    


            She recalled visiting Civil War battlefields with her family when she was young, saying her father “read every word of every sign” at every stop they made. Liz and her sister, Mary Cheney, then young children, “moaned and groaned.”
    


            “My dad's devotion to America was deep and substantive. He spent his life studying the history of our great republic. He knew you couldn't truly appreciate what it means to live in freedom if you didn't understand the sacrifices of the generations who came before. And he made sure that his children and grandchildren understood this, too,” she said.
    


            From driving to rodeos to cooking Christmas dinner, Dick Cheney's grandchildren remembered the little moments of life with their grandfather.
    


            Elizabeth Perry talked about when Cheney drove her to her first day of college. He spent the drive giving her advice as she was set to start her freshman year and reminisced on the times he drove his own kids to university.
    


            “I will forever see him that way. Driving along an open road and telling me stories about his life while talking about the family that he loved so dearly,” she said.
    


            Richard Perry said one thing he and his grandfather both had in common was that they played high school football. He said Cheney kept the schedule of his games on his desk.
    


            “Every Christmas, Grandpa would cook our dinner while we hung out in the kitchen watching his favorite John Wayne movies, year after year,” he said.
    


            But above all, Richard Perry said he remembered the way his grandfather would look at him. He didn't have to say anything, but “you could just feel his love.”
    


                    “He always told us how proud he was of us, and we will always try to follow his example. To be people driven to love our families, to be respectful and to live through the lessons he taught us. To put love and our families first,” Richard Perry said.
                





            Grace Perry shared her own memories and lessons she learned from Cheney. When she did rodeo, she said her grandfather drove her and her horses across the state.
    


            “My grandpa had a love for the land, a love for his country, and a love for Wyoming. Any day of the week, any hour of the day, he was there to help,” Grace Perry said.
    


            Attendees at former Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral include the current and former top-ranking Senate Republicans: John Thune of South Dakota and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
    


            The attendees of Cheney's funeral in many ways represent the old guard of the GOP, including former presidents and vice presidents who aren't aligned with the shift of the party under President Donald Trump. Trump and Vice President JD Vance were not invited.
    


            McConnell has become a fierce Trump critic and is retiring from the Senate.
    


            Former President George W. Bush called Dick Cheney, a “true man of the West, ” as he described his former vice president's demeanor on the campaign trail.
    


            “If any voters came looking for a kind word and a hug, they'd have to settle for the kind word,” Bush joked.
    


                    But, he added: “You can't question the appeal of the only person from America's Mountain West elected to national office.”
                





            Bush said Cheney offered to step aside in 2004 to allow Bush to choose a different running mate in his bid for reelection. But, he said, he “arrived back at the conclusion that they do not come any better than Dick Cheney.”
    


            “He lifted the standards of those around him just by being who he was,” Bush said. He said Cheney was an “old breed of public servant, defined by their substance and character.”
    


            “You did not know Dick Cheney unless you understood his greatest concerns and his ambitions were for his country,” Bush said. “Across 40 years, his service was consistent, faithful and noble.”
    


            As Dick Cheney's funeral is underway at the Washington National Cathedral, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are reacting to President Donald Trump calling six congressional Democrats “traitors” over a video they posted urging troops to disobey illegal orders.
    


            Republican Sen. Rand Paul warned the president against using violent rhetoric, saying he doesn't “think it's a really a good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.”
    


                    “I think we have political disagreements, and we need to work them out in the political run,” Paul told reporters.
                





            Trump said Sens. Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin, and Reps. Jason Crow, Chrissy Houlihan, Maggie Goodlander and Chris Deluzio — all of whom are former military or intelligence officers — should be arrested and put on trial, adding the video was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”
    


            The Republican senator added that people who are “not stable” could see this kind of rhetoric and attack those Democrats.
    


            “I think we should be careful about rhetoric, as far as saying people are traitors, Marjorie Taylor Greene, things like that. That kind of rhetoric isn't good. It stirs up people among us who may not be stable, who may think, ‘Well, traitors, what do we do with traitors? That's the death penalty. Maybe I'll just take matters into my own hands,' which is not something we should be encouraging,” said Paul.
    


            “So I have a lot of disagreement with Democrats, but I try to keep it on the civil, civil level, and try not to call any of them traitors or anything like that, because I think that is something that could incite some people among us who aren't stable to commit violence.”
    


            While searching for a running mate, former President George W. Bush enlisted the help of a trusted source to lead the effort: Dick Cheney.
    


            “Dick Cheney and I went through the files name by name. We talked over the various qualities I was looking for in a vice president: preparedness, mature judgment, rectitude and loyalty. Above all, I wanted someone with the ability to step into the presidency without getting distracted by the ambition to seek it,” Bush said.
    


                    “After weeks of these meetings, I began to have a thought I could not shake. I realized the best choice for the vice president was the man sitting right in front of me,” he said.
                





            Pete Wiliams, who worked closely with former Vice President Dick Cheney, talked about his humility and character as a leader during his decades of public service.
    


            Williams, the press secretary for Cheney when he was defense secretary, told a story about when then-President George H. W. Bush was trying to reach a nuclear weapons agreement with the Soviet Union.
    


            A new negotiation strategy Bush planned to announce in a speech was leaked early, Williams said, prompting Cheney to call him and another official to his office.
    


            “He looked at us sternly and he said, ‘The bad news is that the president of the United States is very angry with you both,' and then I asked for the good news, and he said, ‘I only have to fire one of you.'” Williams said. “I could tell he was joking. I'm not sure the senior official realized it.”
    


            “Then Secretary Cheney said, ‘It's okay guys, I told the president it was my idea.' He could have told President Bush that it was our fault, but he took the blame and saved us from ourselves,” Williams said.
    


            This story was just one example of how Cheney “demonstrated that kind of decency and concern for all the people who served him during his more than 40 years in public life.”
    


            Williams also talked about Cheney's love of fly fishing and the outdoors.
    


            Former President George W. Bush, who is eulogizing his former vice president, Dick Cheney, joked that he discovered in 2000 that “when you choose one Cheney, you get four.”
    


            Bush started his speech at Cheney's funeral by acknowledging his wife and two daughters.
    


            “In a family so close, you dread the day when the circle is broken,” he said. “He sure loved you all, and he was proud of his family.”
    


            Dr. Jonathan Reiner, Dick Cheney's cardiologist for 27 years, described the late former vice president as the model patient as he recounted Cheney's lifelong battle with heart disease, starting with a heart attack at age 37, during his first run for Congress.
    


            He prompted laughter from the crowd when he drew an implicit comparison to the opaque statements issued by President Donald Trump's doctors. Trump is not in attendance, having not been invited to the funeral.
    


            “He never allowed politics to influence his personal health care decisions, and not once in all my time as his doctor did he try to to write or change a single word of a statement I issued,” Reiner said.
    


            Reiner said that “in moments of true existential risk for him, the vice president was always the calmest person in the room — including me.”
    


            “He lived most of his adult life with a relentless disease intent on killing him, but he never looked over his shoulder — he only looked ahead,” he said.
    


            Previous vice presidents and lawmakers of both parties have gathered inside the Washington National Cathedral for Dick Cheney's funeral.
    


            Just moments ago, Cheney's casket was brought inside. The clergy met it on the steps of the cathedral where they said a prayer.
    


            In the cathedral, former President Joe Biden and former first lady Jill Biden are seated next to former Vice President Kamala Harris. Former Vice President Mike Pence is also in the front row.
    


            Former President George W. Bush, who is expected to give the eulogy, and his wife Laura Bush are seated next to the Bidens. Joe Biden and Laura Bush were seen having a long conversation.
    


            Lawmakers such as the Republican former Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, and the Democratic former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, are also in attendance.
    


            Meanwhile in New York City, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is previewing his Friday meeting in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump.
    


            He said at a press conference that their meeting was an “opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers.” Mamdani was questioned repeatedly about how he would approach Trump, who has used a series of Oval Office meetings this year to provide dressing-downs of foreign heads of state, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, an episode Mamdani was asked about.
    


            “I'll stand up for New Yorkers, every single day,” Mamdani responded.
    


            “I think being a New Yorker means that you're prepared for all situations, all kind of comments, all kind of commentary. And at the end of it, the focus has to be, what's the case that you are making? Why are you there?,” Mamdani added. “For me, it's not about myself, it's not about a relationship with an individual. It's about a relationship between New York City and the White House.”
    


            Mamdani also emphasized that the affordability agenda at the center of his mayoral campaign would be the focus of his conversation with the president.
    


            “I view this meeting as an opportunity for me to make my case. And I'll make that case to anyone, frankly, as we've been doing over the course of the campaign, and now as I will be the next mayor of this city, it behooves me to ensure that I leave no stone unturned in looking to make this city more affordable,” Mamdani said.
    


            Vice President JD Vance on Thursday offered condolences to the family of former Vice President Dick Cheney, praising his predecessor's public service while acknowledging his “disagreements” with President Donald Trump.
    


            “My condolences go to Dick Cheney and his family,” Vance said during an appearance at a Breitbart News event. “Obviously there were some political disagreements there, but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.”
    


            Neither Vance nor Trump were invited to Cheney's memorial service on Wednesday, where a slew of former presidents and vice presidents were expected to attend.
    


            Cheney emerged as a sharp critic of Trump following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. His daughter, former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, also clashed repeatedly with Trump, serving as a chief supporter in Congress of Trump's impeachment over the riot at the Capitol.
    


            Both Cheney and Pence had high-profile breaks with President Donald Trump. Pence's came in the wake of his refusal to attempt to reject electoral college votes on January 6, 2020; he later ran against Trump for the 2024 GOP nomination. Cheney in 2024 endorsed the Democratic nominee, former Vice President Kamala Harris, as he warned that Trump was a threat to the republic.
    


            Pence would not directly address whether Cheney's warnings have come true.
    


            “I would never begrudge the late vice president his opinions or political judgment,” he said. “But at the end of the day, I think his lifetime is evidence of the fact of, really, the strength of this nation. And in a very real sense, as we go forward, I think people will continue to be inspired by his devotion to our military, his devotion to our national defense, and a lifetime of service — and that's where we should focus today.”
    


            Former Vice President Mike Pence says Cheney called him after the 2016 presidential election and shared two pieces of “sage advice.”
    


            First, Pence told CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Cheney said he received the president's daily brief, first thing in the morning, at the vice president's residence, before attending as the president received the same classified intelligence report.
    


            “It was a way that he said, ‘You will be better equipped to be able to advise the president if you know in advance what's coming and can run that through the filter of the president's priorities,'” Pence told Zeleny before Cheney's funeral.
    


            Cheney also advised Pence to “spend a lot of time on Capitol Hill” — which both vice presidents, who were members of the House and held the same Republican leadership post, made a regular practice.
    


            “He was the one that said to me, ‘Don't just go to Capitol Hill when the administration is looking for something; looking for a vote. But go on a regular basis,” Pence said. He said he regularly attended Senate lunches.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Washington National Cathedral on Thursday hosted a bipartisan show of respect and remembrance for Dick Cheney, the consequential and polarizing vice president who in later years became an acidic scold of fellow Republican President Donald Trump.

Trump, who has been publicly silent about Cheney's death Nov. 3, was not invited to the memorial service.

Two ex-presidents came: Republican George W. Bush, who eulogized the man who served him as vice president, and Democrat Joe Biden, who once called Cheney “the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American history” but now honors his commitment to his family and to his values.

“Solid and rare and reliable,” Bush said of his vice president, praising a man whose “talent and his restraint” exceeded his ego. “Smart and polished, without airs.”

Among the eulogists, Liz Cheney, his eldest daughter, only obliquely addressed what amounted to a father-daughter feud with the president — a man her dad had called a “coward” for trying to overturn his loss in the 2020 election.

She spoke of her father's conviction that when confronted with a choice between defending the country and a political party, the country must come first. “Bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she said.

A former high-ranking House member whose Republican political career was shredded by Trump's MAGA movement, Liz Cheney chose not to speak directly of Trump. She spoke of seeing clouds in the shape of angels just before her father died.

Moments before the service began, figures of recent but now receded power mingled: Bush and Biden and their wives sitting in a row together, former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris and Mike Pence chatting side by side in their pew with Al Gore and Dan Quayle together behind them. 

Biden greeted Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former longtime Senate leader, and his wife, former labor and transportation secretary Elaine Chao. Behind them sat Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker. All gathered in the grand cathedral known as “a spiritual home for the nation.”

Others delivering tributes at Thursday's funeral were Cheney's longtime cardiologist, Jonathan Reiner; former NBC News correspondent Pete Williams, who was Cheney's spokesman at the Pentagon; and the former vice president's grandchildren. Six grandchildren were there — a seventh is about to give birth.

“I'm happy to report that I haven't given many eulogies,” Reiner said in his remarks. “Nobody wants a doctor who is great at funerals.” 

Reiner recalled doctors telling Cheney decades ago, after the first of multiple heart attacks, that he should abandon his political ambitions then. Yet he kept winning elections as a Wyoming congressman for years after that.

Cheney, he said, was always the “calmest person in the room.”

Cheney had lived with heart disease for decades and, after the Bush administration, with a heart transplant. He died at age 84 from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said.

Trump's vice president, JD Vance, on stage at another event in the morning, was asked about Cheney and said: “Obviously there's some political disagreements there but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.”

Vance was also not invited to the funeral, according to a person familiar with the details who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The White House lowered its flags to half-staff after Cheney's death, as it said the law calls for, but Trump did not issue the presidential proclamation that often accompanies the death of notable figures, nor has he commented publicly on his passing.

The deeply conservative Cheney's influence in the Bush administration was legendary and, to his critics, tragic.

He advocated for the U.S. invasion of Iraq on the basis of what proved to be faulty intelligence and consistently defended the extraordinary tools of surveillance, detention and inquisition employed in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Bush credited him with helping to keep the country safe and stable in a perilous time.

After the 2020 election won by Biden, Liz Cheney served as vice chair of the Democratic-led special House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. She accused Trump of summoning the violent mob and plunging the nation into “a moment of maximum danger.”

For that, she was stripped of her Republican leadership position and ultimately defeated in a 2022 Republican primary in Wyoming. In a campaign TV ad made for his daughter, Dick Cheney branded Trump a “coward” who “tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.”

Last year, it did not sit well with Trump when Cheney said he would vote for the Democrat, Harris, in the presidential election.

Trump told Arab and Muslim voters that Dick Cheney's support for Harris should give them pause, because he “killed more Arabs than any human being on Earth. He pushed Bush, and they went into the Middle East.”

            Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and some of his agents have left Charlotte, North Carolina, according to a Homeland Security official.
    


            The departure is likely a relief to the city, which saw businesses close, children kept out of school, hundreds arrested, and many living in fear during “Operation Charlotte's Web,” which lasted nearly a week.
    


            Immigration enforcement will continue in the area, similar to what happened in Chicago after Bovino and his team departed, other law enforcement officials told CNN.
    


            Bovino and his agents are expected to launch an operation in New Orleans after the Thanksgiving holiday.
    


            Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden issued a statement Thursday saying federal officials confirmed to him that the Customs and Border Protection operation in Charlotte is over.
    


            As a result, the statement said, there will be no CBP operations in Charlotte on Thursday.
    


            “We will continue to build relationships, mend bridges, and listen to the voices of everyone in our community,” McFadden said. “As we move forward, I want the city of Charlotte to know, I will keep fighting for clarity, accountability, and trust. I will continue to protect this city and every single one of its citizens.”
    


            McFadden noted that while the CBP operation known as “Charlotte's Web” has ended, ICE will continue its own enforcement efforts.

President Donald Trump on Thursday accused half a dozen Democratic lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” after the lawmakers — all veterans of the armed services and intelligence community — called on U.S. military members to uphold the Constitution and defy “illegal orders.”

The 90-second video was first posted early Tuesday from Sen. Elissa Slotkin's X account. In it, the six lawmakers — Slotkin, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan — speak directly to U.S. service members, whom Slotkin acknowledges are “under enormous stress and pressure right now.” 

“The American people need you to stand up for our laws and our Constitution,” Slotkin wrote in the X post. 

Trump on Thursday reposted messages from others about the video, amplifying it with his own words. It marked another flashpoint in the political rhetoric that at times has been thematic in his administrations, as well as among some in his MAGA base. Some Democrats accused him of acting like a king and trying to distract from soon-to-be-released files about disgraced financier and sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein.

With pieces of dialogue spliced together from different members, the lawmakers introduce themselves and their background. They go on to say the Trump administration “is pitting our uniformed military against American citizens. They call for service members to “refuse illegal orders” and “stand up for our laws.”

The lawmakers conclude the video by encouraging service members, “Don't give up the ship,” a War of 1812-era phrase attributed to a U.S. Navy captain's dying command to his crew.

Although the lawmakers didn't mention specific circumstances in the video, its release comes as the Trump administration continues attempts at deployment of National Guard troops into U.S. cities for various roles, although some have been pulled back, and others held up in court.

Troops, especially uniformed commanders, have a specific obligation to reject an order that's unlawful, if they make that determination.

However, while commanders have military lawyers on their staffs to consult with in helping make such a determination, rank-and-file troops who are tasked with carrying out those orders are rarely in a similar position.

Broad legal precedence holds that just following orders, colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defense” as it was used unsuccessfully by senior Nazi officials to justify their actions under Adolf Hitler, doesn't absolve troops.

However, the U.S. military legal code, known as the Uniform Code of Military Justice or UCMJ, will punish troops for failing to follow an order should it turn out to be lawful. Troops can be criminally charged with Article 90 of the UCMJ, willfully disobeying a superior commissioned officer, and Article 92, failure to obey an order.

On Thursday, Trump reposted to social media an article about the video, adding his own commentary that it was “really bad, and Dangerous to our Country.”

“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!!” Trump went on. “LOCK THEM UP???” He also called for the lawmakers' arrest and trial, adding in a separate post that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.” 

Democrats were swift to react to Trump's words, with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warning in a floor speech that the president was “lighting a match in a country soaked with political gasoline.”

Speaker Mike Johnson said he did not believe Trump was calling for violence in the social media posts, saying Trump was merely “defining a crime,” and calling the Democrats' video “wildly inappropriate.”

“Think of the threat that is to our national security and what it means for our institution,” Johnson added.

Trump's allies balked at the video. Wednesday on Fox News, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called the messaging “insurrection — plainly, directly, without question” and said it represented “a general call for rebellion from the CIA and the armed services of the United States, by Democrat lawmakers.”

On X, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth commented on the video Tuesday as “Stage 4 TDS,” referring to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a term used by Trump to describe voters so angry and opposed to him that they are incapable of seeing any good in what he does.

The Steady State, which describes itself as “a network of 300+ national and homeland security experts standing for strong and principled policy, rule of law, and democracy,” wrote in a Substack post on Thursday that the lawmakers' call was “only a restatement of what every officer and enlisted servicemember already knows: illegal orders can and should be refused. This is not a political opinion. It is doctrine.”

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell challenged the theory that illegal orders were being issued.

“Our military follows orders, and our civilians give legal orders,” Parnell told The Associated Press on Thursday. “We love the Constitution. These politicians are out of their minds.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Big swings keep rocking Wall Street, and U.S. stocks erased a huge morning gain on Thursday as skittishness continues to dominate the market following weeks of doubts and erratic moves. 

The S&P 500 dropped to a loss of 0.7% after initially soaring 1.9%, which would have marked its best day since May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 231 points, or 0.5%, as of 12:15 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1% lower. 

The sharpest losses came again from what used to be the market's biggest winners. Technology stocks, cryptocurrencies and other areas of the market that had been soaring with nearly relentless momentum, as traders feared missing out on more gains, dropped. Bitcoin fell below $87,000, down from nearly $125,000 last month, for example.

The market had been shaky coming into Thursday, largely because of twin worries: Nvidia and other superstar stocks caught up in the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology may have simply shot too high, and the Federal Reserve may be done delivering the invigorating cuts to interest rates that Wall Street loves. 

Nvidia initially appeared to tamp down the worries about a potential bubble for AI stocks after reporting another big profit for the summer that topped analysts' expectations, along with a forecast for coming revenue that easily cleared analysts' estimates. By delivering big profits and indicating more are coming, Nvidia can justify its stock's price gains and make it look less expensive.

Given the forecasts that Nvidia gave late Wednesday, “it is very hard to see how this stock does not keep moving higher from here,” according to analysts at UBS led by Timothy Arcuri. They also said “the AI infrastructure tide is still rising so fast that all boats will be lifted.” 




Nvidia jumped to an early gain of 5% but then dropped to a loss of 1.5%, sending it again 10% below its record. Because it's the biggest company in the U.S. market by value, Nvidia's stock has more pull on the S&P 500 than any other company's. 

Worries about a potential AI bubble aren't gone. The concern among investors is that all the dollars pouring into AI chips and data centers may not ultimately produce the big profits and productivity for the economy that proponents have been promising. 

Yes, Nvidia expects to sell another $65 billion of chips in the coming three months, which is more than analysts expected. But will all those chips turn into much bigger profits for Amazon and other companies using them? They still need to prove that all the investment in AI chips are worth the cost. 

The most recent survey of global fund managers by Bank of America showed a record percentage of investors saying companies are “overinvesting.” That helped make a potential AI bubble the No. 1 risk that they saw for the market, one with a lower probability of happening but a chance of very big damage. 

Amazon went from an early gain of 2.1% Thursday to a loss of 1.3%. Palantir Technologies swung from a jump of 5.5% to a loss of 4.3%. 

For the second worry that's been dogging Wall Street, Thursday's jobs report from the U.S. government offered some relief. 

Financial markets initially seemed to pick the data apart for encouraging signals, according to Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. The report showed hiring by U.S. employers was stronger in September than economists expected, which may suggest the economy remains solid. But it also said the unemployment rate worsened slightly, which could give the Fed reason to cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in December.

Traders still see a December rate cut as relatively unlikely, giving it a roughly 40% probability, according to data from CME Group. But that's better than the 30% chance they saw a day earlier, before the September jobs report.

What the Fed does is critical for the stock market because prices ran to records in part because of expectations for continued cuts to rates. The Fed has already cut rates twice this year to shore up the slowing job market. But lower rates can also worsen inflation, which has stubbornly remained  above the Fed's 2% target. 

On the winning side of Wall Street was Walmart, which rallied 5.8% after the retailer delivered another standout quarter. It reported strong sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations as it continues to lure cash-strapped Americans nervous about the economy and prices.

In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.08% from 4.13% late Wednesday. 

In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. 

Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 2.6%, and South Korea's Kospi rose 1.9% for two of the bigger gains.

            • Cheney's funeral: Political leaders from both sides of the aisle gathered to pay respects to former Vice President Dick Cheney at the Washington National Cathedral. During the service, his daughter and former Rep. Liz Cheney said he chose to defend the Constitution over political partisanship. Neither President Donald Trump nor Vice President JD Vance were invited, according to a source.
    


            • Epstein files: Trump signed the bill last night that directs the Department of Justice to publicly release all of its Jeffrey Epstein-related files after a stunning reversal in his position. The Justice Department now has 30 days to release the documents.
    


• Uncertainty remains: Attorney General Pam Bondi said yesterday the DOJ will “follow the law,” but some lawmakers and analysts worry the Trump administration may try to hinder the process by slowing the release or redacting information. Read more about the fine print in the legislation. 



            As Dick Cheney's funeral service comes to a close, elsewhere in DC, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended President Donald Trump's call for the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials in a video to disobey illegal orders.
    


                    “I know the DOJ and the Pentagon are looking into the legality of all that, but what I can address is what everybody knows. That was wildly inappropriate. It is very dangerous. You have leading members of Congress telling troops to disobey orders. I think that's unprecedented in American history,” Johnson said. 
                





            The speaker noted his son attends the Naval Academy, and said, “I know young soldiers, airmen, sailors. They don't need that kind of nonsense from people in Congress. It is very dangerous.”
    


            Pressed on Trump saying the Democrats' actions should be punishable by death, the speaker said, “I'm gonna let others define what it is, but it's wildly inappropriate.”
    


            Johnson a bit later expanded on his thoughts, saying he took Trump's suggestion to be the president simply explaining sedition.
    


            “What I read was he was defining the crime of sedition. That is a factual statement, but obviously attorneys have to parse the language and determine all that,” he told reporters.
    


            When it came to choosing between his party and the Constitution, it was an easy choice for Dick Cheney, his daughter and former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney said.
    


                    “For him, a choice between defense of the Constitution and defense of your political party was no choice at all,” she said.
                





            Liz Cheney said her father was “inspired to service” by a speech from former President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat, despite him joining the Republican Party.
    


            “He knew that bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she added.
    


            Liz Cheney closed her eulogy by recalling her father's final words after a night in which she said the skies above her parents' house “filled with clouds in the shape of winged angels.”
    


            “As my dad left this earth, his last words were to tell my mother he loved her,” she said.
    


            “And now all of us who loved him so dearly, say to him: Good night, sweet Dad. May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest,” Cheney added, referencing the line from Shakespeare's “Hamlet.”
    


            Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman and one of Dick Cheney's daughters, recalled that her father attributed the path he'd traveled to being “born an American — a blessing, surely, among life's greatest.”
    


            “My dad thought deeply about what this blessing meant, about the duties it imposed,” she said.
    


            She recalled visiting Civil War battlefields with her family when she was young, saying her father “read every word of every sign” at every stop they made. Liz and her sister, Mary Cheney, then young children, “moaned and groaned.”
    


            “My dad's devotion to America was deep and substantive. He spent his life studying the history of our great republic. He knew you couldn't truly appreciate what it means to live in freedom if you didn't understand the sacrifices of the generations who came before. And he made sure that his children and grandchildren understood this, too,” she said.
    


            From driving to rodeos to cooking Christmas dinner, Dick Cheney's grandchildren remembered the little moments of life with their grandfather.
    


            Elizabeth Perry talked about when Cheney drove her to her first day of college. He spent the drive giving her advice as she was set to start her freshman year and reminisced on the times he drove his own kids to university.
    


            “I will forever see him that way. Driving along an open road and telling me stories about his life while talking about the family that he loved so dearly,” she said.
    


            Richard Perry said one thing he and his grandfather both had in common was that they played high school football. He said Cheney kept the schedule of his games on his desk.
    


            “Every Christmas, Grandpa would cook our dinner while we hung out in the kitchen watching his favorite John Wayne movies, year after year,” he said.
    


            But above all, Richard Perry said he remembered the way his grandfather would look at him. He didn't have to say anything, but “you could just feel his love.”
    


                    “He always told us how proud he was of us, and we will always try to follow his example. To be people driven to love our families, to be respectful and to live through the lessons he taught us. To put love and our families first,” Richard Perry said.
                





            Grace Perry shared her own memories and lessons she learned from Cheney. When she did rodeo, she said her grandfather drove her and her horses across the state.
    


            “My grandpa had a love for the land, a love for his country, and a love for Wyoming. Any day of the week, any hour of the day, he was there to help,” Grace Perry said.
    


            Attendees at former Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral include the current and former top-ranking Senate Republicans: John Thune of South Dakota and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
    


            The attendees of Cheney's funeral in many ways represent the old guard of the GOP, including former presidents and vice presidents who aren't aligned with the shift of the party under President Donald Trump. Trump and Vice President JD Vance were not invited.
    


            McConnell has become a fierce Trump critic and is retiring from the Senate.
    


            Former President George W. Bush called Dick Cheney, a “true man of the West, ” as he described his former vice president's demeanor on the campaign trail.
    


            “If any voters came looking for a kind word and a hug, they'd have to settle for the kind word,” Bush joked.
    


                    But, he added: “You can't question the appeal of the only person from America's Mountain West elected to national office.”
                





            Bush said Cheney offered to step aside in 2004 to allow Bush to choose a different running mate in his bid for reelection. But, he said, he “arrived back at the conclusion that they do not come any better than Dick Cheney.”
    


            “He lifted the standards of those around him just by being who he was,” Bush said. He said Cheney was an “old breed of public servant, defined by their substance and character.”
    


            “You did not know Dick Cheney unless you understood his greatest concerns and his ambitions were for his country,” Bush said. “Across 40 years, his service was consistent, faithful and noble.”
    


            As Dick Cheney's funeral is underway at the Washington National Cathedral, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are reacting to President Donald Trump calling six congressional Democrats “traitors” over a video they posted urging troops to disobey illegal orders.
    


            Republican Sen. Rand Paul warned the president against using violent rhetoric, saying he doesn't “think it's a really a good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.”
    


                    “I think we have political disagreements, and we need to work them out in the political run,” Paul told reporters.
                





            Trump said Sens. Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin, and Reps. Jason Crow, Chrissy Houlihan, Maggie Goodlander and Chris Deluzio — all of whom are former military or intelligence officers — should be arrested and put on trial, adding the video was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”
    


            The Republican senator added that people who are “not stable” could see this kind of rhetoric and attack those Democrats.
    


            “I think we should be careful about rhetoric, as far as saying people are traitors, Marjorie Taylor Greene, things like that. That kind of rhetoric isn't good. It stirs up people among us who may not be stable, who may think, ‘Well, traitors, what do we do with traitors? That's the death penalty. Maybe I'll just take matters into my own hands,' which is not something we should be encouraging,” said Paul.
    


            “So I have a lot of disagreement with Democrats, but I try to keep it on the civil, civil level, and try not to call any of them traitors or anything like that, because I think that is something that could incite some people among us who aren't stable to commit violence.”
    


            While searching for a running mate, former President George W. Bush enlisted the help of a trusted source to lead the effort: Dick Cheney.
    


            “Dick Cheney and I went through the files name by name. We talked over the various qualities I was looking for in a vice president: preparedness, mature judgment, rectitude and loyalty. Above all, I wanted someone with the ability to step into the presidency without getting distracted by the ambition to seek it,” Bush said.
    


                    “After weeks of these meetings, I began to have a thought I could not shake. I realized the best choice for the vice president was the man sitting right in front of me,” he said.
                





            Pete Wiliams, who worked closely with former Vice President Dick Cheney, talked about his humility and character as a leader during his decades of public service.
    


            Williams, the press secretary for Cheney when he was defense secretary, told a story about when then-President George H. W. Bush was trying to reach a nuclear weapons agreement with the Soviet Union.
    


            A new negotiation strategy Bush planned to announce in a speech was leaked early, Williams said, prompting Cheney to call him and another official to his office.
    


            “He looked at us sternly and he said, ‘The bad news is that the president of the United States is very angry with you both,' and then I asked for the good news, and he said, ‘I only have to fire one of you.'” Williams said. “I could tell he was joking. I'm not sure the senior official realized it.”
    


            “Then Secretary Cheney said, ‘It's okay guys, I told the president it was my idea.' He could have told President Bush that it was our fault, but he took the blame and saved us from ourselves,” Williams said.
    


            This story was just one example of how Cheney “demonstrated that kind of decency and concern for all the people who served him during his more than 40 years in public life.”
    


            Williams also talked about Cheney's love of fly fishing and the outdoors.
    


            Former President George W. Bush, who is eulogizing his former vice president, Dick Cheney, joked that he discovered in 2000 that “when you choose one Cheney, you get four.”
    


            Bush started his speech at Cheney's funeral by acknowledging his wife and two daughters.
    


            “In a family so close, you dread the day when the circle is broken,” he said. “He sure loved you all, and he was proud of his family.”
    


            Dr. Jonathan Reiner, Dick Cheney's cardiologist for 27 years, described the late former vice president as the model patient as he recounted Cheney's lifelong battle with heart disease, starting with a heart attack at age 37, during his first run for Congress.
    


            He prompted laughter from the crowd when he drew an implicit comparison to the opaque statements issued by President Donald Trump's doctors. Trump is not in attendance, having not been invited to the funeral.
    


            “He never allowed politics to influence his personal health care decisions, and not once in all my time as his doctor did he try to to write or change a single word of a statement I issued,” Reiner said.
    


            Reiner said that “in moments of true existential risk for him, the vice president was always the calmest person in the room — including me.”
    


            “He lived most of his adult life with a relentless disease intent on killing him, but he never looked over his shoulder — he only looked ahead,” he said.
    


            Previous vice presidents and lawmakers of both parties have gathered inside the Washington National Cathedral for Dick Cheney's funeral.
    


            Just moments ago, Cheney's casket was brought inside. The clergy met it on the steps of the cathedral where they said a prayer.
    


            In the cathedral, former President Joe Biden and former first lady Jill Biden are seated next to former Vice President Kamala Harris. Former Vice President Mike Pence is also in the front row.
    


            Former President George W. Bush, who is expected to give the eulogy, and his wife Laura Bush are seated next to the Bidens. Joe Biden and Laura Bush were seen having a long conversation.
    


            Lawmakers such as the Republican former Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, and the Democratic former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, are also in attendance.
    


            Meanwhile in New York City, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is previewing his Friday meeting in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump.
    


            He said at a press conference that their meeting was an “opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers.” Mamdani was questioned repeatedly about how he would approach Trump, who has used a series of Oval Office meetings this year to provide dressing-downs of foreign heads of state, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, an episode Mamdani was asked about.
    


            “I'll stand up for New Yorkers, every single day,” Mamdani responded.
    


            “I think being a New Yorker means that you're prepared for all situations, all kind of comments, all kind of commentary. And at the end of it, the focus has to be, what's the case that you are making? Why are you there?,” Mamdani added. “For me, it's not about myself, it's not about a relationship with an individual. It's about a relationship between New York City and the White House.”
    


            Mamdani also emphasized that the affordability agenda at the center of his mayoral campaign would be the focus of his conversation with the president.
    


            “I view this meeting as an opportunity for me to make my case. And I'll make that case to anyone, frankly, as we've been doing over the course of the campaign, and now as I will be the next mayor of this city, it behooves me to ensure that I leave no stone unturned in looking to make this city more affordable,” Mamdani said.
    


            Vice President JD Vance on Thursday offered condolences to the family of former Vice President Dick Cheney, praising his predecessor's public service while acknowledging his “disagreements” with President Donald Trump.
    


            “My condolences go to Dick Cheney and his family,” Vance said during an appearance at a Breitbart News event. “Obviously there were some political disagreements there, but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.”
    


            Neither Vance nor Trump were invited to Cheney's memorial service on Wednesday, where a slew of former presidents and vice presidents were expected to attend.
    


            Cheney emerged as a sharp critic of Trump following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. His daughter, former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, also clashed repeatedly with Trump, serving as a chief supporter in Congress of Trump's impeachment over the riot at the Capitol.
    


            Both Cheney and Pence had high-profile breaks with President Donald Trump. Pence's came in the wake of his refusal to attempt to reject electoral college votes on January 6, 2020; he later ran against Trump for the 2024 GOP nomination. Cheney in 2024 endorsed the Democratic nominee, former Vice President Kamala Harris, as he warned that Trump was a threat to the republic.
    


            Pence would not directly address whether Cheney's warnings have come true.
    


            “I would never begrudge the late vice president his opinions or political judgment,” he said. “But at the end of the day, I think his lifetime is evidence of the fact of, really, the strength of this nation. And in a very real sense, as we go forward, I think people will continue to be inspired by his devotion to our military, his devotion to our national defense, and a lifetime of service — and that's where we should focus today.”
    


            Former Vice President Mike Pence says Cheney called him after the 2016 presidential election and shared two pieces of “sage advice.”
    


            First, Pence told CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Cheney said he received the president's daily brief, first thing in the morning, at the vice president's residence, before attending as the president received the same classified intelligence report.
    


            “It was a way that he said, ‘You will be better equipped to be able to advise the president if you know in advance what's coming and can run that through the filter of the president's priorities,'” Pence told Zeleny before Cheney's funeral.
    


            Cheney also advised Pence to “spend a lot of time on Capitol Hill” — which both vice presidents, who were members of the House and held the same Republican leadership post, made a regular practice.
    


            “He was the one that said to me, ‘Don't just go to Capitol Hill when the administration is looking for something; looking for a vote. But go on a regular basis,” Pence said. He said he regularly attended Senate lunches.
    


            Neither President Donald Trump nor Vice President JD Vance were invited to former Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            Cheney will receive full military honors at the memorial service, which is expected to be a bipartisan who's who of Washington dignitaries.
    


            More than 1,000 guests are expected at Cheney's invitation-only funeral this morning at Washington's National Cathedral — including all four living former vice presidents and two former presidents.
    


Who's going: Former presidents George W. Bush and Joe Biden will pay their respects, along with former vice presidents Kamala Harris, Mike Pence, Al Gore and Dan Quayle. There are also expected to be a number of Supreme Court justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Elena Kagan. A large number of past and present Cabinet members from both Republican and Democratic administrations will also attend, as well as congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle.
    


            Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi is expected to attend, along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and former leader Mitch McConnell.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


Some context: While official Washington funerals usually include invites to the White House, excluding Trump should not be a surprise. Trump has not publicly expressed his condolences or commented on Cheney's death.
    


            Both Cheney and his daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney, have been fierce critics of Trump since the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, and Trump's attempts to get his supporters to stop the peaceful transfer of power.
    


            President Donald Trump on Thursday called for the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials to disobey illegal orders that might be issued by the administration, calling it “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”
    


            “It's called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
    


            He was referring to half a dozen members of Congress who previously served in the military or intelligence community who posted a video on X earlier this week urging the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”
    


            “Their words cannot be allowed to stand - We won't have a Country anymore!!! An example MUST BE SET,” Trump wrote, going on to add in a subsequent Truth Social post, “LOCK THEM UP???”
    


            He added “punishable by DEATH!” in yet another post later Thursday morning, after reposting another user's post that read: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House.
    


            In the video, the lawmakers said, “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law, or our Constitution,” adding, “Know that we have your back… don't give up the ship.” The lawmakers don't specify which orders service members have received, or might receive, that could be illegal.
    


            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Wednesday that the Justice Department will be taking a “very close look” at these lawmakers' actions, calling it a “disgusting and inappropriate display of supposed leadership from the Democrat party.”
    


This post has been updated with additional Truth Social posts. 



            Waking up to the news that President Donald Trump signed a bill to release the full Department of Justice case files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a survivor of Epstein's abuse told CNN she felt mixed emotions.
    


                    “It feels incredible; it feels like surreal,” Haley Robson said to CNN's John Berman. “But, you know, of course there's a part of me that wants to be full-on happy, but … I do have reservations because, you know, he's become very unpredictable, especially with the Epstein files,” she said, referring to Trump.
                





            Robson said Trump's back-and-forth about supporting the release of the records makes her feel “a little skeptical,” but ultimately she is happy the president “did the right thing.”
    


            In his Truth Social post announcing he signed the bill, Trump said, “This latest Hoax will backfire on the Democrats just as all of the rest have!”
    


            “I think it's appalling that he keeps referring to all this as a hoax when him and I both know this is not a hoax,” Robson said.
    


            Looking ahead, senators from both parties said the Justice Department has 30 days to comply with the law and release the full files. Robson said she expects the biggest impact will be a fuller picture of the “diabolical abuse of children through using coercive control and sexual abuse.”
    


            While it's important for people mentioned in the files to be held accountable, Robson said the scale of this abuse is what she sees as the more important revelation.

A California mother and father were convicted on Tuesday of stabbing and decapitating their 13-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son, then forcing their two younger children to look at the bodies, authorities said.

Natalie Sumiko Brothwell, 48, and Maurice Jewel Taylor Sr., 39, were found guilty of murdering their 13-year-old daughter, Maliaka, and 12-year-old son, Maurice, inside the family's Lancaster home on Nov. 29, 2020, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said.

"This was a monstrous act of cruelty that shattered an entire family," Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan J. Hochman said in a news release on Tuesday. "Two innocent children were brutally murdered, and their young brothers were left to live through unimaginable horror."

Firefighters discovered the bodies five days later while responding to a possible gas leak, FOX11 Los Angeles reported. Brothwell, Taylor, and the couple's other two sons, then aged 8 and 9, were also inside the home.

Prosecutors said that after Brothwell and Taylor committed the murders, they forced the younger boys to view their siblings' decapitated bodies and then confined them to their bedrooms without food for days.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Washington National Cathedral on Thursday hosted a bipartisan show of respect and remembrance for Dick Cheney, the consequential and polarizing vice president who in later years became an acidic scold of fellow Republican President Donald Trump.

Trump, who has been publicly silent about Cheney's death Nov. 3, was not invited to the memorial service.

Two ex-presidents came: Republican George W. Bush, who eulogized the man who served him as vice president, and Democrat Joe Biden, who once called Cheney “the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American history” but now honors his commitment to his family and to his values.

“Solid and rare and reliable,” Bush said of his vice president, praising a man whose “talent and his restraint” exceeded his ego. “Smart and polished, without airs.”

Among the eulogists, Liz Cheney, his eldest daughter, only obliquely addressed what amounted to a father-daughter feud with the president — a man her dad had called a “coward” for trying to overturn his loss in the 2020 election.

She spoke of her father's conviction that when confronted with a choice between defending the country and a political party, the country must come first. “Bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she said.

A former high-ranking House member whose Republican political career was shredded by Trump's MAGA movement, Liz Cheney chose not to speak directly of Trump. She spoke of seeing clouds in the shape of angels just before her father died.

Moments before the service began, figures of recent but now receded power mingled: Bush and Biden and their wives sitting in a row together, former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris and Mike Pence chatting side by side in their pew with Al Gore and Dan Quayle together behind them. 

Biden greeted Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former longtime Senate leader, and his wife, former labor and transportation secretary Elaine Chao. Behind them sat Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker. All gathered in the grand cathedral known as “a spiritual home for the nation.”

Others delivering tributes at Thursday's funeral were Cheney's longtime cardiologist, Jonathan Reiner; former NBC News correspondent Pete Williams, who was Cheney's spokesman at the Pentagon; and the former vice president's grandchildren. Six grandchildren were there — a seventh is about to give birth.

“I'm happy to report that I haven't given many eulogies,” Reiner said in his remarks. “Nobody wants a doctor who is great at funerals.” 

Reiner recalled doctors telling Cheney decades ago, after the first of multiple heart attacks, that he should abandon his political ambitions then. Yet he kept winning elections as a Wyoming congressman for years after that.

Cheney, he said, was always the “calmest person in the room.”

Cheney had lived with heart disease for decades and, after the Bush administration, with a heart transplant. He died at age 84 from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said.

Trump's vice president, JD Vance, on stage at another event in the morning, was asked about Cheney and said: “Obviously there's some political disagreements there but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.”

Vance was also not invited to the funeral, according to a person familiar with the details who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The White House lowered its flags to half-staff after Cheney's death, as it said the law calls for, but Trump did not issue the presidential proclamation that often accompanies the death of notable figures, nor has he commented publicly on his passing.

The deeply conservative Cheney's influence in the Bush administration was legendary and, to his critics, tragic.

He advocated for the U.S. invasion of Iraq on the basis of what proved to be faulty intelligence and consistently defended the extraordinary tools of surveillance, detention and inquisition employed in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Bush credited him with helping to keep the country safe and stable in a perilous time.

After the 2020 election won by Biden, Liz Cheney served as vice chair of the Democratic-led special House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. She accused Trump of summoning the violent mob and plunging the nation into “a moment of maximum danger.”

For that, she was stripped of her Republican leadership position and ultimately defeated in a 2022 Republican primary in Wyoming. In a campaign TV ad made for his daughter, Dick Cheney branded Trump a “coward” who “tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.”

Last year, it did not sit well with Trump when Cheney said he would vote for the Democrat, Harris, in the presidential election.

Trump told Arab and Muslim voters that Dick Cheney's support for Harris should give them pause, because he “killed more Arabs than any human being on Earth. He pushed Bush, and they went into the Middle East.”

Police in New York have arrested a 33-year-old woman in connection with the brutal death of a 52-year-old man outside a yacht club on Long Island's scenic north shore.

The Stony Brook Yacht Club parking lot is better known for kayak launches and wedding photos than crime scene tape, but police allege that Kacy Corso, who lived in nearby Setauket, was involved in the stabbing death of Christopher Millwater, of Selden.

The altercation began in the parking lot across from 21 Shore Road, used by visitors to a pair of marinas and also a restaurant and wedding venue, the Three Village Inn, about 60 miles east of New York City.

The yacht club itself is surrounded by cameras, with several affixed to each light pole, and sources tell Fox News Digital much of the violence was caught on video.

Corso was due in court in Central Islip Thursday morning on a charge of second-degree murder. Under New York law, that's the charge for intentional murder.

It was not immediately clear whether additional charges were expected.

A July post from a Facebook account in Corso's name appears to show she knew Millwater before his death.

The same account also posted at least one other picture from the yacht club parking lot in July, taken from a space near the boat ramp, where fishermen can access the mouth of the channel from the dock. Millwater "liked" one of her posts from days earlier.

Court records show she racked up unrelated charges at another boat launch in the area earlier this year.

On May 5, she was charged with illegally accessing the boat ramp parking lot in the neighboring town of Smithtown and with entering or remaining in a park or beach area after dark.

According to Millwater's Facebook page, he was given an "all clear" in October following a battle with cancer.

His sister told the local TV station, News 12, that Stony Brook was his favorite place to go fishing.

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts weigh in on parents struggling to decipher Gen Z's slang words.

It is a phenomenon that has swept the nation, seemingly coming out of nowhere in our country's middle schools. The bewildering phrase "6-7" has been amusing kids and annoying parents for months now, but in fact, this expression dates to the 14th century and is one of modern English's oldest.

When my 15-year-old son patiently tried to explain to me that "6-7" meant nothing, but was just something you say as a joke when you hear the numbers together, while making a weighing gesture with your hands, I asked him if it meant the same as "being at sixes and sevens?"

 (Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty images.)

He didn't know what that expression meant, and to be fair it is rather arcane. I probably read too much PG Wodehouse, but it got me thinking that maybe this "6-7" thing didn't actually pop up out of nowhere. Maybe it is very, very old, I thought.

Turns out, that was a good instinct.

The first usage of "6-7" dates back to the 1300s, which is about as old as modern English gets. It referred to a dice game called Hazard that would eventually develop into what we know as craps.

In the game, a player would call out the number he was trying to shoot for, or make, with two six-sided dice. Five, eight and nine were the most likely results. Six and seven, gamblers quickly discovered either through math or experience, offered lower odds and hence less chance of winning.

Several of the most-searched slang terms revolve around looks and attractiveness, like "mogging" and "chopped." (iStock)

From then on, six and seven, taken together, became forever associated with risk and worry. It can be found in the works of Chaucer, and has marched quite steadily down through the centuries.

BOOK BUMMER: WHY READING IS IN DEEP DECLINE

Almost 300 years later, in 1595, William Shakespeare would use the expression in his play "Richard II," with the Duke of York uttering, "I should to Plashy too, but time will not permit. All is uneven, and everything is left at six and seven."

Once again, in Shakespeare's usage six and seven mean risk, worry and confusion.

Over the next few centuries, the phrase would become plural and popularized as "being at sixes and sevens," meaning being worried or confused, as in, "My check is late and my rent is due, I am at sixes and sevens over it."

DICTIONARY.COM DECLARES '6-7' WORD OF THE YEAR

The dead giveaway that this latest iteration of "6-7" is related to its medieval precursor is the weighing motion with the hands. It says visually, "it might be this, or it might be that," it's confusing, unclear, a matter of chance.

What does the endurance of this symbol, this expression that has been with our native tongue since its birth really mean? What can it tell us, beyond being just a little fun fact of history?

A double-digit combination set the social media sphere ablaze among teens in 2025, leaving parents and teachers befuddled -- and now it has officially been crowned Dictionary.com's "Word of the Year": 67. But even the organization that unveiled the winning word -- pronounced "six-seven" and never "sixty-seven" -- admitted it was not exactly sure about its meaning. (Chris Delmas/AFP)

It tells us that we are much more closely linked intellectually to those who spoke our language 700 years ago than we think, that we almost never invent, we almost always borrow or repurpose, as Shakespeare, our greatest writer, did himself.

It was the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein who suggested that language is not merely the vessel of our thoughts, it is also the driver. Here we have the English language stubbornly demanding for centuries that these two numbers have a special meaning.

This is why it is vital to read old books and to make kids read old books. They aren't actually old. They are in fact, timeless in as much as their contributions become indelible. We understand what we ourselves are saying much better when we understand those who said it first.

So, the next time your kid starts giggling and saying "6-7," just imagine them on the old-timey streets of Elizabethan London doing it, because the people there and then would know exactly what it means, even better than we do.

The history of English-speaking people is much shorter than it feels, we are much more closely related to those long gone than we recognize. 

So, as we march into the future of artificial intelligence, and brave new worlds, let us remember, we find our real meaning, our real selves and what we are, in the past, not in the future, and just as with "6-7," the past will always find a way.

UConn's Silas Demary Jr lobbed it to Eric Reibe for the and-1 vs. Arizona. 

UConn head coach Dan Hurley was pretty blunt in his assessment of the team's 71-67 loss to No. 4 Arizona on Wednesday night at Gampel Pavilion. 

Hurley's squad was without two of its top players – senior center Tarris Reed Jr. and five-star freshman Braylon Mullins – in the close loss, and the two-time champion head coach ripped up the stat sheet in disgust. 

"We just f---ing blew a chance to beat one of the best teams, down two studs," Hurley said postgame at his press conference.

The No. 3 Huskies were dominated on the boards, as the Wildcats outrebounded them 43-23, yet they were still in the game. Hurley expressed his displeasure with the team's lack of fight. 

"We should have been minus-10 on the glass today. I mean, we got punked. We punked out. It's going to be a bad film session coming out of here where there are people; there's a street fight going on in the paint and men can't watch fights," Hurley said.

"You know, men, you can't stand on the outside when your buddies are in a fight. You get in the fight, you don't stand on the periphery of the fight. And I think we're going to see a lot of clips where guys were not in the fight with their teammates."

Despite being outrebounded and committing more fouls (the Huskies had 21 fouls to the Wildcats' 16), they went stride for stride with Arizona. UConn clawed back to tie the game at 60-60 after trailing by 13 with 13:44 left in the game.

But down the stretch, Arizona executed better and pulled out the win in the battle of two of the top five teams in the nation. 

The loss was UConn's first of the year, dropping them to 4-1. They will look to bounce back against Bryant (1-4) on Sunday at 6 p.m. ET. 

Arizona improved to 5-0 with the win and will look to continue their hot start to the season against Denver (1-3) at 10:30 p.m. ET.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — GE Appliances on Thursday touted wide-ranging ripple effects from shifting production from China to Kentucky as it announced more than $150 million in new contracts awarded to U.S.-based suppliers.

The supplier contracts range in value from $330,000 to $41 million, span 10 states and cover crucial segments of the supplier chain for the appliance maker's washer and dryer production — from plastics and castings to steel and aluminum, the company said. The suppliers range in size from U.S. Steel to family-owned companies.

With the new contracts, GE Appliances said it is increasing domestic spending on suppliers by 3.3%.

The suppliers will support production of a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers, all of which GE Appliances is moving from China to its sprawling Louisville complex known as Appliance Park. The company says it's investing $490 million to retool a plant for the project, which will create 800 new jobs.

Production is scheduled to begin in early 2027, it said, and will expand the total footprint devoted to clothes care production at Appliance Park to the equivalent of 33 football fields.

“When we invest in U.S. manufacturing and our people, it drives growth far beyond our own walls,” Lee Lagomarcino, a GE Appliances vice president, said Thursday in a news release. “These new supplier contracts represent what ‘Built for America' is all about — investing in U.S. manufacturing, creating more American jobs and building opportunity that multiplies.”

The announcements come as President Donald Trump attempts to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes — tariffs — on foreign goods. The president recently said the U.S. would lower tariffs implemented earlier this year as punishment on China for its selling of chemicals used to make fentanyl from 20% to 10%. That brings the total combined tariff rate on China down from 57% to 47%.




The $150 million-plus in new supplier contracts reflects the amount GE Appliances will spend each year for shipments of parts, components and raw materials to produce the washers and dryers, it said. Contract values could increase if sales of the washers and dryers grow, the company said.

GE Appliances said it spends $4.6 billion with more than 6,500 U.S. suppliers, a 69% increase in spending and a 58% rise in its number of suppliers since 2019. Its U.S. supply chain has grown for more than a decade, it said.

“While tariffs have certainly been a factor, there are also many other benefits such as shorter lead times, reduced transportation costs and the ability to collaborate with your supply chain to ultimately serve our customers better,” Lagomarcino said.

The new contracts were awarded to businesses in Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Alabama and California, GE Appliances said. It awarded more than $40 million in contracts to suppliers in Kentucky, more than in any other state.

The contracts are the first of many expected ripple effects from its broader, five-year, $3 billion commitment to strengthen its U.S. manufacturing, reshore certain production and create more than 1,000 jobs, the company said. GE Appliances announced plans in August to shift production of refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters out of China and Mexico. The company also has manufacturing plants in South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Connecticut. The company is a subsidiary of the China-based Haier company.

BOSTON (AP) — Inside the wide mouth of a stoneware jar, Daisy Whitner's fingertips found a slight rise in the clay — a mark she hoped was a trace left behind by her ancestor, an enslaved potter who shaped the vessel nearly 175 years ago in South Carolina.

Standing in the gallery of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston last week, Whitner said she felt a quiet connection to her ancestor, David Drake, in that moment.

“I was telling the kids, 'Inside this jar, I'm sure I'm feeling his tears, sweat drops off his face, his arms,'” said 86-year-old Whitner, a Washington, D.C., resident and a retired account manager for The Washington Post.

The jar is one of two returned to Drake's family as part of a historic agreement this month between Drake's descendants and the MFA Boston, one of the institutions that holds pieces of his work.

The vessels are among hundreds of surviving works by “Dave the Potter,” an enslaved man who labored in the alkaline-glazed stoneware potteries of Edgefield, South Carolina, in the decades before and during the Civil War. Dave signed many of his jars — and inscribed some with rhyming couplets — an extraordinary and unparalleled assertion of identity and authorship during a time when literacy for enslaved people was criminalized.

The agreement represents what experts say is the first major case of art restitution involving works created by an enslaved person in the U.S. — a process traditionally associated with families seeking the return of art looted by the Nazis in World War II.

It's also rare: as enslaved people were denied legal personhood and documentation, tracing the ownership or lineage of their works is often impossible.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Children's book author Yaba Baker, Dave's 54-year-old fourth-generation grandson, called the return “a spiritual restoration.” Baker, whose first two children's books explore Black history, said the family felt a dual sense of pride and grief. Many Black families, he noted, struggle to trace their ancestry past a few generations; recovering Dave's work gave them back a piece of themselves.




After the museum returned the pots to the family, they sold one back so people can continue to learn from Dave's legacy. The other is on lease to the museum, at least temporarily. The MFA Boston said it wouldn't disclose how much it paid.

“We don't want to hide them away in our house. We want other people to be inspired by it,” Baker said. “We want people to know that this person, Dave the Potter, who was told he was nothing but a tool to be used, realized he had humanity. He deserved his own name on his pots. He deserved to write poetry. He deserved to know who he was.”

Laboring in the pottery yards in the South Carolina heat, Dave etched his name next to the date — July 12, 1834 — on a clay jar that would be sold by his owner and used to store pork and beef rations for enslaved people like him across the region.

He also inscribed the jar, which would likely end up on a cotton plantation in South Carolina, with the couplet: 

“Put every bit all between / Surely this jar will hold 14” to mark the jar's 14-gallon capacity.

The vessel was the first of hundreds, if not thousands, of stoneware jugs and jars made by Dave alongside other enslaved potters over 50 years before and during the Civil War.

Much of Dave's poetry followed Christian themes. As he aged, he wrote more and explored themes related to his enslavement. One of his most resonant poems was etched into a jar he produced in 1857, around the time scholars believe Dave and his family were separated after being sold to different slave owners. 

“I wonder where is all my relation / friendship to all – and every nation”

Multiple Drake descendants said they felt especially moved by Dave's question about his relations — and that their restitution felt like Dave's question was finally answered. 

It's unclear what became of the jars after Dave died. The MFA purchased them in 1997 from an art dealer. MFA Boston's Art of the Americas Chair Ethan Lasser said he thinks they survived mostly from pure “benign neglect” in South Carolina because they were large and difficult to transport or break. 

The MFA has two Drake pots, a “Poem Jar” and a “Signed Jar,” both from 1857.

The jar the Drake descendants sold back to the museum is similar to the 1857 pot on which Dave asks about his relations because he uses first-person language that suggests ownership — something that makes it especially powerful, Lasser said.

“Think of this as an enslaved person, speaking in the first person claiming authorship,” Lasser said.

In the poem, Dave writes: 

“I made this Jar = cash – / though its called = lucre Trash”.

On more than one pot, Dave writes “and Mark” next to his own name, suggesting he worked on the piece with another enslaved laborer. Oral histories indicate that Dave was disabled after losing a leg, although it's unclear how, and may have needed help with his ceramic work later in life.

His last surviving jar, made as the Civil War raged on in 1862, reads: “I made this Jar, all of cross / If you don't repent, you will be lost”.

Researchers believe Drake died sometime in the 1870s after gaining his freedom in the Civil War. He is accounted for in the 1870 census, but not in the 1880 census. 

For the Drake descendants, encountering Dave's work has been both moving and difficult — a collision of pride in his artistry and grief for the conditions in which he lived. 

Yaba Baker, who has a 17-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son, said the experience gave his family something they had never had before: a traceable link.

“I was able to turn to my son and say, ‘This is your lineage.' Dave the Potter was not only a great artist — he resisted oppressive laws, even though he could have been killed for it,” he said. “That's what you come from. Before, we didn't have that link.”

Yaba Baker said he often thinks about the anguish Dave may have felt if, as some historians speculate, the poems on his jars were attempts to signal to family members sold away from him — a common trauma of slavery.

“I can't imagine not knowing where my own kids are,” Baker said. “Completing that circle is very moving for me.”

For his mother, Pauline Baker, discovering Dave's story filled a void many Black families know intimately.

“If you're not African American, you don't understand the missing links in your history,” she said. “When you do find a connection, it becomes very personal.” She studies his life — the heat, the labor, the loss of a limb — and wonders how he managed such precision and focus. “He did not allow them to enslave his mind,” said Baker, 78, a retired speech pathologist who worked for three decades in Washington, D.C., public schools.

Since the MFA agreement was announced, the family has heard from museums and private collectors who hold Dave's work and want to discuss what ethical restitution might look like for them as well.

Daisy Whitner said she felt her ancestor's presence each time she slid her hand inside the jar.

“It broke my heart,” she said. “The outside is beautiful, but when you think about what he went through — sunup to sundown, in that South Carolina heat, on one leg — this poor man in bondage had no say in working so hard for nothing.”

            Scientific information on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website was replaced on Wednesday with anti-vaccine talking points that don't rule out a link between vaccines and autism, despite an abundance of evidence that there's no connection.
    


            Bullet points on the top of the page now state that “vaccines do not cause autism is not an evidence-based claim” because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism. However, the preponderance of scientific evidence shows this is not true, according to a position statement from the Autism Science Foundation.
    


            “The science is clear that vaccines do not cause autism. No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines. This includes vaccine ingredients as well as the body's response to vaccines,” the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement on Thursday.
    


Vaccines Fast Facts



            Other CDC bullets say studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have been ignored by health authorities. This, too, is not true. Studies showing a connection between vaccines and autism have proven to be fraudulent or have been poorly done or biased. There are many well done, credible studies that find no such relationship.
    


            The page also says HHS has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.
    


            The main heading on the page states “Vaccines do not cause Autism,” but now has an asterisk that directs readers to a footnote: “The header “Vaccines do not cause autism” has not been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.”
    


Why not split the MMR vaccine?



            The footnote seems to refer to a commitment by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and Republican from Louisiana, during his confirmation process that language on the CDC website “pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism” would not be removed. Cassidy described the promise in a speech in which he explained his support for Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist.
    


            HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said Thursday, “We are updating the CDC's website to reflect gold standard, evidence-based science.”
    


            In a post on social media late Wednesday night, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as director of the CDC's National Center on Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, called the changes “a national embarrassment.”
    


            “The weaponization of the voice of CDC is getting worse. This is a public health emergency,” he said.
    


            Daskalakis said the scientists at CDC were completely blindsided by the page update.
    


            “This distortion of science under the CDC moniker is the reason I resigned with my colleagues,” he told CNN.
    


            CNN has reached out to CDC for comment.
    


Fact check: What you need to know about Trump's misinformation about vaccines, autism and hepatitis B



            This is the latest move by the Trump administration to alter long-standing US vaccine policy and practice and cast doubt on vaccinations.
    


            Kennedy has hired long time anti-vax allies, including David Geier, a discredited researcher who was once disciplined by the Maryland State Board of Physicians for practicing medicine without a license, and Lyn Redwood, a nurse who was the president of the World Mercury Project, which later became Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group Kennedy ran before campaigning for office, to undertake new evaluations of government data in an effort to prove conspiracy theories that hazards of vaccines have long been hidden from the public.
    


            The rate of routine childhood vaccinations has dropped in the United States, allowing preventable diseases including measles and whooping cough to surge. This year the United States has seen its highest numbers of measles cases in 25 years. In a call with state health officials on Monday, the CDC disease detectives leading the measles response suggested that the United States status as a country that has eliminated continuous measles spread was in jeopardy as cases continue to rise.

Karina Pasian was tapped to sing "The Star-Spangled Banner" before the NFL's first-ever regular-season game in Spain over the weekend but drew backlash on social media for her outfit choice.

Pasian came out onto the field in a black mini dress with thigh-high stockings and garters to sing the national anthem. While the backlash was rather harsh, Pasian explained in an interview with TMZ Sports that she was surprised with the negative criticism.

"I honestly had no expectations with anyone saying anything. I felt great in what I chose to wear. I worked with two stylists of mine named David and Adrianne and they're amazing and they brought my vision to life," Pasian said. "It wasn't my intention to offend anyone. I'm really sorry if anyone felt offended by it, but my intention was to have a good time."

"My look is super cabaret and super burlesque. That's the aesthetic I love. I really admire that aesthetic."

Pasian said the NFL approved her outfit beforehand and didn't feel the need to feed into anything negative.

"I've read a lot of positive comments, and I'm trying to feed into more of that energy. That's what I try to focus on and what I'm trying to spread. People have a right to express their opinion," she added.

Pasian has been in the music industry for quite a while. Her R&B album, "First Love," reached No. 11 on the U.S. R&B charts and No. 57 on the overall U.S. charts when it debuted in August 2008.

Protesters in Charlotte urge Home Depot to keep immigration officers off its property

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Federal agents have now arrested more than 250 people during a North Carolina immigration crackdown centered around Charlotte, the state's largest city, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday.

The operation that began over the weekend is the latest phase of Republican President Donald Trump's aggressive mass deportation efforts that have sent the military and immigration agents into Democratic-run cities — from Chicago to Los Angeles. 

Immigration officials have blanketed the country since January, pushing detention counts to all-time highs above 60,000. Big cities and small towns across the country are targeted daily amid higher-profile pushes in places such as Portland, Oregon, where more than 560 immigration arrests were made in October. Smaller bursts of enforcement have popped up elsewhere.

The push to carry out arrests in North Carolina expanded to areas around the state capital of Raleigh on Tuesday, spreading fear in at least one immigrant-heavy suburb. 

Federal agents in North Carolina are expanding their immigration crackdown. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports.

Late Wednesday, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said via the social platform X that “border patrol enforcement appears to have been suspended” in the city. DHS did not announce a change to its presence and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The number of arrests around Charlotte and beyond during what the government has dubbed “ Operation Charlotte's Web ” was about double the total announced by DHS officials earlier this week. The department said in a statement that agencies “continue to target some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens.”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Their targets include people living in the U.S. without legal permission and those who allegedly have criminal records.




Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They've also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge.

The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests.

About 100 people gathered outside a Home Depot store in Charlotte on Wednesday, where federal agents have been spotted multiple times since the surge started. Protest organizers briefly went inside the store with orange and white signs that read, “ICE out of Home Depot, Protect our communities.”

Arrests in Charlotte and the Raleigh area have created a chilling effect in immigrant neighborhoods — school attendance dropped, and small shops and restaurants closed to avoid confrontations between customers and federal agents.

Customers at a laundromat left behind their clothes in washers and dryers and haven't returned after agents showed up at a Charlotte shopping center on Sunday, said David Rebolloso, who owns the business.

Agents didn't target his laundromat, but it still impacted his bottom line and shut down the neighboring shops, said Rebolloso, a Mexican American born in Brownsville, Texas. 

“We're only open because I'm an American citizen, so it doesn't bother me,” he said. “But of course, business is down. I have no customers.”

Just days after beginning the crackdown in North Carolina, Border Patrol agents were expected to arrive in New Orleans by the end of the week to start preparing for their next big operation in southeast Louisiana, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press and three people familiar with the operation.

Around 250 federal border agents are set to descend on New Orleans in the coming weeks for a two-month immigration crackdown expected to begin in earnest on Dec. 1.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander tapped to head the Louisiana sweep, has been on the ground in North Carolina this week, leading the operation there as well. 

Louisiana Republicans voiced their support on Wednesday. The chair of the state party, Derek Babcock, said it shows a commitment from Trump and Republican Gov. Jeff Landry to “keeping our citizens safe.” 

The head of the state's American Civil Liberties Union chapter said they were compiling information to help people know their rights and coordinating with legal services and groups connected with the immigrant community.

“We urge those with privilege and the opportunity to risk it to stand up for their neighbors and friends,” said Alanah Odoms with the ACLU of Louisiana.

When former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral is held at the Washington National Cathedral in the nation's capital, he will join a bipartisan but exclusive list of figures memorialized there.

WASHINGTON (AP) — When former Vice President Dick Cheney ‘s funeral is held Thursday at the Washington National Cathedral in the nation's capital, he will join a bipartisan but exclusive list of towering figures memorialized there, in a church that tells the story of America on hallowed ground.

Presidents from Dwight D. Eisenhower to Jimmy Carter have received state funerals at the gothic-style cathedral. Funeral services have also been held there for Thurgood Marshall, the first Black Supreme Court Justice, and the moonwalking astronaut Neil Armstrong. The list of notable figures interred at the cathedral includes the author and activist Hellen Keller. Just one president, Woodrow Wilson, is buried there.

The church's history and tradition, said Washington National Cathedral Provost Rev. Canon Jan Naylor Cope, put it “at the intersection of the civic and the sacred.” The funerals held there shed light both on the deceased and their place in the country's history.

Titans of American history keep watch over the cathedral, as statues of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln stand in two separate bays near the entrance of the nave. The cathedral has five chapels on the main level and four chapels and burial vaults on the lower level, or the crypt.

French-born architect Pierre L'Enfant's original design for Washington included a church “for national purposes.” In 1893, a congressional charter was authorized to build a cathedral dedicated to religion, education and charity.




Construction on the Protestant Episcopalian church began in 1907, with President Theodore Roosevelt present to help lay the foundation, but wasn't totally completed until 1990. Today, the cathedral stands as the sixth largest in the world and is the second largest in the country, following the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. 

For Eisenhower's 1969 funeral, the World War II general was dressed in his wartime military uniform and at his request placed in a simple, government-issued casket that was meant for regular U.S. soldiers, according to the White House Historical Association.

At former President Ronald Reagan's funeral in 2004, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher — a partner of Reagan's in confronting the Soviet Union — was one of the attendees, but her eulogy, recorded weeks earlier as her health was deteriorating, was aired to mourners by video. Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who negotiated over nuclear arms with Reagan in the final years of the Cold War, was also there.

For astronaut Armstrong, eulogies meshed the divine with the extraterrestrial. Armstrong's legacy was already linked to the church, as a sliver of moon rock collected by his Apollo 11 mission has been located inside a stained-glass window there known as the “Space Window” since its dedication in 1974.

At Cheney's funeral, the second held at the cathedral for a vice president, former President George W. Bush will speak, as will Cheney's daughter, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney. 

There is a selective list of Americans who are interred within the cathedral compound. President Woodrow Wilson is the only president who is buried there, along with his wife, first lady Edith Wilson. The ashes of Matthew Shepard, the gay American student at the University of Wyoming who was beaten, tortured and left to die near Laramie, Wyoming, on Oct. 6, 1998, are also interred at the cathedral.

“It's a pilgrimage,” Cope said of visits to Shepard's grave. “And it lives into our hope and desire to be a house of prayer for all people. No exceptions.”

Initially, those buried within the cathedral were people associated with the building itself, including some clergy and some of the cathedral's original stone carvers. For the others — 220 in total are interred there — it was a choice of their families or their own and those interested must apply. 

Even some of the cathedral's ornate 215 stained-glass windows tell the story of the nation. It permanently removed stained-glass windows commemorating Confederate Gens. Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson in 2017, after a reckoning that forced its leaders to ask whether the windows, installed in 1953, were “an appropriate part of the sacred fabric of a spiritual home for the nation.” New windows with a racial justice theme replaced the old ones in 2023. 

Many presidents have visited the cathedral for prayer. During the Iran hostage crisis, Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale gathered there to pray for the captives held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Inaugural prayer services have also been held for presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and most recently, Donald Trump.

Cope said the cathedral, the final stop on a journey for some, could be a place of introspection in the lives of others.

“I would hope that a place like this, designed to inspire and to bring awe as gothic architecture does and gothic cathedrals do, would continue to inspire the next generation,” said Cope, “to live a life of meaning that matters and makes a difference.”

Republicans may be facing a “worst-case scenario” in their redistricting fight with Democrats after a three-judge federal court panel ruled that Texas cannot use a racially gerrymandered congressional map hastily drawn this summer at President Donald Trump's urging.

Trump's public push for Texas and other red states such as Indiana to revise their maps ahead of the 2026 elections to boost the GOP headcount in the House of Representatives spurred Democrats in California and Virginia to redraw their own. The goal in Texas was to net up to five additional Republican seats that would allow the GOP to secure the House for Trump's final two years in office.

The El Paso court panel said Tuesday in a 2-1 decision that “substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map” and ordered the state to revert to the maps it had drawn in 2021.

The Texas court's decision complicated the expected alignment between Texas and California for redistricting reforms.

California's Proposition 50 was initially justified as a parallel action to that of Texas. There was even language in the measure indicating that California would only move forward with its redistricting plans if Texas proceeded with its own plans. However, that language was removed from the measure before it reached Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) desk for him to sign it into law. That means there was nothing written on the ballot tying its validity to Texas's decision when Californians went to cast their votes on Proposition 50 on Nov. 4.

CALIFORNIA'S PROPOSITION 50: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT REDISTRICTING VOTE

With Texas no longer proceeding with its map, Proposition 50 stays in effect, delivering an unexpected blow to Republicans.

“This is something of a worst-case scenario for Republicans, because there was no clause when voters passed Prop 50 that it would it would be tabled if Texas was invalidated,” Dave Wasserman, the senior editor and elections analyst for the Cook Political Report, told the Washington Examiner. “So the net result is that Democrats could come out ahead in this redistricting fight if the decision in Texas is upheld. In fact, Democrats could net, effectively, the three seats they need for the majority from redistricting.”

Following the Texas decision, Newsom, who is reportedly considering a 2028 White House bid, posted on X: “Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned — and democracy won. This ruling is a win for Texas, and for every American who fights for free and fair elections.”

The situation in Texas also ramps up pressure on Indiana Republicans to produce and pass a new map that favors the GOP, despite state Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray saying last week that there are not enough votes to pass a new map.

Trump unleashed on Republicans in the Hoosier State this week, threatening to back primary challenges to senators who have resisted pressure to change their maps. Republicans already hold a 7-2 advantage in the state's congressional delegation, but Trump wants to secure more seats. He has singled out Bray and state Sen. Greg Goode.

“Because of these two politically correct type ‘gentlemen,' and a few others, they could be depriving Republicans of a Majority in the House, a VERY BIG DEAL!” Trump posted on Truth Social.

Soon after, Goode was the victim of a swatting call that brought sheriff's deputies to his home on the pretense of a “domestic violence emergency.” Goode has not publicly stated his position on redistricting but has said he will wait until he sees a map. Bray announced Friday that the state Senate would be out until January 2026.

Gov. Mike Braun (R-IN) said the Indiana Senate needs to have a public discussion surrounding redistricting and look at maps that are “going to hopefully come from” the Indiana House. Braun also criticized Bray and said he would consider a change in leadership in the state Senate and the caucus.

Despite the pressure, there has been little to no actual movement on Indiana passing new maps. 

“The idea that we could have gone from Republicans creating an impenetrable map for themselves to, like, the Democrats now potentially gaining seats if this Texas court thing stays is an unbelievable turn of events in a short period of time,” Tim Miller, host of The Bulwark Podcast, said. 

Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School, said that most “law around redistricting is up to the state, not the federal government, not federal law, and we just changed state law.” He added that he did not think “there are many grounds for a legal challenge against Prop. 50 to succeed.”

Last week, the Justice Department joined a GOP-led lawsuit attempting to block California's new map. The Trump administration argued that the new districts violate the Constitution because Proposition 50 was “a rush-job rejiggering California's congressional district lines,” and argued that “race cannot be used as a proxy to advance political interests, but that is precisely what the California General Assembly did with Proposition 50.” 

The plaintiffs claimed that “race was a predominant factor in drawing at least District 13 in the Proposition 50 map.”

With the passage of Proposition 50, the number of Republicans representing Californians could be cut in half. The state has 43 Democrats and nine Republicans in the House. Proposition 50 shifted five GOP-represented House districts into the competitive or easily winnable category for Democrats.

Specifically, the map changed districts held by Reps. Kevin Kiley (R-CA) and Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) in Northern California. In Southern California, Reps. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Ken Calvert (R-CA) are at risk, and in the Central Valley, Rep. David Valadao (R-CA) will likely have a much harder time getting reelected.

REDISTRICTING SETBACKS IN COURT SLOW GOP MAP PUSH AHEAD OF 2026

The new map eliminated Calvert's Inland Empire district and created a new seat in Los Angeles County that skewed heavily toward Democrats.

Wasserman, who does not believe the federal government has much of a case against Proposition 50, called the “plot twists” leading up to the midterm election among the most extreme he has ever seen.

Panelists Sonja Shaw and Ryan Walters discuss a Harvard professor's remarks about conservative views at the university, a report on incoming University of California students' math struggles and more on 'Fox News @ Night.' 

The Anchorage School District in Alaska admitted it made a "mistake" by adding a disclaimer saying that the school district "does not endorse these materials or the viewpoints expressed" on a flyer which solely contained the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. 

A parent in Anchorage was shocked to find the sticker after her daughter brought the pamphlet home, which was handed out to students in class.

"Today my daughter brought home a pamphlet with the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution," Karen Waldron posted to Facebook. "On the back was a sticker saying that the Anchorage School District ‘does not endorse the materials or viewpoints expressed in them.'"

"I was honestly stunned," Waldron continued. "These aren't controversial documents, they are the foundation of our country and what our students are supposed to be learning about. Why would a school need to distance itself from the very principles we are built on?"

"I'll be asking the district for an explanation," Waldron concluded in the post. 

Fox News Digital spoke with Waldron on the phone, who expressed frustration about the situation and said the wording on the sticker was highly inappropriate. 

Waldron explained that she fully supports transparency in education and just wants to understand the thinking behind the sticker being placed on every packet.

Waldron also told Fox News Digital that parents deserve clarity and that if outside materials are being sent home, especially involving American founding documents, the messaging should be thoughtful and not confusing to families.

Anchorage Daily News reported that M.J. Thim, a spokesperson for the school district, said that the disclaimers were a "mistake" and that the flyers "shouldn't have been processed" through a system that adds the stickers to materials that come from outside the school district. 

"This was our mistake," Thim wrote to the Anchorage Daily News. "The request that came in wasn't for a flyer or poster and shouldn't have been processed through that system. We will be following up directly with the requestor to make things right."

Fox News Digital reached out to the school district but did not receive a response. 

The flyer was produced by Hillsdale College, as illustrated on the back of the pamphlet, which also displayed the disclaimer from the Anchorage School District. 

Alaska Attorney General Stephen J. Cox also weighed in on the disclaimer on the pamphlet, calling the school district's actions "deeply concerning."

"The Declaration of Independence and Constitution are foundational American documents, and it is essential to teach students about the birth of our nation, their rights, and the government's duty to protect those rights," Cox told Fox News Digital. "The stickers only invite confusion about these founding documents."

The packet was handed out to students across Anchorage Public Schools. (iStock)

"Shortly after the news broke, the School District took ownership, apologized, and promised corrective action," Cox added. "The Law Department and the Department of Education and Early Development have followed up with the District with specific questions, but in a spirit of cooperation, we have offered to help review ASD's policies and procedures to ensure it never happens again."

Following the backlash and public spotlight on the flyer, the spokesperson from the Anchorage School District told Anchorage Daily News that the district is reviewing the process to ensure it doesn't happen again and that the "founding documents are taught in every school and reflect the values we want every student to understand."

Hillsdale College did not respond to a request for comment.

It's more subtle than Skynet.

It would take about 30 minutes for a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to travel from Russia to the United States. If launched from a submarine, it could arrive even faster than that. Once the launch is detected and confirmed as an attack, the president is briefed. At that point, the commander-in-chief might have about two or three minutes at most to decide whether to launch hundreds of America's own ICBMs in retaliation or risk losing the ability to retaliate at all.

This is an absurd amount of time to make any consequential decision, much less what would potentially be the most consequential one in human history. While countless experts have devoted countless hours over the years to thinking about how a nuclear war would be fought, if one ever happens, the key decisions are likely to be made by unprepared leaders with little time for consultation or second thought.

And so it shouldn't be a surprise that the people in charge of America's nuclear enterprise are interested in finding ways to automate parts of the process — including with artificial intelligence. The idea is to potentially give the US an edge — or at least buy a little time.

But for those who are concerned about either AI or nuclear weapons as a potential existential risk to the future of humanity, the idea of combining those two risks into one is a nightmare scenario. There's wide consensus on the view that, as UN Secretary General António Guterres put it in September, “until nuclear weapons are eliminated, any decision on their use must rest with humans — not machines.”

By all indications, though, no one is actually looking to build an AI-operated doomsday machine. US Strategic Command (STRATCOM), the military arm responsible for nuclear deterrence, is not exactly forthcoming about where AI might be in the current command-and-control system. (STRATCOM referred Vox's request for comment to the Department of Defense, which did not respond.) But it's been very clear about where it is not. 

“In all cases, the United States will maintain a human ‘in the loop' for all actions critical to informing and executing decisions by the President to initiate and terminate nuclear weapon employment,” Gen. Anthony Cotton, the current STRATCOM commander, told Congress this year.

At a landmark summit last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping and then-US President Joe Biden “affirmed the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons.” There are no indications that President Donald Trump's administration has reversed this position.

But the unanimity behind the idea that humans should remain in charge of the nuclear arsenal obscures a subtler danger. Many experts believe that even if humans are still the ones making the final decision to use nuclear weapons, increasing reliance on AI by humans to make those decisions will make it more, not less, likely that those weapons will actually be used, particularly as humans start to place more and more trust in AI as a decision-making aid.

A rogue AI killing us all is, for now at least, a far-fetched fear; a human consulting an AI on pressing the button is the scenario that should keep us up at night.

“I've got good news for you: AI is not going to kill you with a nuclear weapon anytime soon,” said Peter W. Singer, a strategist at the New America think tank and author of several books on military automation. “I've got bad news for you: it may make it more likely that humans will kill you with a nuclear weapon.”

To understand exactly the threat AI's involvement in our nuclear system poses, it is important to first grasp how it's being used now.

It may seem surprising given its extreme importance, but many aspects of America's nuclear command are still surprisingly low-tech, according to people who've worked in it, in part due to a desire to keep vital systems “air-gapped,” meaning physically separated, from larger networks to prevent cyber attacks or espionage. Until 2019, the communications system that the president would use to order a nuclear strike still relied on floppy disks. (Not even the small hard plastic disks from the 1990s, but the bendy 8-inch ones from the 1980s.)

The US is currently in the midst of a multidecade, nearly trillion-dollar nuclear modernization process, including spending about $79 billion to bring the nuclear command, control, and communications systems out of the Atari era. (The floppy disks were replaced with a “highly secure solid-state digital storage solution.”) Cotton has identified AI as being “central” to this modernization process.

In testimony earlier this year, he told Congress that STRATCOM is looking for ways to “use AI/ML [machine learning] to enable and accelerate human decision-making.” He added that his command was looking to hire more data scientists with the aim of “adopting AI/ML into the nuclear systems architecture.”

Some roles for AI are fairly uncontroversial, such as “predictive maintenance,” which uses past data to order new replacement parts before the old ones fail.

At the extreme other end of the spectrum would be a theoretical system that could give AI the authority to launch nuclear weapons in response to an attack if the president can't be reached. While there are advocates for a system like this, the US has not taken any steps toward building one, as far as we know.

This is the kind of scenario that likely comes to mind for most people when it comes to the idea of combining nuclear weapons and AI, due in part to years of films in which rogue computers try to destroy the world. In another public appearance, Gen. Cotton referred to the 1983 film WarGames, in which a computer system called WOPR goes rogue and nearly starts a nuclear war: “We do not have a WOPR in STRATCOM headquarters. Nor would we ever have a WOPR in STRATCOM headquarters.”

Fictional examples like WOPR or The Terminator's Skynet have undoubtedly colored the public's views on mixing AI and nukes. And those who believe that a superintelligent AI system could attempt on its own to destroy humanity understandably want to keep these systems far away from the most efficient methods humans have ever created to do just that.

Most of the ways AI is likely to be used in nuclear warfare fall somewhere between smart maintenance and full-on Skynet.

“People caricature the terms of this debate as whether it's a good idea to give ChatGPT the launch codes. But that isn't it,” said Herb Lin, an expert on cyber policy at Stanford University.

One of the most likely applications for AI in nuclear command-and-control would be “strategic warning” — synthesizing the massive amount of data collected by satellites, radar, and other sensor systems to detect potential threats as soon as possible. This means keeping track of the enemy's launchers and nuclear assets to both identify attacks when they happen and improve options for retaliation.

“Does it help us find and identify potential targets in seconds that human analysts may not find for days, if at all? If it does those kinds of things with high confidence, I'm all for it,” retired Gen. Robert Kehler, who commanded STRATCOM from 2011 to 2013, told Vox.

AI could also be employed to create so-called “decision-support” systems, which, as a recent report from the Institute for Security and Technology put it, don't make the decision to launch on their own but “process information, suggest options, and implement decisions at machine speeds” to help humans make those decisions. Retired Gen. John Hyten, who commanded STRATCOM from 2016 to 2019, described to Vox how this might work.

“On the nuclear planning side, there's two pieces: targets and weapons,” he said. Planners have to determine what weapons would be adequate to threaten a given target. “The traditional way we did data processing for that takes so many people and so much time and money, and was unbelievably difficult to do. But it's one of the easiest AI problems you can define, because it is so finite.”

Both Hyten and Kehler were adamant that they do not favor giving AI the ability to make final decisions regarding the use of nuclear weapons, or even providing what Kehler called the “last-ditch information” given to those making the decisions.

But in the unbelievable pressure of a live nuclear warfare situation, would we actually know what role AI is playing?

It's become a cliche in nuclear circles to say that it's critical to keep a “human in the loop” when it comes to the decision to use nuclear weapons. When people use the phrase, the human they have in mind is probably someone like Jack Shanahan.

A retired Air Force lieutenant general, Shanahan has actually dropped a B-61 nuclear bomb from an F-15. (An unarmed one in a training exercise, thankfully.) He later commanded the E-4B National Airborne Operations Center, known as the “doomsday plane” — the command center for whatever was left of the American executive branch in the event of a nuclear attack.

In other words, he's gotten about as close as anyone to the still-only-theoretical experience of fighting a nuclear war. Pilots flying nuclear bombing training missions, he said, were given the option of bringing an eyepatch. In a real detonation, the explosion could be blinding for the pilots, and wearing the eyepatch would keep at least one eye working for the flight home.

But in the event of a thermonuclear war, no one really expected a flight home. “It was a suicidal mission, and people understood that,” Shanahan told Vox.

In the final assignment of his 36-year Air Force career, Shanahan was the inaugural head of the Pentagon's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.

Having seen both nuclear strategy and the Pentagon's push for automation from the inside, Shanahan is concerned that AI will find its way into more and more aspects of the nuclear command-and-control system, without anyone really intending it to or fully understanding how it's impacting the overall system.

“It's the insidious nature of it,” he says. “As more and more of this gets added to different parts of the system, in isolation, they're all fine, but when put together into sort of a whole, is a different issue.”

In fact, it has been malfunctioning technology, more than hawkish leaders, that has more often brought us alarmingly close to the brink of nuclear annihilation in the past.

In 1979, National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski was woken up by a call informing him that 220 missiles had been fired from Soviet submarines off the coast of Oregon. Just before Brzezinski called to wake up President Jimmy Carter, his aide called back: It had been a false alarm, triggered by a defective computer chip in a communications system. (As he had rushed to get the president on the phone, Brzezinski decided not to wake up his wife, thinking that she would be better off dying in her sleep.)

Four years later, Soviet Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov elected not to immediately inform his superiors of a missile launch detected by the Soviet early warning system known as Oko. It turned out, the computer system had misinterpreted sunlight reflected off clouds as a missile launch. Given that Soviet military doctrine called for full-scale nuclear retaliation, his decision may have saved billions of lives.

Just a few weeks after that, the Soviets put their nuclear forces on high alert in response to a US training exercise in Europe called Able Archer 83, which Soviet commanders believed may actually have been preparations for a real attack. Their paranoia was based in part on a massive KGB intelligence operation that used computer analysis to detect patterns in reports from overseas spies.



“It's all theory. It's doctrine, board games, experiments, and simulations. It's not real data. The model might spit out something that sounds unbelievably credible, but is it justified?”

Today's AI reasoning models are far more advanced, but still prone to error. The controversial AI targeting system, known as “Lavender,” which the the Israeli military used to target suspected Hamas militants during the war in Gaza, reportedly had an error rate of up to 10 percent.

AI models could also be vulnerable to cyberattacks or subtler forms of manipulation. Russian propaganda networks have reportedly seeded disinformation aimed at distorting the responses of Western consumer AI chatbots. A more advanced effort could do the same with AI systems meant to detect the movement of missiles or preparations for the use of a tactical nuclear weapon.

And even if all the information collected by the system is valid, there are reasons to be concerned about AI systems recommending courses of action. AI models are famously only as useful as the data that's fed into them, and their performance improves when there's more of that data to process.

But when it comes to how to fight a nuclear war, “there are no real-world examples of this with the exception of two in 1945,” Shanahan points out. “Beyond that, it's all theory. It's doctrine, board games, experiments, and simulations. It's not real data. The model might spit out something that sounds unbelievably credible, but is it justified?”

Stanford's Lin points out that studies have shown humans often give undue deference to computer-generated conclusions, a phenomenon known as “automation bias.” The bias might be especially difficult to resist in a life-or-death scenario with little time to make critical decisions — and one where the temptation to outsource an unthinkable decision to a thinking machine could be overwhelming.

Would-be Stanislav Petrovs of the AI era would also have to contend with the fact that even the designers of advanced AI models don't often understand why they generate the responses they do.

“It's still a black box,” said Alice Saltini, a leading scholar on AI and nuclear weapons, referring to the internal operations of advanced reasoning models. “What we do know is that it's highly vulnerable to cyberattacks and that we can't quite align it yet with human goals and values.”

And while it's still theoretical, if the worst predictions of AI skeptics turn out to be true, there's also the possibility that a highly intelligent system could deliberately mislead the humans relying on it to make decisions.

The notion of keeping a human “in control over the decision to use nuclear weapons,” as Biden and Xi vowed last year, might sound comforting. But if a human is making a decision based on data and recommendations put forward by AI, and has no time to probe the process the AI is using, it raises the question of what control even means. Would the “human in the loop” still actually make the decision, or would they merely rubber-stamp whatever the AI says?

For Adam Lowther, arguments like these miss the point. A nuclear strategist, past adviser to STRATCOM, and co-founder of the National Institute for Deterrence Studies, Lowther caused a stir among nuke wonks in 2019 with an article arguing that America should build its own version of Russia's “dead hand” system.

The dead hand, officially called Perimeter, was a system developed by the Soviet Union in the 1980s which would give human operators orders to launch the country's remaining nuclear arsenal if a nuclear attack was detected by sensors and Soviet leaders were no longer able to give the orders themselves.

The idea was to preserve deterrence even in the event of a first strike that wiped out the command chain. Ideally, that would discourage any adversary from attempting such a strike. The system is believed to still be in operation and former President Dmitry Medvedev referred to it in a recent threatening social media post directed at the Trump administration's Ukraine policies.

An American Perimeter-style system, Lowther says, would not be a ChatGPT-type program generating options on the fly, but an automated system carrying out commands that the president had already decided on in advance based on various scenarios.

In the event the president was still alive and in a position to make decisions during a nuclear war, they would likely be choosing from a set of attack options provided by the nuclear “football” that travels with the president at all times, laid out on laminated sheets said to resemble a Denny's menu. (This “menu” is shown in the recent Netflix film House of Dynamite.)

Lowther believes AI could help the president make a decision in that moment, based on courses of action that have already been decided. “Let's suppose a crisis happens,” Lowther told Vox. “The system can then tell the president, ‘Mr. President, you said that if option number 17 happens, here's what you want to do.' And then the president can say, ‘Oh, that's right, I did say that's what I thought I wanted to do.'”

The point is not that AI is never wrong. It's that it would likely be less wrong than a human would be under the most high-pressure situation imaginable.

“My premise is: Is AI 1 percent better than people at making decisions under stress?” he says. “If the answer is that it's 1 percent better, then that's a better system.”

For Lowther, the 80-year history of nuclear deterrence, including the near-misses, is proof that the system can effectively prevent catastrophe, even when mistakes occur.

“If your argument is, ‘I don't trust humans to design good AI,' then my question is, ‘Why do you trust them to make decisions about nuclear weapons?',” he said.

The encroachment of AI into nuclear command-and-control systems is likely to be a defining feature of the so-called third nuclear age, and may be already underway, even as national leaders and military commanders are adamant that they have no plans to give authority to use the weapons over to the machines.

But Shanahan is concerned the allure of automating more and more of the system may prove hard to resist. “It's just a matter of time until you're going to have well-meaning senior people in the Department of Defense saying ‘Well, I've got to have this stuff.'” he said. “They're going to be snowed by some big pitch” from defense contractors.

Another incentive to automate more of the nuclear system may be if the US perceives its adversaries as gaining an advantage from doing so, a dynamic that has driven nuclear arms build-ups since the beginning of the Cold War.

China has made its own aggressive push to integrate AI into its military capabilities. A recent Chinese defense industry study touted a potential new system that could use AI to integrate data from underwater sensors to track nuclear submarines, reducing their chance of escape to 5 percent. The report warrants skepticism — “making the oceans transparent” is a long-anticipated capability that is still probably a long way off — but experts believe it's safe to assume Chinese military planners are looking for opportunities to use AI to improve their nuclear capabilities, as they work to build up their arsenal to catch up with the United States and Russia.

Though the Biden-Xi agreement of 2024 may not have actually done much to mitigate the real risks of these systems, Chinese negotiators were still reluctant to sign onto it, likely due to suspicions that it was an American ruse to undermine China's capabilities. It's entirely possible that one or more of the world's nuclear powers could increase automation in parts of their nuclear command-and-control systems simply to keep up with the competition.

When dealing with a system as complex as command-and-control, and scenarios where speed is as disturbingly necessary as it would be in an actual nuclear war, the case for more and more automation may prove irresistible. And given the unstable and increasingly violent state of world politics, it's tempting to ask if we're sure that the world's current human leaders would make better decisions than the machines if the nightmare scenario ever came to pass.

But Shanahan, reflecting on his own time within America's nuclear enterprise, still believes decisions with such grave consequences for so many humans should be left with humans.

“For me, it was always a human-driven process, for better and worse,” he said. “Humans have their own flaws, but in this world, I'm still more comfortable with humans making these decisions than a machine that may not act in ways that humans ever thought they are capable of acting.”

Ultimately, it's fear of the consequences of nuclear escalation, more than anything else, that may have kept us all alive for the past 80 years. For all AI's ability to think fast and synthesize more data than a human brain ever could, we probably want to keep the world's most powerful weapons in the hands of intelligences that can fear as well as think.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday sought to bring a swift end to perhaps the most damaging saga of his term, signing a measure compelling the release of the Epstein files after losing a monthslong, tooth-and-nail fight to prevent their disclosure.
    


            The decision represents a stunning reversal for the president aimed chiefly at quelling a brewing GOP revolt and restoring his iron grip over the party. But few believe the path will be so easy from here.
    


            “I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES,” Trump posted on Truth Social late in the day, framing the overwhelming votes for it in Congress as a result of his involvement.
    


            The measure becoming law is now set to open a fraught new stage in the push for the files tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, putting the Justice Department under fresh scrutiny and testing the White House's ability to pivot attention away from the president's past dealings with Epstein and toward more advantageous political ground.
    


            At an unrelated press conference earlier Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi would only say that the Justice Department would “follow the law” when asked about the Epstein files.
    


            But already, officials face growing suspicion from Capitol Hill and their MAGA base that the administration will use a just-opened, Trump-ordered criminal investigation as an excuse to keep some of the Epstein case file under wraps.
    


Reading the fine print on the Epstein files legislation



            Justice officials, meanwhile, are scrambling to balance their probe with a looming December deadline for releasing the documents after being caught off-guard by both Trump's demand for a new investigation and his subsequent sudden support Sunday evening for making all the Epstein files public, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    


            And even as the White House tries to accelerate past the controversy to focus on next year's midterm elections, there remains little sign that Trump's supporters are anywhere near ready to leave it behind.
    


            “This is a storyline that's going to continue to dog the president into the second year of his presidency,” said Alex Conant, a longtime GOP operative. “The Epstein conspiracies have reached moon landing status. And we'll never stop talking about it.”
    


            The relentless intrigue surrounding the Epstein files marks the rare issue that has driven a wedge between Trump and the Republican Party he's led for the last decade, exposing a vulnerability for the White House made all the more frustrating by the fact that it's largely the result of a series of self-inflicted wounds.
    


            Since it became clear that he could not suppress the files' release, Trump has tried to reunify the GOP behind a new effort to tie Epstein directly to the Democratic Party.
    


            In announcing he'd signed the bill, Trump focused squarely on Democrats, writing, “Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed,” and adding, “This latest Hoax will backfire on the Democrats just as all of the rest have!”
    


            The offensive has drawn on newly disclosed Epstein emails that mention various prominent Democrats, alongside numerous references to Trump — a development that White House officials hope will put them back on offense after months under siege. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there's no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein's wrongdoing.)
    


Trump signed the Epstein files bill. Will he actually release them all?



            “All of a sudden there existed a real opportunity to change the narrative,” one official told CNN, noting that aides had only limited knowledge of what was in the documents compiled by Epstein's estate until a House committee released them last week. 



            But the strategic shift comes after months of failed gambits, dismissals and outright resistance to releasing the files — all of which has sapped precious attention and time from the administration's core agenda.
    


            The president now faces some of the lowest approval ratings of his term so far, as well as the twin challenges of waging an uphill battle toward the midterms while keeping a lid on the simmering divisions over Epstein.
    


            “I think the president was in the right position at the end,” GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said of his support for the Epstein measure. “The rest of the story now is that they will have to deliver on that package in very short order, and then it's going to depend upon what's in the package and what's been withheld.”
    


            Trump's signature on the bill — and the credit he claimed for its success — capped a public push for the files that the president himself first fueled nearly a year-and-a-half ago, after he pledged on the campaign trail to release the materials if elected.
    


            His team then leaned into that off-hand commitment as a way to energize a segment of the GOP base that's been fixated on the Epstein files and has been convinced they would implicate a range of powerful figures in the late financier's sexual abuse of young girls.
    


            The administration further heightened expectations in February, when Bondi distributed “Epstein Files” binders to conservative influencers at the White House. The event was a dud; virtually all of the information was already public, sparking public backlash and opening the door to months of private tensions among top DOJ officials.
    


            Bondi later claimed the administration was poring over newer materials, only for the DOJ to announce months later that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”
    


            The ensuing firestorm pitted the White House against many of the MAGA figures who had aided Trump's rise, sparked a bipartisan effort on Capitol Hill to force the release of the files and prompted an internal scramble to tamp down an issue that threatened to consume the administration through much of the summer.
    


            That effort became more challenging in the wake of revelations that magnified Trump's past connections to Epstein, including that the president's name had surfaced in the files. (Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.)
    


            Within the White House, aides sought to manage the expectations of their allies, trying to explain that publicizing the rest of the files risked harming victims and violating the privacy of people whose names were in the documents but not credibly accused of wrongdoing.
    


            Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly took to social media to try to browbeat Republicans in line, insisting that the files he once vowed to release were now little more than a Democratic “hoax.” Yet neither approach succeeding in quelling the calls for more disclosure.
    


            “We're trying to explain to people that they're believing in something that does not exist,” a senior White House official said. “That's why it's so frustrating.”
    


            At one point, as the congressional effort to compel the Epstein files' release gained steam, officials floated launching the new DOJ investigation as a way to alleviate the pressure and block any more documents from being released, an administration official said.
    


            But it's not clear whether the option made it to Trump. A White House official said the idea of an investigation into Democrats came after the emails were released by the House oversight panel last week. The Justice Department declined to comment.
    


            During Wednesday's unrelated press conference, Bondi said that “new information” obtained by investigators had prompted her to reopen the Epstein matter without specifying what that was.
    


            So last Friday, as the House vote on releasing the files loomed, Trump abruptly called for the DOJ to probe Epstein's connections to a handful of Democrat-aligned figures including former President Bill Clinton. He also sought an inquiry into the banking giant JPMorgan Chase's associations with Epstein. (Responding to the probe, spokespeople for Clinton and JPMorgan maintained they were not involved in Epstein's crimes.)
    


            The White House insists Trump has always been on the side of releasing the files. “President Trump has never been against releasing the Epstein files — rather, he has always been against Republicans falling into the Democrat trap of talking about this rather than focusing on the historic tax cuts signed into law, the fact that zero illegal aliens have entered our country in five months, and the many other accomplishments of the Trump Administration on behalf of the American people,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CNN.
    


            And since the opening of the new investigation, multiple White House officials have insisted to CNN that Trump will not stand in the way of the documents being released and that aides have little reason to believe the new investigation will affect that process, though Bondi declined to offer any explicit assurances on Wednesday.
    


            Within the DOJ, some officials have lamented that Trump's novel support for releasing the files amounts to a lose-lose — with Bondi and her department now facing dueling directives to both run an investigation and make public its pertinent documents.
    


            The White House's belated bid now to lean into the Epstein files as a political attack line has also generated some grumbling among allies on Capitol Hill and in the broader Trump orbit who had hoped to move on from a challenging period.
    


            In the last two weeks, some of these allies noted, Trump oversaw an end to the record-long government shutdown, promoted the administration's efforts on key affordability issues and hosted a series of high-profile diplomatic events.
    


            Yet as Trump and his aides try to turn the tables on Democrats over Epstein, “this is all anyone's talking about,” Conant said.
    


            “The power of the presidency is the ability to set the agenda,” he added. “And to the extent that this is a distraction, it does undermine what else he can do.”

A half-dozen Democratic veterans in Congress released a joint video urging U.S. service members to disobey unlawful orders, though they did not specify what those would be.

Sens. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and Reps. Jason Crow (D-CO), Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Chris Deluzio (D-PA), and Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA) said the “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home.” They repeatedly urged military and intelligence personnel to “refuse illegal orders.”

None of the Democrats in the video specified what illegal orders they should be concerned about or what to do if they believe they are given one.

Trump blasts ‘seditious' Democratic veterans: ‘Punishable by death'

“We are standing by our troops, our service members who are often put in very difficult positions and Donald Trump has put them in very difficult positions and has alluded to putting them in even more difficult positions in the months and years ahead, so we are reminding folks about what the uniform code of military justice says, what the Constitution says, what the law of war says,” Crow said on Fox News on Wednesday afternoon.

He cited President Donald Trump's musings during his first term about whether service members could shoot U.S. protesters in the leg, his more recent decisions to send the National Guard into several U.S. cities to crack down on illegal activities, and possibly sending U.S. troops to election polling stations.

“Donald Trump has made a series of very disturbing comments and suggestions that would violate U.S. law and put our military in a terrible position,” Crow, a former Army ranger, added. “I don't want to wait until that happens to remind our troops of this obligation because then it will be too late.”

Republicans rebuked the Democrats' video.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn said on Fox, “It is inconceivable that you would have elected officials that are saying to uniformed members of the military who have taken an oath that they would defy the orders that they have been given to execute their mission.”

Similarly, War Secretary Pete Hegseth responded to the video on social media, saying, “Stage 4 [Trump Derangement Syndrome].”

Crow denied that they were referring to the ongoing military operations in the Caribbean in the video. The military currently has its largest buildup of U.S. forces in the Western Hemisphere in decades. Since early September, the military has carried out roughly 20 lethal airstrikes on vessels they claim were carrying drugs intended for the United States, killing more than 80 people.

The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel found in July that the U.S. troops involved in the lethal targeting of alleged drug smuggling vessels would not be exposed to future prosecution.

“We got lawyers on lawyers, all the authorities necessary to do so, treating these terrorists like the al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere,” Hegseth said last week.

Service members are required to follow lawful orders in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and they can face prosecution for following unlawful orders. 

DOJ MEMO SAYS US TROOPS SAFE FROM PROSECUTION OVER SMUGGLING BOAT STRIKES

The precedent of whether a service member can face charges for following an illegal order came out of the trial of Lt. William Calley, who participated in the March 1968 slaughter of hundreds of Vietnamese individuals known as the My Lai massacre. Calley took the stand in his own case, stating that his superior, Capt. Ernest Medina, who was later court-martialed and ultimately acquitted, had directed him to kill everyone in the village.

Calley's defense team got the defense idea from the Nuremberg trials of captured Nazis following World War II.

            The first time Mwezi Mugerwa saw the African golden cat, he didn't know what it was.
    


            While reviewing camera trap footage at Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park, the conservation biologist spotted an unfamiliar creature around twice the size of a domestic cat in the grainy black-and-white footage.
    


            None of his colleagues could identify it; “but, when I talked to the hunters and communities who lived around the park, they knew the species,” Mugerwa recalls.
    


            Known as Embaka in the local language, the “cryptic” golden cat was often caught accidentally in forest snares.
    


            “That was really concerning for me — that we may lose this species before we even get to know about it,” says Mugerwa.
    


            Over the past 16 years, Mugerwa has dedicated his career to “Africa's least known, least understood, least studied big cat.” Found in dense tropical forests across Central and Western Africa, the species is so elusive that the last IUCN assessment — over a decade old — has no population estimates, and in all his years of fieldwork, Mugerwa has only managed a fleeting glimpse of the African golden cat three times with his own eyes. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the world's largest environmental network of government and society organizations, tracks threatened wildlife.
    


            “They're really, really difficult to see in the wild,” says Mugerwa, who won the Indianapolis Prize Emerging Conservationist Award earlier this year for his work on the species.
    


            But, realizing that accurately counting the big cats was the first step to protecting them, he set out to conduct the first population census across the species' range, expected to publish next year.

            Mugerwa knew that gathering data on the African golden cat wasn't something he could do on his own. So, in 2019, he founded the African Golden Cat Conservation Alliance (AGCCA), a network of 46 conservationists across 19 countries.
    


            Together, they launched a standardized camera trap survey across the cat's suspected range, supported by funding from the National Geographic Society.
    


            But manually reviewing thousands of images from 30 sites across 19 countries — the largest camera trap grid for any African wildlife species, says Mugerwa — “was really, really painful.”
    


            At the same time, US-headquartered nonprofit Panthera, another of Mugerwa's collaborators, was developing an AI algorithm that could quickly sort the images and identify individual cats based on their unique coat patterns, similar to how tiger stripes are used like fingerprints.
    


            “That's really important, because now we are able to speak to number and density,” says Mugerwa, adding that without AI, distinguishing individual cats would be nearly impossible due to their small size and subtle markings.
    


            Preliminary data suggests the species exists at low densities — even in protected habitats. In Uganda and Gabon, for example, surveys found just 16 individuals per 100 square kilometers.
    


            The surveys have also revealed the true impact of poaching: in areas with hunting restrictions, Mugerwa says cat populations were up to 50% higher, with wider distribution. The study has also observed that while the cats are active both day and night, many are strictly nocturnal — likely to avoid human activity during the day, he adds.
    


            Establishing population numbers was just the first step. Early in his research, Mugerwa realized that hunting was the cat's primary threat.
    


            In East Africa, where Mugerwa is based, the African golden cat is rarely the target of hunters. But bushmeat snares, set for pigs and antelopes, are indiscriminate, often catching other species unintentionally. In 2019, Mugerwa received reports of 80 golden cats caught in snares in three Ugandan forests, 88% of which were accidental.
    


            “We are dealing with a bushmeat crisis: the level of hunting ongoing in this forest is unsustainable and out of control,” he says, adding: “The species is being pushed to the edge of extinction in many of its range countries.”
    


            To combat the cat's biggest threat, Mugerwa went directly to the residents, creating Embaka: the first community-based anti-poaching conservation project focused on the African golden cat.

            Working with over 8,000 families across the cat's range, including Gabon, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, and Uganda, the project engages local communities — many of whom are former poachers — to deploy camera traps and report sightings.
    


            “We have learned a lot from local communities; the range expansion, for instance, some of that data comes from hunters,” says Mugerwa. Embaka offers incentives like dental care and livestock support to encourage communities to “speak out against hunting” and protect the forest ecosystem.
    


            Bringing reformed hunters on board not only reduces the threat the cats will face from hunting, but it also “improves the relationship between the African golden cat and the communities,” says Mugerwa.
    


            “It also allows the local communities to own and to be part of the camera trap grid, which is really beautiful to see,” he adds.

The Department of Justice has charged Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-FL) with stealing $5 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds and laundering it, and using the proceeds for her 2021 congressional campaign.

A federal grand jury in Miami handed down the indictment. McCormick was first elected to Congress in 2022 in a special election after the death of Rep. Alcee Hastings. She then won general elections in 2022 and 2024.

Cherfilus-McCormick and her brother's family healthcare company allegedly received a $5 million overpayment from FEMA in 2021 and hid the money through multiple accounts before rerouting a “substantial portion” of it to her congressional campaign.

She and co-conspirator Nadege Leblanc, 46, allegedly gave the illicit money to relatives who then donated to her campaign via a straw donor scheme.

Cherfilus-McCormick and her 2021 tax preparer, David K. Spencer, are also accused of conspiring to file a false federal tax return because they allegedly “falsely claimed political spending and other personal expenses as business deductions and inflated charitable contributions in order to reduce her tax obligations.”

Cherfilus-McCormick is the second House Democrat to be charged with a crime this year after Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ) was charged with impeding federal officers in June.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is from Florida, condemned Cherfilus-McCormick's actions. 

“Using disaster relief funds for self-enrichment is a particularly selfish, cynical crime,” she said in a statement. “No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain. We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.”

McCormick had been under the scrutiny of the House Ethics Committee after being referred by the Office of Congressional Ethics. 

SHEILA CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK MAY HAVE VIOLATED HOUSE RULES AND CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS, ETHICS PANEL SAYS

The Washington Examiner reported that the OCE recommended the Ethics Committee look into whether she requested community project funding for a for-profit entity, accepted campaign contributions linked to an official action, and whether her office either made payments to an entity or her campaign accepted and failed to report in-kind contributions

The DOJ said Cherfilus-McCormick faces up to 53 years in prison if convicted. Her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, faces up to 35 years, Spencer up to 33 years, and LeBlanc up to 10 years in prison.

Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack on Thursday gave indications that she thinks the central bank could be nearing the end of what could be a brief rate-cutting cycle.

The policymaker told CNBC that she thinks the current level of interest rates is "barely restrictive, if at all" when it comes to the economic impact. 

Restrictiveness is a key metric for Fed officials, who are divided ideologically over whether labor market weakness or inflation is a bigger threat. Hammack has been more in the hawkish camp when it comes to inflation, preferring higher rates and more restrictive policy as a bulwark against another surge in prices.

"I think that we need to maintain a modestly, somewhat restrictive stance of policy to make sure that we are continuing to bring inflation back down to our 2% objective," she told CNBC's Steve Liesman on "Squawk on the Street." "Right now, to me, monetary policy is barely restrictive, if at all, and I think we need to make sure that we're maintaining that somewhat restrictive stance to bring monetary to bring in place."

Hammack added that she thinks the current federal funds rate, targeted in a range between 3.75%-4%, is "right around a neutral rate," indicating it does not need to come down much further.

As a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year, Hammack serves as a key policy voice. 

The Fed next meets Dec. 9-10, and market expectations have swung from a near-certainty that the committee would approve a third consecutive quarter percentage point reduction to now pricing in about a 60% probability that the committee will stand pat, per the CME Group's FedWatch tracker of futures prices. Minutes from the October meeting, released Wednesday, detailed the sharp divide among committee members.

While focused on inflation, Hammack expressed concern over current price levels, noting that interviews she and her staff have conducted around the Cleveland area indicate labor market pressures as well as inflation concerns that are causing difficulty for households to make ends meet.

"What we hear from the workers is that they're holding on to their jobs for dear life, if they have them," she said. "We are in this slow,  this low-hiring, low-firing environment. But what I also heard ... was that the money that they have coming in is just not stretching as far as it used to. What used to cost $30 now costs $5, and so ... that inflationary pressure is still very salient for them."

Addressing the September nonfarm payrolls report released Thursday, Hammack called the picture "mixed" as it showed both higher-than-expected payrolls growth and a tick up in the unemployment rate.

Google on Thursday rolled out Nano Banana Pro, its latest image editing and generation tool, continuing the company's momentum after launching its new Gemini artificial intelligence model earlier this week.

The product is built on Gemini 3 Pro, which was announced on Tuesday and contributed to record-breaking stock highs.

Alphabet's stock was up 4% Thursday.

Josh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs and Gemini, told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa that the Nano Banana Pro's capabilities expand beyond its original iteration, which launched in late August. 

"It's incredible at infographics. It can make slide decks. It can take up to 14 different images, or five different characters, and sort of keep that character consistency," he said.

He added that internal users have experimented with the feature by inputting code snippets and even LinkedIn resumes to create infographics.

"I think this ability to visualize things that were previously maybe not something you would think of as a visual medium that tends to be one of the magic things people are finding with it," Woodward said. 

The original Nano Banana went viral on social media as users turned photos of themselves or their pets into hyperrealistic 3D figurines. Woodward wrote in an X post in September that the product helped add 13 million new users to the Gemini app in the span of four days.

Nano Banana Pro is currently available in the Gemini app, with limited free quotas, Google's writing assistant, NotebookLM, as well as the company's developer, enterprise and advertising products. 

Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will have access to the product in Google's search features AI Mode.

The feature will later also roll out to Ultra subscribers first in Flow, Google's AI filmmaking tool.

Google introduced another feature in the Gemini app that allows users to upload any image to find out if it was generated by Google AI. 

Images generated on free Nano Banana accounts will have a watermark, but it will be removed for Google AI Ultra tier subscribers.

Google has been working to gain ground on OpenAI in the generative AI race, which ignited after the release of ChatGPT in 2022. 

Last week, OpenAI announced two updates to its GPT-5 model to make it "warmer by default and more conversational" as well as " more efficient and easier to understand in everyday use," the company said. 

ChatGPT currently tops the list of free apps on Apple's App Store, with Gemini in the second spot.

The Gemini app currently has over 650 million monthly active users per month, and Gemini-powered AI Overviews has 2 billion monthly users, Google said in a release. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in October that ChatGPT had reached 800 million weekly active users.

Woodward said Google AI products have had growing demand, with many users signing up for Gemini's subscription plan to have "higher limits with some of these advanced models."

"We're seeing high numbers of people coming to lots of these products," he said. "That's really the best problem to have, is there's a lot of demand, and we're trying to figure out actually how to serve it."

The company is looking to continue scaling its AI offerings, Woodward said, highlighting Flow, Google's AI filmmaking tool, and Genie, a "world building" model that is currently available as a limited research preview.

When the U.S. Department of Education announced this week that it would transfer much of its programs to other agencies, it didn't appear that the country's federal student loan portfolio would be impacted. 

However, financial aid experts and consumer advocates are still worried for borrowers. 

More than 40 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. 

"What is concerning is the destabilization of the Department of Education and Federal Student Aid at the very moment when consistent, technically skilled oversight is most needed," said Carolina Rodriguez, director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York. 

The major overhaul of the agency is occurring at an especially challenging time for the federal student loan system. More than 5 million people are in default on their education debt, and President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminates several long-standing affordable repayment plans and relief options.

"Student loan eligibility and repayment involve multiple systems working together, and institutions need that process to be seamless, current and accurate," said Melanie Storey, president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. "As the delivery of other programs moves to other agencies, these dependencies must be carefully considered." 

On Tuesday, Trump administration officials said they had signed agreements with four federal agencies, including the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, to start managing programs currently under the Education Department.

The move is part of Trump's directive to dismantle the agency, experts said. Education Secretary Linda McMahon has argued that the recent government shutdown proved that the department is not needed.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration laid off nearly half of the Education Department's staffers.

"They are attempting to hollow out the U.S. Department of Education, leaving behind a shell of the original organization," said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

The Trump administration's goal of hobbling the Education Department will be difficult while the agency still oversees the massive federal student loan portfolio, experts say. But it may be trying to offload the debt. 

The new restructuring at the Education Department doesn't involve the loans, but Trump officials are exploring options to sell some of the debt to the private market, Politico reported in October.

Student loan borrowers have faced even more problems in the private market than with the government, consumer advocates said. When private companies played a bigger role in federal student lending in the past under the Federal Family Education Loan, of FFEL, program, Rodriguez said, "borrowers saw their debt balloon with no end in sight due to loan mismanagement." 

Any major loan transfer "will also result in errors that could harm borrowers and push relief further out of reach," said Aissa Canchola Banez, the policy director at Protect Borrowers. 

Currently, private lenders account for 8% of all student loans but are the subject of more than 40% of student debt complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, lawmakers recently wrote in a letter to Trump officials.

While artificial intelligence spending is forming a bubble in the market, investors don't need to give up their positions, according to Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio.

"Don't sell just because there's a bubble," Dalio said Thursday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "But if you look at the correlations with the next 10 years' returns, when you are in that territory, you get very low returns."

Dalio's comments come as AI darling Nvidia surged more than 5% Thursday on the back of better-than-expected earnings and guidance. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang brushed off bubble concerns, telling analysts on Wednesday that "we see something very different."

Nvidia's rally lifted the stock market, with Wall Street appearing to move past fears around the AI trade faltering that weighed on stocks in recent sessions. 

The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite has climbed nearly 17% in 2025, propelled by gains in megacap tech stocks amid continued excitement around AI.

While Dalio sees a bubble forming, he said there would also need to be something to pop it. The billionaire investor said it's unlikely to be tighter monetary policy, but it could come from higher wealth taxes.

"The picture is pretty clear, in that we are in that territory of a bubble," Dalio said. "But we don't have the pricking of the bubble yet."

Dalio said market participants should look to diversify their portfolios through investments like gold. The metal — which has long been viewed as a safe-haven trade — has surged to all-time highs this year.

Nvidia on Wednesday reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat expectations, and provided a strong forecast for the current quarter.

Wall Street welcomed the report, and Nvidia stock rose after the release and during the conference call. Other stocks in the so-called artificial intelligence trade also saw a boost.

A closer look at Nvidia's report shows that it continues to dominate the market for AI chips called GPUs, and CEO Jensen Huang sounded confident in the company's products and bullish on the company's outlook during a call with analysts. 

Nvidia said it expects about $65 billion in sales in the current quarter, which ends in late January. That would be 65% growth on an annual basis. 

Here are three key takeaways from Nvidia's earnings:

On Wednesday's earnings call with analysts, Huang began his comments by rejecting the premise of an "AI bubble" held by some investors who are concerned about the billions of dollars being spent on Nvidia chips and potential return on investment. 

"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Huang said. "From our vantage point, we see something very different."

Huang said there were three different kinds of uses for AI that are currently growing, and that all three are contributing to the boom in infrastructure investments.

He said that non-AI software, like for data processing, was increasingly being run on the company's GPUs, that AI will create new kinds of apps, and that "agentic AI" which doesn't need user input, will require additional computing power. 

Huang said that people will soon start appreciating what's happening underneath the surface of the AI boom, versus "the simplistic view of what's happening to CapEx and investment."

Bernstein analysts said in a note that Huang's comments helped settle investor fears of a bubble after a recent pullback in AI names, saying "perhaps the AI trade is not yet dead after all."

"More than just good numbers, we believe investors needed some hand-holding from Jensen which he provided in spades," the analysts wrote.

Last month, Huang said at a conference in Washington, DC, that his company had orders for $500 billion in AI chips in 2025 and 2026.

On Wednesday, the company said that the forecast was still on track. Any long-term outlook from Nvidia is important to the technology industry because Nvidia counts many of the most powerful technology customers as customers. 

Nvidia said on Wednesday that its order backlog didn't even include a few recent announcements, like the company's deal with Anthropic or the expansion of a deal with Saudi Arabia this week. 

"The number will grow," CFO Colette Kress said on the call, saying the company was on track to hit the forecast. "We'll probably be taking more orders."

"We see the opportunity to grow for quite some time," Huang said. 

Several analyst notes on Thursday drew attention to the $500 billion forecast and the addition of the recently announced deals.

Jefferies said Nvidia "answered the bell" in its earnings report and said the numbers should help steady the AI trade into the end of the year.

"We don't expect every AI bear to be satisfied, but these results and added context from management around demand outlook should offer some near-term reprieve," the analysts wrote.

Nvidia fought over the summer to gain licenses to export its H20 chip, a slowed-down version of 2022 technology, to China. Some analysts projected the China business could be worth $50 billion per year to Nvidia. 

The company eventually got the licenses this summer after Huang personally met with President Donald Trump and struck a deal to give the U.S. government 15% of China sales. 

But it turns out that the sales of H20 chips during the quarter was "insignificant." Kress told analysts that the company recorded $50 million in H20 sales during the period. 

"Sizable purchase orders never materialized in the quarter due to geopolitical issues and the increasingly competitive market in China," Kress said. 

Nvidia has argued that the U.S. government should allow exports of the most advanced chips because it's better for national security if Chinese developers get used to Nvidia technology, rather than being forced to use Chinese chips and make them better.

The H20 is old technology, but Nvidia wants to gain approval to send a version of its current-generation Blackwell chip in China. 

"While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the US and China governments and will continue to advocate for America's ability to compete around the world," Kress said.

Analysts at Melius said Thursday that the lack of China sales made the numbers "all the more extraordinary" and projected Nvidia would generate nearly $400 billion in free cash flow over the next nine quarters.

"Currently Nvidia isn't delivering to China and we are not counting on this situation to get straightened out," the firm said.

One week into what baristas have threatened to make the "largest, longest" strike in Starbucks' history, the Workers United union said it is adding more than two dozen new cities and stores to its strike count. 

The union said Thursday it will now be striking at 95 stores in 65 cities, with some 2,000 baristas now engaged in the action. On Wednesday, baristas and allies also picketed and held a rally outside of the company's distribution center in York, Pa. Starbucks said there were no disruptions to its operations in York.

Workers United said the majority of stores where strikes were held had to close down on the first day of the strike due to staffing issues, and the lack of workers impacted some 50 locations in the days to follow. Starbucks said stores that had issues were often able to reopen quickly and that less than 1% of its locations are experiencing disruption from the strike.

The strike has so far not appeared to dent foot traffic and sales, according to the company and data from Placer.ai. The location intelligence tracking firm's data show foot traffic on Red Cup Day, when the strike was launched, was up 44.5% compared to the daily average between Jan. 1 and Nov. 14 this year.

In a memo to workers last week, CEO Brian Niccol touted the success of the holiday launch so far. 

"Together, we set new records. Last Thursday's Holiday launch was our biggest sales day ever in North America. Then yesterday, we had our strongest Reusable Red Cup day in company history," the memo sent Friday said. 

The union began organizing at Starbucks in 2021 and says it now represents more than 11,000 workers across more than 550 stores. This week, it said five non-union stores filed for union elections, including locations in the Baltimore, Md. area, Harrisonburg, Va., and Little Rock, Ark. The company last week told CNBC that the union only represents 9,500 workers. 

Workers United is seeking new proposals that address its top issues to finalize a contract. Those include improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges levied against Starbucks. The two parties have not been in active negotiations to reach a contract after talks between them fell apart late last year. The strikes have not changed that fact so far.

Starbucks and the union entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April. Both sides have pointed blame at the other for failure to reach a bargaining agreement, and say they're ready to negotiate.

The strike has threatened to hurt business during Starbucks' busy holiday season, which typically provides a sales boost and will be key to the chain's plan to turn around performance in the U.S. under Niccol. Starbucks broke a nearly two-year streak of same-store sales declines in its most recently reported quarter. Past strikes have impacted less than 1% of its stores, the company said.

Starbucks maintains it will be ready to serve customers across its stores this holiday season.

"As we've said, 99% of our 17,000 U.S. locations remain open and welcoming customers —including many the union publicly stated would strike but never closed or have since reopened," Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said in a statement regarding the strike escalation.

"Regardless of the union's plans, we do not anticipate any meaningful disruption. When the union is ready to return to the bargaining table, we're ready to talk," Anderson said. "The facts are clear, Starbucks offers the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging $30 per hour for hourly partners. People choose to work here and stay here—our turnover is less than half the industry average, and we receive more than a million job applications every year."

Abbott said on Thursday it would buy cancer test maker Exact Sciences in an up to $23 billion deal, bolstering the medical device maker's diagnostics business.

This marks one of Abbott's largest deals in nearly a decade and its first major push into cancer screening with preventative diagnostic devices.

The transaction would bring Exact Sciences' flagship colorectal cancer test Cologuard into Abbott's diagnostics portfolio, helping offset revenue declines from its Covid-19 testing kits. 

As part of the agreement, Exact Sciences shareholders will receive $105 apiece in cash, implying a premium of about 21.8% to the stock's last closing price. Exact shares jumped more than 17% in premarket trading, while Abbott was down nearly 2%.

The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026 after Exact Sciences' shareholder approval.

Business leaders, including Elon Musk and AMD CEO Lisa Su, joined a dinner with President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House on Tuesday.

The guest list, shared by the White House, included members of the Saudi government and royal family, as well as almost 50 US business executives. Soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo also attended.

The dinner was the Tesla CEO's first public visit to the White House since his bitter feud with Trump this summer, following Musk's departure from his role as leader of the White House DOGE Office.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev were on the guest list, but it is unclear if they attended the event.

Here is a list of US executives who attended the high-profile dinner.

Elon Musk made a rare public appearance at the White House since his falling-out with Trump earlier this year, after stepping down as the informal head of the White House DOGE Office.

The world's richest man and head of Tesla, SpaceX, and X, Musk exerts significant influence in technology, energy, and artificial intelligence — industries central to both the US and Saudi economic ambitions.

Nvidia chief Jensen Huang attended the White House dinner as one of the most influential figures in artificial intelligence and chipmaking.

Nvidia's CEO's presence underscored the pivotal role of advanced computing in US-Saudi economic relations and the global competition to dominate AI technology.

Apple chief Tim Cook joined the White House dinner as one of the most powerful figures in global business, representing a tech giant that shapes everything from consumer tech to privacy standards.

His appearance highlighted Apple's pivotal role in US innovation — and its importance to any conversation about the future of tech and trade.

AMD's Lisa Su was among the high-profile executives at the White House dinner, bringing the perspective of one of the world's top chipmakers.

As the leader driving fierce competition in semiconductors — a sector vital to both AI development and global supply chains — Su's inclusion signaled the critical importance of her industry to US strategy.

Late on Wednesday evening, Su shared photos from the dinner, including one of her sitting with Ronaldo.

Billionaire investor Bill Ackman attended the White House dinner as one of Wall Street's most outspoken figures.

Known for his bold market bets and influence in finance and policy circles, Ackman's presence reflected the growing alignment between political power and the capital shaping global markets.

OpenAI president Greg Brockman joined the White House dinner as a key architect behind the modern AI revolution.

His invitation underscored the growing importance of artificial intelligence in diplomacy and economic strategy, with OpenAI's technology now at the center of global debates about innovation and regulation.

Venture capitalist and White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks was among the attendees at the dinner, reflecting his growing influence at the intersection of tech, politics, and finance.

As both an early investor in major startups and the chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, Sacks embodies the blend of innovation and policymaking that defined the evening's guest list.

In December, Trump appointed Sacks as White House's AI and crypto czar, guiding the government on policy and regulation around the digital asset industry.

Coinbase's chief, Brian Armstrong, attended the White House dinner as the leading voice in America's cryptocurrency industry.

His presence showed the increasing importance of digital assets in global finance and the White House's commitment to engaging with fintech leaders who are shaping the future of money.

One analyst has taken a dimmer view of two AI kingmakers this week.

Alex Haissl, an analyst at Rothschild & Co Redburn, is a lonely dissenting voice among research analysts when it comes to shares of Amazon and Microsoft. In a note to clients this week, Haissl downgraded the firm's rating on the tech giants despite the ongoing hype for generative AI and the billions both firms have pledged to spend on the new tech in the coming years.

Investors look like they're valuing Amazon and Microsoft's capex plans as "as if cloud-1.0 economics still applied," Haissl wrote, referring to the low-cost structure of cloud-based services that allowed Big Tech firms to boom in the 2010s.

But there are a few problems that suggest the AI boom likely won't play out in the same way, and it is is probably far more costly than investors realize, he said.

"We downgrade Amazon and Microsoft with a heavy heart," Haissl wrote, noting that the firm had held a bullish view on the two stocks for the last several years.

"But after turning over every stone, we no longer see a credible path back to cloud 1.0 economics. The market, however, still prices in that outcome, implying returns we believe are no longer achievable," he added.

There are key differences between the business model for "cloud 1.0" and generative AI, Haissl said.

For one, AI is far more costly. According to Rothchild's analysis, a GPU costs firms around $40 billion in capex per gigawatt of power.

It's also believed to generate less revenue. Each GPU generates around $10 billion of revenue per gigawatt, per the firm's calculations.

Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Apple are on track to spend around $349 billion in capex this year, much of which is directed toward AI infrastructure, according to company statements.

"We are not concerned about operating margins; those can be managed. The real constraint is the capex required relative to the growth delivered," Haissl said, later adding that he believed the market was overestimating the returns related to AI investment.

Second, AI chips are also known to have a short lifespan, another factor that can make projects costly. If a GPU were to be replaced every three years, projects would turn "value destructive," according to Rothchild's estimates, implying losses for the owners of the chips.

Third, hyperscalers have limited pricing power, Haissl said, pointing to the expenses associated with AI hardware, which is largely provided by tech startups.

"Passing higher costs on to startups would simply deepen their losses unless those costs could be pushed through to end users; if not, hyperscaler economics deteriorate further," he said.

Amazon and Microsoft already look like they're "re-rated meaningfully" in price, Haissl said, pointing to the recent declines in both stocks. Amazon shares are down around 13% from their peak in early November, while Microsoft shares are down 10% from their peak in late October.

"While there may still be some upside to growth, we believe it is limited relative to buy-side expectations and, more importantly, less relevant given the low value of that growth," Haissl said.

That's not to say the firm is turning completely negative on Amazon and Microsoft. It's hard to hash out a bear case for the near-term for these stocks, Haissl wrote, adding that the firm believed both would continue to post strong growth figures over the next year.

"In our view, it is not a bear case — but it is no longer a bull case either," he said, adding that the firm would need to see high growth and a "meaningful reduction in capex" in order to turn more optimistic.

It's a fragile time for the AI trade, with tech stocks sinking in recent weeks as investors take stock of high valuations and begin to doubt the billions being sown into AI-related investments. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is down 6% from its high in late October. 

The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which tracks the seven tech titans at the heart of the AI trade, is down 7% from its peak last month.

Nvidia's blockbuster earnings just blew a hole through Wall Street's AI bubble anxieties.

Analysts said the chipmaker's third-quarter results prove the AI boom is nowhere near running out of steam.

On Wednesday, Nvidia posted $57 billion in revenue, topping Wall Street's $55 billion estimates. Its data center division generated revenue of $51 billion, surpassing the $49.31 billion analysts had projected. The company reported earnings of $1.30 per share compared to the $1.26 estimate. It also forecast $65 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations of $61.98 billion.

Nvidia's stock rose more than 5% in premarket trading on Thursday.

"Fears of an AI bubble are way overstated," Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote after the print. The tech bull called the results a "pop-the-champagne moment" for tech investors.

"This is another validation point for the AI revolution," Ives wrote. "We are in the top of the third inning of this AI game."

Other analysts echoed that view. Thomas Monteiro, a senior analyst at Investing.com, said Nvidia's report shows the AI revolution is "nowhere near its peak," with both demand and supply chain scaling continuing.

Despite concerns that ballooning capital expenditures — estimated at more than $400 billion across top cloud platforms — could lead to a slowdown, Monteiro said Nvidia's numbers show that tech companies remain committed to scaling their data centers.

Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said investors remain wary of what he calls the "three C's" — capex sustainability, circular financing, and rising competition.

"While these issues were not put to rest, the recent print does give investors confidence that Nvidia is still executing at a high level," he wrote. Nvidia's results suggest those fears can at least be "punted" into the next quarter, he added.

EMARKETER tech analyst Jacob Bourne told Business Insider that while Nvidia "delivered another blockbuster quarter," investors are increasingly focused on whether physical constraints — including power availability, land, and grid access — may limit how quickly hyperscalers can turn GPU capacity into actual revenue.

During the earnings call, Nvidia reiterated that it has "half a trillion" in Blackwell and Rubin chip revenue on the books through 2026.

"We'll probably be taking more orders," said Colette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, noting that new customers — including Anthropic following its recent deal — would add demand. "There's definitely an opportunity for us to have more on top of the $500 billion that we announced," she added.

CEO Jensen Huang revealed at Nvidia's October GTC conference that the company has $500 billion worth of AI-chip orders booked for 2025 and 2026, including orders for Blackwell, its most powerful chip, and Rubin, which is set to surpass it when it launches next year.

"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out," Huang said in Nvidia's earnings release.

Jefferies' analysts said that Nvidia's Blackwell GB300 GPU sales, which accounted for two-thirds of Blackwell sales, were "very strong."

"Nvidia answered the bell with GB300 shipments driving healthy upside to estimates," they wrote. They said that Nvidia's results "should help steady the ship" for AI stocks into the end of the year.

"Commentary around cloud service providers being sold out across the board and full utilization for Blackwell, Hopper, and even Ampere should help put the useful life conversation to bed," the analysts added.

The Nvidia CEO kicked off his remarks on Wednesday by taking aim at the "AI bubble" chatter.

"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," said Huang, who is a longtime AI bull. "From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference."

Some tech leaders have been warning that AI may be in bubble territory.

Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said in October that the market could be in the middle of an AI bubble.

"The value is extremely high, just like creating the internet ended up being, in net, very valuable," Gates said in an appearance on CNBC's "Squawk Box". "But you have a frenzy. And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they'll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive."

"There are a ton of these investments that will be dead ends," he added.

Michael Burry, the contrarian investor who called and profited from the 2008 financial crisis, has also been warning about AI market mania — and betting against Nvidia.

Others, like Huang, have pushed back on the AI bubble narrative.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said in July that the AI frenzy may resemble a bubble, but that doesn't mean it is one in reality.

"I think it's unlikely, based on my experience, that this is a bubble," Schmidt said during an appearance at the RAISE Summit in Paris. "It's much more likely that you're seeing a whole new industrial structure."

Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said both sides of the debate could take something away from Nvidia's earnings.

"Overall the bulls got what they wanted last night, while bearish investors (hello, Michael Burry) will still be able to argue that such exuberant spending will ultimately end in tears," he said.

The Sam Altman-founded company behind the "Orb," a volleyball-sized metal sphere that scans irises to prove people's humanity, had a message for employees: work weekends and ignore anything outside your job — for the good of humanity.

During a January all-hands with employees of the startup, Tools for Humanity, CEO Alex Blania laid out his expectations.

"We will neither fail, nor will we be an average outcome, and that's what we want and that's all I care about every day and all you should care about every day, and nothing else should matter," Blania said, according to a recording reviewed by Business Insider. "If you should care about something else, and if you want something else, you should just not be here. It's as simple as that."

The company's mission is to build a global digital identity system that can verify who is human in an increasingly AI-driven world. Blania said it exists solely to achieve that goal — and that anything else is a distraction.

"We don't care about politics, we don't care about DEI, we don't care about anything, we just care about how can we achieve the mission through merit, performance, and excellence," said Blania, who also told staffers he had recently attended President Donald Trump's inauguration in Washington, DC.

Several "team values" displayed on a television screen in the start-up's now-former San Francisco office echoed Blania's messaging, a February video viewed by Business Insider shows.

"We are very (very) hard working. We believe this is a once in a lifetime project and that success is important for humanity," one read. "Therefore, we work weekends, we're always on call, and we push as hard as our circumstances allow us to. As a result we defy the odds, get to escape velocity and succeed on the mission."

Other values included a warning that the company doesn't "tolerate slowness and comfort," as well as the idea that "we have no place for talkers, ideology, or politics. We don't have time to worry about each other's feelings; we say what needs to be said."

The values were written by Blania, according to a former employee.

"The organization's transparency about its values and operating principles has resulted in building a team that is passionate and focused on its increasingly urgent mission of ensuring every human benefits from the age of AI," a Tools for Humanity spokesperson told Business Insider.

The core values currently include optimism about the project, individual responsibility, and clear thinking.

The company's philosophy reflects a broader corporate trend toward hardcore culture.

John Stankey, AT&T's CEO, sent the company's managers a frank memo about its return-to-office policy and told workers to prioritize performance and accountability over loyalty or comfort. Business Insider previously reported on Amazon's "hardcore culture reset."

During the January meeting, Blania said that the company aimed to deploy an additional 3,000 Orbs to verify 30 million users by the end of the quarter, and that it wanted 100 million verifications by the end of the year.

He has described the company's overarching goal as reaching a billion users. Business Insider previously reported that, so far, Tools for Humanity has verified around 17.5 million people — a little under 2% of its target.

Employees were also encouraged during the January meeting to use artificial intelligence to boost productivity.

"We're here as a company that's trying to solve problems in the AI world," said Damien Kieran, whose LinkedIn describes him as the company's chief legal and privacy officer. "We also probably don't use AI as much as we should."

To address this, he said, the IT team was negotiating a new deal with ChatGPT Enterprise — the large language model sold by Altman's OpenAI. Business Insider has reported that there were also discussions around integrating Tools for Humanity's cryptocurrency World project with OpenAI to verify those using its services.

OpenAI didn't respond to a request for comment.

ChatGPT wasn't the only artificial intelligence tool being employed by Tools for Humanity. Staffers were told that another AI model — which directly competes with Altman's flagship venture — would soon be accessible.

"Gemini Enterprise will also be available by the end of the month to everybody," Kieran said. "All of the Gemini AI stuff that Google has to offer will be available to folks."

Ukraine could face some tough choices amid reports that the U.S. and Russia have secretly formulated a peace plan to end the war, potentially including significant concessions to Moscow.

Senior U.S. military officials are in Ukraine on Thursday "on a fact finding mission to meet with Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war" with Russia, a U.S. army spokesman said.

The visit comes a day after media reports suggested Washington and Moscow had held secret talks and devised a new 28-point peace plan for Ukraine, without Kyiv's involvement.

The 28-point plan — first reported by Axios but followed by other media, including the Financial Times and Reuters, citing unnamed sources — allegedly contains proposals for Ukraine to concede territory in its eastern Donbas region to Russia, abandon certain categories of weaponry and reduce the size of its armed forces by 50%, among other conditions. 

One report in The Telegraph newspaper suggested that Russia could take control of the Donbas region despite Ukraine maintaining legal ownership, with Moscow essentially paying rent for the land. CNBC was unable to confirm the information contained within the media reports.

A senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that Kyiv had received "signals" about a set of U.S. proposals to end the war, but that Kyiv had had no role in preparing the proposals, the unnamed source said.

The Kremlin on Wednesday denied that there had been any "innovations on possible peace proposals" since Russian President Vladimir Putin had met U.S. President Donald Trump in August. When asked specifically about the Axios report, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was nothing he could share publicly.

Meanwhile, the White House has not explicitly confirmed the existence of the 28-point peace plan, reportedly modeled on the Gaza peace agreement, but U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that new proposals were in the works.

"Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas," Rubio posted on X overnight Wednesday. 

"Achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict," he said.

Ukraine leadership has not publicly commented on the 28-point plan, but peace proposals are expected to form part of Thursday's talks between President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the U.S. delegation of military officials.

On Wednesday, Zelenskyy commented that "only President Trump and the United States have sufficient power to make this war come to an end."

He said Kyiv had "supported every decisive step and the leadership of [President Trump], every strong and fair proposal aimed at ending this war," and added that Ukraine was "ready to work in any other meaningful formats that could yield results."

Ukraine's First Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia addressed reports of the peace plan head-on, however, suggesting in a post on X that Moscow was behind a push to hype up "a factory of unrealistic plans."

Whether Ukraine would accept such concessions to end the war is highly uncertain, with pushback likely. 

However, Kyiv finds itself in a vulnerable position given its reliance on the U.S. for military aid, and although it still has staunch support from its European allies, military and financial aid are slower to materialize now than in the early days of the war.

Still, European diplomats appear unhappy at the reports of a peace plan lacking Ukrainian or regional involvement, with the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas commenting Thursday that "for any plan to work, it needs to have Ukrainians and Europeans on board."

"In this war, there is one aggressor and one victim. So far, we haven't heard of any concessions from Russia's side," she told reporters.

Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War said that if the reports are true, the 28-peace plan would amount to "Ukraine's full capitulation and would set conditions for renewed Russian aggression against Ukraine."

"The reported proposed peace plan would deprive Ukraine of critical defensive positions and capabilities necessary to defend against future Russian aggression, apparently in exchange for nothing," the ISW analysts said Wednesday. 

They noted it would "give this significant land to Russia — apparently for no specified compromise — sparing Russia the time, effort, and manpower that it could use elsewhere in Ukraine during renewed aggression." 

The ISW concluded that the plan, if verified, showed Russia's maximalist territorial demands on Ukraine had essentially not changed since the initial invasion in 2022. "This reported peace plan is fundamentally the same as Russia's 2022 Istanbul demands, which Russia presented to Ukraine when the circumstances on the battlefield appeared to favor Russia more heavily."

Global tech stocks rallied Thursday as investors piled back into AI-related names, buoyed by Nvidia earnings. 

Nvidia topped forecasts for revenue, which jumped 62% to $57.01 billion year-on-year, and issued stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter sales guidance, giving investors the confidence they were looking for to continue placing bets on the AI industry. Shares were 5% higher in premarket trade.

In Europe, Dutch semiconductor firms BESI and ASMI moved up over 3% and 2% in the first hours of trading, respectively. ASML, which makes critical equipment for semiconductors, gained 2.1%.

Asia-listed stocks Samsung Electronics and Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, climbed 3.5% and 3.3% higher, respectively. 

Stateside, investors flocked to tech stocks in premarket trade: AMD rose 5%, Arm gained almost 4%, Micron Technology advanced 2.7%, Marvell Technology added 3.3%, Broadcom was last seen 3.1% up and Intel moved 2% higher.

Dan Hanbury, global equity portfolio manager at Ninety One, which holds Nvidia as its second-largest holding in its global strategic equity fund, cautiously welcomed Nvidia's share price jump in Thursday's premarket trade.

"As a holder, it's great to see an early positive reaction but of course as we know those reactions can reverse further into the day," Hanbury told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

"Our reading of the numbers is they are very strong. Clearly, we can get caught up in the quarterly noise of a company like this but if we just put those [numbers] in context … only three years ago they were delivering $15 billion of data center revenue, we're now looking at consensus forecasts into next year of $280 billion," Hanbury said. "That is phenomenal growth that these guys are delivering."

Karen McCormick, chief investment officer at London-based venture capital company Beringea, spoke with CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" about some of the recent moves to bulk-up on AI and scale, particularly following Nvidia and Microsoft's recent push to invest up to $15 billion in OpenAI rival Anthropic.

"It's always a little bit intimidating to contradict Jensen Huang right after he has made phenomenal earnings results but in terms of the almost incestuousness of the valley and the AI companies, it is more than we have seen in the past," McCormick said.

"I mean, if you think about traditionally, we might have called something like this vendor financing, where your vendor is helping to support the business," McCormick said. "In this case we are just doing it with hundreds of billions of dollars and the ecosystem itself is now so intertwined that it's almost a little bit nerve-wracking because if we are in a bubble and if any of that bubble bursts, what is going to happen to all of the related businesses?"

The culmination of circular dealmaking, debt issuances and high valuations added pressure to the market ahead of Nvidia's much-anticipated results, despite other Big Tech firms posting solid quarterly earnings. 

"The flip side to that is that each of them has incredibly robust balance sheets and incredibly robust investors, who may not let them fail either way," McCormick said.

Quilter Cheviot's global head of technology research and investment strategist Ben Barringer, added that Nvidia's valuation isn't "particularly excessive."

Valuations aren't that streteched when you look at the core big tech companies, he told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Thursday. 

In terms of debt that's also at the peripheral, he said. While Meta and Amazon have raised debt, "they're still net cash positioned," Barringer added. 

"I think it's more about them managing their treasury position and managing their balance sheet, as it were. Yes, it's not great that they are doing some of this capex from debt, but it's nowhere near as bad as 1999 where these were very heavily levered telecom companies doing a lot of this capex."

However, Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, told CNBC on Thursday that Nvidia is not a bubble barometer. "The concern is about companies raising a lot of debt to build data centers," he said. 

"Any concerns about Nvidia were certainly laid to rest [with Nvidia's earnings], but that doesn't mean that we don't need to keep an eye on companies lending or borrowing to build data centers," Luria added.

Nvidia on Wednesday stateside reported fiscal third-quarter figures that beat analyst expectations (ironically, nothing unexpected there). It also provided guidance for sales in the current quarter that exceeded estimates (all good still). It was CEO Jensen Huang's comment, however, that piqued more interest. 

"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on an earnings call. "From our vantage point, we see something very different."

Of course, this could be the regular sales pitch all CEOs have to do on earnings calls. Which leader is going to publicly put down their business model? Having said that, Huang might be intimating that, because of the insight Nvidia has into the artificial intelligence industry — such as precise sales figures, the relationships and deals still being forged, clients' plans on utilizing data centers — the sum of the sector is more than its parts.

That could be hopeful thinking. And there was some uncertainty regarding Nvidia's announced $100 billion investment in OpenAI. 

But investors certainly cheered Huang's statement and the chipmaker's results. Shares of Nvidia popped more than 5% in extended trading, after its post-bell earnings announcement. Prior to that, shares rose 2.85% in regular trading, pushing up major indexes.

Regardless of what the AI industry and trade might look like in the future, from investors' perspectives, Nvidia's earnings are clearly something to celebrate for today.

The S&P 500 snaps a four-day losing streak. Major benchmarks rose Wednesday stateside as investors returned to tech stocks, with Alphabet touching a new high. Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose Thursday as Asian chip stocks rallied on Nvidia's blockbuster results. 

Nvidia's numbers beat forecasts. Fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue were higher than Wall Street's estimates, with net income rising 65% year on year to $31.91 billion. Nvidia's guidance for sales in the current quarter also beat expectations. 

The Fed is divided on a December cut. "Many" officials think interest rates do not need to be lowered further for the rest of the year, but "several" assessed a reduction could be "appropriate in December," according to minutes of their October meeting. 

Singapore's bourse ties up with the Nasdaq. The partnership streamlines the process of attaining a dual listing in the U.S. and Singapore for companies with a market capitalization of more than 2 billion Singapore dollars (about $1.5 billion).

[PRO] Nvidia's earnings shine but questions remain. Even though markets got a "pop the champagne moment," as one analyst wrote, others are questioning the long-term viability of the AI business.

China's homegrown games capture overseas players as its cultural influence expands

From Nezha 2 to Labubu, it's been quite a year for Chinese cultural exports. Now, one of the latest titles to hit the $189 billion global gaming market is also from China. 

More than 2 million people played the martial arts video game "Where Winds Meet" within 24 hours of its overseas release this past weekend on PlayStation and PC, according to the game's Chinese publisher NetEase — and China's emerging soft power in games has captured the attention of wealthy investors in Saudi Arabia.

Business Insider Edition 

Duduzile Zuma, daughter of former President Jacob Zuma, is at the centre of a growing scandal after different families revealed she helped send young Southern African men to Russia, where they were later deployed to the war in Ukraine.


        The daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma has been implicated in the recruitment of young men from South Africa and Botswana to join Russian forces in the war in Ukraine, according to relatives of the recruits and WhatsApp correspondence reviewed by Bloomberg.



        The allegations have raised concerns within South Africa's government, which recently launched a formal investigation into the recruitment of its citizens for foreign military service.
    


        According to relatives of the recruits, approximately 20 men were approached by Duduzile Zuma and told they would participate in a bodyguard training programme for Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MKP).
    


        The men reportedly travelled to Russia in July, signed military contracts in Russian, and were subsequently sent to frontline areas in Ukraine.
    


        Photographs reviewed by Bloomberg show the group in Russia, first traveling together and later wearing camouflage alongside instructors. WhatsApp messages between Duduzile Zuma and some parents indicate that the recruits were assured they would not be sent into combat.
    


        “The recruits thought they were signing documents for the bodyguard course,” several relatives said.
    


        In one exchange, a recruit wrote: “As we speak now, we are packing and preparing to move to the war zone,” with Duduzile Zuma replying: “It's not the frontline. They are just scaring you… you may just patrol or be put on cooking duties or gun cleaning,” adding she would retrieve them “personally” if required. Families report losing contact with the men in August.
    


        Although South African law has prohibited citizens from serving as mercenaries or fighting for foreign governments since 1998, reports of its citizens being recruited to join Russia's war effort have risen sharply this year.
    


        Economic hardship and high unemployment have made young people across the continent increasingly vulnerable to offers of “training” or well-paid security jobs abroad.
    


        Similar recruitment cases have emerged in Kenya, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Nigeria and several other countries.
    


        Prior to these disclosure, Business Insider Africa reported that the South African government had received distress calls from 17 citizens trapped in Ukraine after joining Russian forces. In response, President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered a formal investigation. “President Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered an investigation into the circumstances that led to the recruitment of these young men into these seemingly mercenary activities,” the Presidency said.
    


        Officials have confirmed that diplomatic efforts are ongoing to secure the safe return of those involved.
    


        Duduzile Zuma has yet to respond to requests for comment. Attempts to reach the MKP, the South African Presidency, the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, the Russian Embassy, and Russia's foreign ministry were unsuccessful.
    


        Meanwhile, Jacob Zuma's own legal challenges remain unresolved, with a recent court ruling declaring his medical parole unlawful and ordering him to return to prison to serve the remainder of his 15-month sentence.
    


        At the same time, relatives and available evidence suggest that Duduzile Zuma has previously shared pro-Russian content on social media, including images from Russia and posts critical of President Cyril Ramaphosa.
    


        She is also currently facing trial for allegedly inciting violence on social media during the 2021 unrest.
    


        South African news outlets report that Jacob Zuma wrote to Russia's defence minister requesting the removal of 18 South Africans from the combat zone, citing that they had been misled into signing infantry contracts in Pskov, near Estonia.
    


        The involvement of African nationals in Ukraine highlights the international dimension of the conflict. According to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, at least 1,436 individuals from 36 African countries are currently fighting alongside Russian forces.
    


        This figure excludes Africans who were already residing in Russia prior to the war and subsequently volunteered or were recruited to join the conflict.

Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang pushed back against fears of an AI bubble on the company's blowout earnings call on Wednesday.

"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Huang said. "From our vantage point, we see something very different." 

Coming from the world's most valuable company that powers nearly every major AI data center, that vantage point matters.

Huang said that AI is fueling three transformative shifts that Nvidia is uniquely poised to capitalize on.

The first stems from the slowdown of Moore's Law — a trend that's seen computer chips double in power roughly every two years. As that progress stalls, companies are shifting from traditional chips to GPUs, which Nvidia specializes in building to power AI systems.

Huang also cited the rise of generative AI, which is transforming search and recommendations at companies like Meta. Finally, he cited the shift to agentic AI and physical AI—which power coding assistants and robotics—as other game-changing opportunities.

"Nvidia is chosen because our singular architecture enables all three transitions and does so for any form and modality of AI across all industries," Huang said.

Before Nvidia's earnings report, concerns about a potential AI bubble were swirling. Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus, wrote that a key concern was that spending by major cloud companies may be "moving into bubble territory" and could prove difficult to sustain.

On the earnings call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said that the company's chips are being used at full capacity. 

"The clouds are sold out," she said, and the company's GPU installed base is "fully utilized."

Beyond Huang's remarks, the company's earnings spoke volumes. Nvidia reported record quarterly revenue of $57 billion, up 62% year-over-year. And it's forecasting more growth ahead — to the tune of $65 billion in the fourth quarter. Shares were up about 5% in after-hours trading.

The strong results rippled across the chip sector. Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor each rose more than 7% in after-hours trading, while AMD climbed over 6% and Oracle gained more than 5%.

Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, who has in the past has said he owns some bitcoin BTC$86,401.96, put a clearer figure on it, saying it's been about 1% of his portfolio for some time.

However, the hedge fund mogul said bitcoin still faces significant structural challenges before it can realistically be considered a global reserve asset.

"I have a small percentage of bitcoin,” he told CNBC on Thursday. “I've had it forever, like 1% of my portfolio.”

Hindering its adoption as a reserve currency, said Dalio, are issues such as its traceability, transactional transparency and vulnerabilities in light of the progress of quantum computing.

“I think the problem of bitcoin is it's not going to be a reserve currency for major countries because it can be tracked and it could be, conceivably with quantum computing controlled, hacked, and so on and so forth," Dalio said, stressing governments will not adopt financial products that record in a public and permanent way.

Recently, Dalio called on investors to allocate 15% of their portfolios to bitcoin and gold, an asset which he says he prefers. “The advantage of gold is that it's an asset you can hold, and you're not dependent on someone to provide it.”

In a broader sense, Dalio warned the U.S. economy is nearly 80% of the way into a bubble similar to those that preceded the 1929 crash and the dot-com era collapse of 2000.

The multi-billionaire hedge fund manager explained his predictions come from his bubble indicator, which tracks data going back to 1900. He said it tracks multiple metrics, including leverage, money supply, and wealth concentration, to evaluate market vulnerability.

“The picture is pretty clear, in that we are in that territory of a bubble,” Dalio said.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin extended its recent slide Thursday, diving below the $87,000 mark for the first time since April as traders weighed the prospects of a third rate cut this year following the delayed release of September jobs data.

The price of Bitcoin has fallen as low as $86,520 on the day, with a nearly 3% daily fall that's extended the leading cryptocurrency's weekly dive to 13.5% as of this writing.

Bitcoin has plunged by 31% since setting a new all-time high mark above $126,000 in early October.

Overall crypto market liquidations have surged over the past hour, currently sitting at $933 million across all crypto assets over the last 24 hours, per CoinGlass. Bitcoin leads the losses on the day, with $380 million worth of liquidated positions, followed by Ethereum at $239 million.

Ethereum and XRP are showing slightly sharper daily losses, both down about 3% as of this writing to prices of $2,827 and $2.00, respectively. ETH is down 15% over the past week, with XRP's loss in the same period nearing 18%.

Stocks are similarly falling on the day, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both showing losses in excess of 1% as of this writing.

Proposed Bitcoin for America Bill Would Enable BTC Tax Payments, Which Go to Reserve

Optimism over a potential December rate cut—which Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell tried to temper hype for in late October—has fallen in recent days, with analysts and traders now betting against cuts.

According to CME's FedWatch tool, just 37.6% of interest rate traders expect a 25 bps cut in December, while over 62% expect no change. The odds were effectively even just one week ago. On prediction market Polymarket, the odds show a similar spread, with a 63% likelihood of no change, flipping on late Tuesday as optimism faded.

September's delayed U.S. jobs report, issued Thursday following last week's government reopening, shows that the country added 119,000 jobs during the month. That's better than expected, but analysts have said the report doesn't provide clarity for traders.

"The September jobs report is a mixed bag," wrote Navy Federal Credit Union Chief Economist Heather Long on X. "It's encouraging that more people are looking for work (the labor force grew +470,000). But more people are also unemployed now (+219,000)."

"The Fed probably won't cut in December," she added.

Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) slump deepened Thursday just as U.S. stocks gave back gains fueled by Nvidia's (NVDA) Q3 earnings beat, in a sign of renewed investor caution.

The cryptocurrency retreated 4.7% in the last 24 hours to $87.2K as of 12:12 p.m. ET. Ether (

11/20 update below. This post was originally published on November 19

Bitcoin, ethereum and smaller cryptocurrencies have plunged over the last month as crash fears suddenly sweep through the market.

The bitcoin price has dropped under $100,000 per bitcoin, giving up the psychological level and dragging ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies lower even as analysts claim the liquidity “flood gates” have been opened.

Now, as traders brace for a potential $1 trillion bitcoin and crypto market crash, the threat to crypto from quantum computers has led to ethereum cofounder and the project's spiritual leader Vitalik Buterin warning elliptic curve cryptography could break before the next U.S. presidential election in 2028.

“Elliptic curves are going to die,” Buterin warned, referring to one of the foundational pillars of bitcoin, ethereum and crypto encryption, during the Buenos Aires Devconnect conference in comments reported by DL News.

11/20 update: Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin has also warned that the growing influence of Wall Street giant BlackRock over cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and ethereum could cause problems for the networks.

“How do you avoid capture by big behemoths like BlackRock?” Buterin was asked on stage, according to a DL News report, referring to a surge of institutional interest after the launch of BlackRock's bitcoin and ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024.

Buterin warned that if BlackRock and other large institutions keep expanding their ethereum holdings, the network faces the possibility that those focused on decentralization get crowded out and base-layer choices are optimized for institutions, making it harder for regular users to run nodes, and in turn driving centralization. 

“It easily drives other people away,” Buterin said. “We need to focus on the things that would otherwise be in short supply: global, permissionless, and censorship-resistant protocol."

This week, BlackRock registered a staked ethereum fund in Delaware, signaling its intent to enter the staked ether ETF market, while its flagship ethereum ETF now holds $10 billion worth of ethereum.

Last month, Google claimed a breakthrough in quantum computing, following in Microsoft's footsteps after it unveiled a new quantum-enabling chip in February.

These and similar developments have catapulted quantum computing's risk to bitcoin, ethereum and crypto up the agenda.

“Given the current staggering rate of hardware progress, I now think it's a live possibility that we'll have a fault-tolerant quantum computer running Shor's algorithm before the next U.S. presidential election,” quantum computer researcher Scott Aaronson wrote in blog post this month, referring to how a quantum computer could break the encryption that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.

The “magnitude of the threat that quantum poses to all blockchains,” has given crypto investor Nic Carter “an urgent sensation like I have to act on it now with as much intensity as I can muster,” he posted to X.

"We don't need to panic, but we need to get serious," Alex Pruden, the chief executive of quantum computing risk company Project 11 posted to X, adding that “quantum computers at sufficient scale will break crypto at the most fundamental level imaginable.”

Meanwhile, bitcoin developers have also been warned they need to prepare for the post-quantum world that could become a reality by 2030.

“You should have a few good years ahead of you but I wouldn't hold my bitcoin,” Théau Peronnin, the chief executive of Alice & Bob, told Fortune during the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Portugal.

“They need to fork [move to a stronger blockchain] by 2030, basically," Peronnin said. "Quantum computers will be ready to be a threat a bit later than that."

Continuing with recent patterns, even the most modest of crypto gains were met with waves of selling on Thursday, sending bitcoin BTC$86,401.96 back to $88,000 after a rally above $93,000 just hours earlier.

The move higher had begun on Wednesday evening in the U.S. after Nvidia (NVDA) calmed jittery markets with an earnings beat and rosy outlook. In addition to boosting battered crypto, the NVDA results sent the Nasdaq higher by more than 2%.

Stocks are also rapidly reversing their gains, with the Nasdaq now higher by just 0.3%. Even mighty Nvidia is trading flat after being up more than 5%.

Hurting sentiment at the macro level are continued ideas that the Fed, for now, appears set not to trim interest rates at its December meeting. The September employment report (released today instead of weeks ago due to the government shutdown) showed a far stronger than expected 119,000 jobs added that month. 

Also leading hawk, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, was on the wires suggesting that not only was perky inflation not a reason to cut rates, but high stock prices were also a concern. Market veterans will hear echoes of Alan Greenspan's "irrational exuberance" speech of 1996. Stocks went on to strongly rally for four more years.

Hit harder than bitcoin was Ethereum's ether ETH$2,812.94, now off nearly 4% over the past hour, perhaps weighed down by digital asset treasury FG Nexus selling a chunk of its holdings to buy back some of its battered stock (down more than 95% from its summer high).

A check of crypto-related stocks now finds large losses after opening gains. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) is down by another 4.7% and off 62% year-over-year to a new 52-week low of $178. Exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Gemini (GEMI) are down 4% and 5%, respectively, and stabecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) is lower by 3.5%.

The Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”) has recently published guidance for the education sector on complying with data protection law when sharing data to safeguard children and young people. This guidance provides sector specific advice and case studies to run alongside the ICO's 10 step guide to sharing information to safeguard children. Its message is clear: data protection law is not a barrier to safeguarding, it is a framework to support it.

Here are some of the key takeaways:

Education providers must identify a lawful basis before sharing information. While consent is a lawful basis, it is often not the most appropriate in a safeguarding context because consent must be freely given and there is usually a power imbalance between an education provider and a child or a child's parent.

For state schools, the most appropriate lawful basis for sharing safeguarding concerns will typically be public task. In contrast, a private school or private nursery is more likely to rely on legitimate interests, which involves a three-part test:

Education providers should note that the Data Use and Access Act 2025 introduces a new lawful basis of ‘recognised legitimate interest'. For certain public interest purposes, including safeguarding, this will remove the obligation to carry out the balancing test at step three above once these provisions come into force. The ICO has released initial guidance on this but more is expected to follow.

Education providers should consider the capacity of the child or young person to exercise their own data protection rights when deciding whether to share information. The ICO suggests that, in many cases, it is reasonable to assume that a child has capacity from the age of 12. Even when consent is not relied upon as the lawful basis for sharing information, organisations should still listen to and consider the views of the child alongside safeguarding considerations because open communication and transparency can improve the effectiveness of safeguarding decisions. The ICO emphasises, however, that a child's wishes should not override a duty to report a child protection concern.

Where an education provider regularly shares information with other organisations, such as the local authority, a health and social care organisation or the police, the ICO recommends agreeing formal data sharing arrangements between those organisations. However, in emergency situations, the absence of a formal arrangement should not prevent an organisation from raising a safeguarding concern. In such cases, organisations should keep a detailed record of what was shared, with whom and why. Even where a formal arrangement exists, an education provider may not have time to follow the usual process in an emergency. The ICO is clear that organisations should not hesitate to share information to prevent harm.

The ICO has published 12 helpful case studies to show how these considerations may apply in practice.

If you have any questions on the ICO's new guidance or how it may impact your organisation's safeguarding and data protection practices, please contact our education law experts for tailored advice.

He fumbled with his driver's license, standing inside an Augusta convenience store, trying to keep hold of the sack of cash tucked under his arm. His wife waited in the car.

His failing eyesight made it difficult to follow the instructions on the bitcoin ATM, but he had Ryan's calm voice coaching him on the cellphone pressed to his ear.

“Just relax,” Ryan told him. “I'll talk you through it.”

After several attempts, he successfully set up a digital wallet and began feeding $10,000 into the machine — one $100 bill at a time. It took so long, this being his first purchase of cryptocurrency, that his wife came in after 45 minutes to check on him and helped to insert the remaining bills.

“We were terrified because we didn't know what we were doing,” Larry Cook recalled. “But we thought we were doing a good thing.”

Over the next seven months, from October 2023 to April 2024, Larry and Barbara Cook would repeat the same process over 30 times, unknowingly giving away $1.3 million from their retirement accounts in a government impersonation scam. 

The scammers introduced their ruse with accusations and threats and wound up convincing the Cooks to use their own money to help investigate and trap bad actors on the “dark web.”

The scam would take the Cooks to gas stations and bodegas across Maine and in Florida, where they spend winters. Both 80 at the time, they drove to places they'd never been, into neighborhoods they normally wouldn't go. They even booked a last-minute flight to Portland and drove through a snow storm to meet the scammers' demands. In the end they were handing over taped-up cardboard boxes filled with cash or gold bullion to strangers who came to their homes in broad daylight or the pitch black night.

Week after week, they spent hours on the phone with Ryan Terry, ostensibly a Federal Trade Commission investigator. They would come to trust him, even appreciate his kindness, as he talked them through the painstaking process of gradually syphoning off their life savings.

They transferred retirement funds to a TD Bank savings account, then made $10,000 to $150,000 withdrawals so they could send bitcoin to a U.S. Treasury holding account, or cash or gold to government safe houses. They were told all of it would be returned to them when the investigation ended.

Neither the account nor the safe houses ever existed.

“The minute I put money in the machine, it was gone out of the country,” Larry Cook said during a recent interview at the couple's home in China, a rural town of about 4,500 near Augusta.

All the while, they thought they were helping the FTC catch criminals involved in identity theft and money laundering. They promised to keep their involvement secret, even fending off questions from a concerned family member and bank employees. They had receipts and letters signed by government officials — solid proof it was for real. They didn't notice the odd wording, faded government seals and chronic misspelling.

“We had a letter signed by Janet Yellen,” Larry Cook said, referring to the former U.S. treasury secretary.

Two years later, the Cooks are still dealing with fallout from the scam, trying to avoid losing their Social Security benefits and paying taxes on the money they lost, which counted as income in 2023 and 2024. The Internal Revenue Service recently agreed they don't have to pay federal income tax on the scammed money. Maine legislators are working on a plan so they won't have to pay state income taxes. But they're still on the hook for a $24,000 underpayment to Medicare and Medicaid.

The Cooks say they are sharing their story now because they are people of faith — Larry Cook is a retired pastor from Pennsylvania who established two orphanages in Kenya — and they believe they have been called to warn others against being scammed.

Before you judge them for falling prey to one of the fastest growing scams, they want you to know that they didn't think they would ever be conned like this either. 

Scam victims are prevalent across every generation. But while people ages 30-39 reported the greatest incidence of fraud in 2024 — 178 scams per 100,000 population, with a median loss of $450 — people age 80 and up reported the greatest losses, in part because they have more savings — 85 scams per 100,000 population, with a median loss of $1,650, according to the FTC.

“You think you're smarter than them, whoever they are,” Barbara Cook said. “But we're also of the generation that we trust the authority figures in our lives, especially government officials.”

They were shopping at the Augusta Walmart on Sept. 21, 2023, when Barbara Cook got a cellphone call from people who said they were security personnel with Amazon and TD Bank. She was having trouble accessing her Amazon account at the time and had sent several emails seeking help, which lent credence to the call.

She handed the phone to Larry, and from then on he was the scammers' primary contact. They said his name and Social Security number were being used on the dark web to make purchases in New York state and California, which the Cooks denied making. The calls continued for days, including from FTC representatives, who accused the Cooks of being involved in illegal financial activity and threatened to investigate their entire family. 

Trying a different tack, they also said the Cooks' savings were at risk of being stolen by cyber scammers and had to be moved into safer accounts. They would close all accounts associated with Larry Cook's current Social Security number and give him a new number. They emailed documents purportedly signed by Yellen and other officials to prove their legitimacy. Then they assigned Ryan Terry to handle the case.

“He insisted that we cooperate with a current FTC criminal investigation involving money laundering, bank fraud and other issues,” Larry Cook wrote in an account of their experience.

When the Cooks resisted his pressure, they said Ryan threatened them with a federal indictment, “which would involve heavy court costs, legal fees and the possibility of ruining not only (our) reputation, but also that of our two sons, both successful businessmen.”

In a final appeal, Ryan told the Cooks it was their “patriotic duty” to assist in the investigation and prosecution of these perpetrators. They reluctantly agreed. In early October 2023, they signed and returned letters of consent bearing what appeared to be the insignia of the U.S. Treasury Department.

“But we were warned that all activity and information would have to be kept in total confidentiality, including from family members, our accountant, our lawyer — everyone,” Larry Cook said.

Throughout their ordeal, they never told a soul.

Looking back, the Cooks still can't believe they did what they did, but they know exactly why they fell prey to one of the fastest growing scams.

The number of complaints about government impersonation scams increased 50% over the last three years, from 11,554 incidents worth $240.6 million in 2022 to 17,367 incidents worth $405.6 million in 2024, according to the FBI's cybercrime center. 

Among people age 60 and up, scams involving cryptocurrency more than tripled in the same period, from 9,991 incidents worth $1 billion to 33,369 incidents worth $2.8 billion.

“I look at it now and it seems so easy to say ‘no,' but it's not when you're right in the middle of it,” Larry Cook said. “At the time, we prayed for God's direction, but on this God was silent. Once you get enmeshed in the situation, it's almost like Stockholm syndrome.”

The Cooks describe themselves as hardworking, honest, Christian people who don't lie and expect others to tell the truth, especially those in authority.

Now 82, the Cooks met when they were 10 years old and attended the same Baptist church in Philadelphia. They began dating at 15 and married 61 years ago, when Larry was a senior in college. They moved to Maine in 2013 to be near family in Yarmouth and China.

Larry Cook made his fortune early, working first for an auto parts manufacturer, then as vice president of human resources for Johnson Matthey, a multinational precious metals and chemicals company.

At age 40, when he was ordained in the Church of the Nazarene, he left the corporate world with hefty retirement savings. He knew his earnings as a pastor would not be so robust, but he was raised to be a penny-pincher. Barbara Cook went back to work as an executive secretary.

Larry Cook stresses in multiple interviews that they thought they were helping to stop criminals from defrauding others.

Helping people is why he went into ministry, he said. His corporate bosses used to say he was “too nice.” They counted on him to reel in difficult clients and deliver difficult news to employees. Even in retirement, he's still promoting Kenya's Kids, the all-volunteer Christian ministry and children's homes he started in the East African country in 1997.

“I've always wanted to help people,” he said. “God created me that way.”

The Cooks experienced many of the tools in the scammer's toolbox — high pressure, threats, intimidation, fast-talking, fast-moving, emotional manipulation and what seemed to be a deep knowledge of their personal finances, family life and day-to-day whereabouts.

“They had information before we told them anything,” Larry Cook said. The couple isn't sure whether the scammers got their initial contact and financial information through Barbara's Amazon account or from TD Bank.

The Cooks got to know Ryan, the scammer who spoke with them almost daily. He had a slight foreign accent and called them sir and madam, things that seem like yellow flags in retrospect. But he calmed them down when they were stressed and shared personal information about himself.

“We liked Ryan,” Larry Cook said. “He was so nice. He talked about his wife and family. He said he wanted to meet us. He wanted us to go to Washington. He told us we were doing great.”

The Cooks also came to believe Ryan was tracking them through a WhatsApp account he helped to install on their phones. It allowed him to call them anytime and talk them through cryptocurrency purchases and pickups of cash and gold.

“When I was driving to a bodega in Lewiston and couldn't find a parking space, he told me spaces were available right around the corner,” Larry Cook said. “It was like he was watching me.”

Showing that kind of familiarity is a prime feature of the scammer's playbook, much like a psychic demonstrates personal knowledge in front of a large audience, said Dan Simons, a psychology professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He and Christopher Chabris, a cognitive scientist, co-authored a book on scams, “Nobody's Fool: Why We Get Taken In and What We Can Do About It.”

“There's a lot of information online that's available to everyone,” Simons said. “(The scammer) was probably on Google Maps and could see the area. They give you just enough information to make it sound like they know things about you.”

Simons said most cyber scams are run by international crime syndicates from call centers in places like Myanmar, Pakistan and India. Often they're staffed by victims of human trafficking who have no choice in the matter.

Most scammers also have a virtual script based on a lot of trial and error, Simons said. They're happy when someone suspects it's a scam and hangs up because they don't want to waste time.

“They don't have to catch everybody. They only have to catch a few,” Simons said. “It's not just a lone con artist anymore. It's organized crime on a massive scale.”

The proliferation of largely unregulated bitcoin machines also makes it easier to scam the uninitiated, Simons said. In September, Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued Athena Bitcoin, one of the largest operators of bitcoin ATMs, charging that it neglected to implement anti-fraud measures when his office found that 93% of its deposits came from scams.

The Cooks likely were more vulnerable because they were less savvy about technology, they had a sizable nest egg and they were especially trusting, Simons said. But we all want to believe that people are telling us the truth.

“We tend to have a truth bias and it takes a lot of effort to counter that,” Simons said. “(Getting scammed is) traumatic, it's embarrassing and it's great that they're willing to share their experience so others may learn from it.”

Ryan kept moving the goal posts, telling the Cooks repeatedly that “this will be the last time.” They never did tell anyone, not even their 20-something grandson when he interrupted their first bitcoin purchase. He pressed them to know why they were buying bitcoin. He even called later that day because he was worried about them.

“I told him we knew what we were doing,” Barbara Cook recalled. “I told him, ‘You just have to trust me on this.'”

They purchased and transferred cryptocurrency from convenience stores in Augusta, Waterville, Lewiston, Freeport, Portland and Naples, Florida. They struggle to remember exactly where, saying the experience is too painful to remember details they'd rather forget.

They became friendly with bank tellers and managers at TD Bank branches in both states. They went to different branches because most had limited amounts of cash on hand, and they succeeded in dissuading any serious intervention. 

“All of them asked if I was being scammed,” Larry Cook said. “A few had me sign a statement. I wouldn't lie. I told them, ‘It's my money and you don't have to know what it's for.' A bank manager in Naples said he was obligated to notify bank security and I said, ‘Please do.'”

At some point Ryan added gold to the mix, coaching the Cooks on how to buy bullion online and have it delivered to their homes. Six times “undercover” couriers picked up cardboard boxes filled with cash or gold — four times in Maine and twice in Florida. The value of each package ranged from $50,000 to $150,000.

In early 2024, the scammers seemed to grow skittish, the Cooks said, and Ryan indicated that TD Bank might be audited. He had them open a savings account with Chase Bank, where they were treated well, Larry Cook said.

“I was getting a lot of questions at TD Bank, so it became clear that we weren't going to get more than $20,000 at a time,” he said.

In October 2024, TD Bank pleaded guilty and was fined $1.8 billion for failing to maintain an anti-money laundering program and conspiring to commit money laundering. Several bank employees also were charged. “By making its services convenient for criminals, TD Bank became one,” U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time.

TD Bank declined to discuss its fraud prevention protocols. A spokesperson said the company “is committed to supporting clients who report they may have fallen victim to a scam” and it provides resources to help customers avoid them.

The last cash transfer took place on April 8, 2024. The Cooks fed $50,000 into a bitcoin machine in Florida. Their role in the investigation was over. They were relieved.

But when they tried to call Ryan to find out how and when their $1.3 million would be returned, his WhatsApp account had been deleted. The cold reality sank in.

“My first reaction was to shame myself and blame myself,” Larry Cook said. “I know I'm not stupid, but I made a lot of stupid decisions.”

The Cooks reported the scam to federal, state and local authorities.

FBI agents spent two days in their home, reviewing all of their documents and purging their devices of any malware. They told the Cooks last week that they don't expect to recover their money, but they continue to investigate and use their experience to train other agents.

The FBI declined to discuss the Cooks' case but responded to questions about similar scams.

“No legitimate law enforcement or federal agency is ever going to call or email you demanding payment, threatening arrest, or requesting personal or sensitive information,” said Kristen Setera, spokeswoman for FBI Boston. “We're not going to ask you to send us large sums of your own money to help us catch criminals, or for you to mislead anyone about why you are making the withdrawal. Legitimate investigations simply don't work this way.”

While the Cooks' seven-month ordeal was at turns terrifying, exhausting, all-consuming and ultimately traumatic, they admit they were deflated afterward. It had been exciting, especially when they were fully absorbed into their roles as operatives in a federal investigation.

Family members were shocked to learn of the scam but have been understanding and supportive, the Cooks said. They have shared their story at church and community meetings in Maine and Florida, where audience members lined up afterward to tell their own scam stories.

They are thankful for the prayers and support of family and friends, especially as Larry deals with macular degeneration and Barbara is being treated for lung cancer. And they are grateful to still have some financial resources so they can move to a retirement community in Pennsylvania. Their home on China Lake is up for sale.

“We're not destitute and we're being careful,” Larry Cook said. “But we're not enjoying our retirement as we planned. Our life is much diminished.”

The Cooks are now wrangling with income tax and Social Security impacts of an $802,000 increase in their 2023 income and a $508,000 increase in their 2024 income as a result of fraud.

After a year of negotiating, and at the urging of U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the IRS capitulated, refunding $161,000 that the Cooks paid up front on the retirement disbursements and writing off $243,000 that they still owed.

Maine Revenue Services is poised to write off $60,000 that the Cooks owe on their state tax returns, and legislators are planning to change state law so $40,000 that the couple paid up front may be refunded eventually.

“This is a bipartisan, all-hands-on-deck situation,” said Rep. Dan Sayre, D-Kennebunk, House chair of the Legislature's taxation committee. “It's unfortunate that these scams are getting more sophisticated. What's happening to (the Cooks) is unjust and we need to correct it.”

But so far, Social Security has been intractable. Under federal law, the Cooks' financial losses cannot be deducted from their income in assessing Medicare and Medicaid premiums, an administrative law judge said in a letter to Larry Cook last month.

The judge acknowledged the Cooks experienced a “significant hardship” but said being scammed isn't among the qualifying life-changing events that can trigger a recalculation of premiums, or allow an independent decision if the perpetrators haven't been convicted of fraud or theft.

With little chance of that happening, Social Security is deducting a combined $1,000 from the Cooks' $3,300 monthly benefits in 2025 and 2026 to offset a $24,000 underpayment to Medicare and Medicaid, they said.

“It's not over and it won't be over until this situation is resolved,” Larry Cook said. “I'm not anti-government, but when this kind of thing happens — they say it's the law, but the law never imagined fraud like this.”

A union representing Lloyds Banking Group employees is asking the Information Commissioner to investigate the lender's use of staffers' personal current account data as part of its pay negotiations.

Earlier this month, it emerged that Lloyds compared the transaction data of around 36,000 employees with accounts at the bank to the wider public.

The group - which is made up of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland - looked at that data, along with the saving rates and salary increases of low paid employees - and compared them to its customers.

According to the Financial Times, the Accord union claimed in correspondence with Lloyds that, on reviewing the account data, the bank "concluded we are more financially resilient than the general public. This was used to justify a lower pay award."

Lloyds defended the practice, stating: "In these situations, any insights used are always aggregated and anonymised to ensure both compliance with important data protection regulations and to support our common practice of using data to underpin our decision making."

Now, another union, Affinity, has written to the Information Commissioner, arguing that the fact that data was aggregated and anonymised "does not mean that those activates are exempt from the Data Protection Act".

Says the letter: "The data was taken from the personal accounts of employees and their spouses or partners without their express permission. Lloyds had no reason to access that data other than to justify its proposed pay increase. That's not a legitimate reason under the Data Protection Act."

This, writes, Affinity general secretary Mark Brown, "needs to be investigated as a matter of priority".

Affinity - which is not recognised by Lloyds - has also taken aim at "in-house lap dogs" Accord and Unite unions. 

"Instead of breaking off pay negotiations to tell their members what Lloyds had done, Accord and Unite agreed to the pay increases instead," says Affinity.

HH Sheikh Mansour also Chairs the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE), with both the Governors of the CBUAE and the People's Bank of China in attendance in person. mBridge enables direct cross border payments between banks, sidestepping the need to use correspondent banking, enabling near instant international transfers. In June last year mBridge entered the minimum viable product (MVP) phase, with this announcement signalling it is now live.

Home - Crypto Presales - Missed the XRP ICO Surge? LivLive's 200% Bonus Pushes It Toward Becoming the Next 1000x Crypto Presale

The crypto market often feels like a cosmic test of timing. Anyone who brushed off XRP under $0.20 remembers exactly when it exploded past $1, creating life-changing returns for early believers. Now that XRP is trading far above its early accumulation zone, investors are again seeking the next 1000x crypto presale with similar early-stage potential.

LivLive is emerging as that unexpected answer. The project has already raised over $2.1M, with more than 300 buyers stepping into Stage 1 at a base price of just $0.02. Unlike XRP's quiet beginnings, LivLive is launching with massive bonuses, timed incentives, and a narrative built around real-world utility that rewards early movers before the broader market reacts.

LivLive ($LIVE) has taken an aggressive approach to early-stage adoption by activating a flash sale during a market dip. Instead of slowing momentum, the downturn triggered its strongest bonus structure to date. Buyers can double or triple their allocations instantly, creating an environment where hesitation becomes costly and early participation becomes the engine for oversized upside before Stage 1 closes.











What makes LivLive stand out is its category-defining model. It introduces a live-to-earn ecosystem combining augmented reality, blockchain rewards, physical actions, and on-chain verification into a unified earning experience. With a total supply of 5B tokens and a community allocation of 65%, LivLive positions early supporters at the center of long-term value creation, offering the ground-floor access investors crave.

LivLive's tech stack is engineered for real-world utility rather than speculative hype. Its augmented-reality engine transforms physical locations into interactive earning spaces, while blockchain-verified presence ensures that every action is genuine and free from bot manipulation. This fusion of digital triggers and real-world validation gives LivLive the structural strength expected from the next 1000x crypto presale.

Supporting this innovation is a rapid reward pipeline connected to the upcoming LivLive wearable. The wristband verifies location, unlocks quests, and syncs AR interactions in real time, enabling frictionless participation. A scalable API layer also allows brands and venues to deploy campaigns inside the platform. Together, these components give LivLive a competitive moat few presales can match.

LivLive introduces a rare mechanic with its $2.5M Treasure Vault, where more than 300 winners will be selected across multiple reward cycles. With a top prize of $1M, participants gain tangible financial upside even before the token launches. This structure creates excitement, encourages activity, and motivates investors to accumulate more packs to maximize their winning potential.

The ROI potential heightens the appeal further. Stage 1 pricing at $0.02 contrasts sharply with Stage 10's $0.20 and the launch price of $0.25. Buyers using EARLY100 can double their allocation, while BOOST200 triples it for purchases of $2,000 or more. This means a $2,000 buy can convert into more than $6,000 worth of tokens at the very earliest valuation.

XRP remains one of the most established digital assets in the market, backed by enterprise adoption, global liquidity, and a loyal community that has endured regulatory turbulence. Its resilience through multiple market cycles has positioned it as a dependable asset with long-term relevance. However, mature strength comes with slower growth, limiting the explosive multiplier potential that new investors often seek.

The era of XRP under $0.20, when early buyers quietly secured life-changing positions, is now long gone. Today, XRP behaves like a top-tier asset rather than a high-risk, high-reward early-stage play. For investors seeking asymmetric upside, early access, and ground-level pricing, the opportunity zone has shifted. That early-stage window now belongs to LivLive, which is shaping up to be the next 1000x crypto presale for bold movers.

Kevin Tang and Wyatt Raich used to work in digital assets at BlackRock, where they helped the company pivot from its loud skepticism of crypto to being one of Wall Street's major players in the sector. During this time, they came to feel it was too difficult for people overseas to participate in common investment opportunities like purchasing U.S. stocks. That's why they co-founded HelloTrade, a mobile-first, blockchain-powered trading platform. 

The company announced on Thursday that it raised $4.6 million in a first round of funding from Dragonfly Capital, with backing from Mirana Ventures, along with angel investors. 

“We see a huge market opportunity to make these traditional assets such as stocks and commodities accessible to anyone around the world with an internet connection,” Tang, co-founder and CEO of HelloTrade, said in an interview with Fortune. “We believe that the next frontier of blockchain adoption will be the movement of these traditional markets on chain.”

HelloTrade aims to give investors around the world access to U.S. assets. For example, people in Vietnam or Indonesia may want to buy Tesla stock. But through their current brokerage systems, those aren't easily accessible. By using crypto technology, HelloTrade plans to solve that problem. The platform also offers perpetual futures, which give customers more exposure to an asset than they would have in cash on the platform. 

HelloTrade's value proposition is similar to that of trading platforms like Robinhood and Revolut. Tang says those companies can be clunky and hard to use, and that HelloTrade will focus on building a better user interface. 

The startup's product has not launched yet, but Tang said he expects it to launch at the end of this year or the beginning of next year. The company currently has about 10 employees. 

At BlackRock, Tang and Raich, HelloTrade's co-founder and CTO, helped develop the firm's crypto offerings. Tang worked as senior director on its digital assets team, and Raich was the head of engineering at its digital asset lab. During their tenure, the company released the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) ETFs, funds that both had record debuts on the stock market and were among the first crypto ETFs to launch. 

The two HelloTrade co-founders aren't the only ones bringing their legacy finance talents to the crypto world. In a report from last month, the well known venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz's crypto arm found that workers coming into crypto tend to come from a traditional finance background. This blending of Wall Street and crypto coincides with President Donald Trump's friendly policies toward the sector. Since last year's election, big banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have developed their blockchain technology. 

Tang and Raich often heard a saying at BlackRock: you spend decades building up trust, and you can lose it in a matter of minutes. It's an ethos they have brought to HelloTrade, which is why they plan to spend their new capital in part to educate individuals around the world about the benefits of blockchain technology, and to invest in the safety and security of their product.

The collector Vignesh Sundaresan today unveiled a new project space, Padimai Art & Tech Studio, located in Singapore's Tanjong Pagar Distripark area. Sundaresan, who also goes by Metakovan, is best known for his 2021 purchase of Beeple's nonfungible token (NFT) work Everydays: The First 5000 Days for $69.3 million, which helped to make NFTs mainstream within the art market.

Sundaresan, who is based in Singapore, says Padimai is a heritage, contemporary art and research institution “dedicated to the question of how technology can function as cultural infrastructure. That means examining how digital works are created, how they survive, how they circulate, and how they shape collective memory.” It is, he continues, “meant to play a complementary, not competitive, role within Singapore's cultural landscape”.

Tanjong Pagar Distripark is already home to the state-backed contemporary art institution Singapore Art Museum and several commercial galleries. Sundaresan envisions his venue supporting projects that “don't fit neatly into gallery timelines or commercial expectations, supporting artists to work with technologists, archivists, coders and designers in ways that allow the work to evolve organically rather than being rushed toward display,” and also exploring the preservation of digital works. “Experimentation at Padimai is not about spectacle; it's about process,” he continues.

The space opens with an Olafur Eliasson exhibition, Your view matter—an adaptation of a virtual reality work the Norwegian-Danish artist made in 2022. It will involve visitors moving through six digital installations which respond to their movement—with each person's experience recorded and stored on a blockchain-based system devised by Sundaresan. The project “emerged from a shared interest in how technology can deepen, rather than distract from, the experience of perception,” the collector says. It “resonates strongly with Padimai's ethos because it treats technology as a philosophical tool,” he adds. “The work explores how we orient ourselves in the world, using virtual reality not simply for an immersive encounter, but for examining how we orient ourselves in digital and physical space, how perception shapes experience and how memory is formed.”

Sundaresan hopes Padimai will foster more such collaboration between art and technology, helping to push the boundaries of digital art. “Rather than focusing on novelty or market trends, we are interested in projects that operate at the intersection of embodiment, memory and digital infrastructure,” he says.

Sundaresan says his own collection will inform but not dominate the space. “The Beeple acquisition is part of the story that brought me here, but it is not the programme. If anything, it serves as a historical marker, a reminder of the moment when the art world confronted the idea of digital ownership at scale.”

With the NFT market still a fraction of its recent heights, the auction house has reportedly let go of key staffers

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Cybersecurity firm Quarkslab has completed the first public, third-party security audit of the Bitcoin Core codebase — the open-source reference implementation that underpins the Bitcoin network, including a full-node client, a GUI, and an embedded wallet.

The four-month assessment, funded by Brink, a non-profit organization that supports open-source Bitcoin protocol development, and coordinated by the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF), focused on the peer-to-peer networking layer — the network's primary attack surface — as well as adjacent components, including mempool management, chain state, transaction validation, and consensus logic, according to a Wednesday announcement.

Completed in September, the audit totaled 100 man-days of work conducted by three Quarkslab engineers, with technical support from Brink and Bitcoin research and development firm Chaincode Labs. Before the code review began, two auditors worked in person with Brink engineers to familiarize themselves with Bitcoin Core's architecture and development practices.

The process combined manual code analysis, dynamic testing, and advanced fuzzing techniques drawn from Bitcoin's existing continuous integration workflows. Fuzzing is an automated software testing technique that attempts to break code by feeding it large volumes of unexpected, random, or malformed data.

The goal was not to certify Bitcoin Core, but to "actively search for vulnerabilities, improve testing methodologies, and identify practical ways to strengthen the codebase," Brink noted in a separate post.

Quarkslab reported no critical, high, or medium-severity findings. The auditors did identify two low-severity issues and provided 13 informational recommendations, none of which qualified as security vulnerabilities under Bitcoin Core's classification standards.

"No high-impact issues were found, but marginal gain was brought on existing fuzzing harnesses as well as new ones to cover untested scenarios like chain reorganization," Quarkslab said.

"While no findings with critical, high, or medium security impact were identified during this engagement, this audit provided valuable feedback, insight, information, and testing improvements for Bitcoin," OSTIF added.

The results reinforce long-standing views of Bitcoin Core as a mature and conservatively engineered system maintained by dozens of contributors and reviewed by multiple organizations. While the assessment focused on a defined subset of the codebase, independent reviews may again be valuable in the future, particularly for new components introduced in upcoming releases, the firms noted.

"Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation that powers the Bitcoin network and helps secure trillions of dollars in value," Brink said. "The project has a strong security track record, but it has never undergone an external security assessment. The more independent, security-minded reviewers who bring their unique perspectives, the better."

The audit arrives amid renewed discussion over the long-term quantum threat to Bitcoin's cryptographic assumptions. Bitcoin, like most major blockchains, relies on elliptic curve digital signatures, which are secure against classical attacks but theoretically vulnerable to Shor's algorithm on a future large-scale quantum computer.

If elliptic curve cryptography were broken, private keys could be derived directly from exposed public keys — not through brute-force guessing, which would remain infeasible, but through a mathematical shortcut enabled by quantum algorithms. Researchers continue to debate timelines for when post-quantum upgrades may become necessary, with estimates ranging from a few years to decades, prompting ongoing exploration of migration paths that would protect funds once public keys are revealed.

Native SegWit Bitcoin address formats that start with "bc1q" are considered more resistant to quantum attacks because they do not reveal the public key until funds are spent. Only the hashed public key is visible onchain, which would be far harder for a quantum computer to attack.

This means funds stored at these addresses remain protected from quantum key-recovery attacks as long as they have never been spent and the public key has not otherwise been exposed. Once that spend occurs, however, the public key becomes visible, and any remaining funds tied to that address would inherit the same vulnerability — reinforcing long-standing guidance to avoid address reuse and move the full balance when spending.

Bitcoin Core's review also follows recent debate within the Bitcoin ecosystem over client diversity and the relationship between Bitcoin Core and Knots — a derivative implementation that maintains certain policy and configuration options modified in Core's latest v30 release last month. The often-heated debate highlighted differing views on how Bitcoin should balance conservatism, optionality, and decentralization in its software stack.

 Some users viewed the asset reallocation as an alarming sign of the platform's ability to blacklist user funds without requiring a governance proposal. 

The Trump family-backed crypto project World Liberty Financial has reignited concerns about its ability to freeze and reassign user funds, despite promoting itself as “community governed.”

The platform said Wednesday that it will reallocate assets affected in a pre-launch phishing attack that exposed the seed phrases of what it described as a “relatively small subset” of user wallets. WLFI said the compromised wallets were targeted through “third-party security lapses,” not issues with the platform or its smart contracts.

“This was not a WLFI platform or smart contract issue. Attackers gained access to user wallets through third-party security lapses,” wrote WLFI in the X post.

The reallocation will only apply to users who have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. Accounts belonging to users who have not completed KYC will remain frozen. WLFI first halted the affected wallets in September as it investigated the attack.

WLFI blacklisted 272 wallets, 215 of which were tied to a phishing attack, while 50 of those wallets reported being compromised.

“We stepped in preemptively to stop hackers from draining funds and are working with the rightful owners to secure/move assets,” wrote WLFI in a Sept. 6 X post.

Cointelegraph has contacted WLFI for details on the total value of affected assets.

Some X users cried foul after the announcement, raising concerns about the platform's ability to freeze and reassign user funds without the necessity of a decentralized governance proposal.

“I think it's hilarious how everyone is cheering that you can rug or lock any wallet on your own protocol. The entire ecosystem is dependent on your security. Everyone will get phucked in the end,” wrote pseudonymous blockchain developer flick, in response to WLFI's announcement.

Other users took WLFI's move as a sign of accountability, as the platform aims to compensate users for the September phishing attack.

“Good to see a project actually taking responsibility instead of hiding behind ‘not our fault'. User safety > everything,” wrote crypto trader DefiBagira in a Wednesday X response.

High-performance blockchain's public token sale reaches 75% of $187 million target with three days remaining, facing headwinds from market conditions and community concerns

Monad's public token sale has raised $140 million toward its $187 million target with three days remaining before the sale closes on Saturday, marking a more cautious reception than recent comparable offerings despite the project's technical ambitions.

The sale, conducted through Coinbase's token launch platform, is offering up to 7.5 billion MON tokens, representing 7.5% of the initial 100 billion token supply, at $0.025 per token, valuing the network at $2.5 billion. 

The sale opened on November 17 and runs through November 22, two days before Monad's public mainnet launch scheduled for November 24.

The fundraise follows MegaETH's $1.4 billion ICO last month, which filled its $50 million allocation within five minutes and concluded 28x oversubscribed. Bitcoin traded $110,000 during the MEGA sale, while it's exchanging hands at around $92,000 currently.

Market conditions have impacted pre-launch valuations. MON's pre-market valuation on Hyperliquid has declined 36% from $6 billion to $3.8 billion, implying approximately 50% gains for ICO participants if the token launches at current prices.

The sale structure includes a $100 minimum and $100,000 maximum contribution cap for standard participants, with higher thresholds available for Coinbase One subscribers. Purchases are subject to KYC requirements and geographic restrictions, excluding certain jurisdictions including most of Europe and New York where Coinbase operates under regulatory constraints.

Community sentiment has emerged as a complicating factor. Monad allocated just 3.3% of token supply to community airdrops, disappointing some early supporters who participated in Discord events and community activities over several years. The decision reflects tensions common to major token launches between rewarding genuine community members and avoiding exploitation by airdrop farmers using bots and paid participants.

"Decentralization is only possible with widely distributed ownership of the MON token," the Monad Foundation stated in a blog post, describing the Coinbase platform as enabling "smaller allocations across more participants" and bringing "public sales to retail purchasers in the US and globally."

Monad positions itself as a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain designed for speed without sacrificing security or decentralization while maintaining full Ethereum compatibility. The project has spent several years developing what it describes as "state-of-the-art financial infrastructure" to power applications for a global user base.

"The mission is to power a new world economy, suitable for a world that is increasingly online and onchain," the foundation said, outlining pillars focused on developer experience, global reach, and technical excellence.

If the sale is undersubscribed, unsold tokens will be reallocated to ecosystem development. If oversubscribed, a "filling up from the bottom" distribution mechanism will prioritize broader distribution and limit concentration among large purchasers.

Polymarket currently gives Monad an 81% probability of attracting more than $300 million in total commitments. A potential catalyst for final flows could come from the finalization and release of funds from the MegaETH ICO, expected on November 21, one day before the MON sale concludes.

The raise comes as competition intensifies in the decentralized perpetuals market, where Lighter has rapidly emerged as a leading player.

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, registered a new Delaware statutory trust, the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, on Wednesday.

Delaware Division of Corporations records show that the trust was formed on November 19. The listing does not include product documentation, but the public entity record can be viewed directly through the state's search portal.

Forming a Delaware statutory trust is a common early step for ETF issuers, particularly for commodity and crypto products. 

The next stage typically involves filing a registration statement with the SEC, which can be an S-1 or another form depending on the fund structure. 

The preparatory move, however, does not indicate that a filing is imminent. Decrypt has reached out to BlackRock and its registered agent for further information.

The registration comes as Ethereum staking ETFs have begun trading in the U.S., including the REX Osprey ETH + Staking ETF, which launched the first combined spot and staking-enabled Ethereum ETF in late September.

Grayscale, meanwhile, became the first U.S. issuer to add staking to an exchange-listed Ethereum product in October, following the SEC's approval of generic crypto ETP listing standards, which enabled the firm to incorporate native staking into its Ethereum ETFs. 

The move gave the market its earliest regulated benchmark for how staking yield could be passed through to shareholders.

Still, dedicated staking-focused Ethereum ETFs remain small. The REX-Osprey ETH + Staking ETF, for example, reported about $2.4 million in assets as of mid-November, with trading activity remaining light since its launch.

Earlier in July, BlackRock filed a rules-change request to allow additional staking functionality in its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). 

New language in the proposed changes stated the trust would “receive all or a portion of the staking rewards” generated by the staking provider, adding that such rewards may be “treated as income to the Trust.”

In Ethereum, staking means locking up Ethereum while staked so the network can choose users to validate transactions, in return for earned rewards. It also affects the circulating supply, as staked Ethereum is not freely tradeable until it is withdrawn.

Staking remains a point of regulatory caution because it involves active participation in network validation and introduces operational, slashing, and custody risks that differ from simple asset holding.

Issuers seeking to stake inside a registered product have had to detail validator selection, liquidity management, custody segregation, and how rewards will be accounted for under securities rules.

After you close your eyes, there is actually a certain point that brain activity falls off sharply, plunging until it reaches a sleep state.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Until now, it used to be thought that falling asleep was a gradual process, like being buoyed by clouds and drifting into dreamland. What actually happens is more like reaching the edge of a precipice—and taking a sudden fall into the shadows below. 

Falling asleep is quite literal. This is what a team of researchers from Imperial College London and the UK Dementia Research Institute, led by neuroscientist Nir Grossman, found out when they hooked subjects up to an EEG and saw that brain activity remains stable until there is a drastic drop in the final minutes before sleep sets in. Previous attempts to define the moment the brain transitions from a waking state to a sleep state had relied on short and mostly inconsistent EEG data fragments. Sleep does not lie at the end of a winding road, but rather at the bottom of an abrupt drop.

“The tipping point accurately defines the critical time during the transition from a steady wake state into a steady sleep state, providing an objective and physiologically precise definition of the wake–sleep cutoff,” Grossman said in a study recently published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.

Sleep involves both cognitive and physiological shifts. During the process of falling asleep, changes in brain activity cause breathing and heart rate to slow down, muscles to relax, and a reduced response to external stimuli.

There is a reason so many magazine articles keep urging you to get more sleep. It boosts regenerative processes such as homeostatic plasticity, meaning the adaptation of neurons to overall neural network activity so they can keep up normal communication with each other. Memories are also stabilized as information is reorganized during sleep, making it less likely to forget.

The transition between waking and sleeping states is overseen by clusters of neurons known as nuclei. Some of these nuclei promote wakefulness while others bring on sleep. For the brain to go into sleep mode, certain functions in both nuclei are switched off, which rapidly changes how neurons communicate. When sleep would take over used to be predicted by the activity of these nuclei between sleep and wake states. What Grossman and his team found is that the transition between states has a defined boundary as opposed to the brain gradually fading into sleep. 

It also turns out that the longer it takes you to reach the edge of sleep, once your brain takes the plunge, you will spend less time “falling” until you land in the sleep state. Sleep distance is how long it takes to fall asleep from the moment you close your eyes. Though it seems counterintuitive, EEG monitoring revealed that if it takes longer fall asleep, less of that time will be spent in the falling phase than for someone who falls asleep sooner. The average time between the fall and onset of sleep is 4.5 minutes. Maybe it would take 3.8 out of 30 total minutes for one sleeper, but 5 minutes out of 15 total minutes for someone else.

Why the fall takes longer for shorter sleep distances can be explained by the occipital cortex, which processes visual information, reaching that point of falling earlier than the frontal cortex, which is involved with thinking, emotion, personality and memory along with muscle movement and control. Once the researchers measured sleep distance for individual subjects, they were then able to use it to predict the time of the fall and of sleep onset in real time during the following nights. Predictions were within about 49 seconds of the actual fall. Recording brain activity for just one night showed that there would be 95% similarity on later nights. 

Being able to identify the point of no return for falling asleep isn't only demystifying how the brain transitions from awake to asleep. It could also help create new treatments for disordered sleep that not only increase quality of life, but promote safety in situations where someone needs to be fully awake and alert.

“Understanding the dynamics of brain activity during the process of falling asleep has profound implications for human health and public safety, especially given the increasing prevalence of sleep-onset disorders and the devastating consequences of falling asleep during critical activities such as driving,” the researchers said.

Next time you lay your head down on your pillow, prepare for a fall.

 Bees obviously can't use this skill on human level, but this progress could help scientists better grasp complex cognitive-like traits.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Throughout the 1940s, Austrian ethologist (a researcher focused on the behavioral study of non-human animals) Karl von Frisch decoded what's known as the “waggle dance”—a sophisticated figure-eight dance that allowed honey bees to communicate the distance of resources like water, pollen, and new nesting locations. Up until that point, the opinion that insects have any sort of intellect was a minority-held belief. Even von Frisch, who won the Nobel Prize for his bee-decoding efforts in 1974, once wrote that “the brain of a bee is the size of a grass seed and is not made for thinking. The actions of bees are mainly governed by instinct.” 

But the waggle dance was only the beginning. In the subsequent decades of bee research, scientists have uncovered even more of the remarkable mental abilities of bees. For example, these tiny critters use tools, understand abstract mathematical concepts, and recognize human faces—all with just 0.01 percent of the neurons found in a human brain. Now, scientists are adding to this list of impressive accolades with a new study, published in the journal Biology Letters. It details how bees can also understand the building blocks of morse code, the complex system of dots and dashes that heralded the information age in the mid-19th century. 

Led by scientists at Queen Mary University of London, the study focused on a specialized maze that led to either a sugar reward or a bitter substance called quinine. Each result was associated with a signal—either a short-flashing circle (or dot) for sweet, or a long-flashing one (representing a dash) for butter. In each room of the maze, the orientation of the dot/dash stimulus changed, so researchers could be certain that the bees weren't relying on spatial cues to select the right answer. They also tested the bees without using a sugar reward, in case the olfactory senses were leading the bees to the correct answer. The bees quickly learned to associate a quick-flashing dot with a reward and long-flashing dash with disappointment.  

“Since bees don't encounter flashing stimuli in their natural environment, it's remarkable that they could succeed at this task,” Alex Davidson, the lead author of the study and a Ph.D. student from Queen Mary University, said in a press statement. “The fact that they could track the duration of visual stimuli might suggest an extension of a time processing capacity that has evolved for different purposes, such as keeping track of movement in space or communication.”

While bees aren't going to suddenly start typing out complex messages to their buzzing buddies—one dot and one dash at a time—this experiment does confirm the simple-yet-groundbreaking idea that certain insect minds can keep track of time. The researchers note that, while they don't know of a neural mechanism that explains this mental behavior, future studies could test different ideas in these miniature brains and see what they discover. What they find could even have an impact on human-made technologies. 

“Processing durations in insects is evidence of a complex task solution using minimal neural substrate,” Elisabetta Versace, a senior author of the study from Queen Mary University, said in a press statement. “This has implications for complex cognitive-like traits in artificial neural networks, which should seek to be as efficient as possible to be scalable, taking inspiration from biological intelligence.”

It's true that the brain of a bee is the size of a seed, but that seed certainly has sprouted into a complex mental tree—one that scientists are only beginning to understand.

Emerging imaging spatial transcriptomics (iST) platforms and coupled analytical methods can recover cell-to-cell interactions, groups of spatially covarying genes, and gene signatures associated with pathological features, and are thus particularly well-suited for applications in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues. Here, we benchmark the performance of three commercial iST platforms—10X Xenium, Vizgen MERSCOPE, and Nanostring CosMx—on serial sections from tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 17 tumor and 16 normal tissue types for both relative technical and biological performance. On matched genes, we find that Xenium consistently generates higher transcript counts per gene without sacrificing specificity. Xenium and CosMx measure RNA transcripts in concordance with orthogonal single-cell transcriptomics. All three platforms can perform spatially resolved cell typing with varying degrees of sub-clustering capabilities, with Xenium and CosMx finding slightly more clusters than MERSCOPE, albeit with different false discovery rates and cell segmentation error frequencies. Taken together, our analyses provide a comprehensive benchmark to guide the choice of iST method as researchers design studies with precious samples in this rapidly evolving field.

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) tools measure the gene expression profiles of tissues or cells in situ. These approaches overcome the limitations of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods by negating the need for cell dissociation, thus maintaining both local and global spatial relationships between cells within a tissue. ST can recover cell-cell interactions, groups of spatially covarying genes, groups of cells predictive of cancer survival, and gene signatures associated with pathological features1,2. These advantages, coupled with rapidly emerging computational and analytical methods, have led to substantial excitement about deploying these platforms in fundamental biology studies and in the clinic for research and diagnostic purposes3,4,5.

ST tools can be split into two broad categories: sequencing (sST) and imaging (iST) based modalities. sST methods tag transcripts with an oligonucleotide address indicating spatial location, most commonly by placing tissue slices on a barcoded substrate; isolating tagged mRNA for next-generation sequencing; and computationally mapping transcript identities to locations6. In contrast, iST methods most commonly use variations of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) where mRNA molecules are tagged with hybridization probes, which are detected in a combinatorial manner over multiple rounds of staining with fluorescent reporters, imaging, and de-staining (Fig. 1a)7. Computational reconstruction then yields maps of transcript identity with single-molecule resolution. Compared to sST methods, iST methods are targeted to subsets of the transcriptome due to their reliance on pre-defined gene panels and they adopt the higher spatial resolution and sensitivity of FISH, yielding single-cell resolution data8.

While the iST methods share some similarities, significant differences arise in primary signal detection and amplification, sample processing, and the subsequent fluorescent cycling chemistry (Fig. 1b)9,10,11. The need for amplification of signal is coupled to the sample processing, namely whether the sample is cleared, gel-embedded, or photobleached to quench autofluorescence. There are tradeoffs due to differences in sample processing for each iST method. For example, clearing of the sample increases signal quality but can prevent follow-up H&E staining and complicate immunostaining, which, in turn, can make cell segmentation more challenging. Finally, there are tradeoffs between imaging time, molecular plex, and imaging area covered, which result from the particular combination of the molecular protocol and the imaging hardware implementation12.

A key historic limitation in the widespread use of iST methods with human clinical samples was the incompatibility of most methods with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples13,14. FFPE is the standard format for clinical sample preservation for pathology due to its ability to maintain tissue morphology and sample stability at room temperature for decades, accounting for over 90% of clinical pathology specimens15. The ability to process FFPE samples with iST will enable the use of archival tissue banks for studies and obviate the need for specialized sample harvesting workflows. However, FFPE samples tend to suffer from decreased RNA integrity, particularly after having been stored in archives for extended periods of time16.

Three companies recently released the first FFPE compatible commercial iST platforms: 10x's Xenium, NanoString's CosMx, and Vizgen's MERSCOPE9,10,11,17. These three platforms each use different protocols, probe designs, signal amplification strategies, and computational processing methods, and therefore may potentially yield different sensitivities and downstream results. The main chemistry difference lies in transcript amplification: 10x Xenium uses a small number of padlock probes with rolling circle amplification; CosMx uses a low number of probes amplified with branch chain hybridization; and MERSCOPE uses direct probe hybridization but amplifies by tiling the transcript with many probes (Fig. 1b). However, no head-to-head performance comparisons on matched samples have been published. Understanding the key differences across platforms will allow users to make better-informed decisions regarding panel design, method choice, and sample selection as they design costly experiments, often on precious samples that have been bio-banked for years18.

In this study, we compared currently available FFPE-compatible iST platforms on matched tissue samples. We prepared a set of samples representative of typical archival FFPE tissues, comprised of 33 different tumor and normal tissue types, and acquired matched data from sequential sections according to the manufacturer's best practices at the time of writing, generating a dataset of >5.0 M cells. We analyzed the relative sensitivity and specificity of each method on shared transcripts and further quantified the concordance of the iST data across each platform with paired scRNA-seq data collected by 10x Chromium Single Cell Gene Expression FLEX. Then we focused on cell-level comparisons, evaluating the out-of-the-box segmentation for each platform based on detected genes and transcripts and coexpression patterns of known disjoint markers. Finally, we cross-compared the ability of each platform to identify cell type clusters with breast and breast cancer tissues as an example use case. Taken together, our work provides the first head-to-head comparison of these platforms across multiple archival healthy and cancerous FFPE tissue types.

To test the performance of the latest generation of FFPE-compatible iST tools, we sought to match gene expression and sample as much as possible given available panel configurations and manufacturer guidelines. To accomplish this, we used three previously generated multi-tissue tissue microarrays (TMAs) from multiple types of clinical discarded tissue (see Methods). We focused on FFPE tissues as the standard method for sample processing and archival in pathology. Tumor TMA 1 (tTMA1) consisted of one hundred and seventy 0.6 mm diameter cores (i.e., sampled regions) from seven different cancer types, with 3-6 patients per cancer type, and 3–6 cores per patient (Fig. 1c, d, Supplementary Table 1). Tumor TMA 2 (tTMA2) consisted of forty-eight 1.2 mm diameter cores from nineteen different cancer types, with each tissue type coming from one or two patients and represented in 2–3 cores (Fig. 1c, d, Supplementary Table 2). A normal tissue TMA (nTMA) contained forty-five 1.2 mm diameter cores spanning sixteen normal tissue types isolated with each tissue type coming from one patient and represented in 2–3 cores (Fig. 1c, d, Supplementary Table 3). CosMx and Xenium suggest pre-screening samples based on H&E, while MERSCOPE recommends a DV200 > 60%. Since our goal was to determine the compatibility of iST platforms under typical workflows for standard biobanked FFPE tissues from clinical pathology labs, and since TMAs are challenging to assay by DV200, samples were not prescreened based on RNA integrity. Samples were screened by H&E in the process of TMA assembly. TMAs were sliced into serial sections for processing by 10x Xenium, Vizgen MERSCOPE, and NanoString CosMx, following manufacturer instructions (see Methods).

The three different iST platforms offer different degrees of customizability and panel compositions. In terms of panel design, MERSCOPE and Xenium offer either fully customizable panels or standard panels with optional add-on genes, while CosMx offers a standard 1 K (substantially larger plex) panel with optional add-on genes (while this paper was in review Xenium and CosMx began providing options for 5000 and 6000 gene, respectively). We opted to run the CosMx 1 K panel as available commercially, as well as the Xenium human breast, lung, and multi-tissue off-the-shelf panels. We then designed two MERSCOPE panels to match the pre-made Xenium breast and lung panels, by filtering out any genes which could potentially lead to high expression flags in any tissue in the Vizgen online portal. This resulted in a total of six panels, with each panel overlapping the others on > 65 genes (Supplementary Table 4).

We carried out multiple runs with each panel following manufacturer instructions as provided in 2023 and 2024 (Supplementary Table 5), with efforts made to ensure that head-to-head comparisons were available at similar time points for each pair of platforms. 2023 data on tTMA1 and the nTMA were acquired with lung, breast, and multi-tissue panels for Xenium, MERSCOPE lung and breast panels, and the CosMx 1k panel. 2024 data was acquired on tTMA1 and tTMA2 with only the breast and 1k panels, along with reference single-cell transcriptomic data from sequential slices. In an intentional deviation from manufacturer instructions, the 2024 round of tTMA1 was intentionally carried out with matched baking times after slicing for a head-to-head comparison on equally prepared tissue slices. We note that between 2023 and 2024, CosMx updated its detection algorithms and Xenium improved its segmentation capabilities by adding additional membrane staining. The main part of this manuscript is thus based mostly on the 2024 data as more representative of the current capabilities of the technologies, while the results from 2023 are included in the Supplementary Figs. and tables as useful comparisons for previous datasets acquired on these platforms.

Each data set was processed according to the standard base-calling and segmentation pipeline provided by each manufacturer. The resulting count matrices and detected transcripts were then subsampled and aggregated to individual cores of the TMA (Methods). Across all datasets we generated 394,635,679 transcripts and 5,017,397 cells. Overall, we found that the cores from each TMA were generally well adhered to the tissue and detected transcripts. The total number of transcripts recovered for each run in 2024 was highest for CosMx, followed by Xenium, and then MERSCOPE (Supplementary Table 6). Based on the initially reported number of transcripts, tTMA1 appeared to provide more counts than tTMA2 and nTMA, which we ascribed to differences in tissue quality (Supplementary Table 6). We note that the total number of transcripts from the MERSCOPE nTMA run was below what would be typically thought of as a successful run. Such a sample would normally be excluded from analysis, but we continued with the data through all analyses to illustrate how low transcript capture affects downstream results (Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Figs. 1–4).

We next sought to directly compare the performance of each iST platform on matched genes. We began with a pseudo-bulk-based approach at the core level since this would not depend on differences in cell segmentation performance (see Methods)19.

First, we examined the reproducibility of the data across experiments using tTMA1 (23) and nTMA (23). When the same genes were evaluated by Xenium and MERSCOPE in sequential sections across different panels, we found that the total transcript count of all shared genes was highly correlated across data sets acquired with different panels, regardless of the tissue of origin (Supplementary Fig. 1a) Deviation in total transcript count was primarily driven by changes in morphology of a core from section to section (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c). However, explorations on a gene-by-gene basis, even in morphologically well-matched cores showed that some genes consistently had higher or lower expression in the breast or lung panel, up to 3-fold (Supplementary Fig. 1d,e). We ascribe these differences primarily to slight competition between probes but note that the magnitude of this effect is comparable to findings in bulk and single cell RNA-seq methods in FFPE tissue20. To explore technical replicability further we examined pseudo-bulk gene expression correlation for cores from the same patient and same tissue type in the same dataset and found that correlation was high (Spearman's r > 0.74) in almost all cases (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b), indicating good sample-to-sample reproducibility within a given platform. These correlation was similar to that observed when comparing the same core profiled across slides with different panels, suggesting that each platform was highly self-consistent and matching previous reports for MERSCOPE finding high section to section correlation21,22.

We also examined the correlation of the data from each platform between 2023 and 2024 using tTMA1 (23) and tTMA1 (24). Despite several differences in acquisition (age of sample, changes to the Xenium and CosMx analysis algorithms, and using matched baking conditions in 2024 vs manufacturer recommended conditions in 2023) we nonetheless found that the total transcript count of every shared gene from all matched cores was highly correlated (Spearman r = 0.99, 0.94, 0.95 for Xenium, MERSCOPE, and CosMx, respectively, Supplementary Fig. 2c–e). The correlation plots showed an average of only 18% median fold decrease in expression across all cores for Xenium in 2024 vs 2023; a four-fold increase for CosMx, and an eight-fold decrease for MERSCOPE—differences we ascribe primarily to the improved CosMx algorithm and changes in the baking time affecting MERSCOPE. Breaking down the correlations by core showed similar results regardless of the tissue of origin, though with more variance between the datasets for MERSCOPE and CosMx than for Xenium (Supplementary Fig. 2f–j). Thus, the correlation of gene expression across matched samples is high in all three technologies across a variety of conditions, but sensitivities could show significant differences.

To evaluate the relative sensitivity of each platform, we plotted the total transcript counts of every shared gene between all combinations of platform and panel, summed across all matched cores. We found generally linear relationships between all pairs of platforms (Fig. 2a–c, Supplementary Fig. 3). When we initially examined CosMx compared to Xenium data using tTMA1 (23) we noted an upward curve in the lower expression regime indicative of higher-than-expected calls associated with the low expression regime by CosMx, though this is no longer present in tTMA1(24) likely because of the updated base calling algorithm (Supplementary Fig. 3a,d,e). Since the three methods use variable number of probes per transcript, we broke these analyses down by gene length, but found no noticeable differences between the performance on short, medium, or long transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 4a–i). Xenium consistently showed higher expression levels on the same genes than CosMx in tTMA1 (24) when all slides were treated the same way, with the Xenium breast dataset having 2-fold more counts than the CosMx multi-tissue data sets (Fig. 2a). CosMx showed higher expression levels than MERSCOPE (median of 11-fold). (Fig. 2b). Finally, Xenium showed 20-fold higher median expression with the breast panels than MERSCOPE. In tTMA2 (24), where slide histology was carried out according to manufacturer protocols, we nonetheless found generally consistent results, though the MERSCOPE data set showed lower expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). Intriguingly, in the earlier round of experimentation, tTMA1 (23), while Xenium still showed higher counts than the other two platforms (Supplementary Fig. 3d–j), the MERSCOPE breast panel showed higher expression levels than CosMx levels, which were only 2.6-fold lower than Xenium's (Supplementary Fig. 3i). Considering the overall higher transcripts per cell across platforms for tTMA1 over tTMA2 and nTMA, and the differences in sample handling across rounds of experimentation (Supplementary Table 5), this suggests that MERSCOPE's ability to detect transcripts is highly sensitive to both sample quality and processing.

a Scatter plots of summed gene expression levels (on a logarithmic scale) of every shared gene between Xenium (breast) and CosMx (1k) data, captured from matched cores from tTMA1(24). Each data point corresponds to a gene. The red line represents the fitted regression (center), obtained from a first-order polynomial fit in log–log space and back-transformed to the original scale. The shaded band shows ±1.96× the standard deviation of residuals (linear scale) around this line. b Same as (a) but between MERSCOPE (breast) and CosMx(1k). c Same as (a) but between Xenium(breast) and MERSCOPE(breast). d Violin plot of percentage of all transcripts corresponding to genes relative to the total number of calls (including negative control probes and unused barcodes) averaged across cores of the same tissue type. Results are from Xenium's breast panel; MERSCOPE's breast panel; and CosMx's multi-tissue 1k panel. Each data point represents a TMA-tissue type combination, such as tTMA1(24)-BrC or tTMA2(24)-BlC. Violins show kernel density; interior lines denote quartiles (median = 2nd quartile). The full data is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a. e Violin plot of false discovery rate (FDR) where FDR(%) = (blank barcode calls / total transcript calls) x (Number of panel genes /Number of blank barcode) x 100. f Same as (e) but using negative control probes to replace blank barcodes. MERSCOPE is missing in this bar plot as it does not have negative control probes by design. g Violin plot of number of genes detected above noise, estimated as two standard deviations above average expression of the negative control probes. h Same as (g) but normalized to the number of genes in a panel or in percentage. Pairwise differences between platforms were assessed with two-sided Mann–Whitney U tests for (d–h); brackets show unadjusted p-values for each comparison.

We next wanted to assess the specificity of each platform. Each of the three platforms includes negative controls which are used to evaluate sample quality23,24. Xenium and CosMx include both negative probes (e.g., real probes targeting nucleic acids that are not present in human tissue) and negative barcodes (e.g., algorithmically allowable barcodes that are not associated with any probe in the experimental panel). MERSCOPE includes only negative barcodes by default. To determine specificity, first we calculated the fraction of all transcripts corresponding to targeted genes relative to the total number of calls (Fig. 2d). We found that Xenium consistently showed the highest on-target fraction, while CosMx was lowest across most tissue types except for bladder cancer and tonsil, where CosMx showed a higher on-target fraction than MERSCOPE (Supplementary Fig. 5a). However, this measurement is biased because of the relative numbers of controls and target barcodes. We therefore also adopted a false discovery rate (FDR) calculation which normalizes for these differences and is calculated against both the negative probes and negative barcodes (see Methods, Fig. 2e, f). We found that Xenium consistently showed the lowest FDR while CosMx showed the highest FDR in most cancer types (15 out of 22 TMA-cancer type combinations, see Supplementary Fig. 5b,c) regardless of whether we standardized to negative control barcodes or probes.

Finally, we used the negative control barcodes to evaluate the number of genes reliably detected by each platform in each tissue type. For each core, we calculated the number of genes that were detected two standard deviations above the average expression of the negative control probes. These numbers were then averaged for cores of the same tissue type. Because the CosMx panel was almost three times larger, it yielded a larger absolute number of detected genes in all 22 TMA-cancer type combinations (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Fig. 5d). CosMx also detected the highest fraction of genes in 15 out of 22 TMA-cancer type combinations, followed by Xenium (5 cancer types across two TMAs: breast cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, and SCC, see Supplementary Fig. 5e). The conclusions above are broadly the same when using 2023 protocols (Supplementary Figs. 6–7), except that the 2024 version of CosMx chemistry shows an almost 10-fold lower FDR in some tissues, with a corresponding increase in number of genes above noise, regardless of whether sample histology was carried out the same way or following manufacturer instructions—again in line with increased sensitivity from CosMx's updated data processing.

We next sought to determine whether a higher number of expressed genes is representative of increased sensitivity to real biology or increased false positive rates. First, we evaluated the correlation of iST data to reference RNA-seq data. We aggregated pseudo-bulk both tTMA1 (23 and 24) data from all panels of the three platforms and compared them to data from the TCGA25 program (see Methods)11. In Breast Cancer from tTMA1 (24), the Spearman correlation coefficients were 0.64 for Xenium, 0.55 for MERSCOPE, and 0.80 for CosMx (Fig. 3a). The performances across all other cancer types followed a similar trend, with CosMx showing the highest correlation coefficient for a particular tissue type followed by Xenium and then MERSCOPE (Supplementary Table 8). These results stand in contrast to results on tTMA1 (23) where each method was generally comparable in correlation coefficient (Supplementary Fig. 8a Supplementary Table 8). We also observed similar correlation coefficients across lung and multi-tissue gene panels relative to bulk RNA-seq expression data (Supplementary Fig 8b).

We also compared the pseudo-bulk results from nTMA(23) with bulk RNA-seq data obtained from GTEx12,26 The Xenium breast and CosMx data sets showed similar correlations to breast data obtained from GTEx, while the MERSCOPE had significantly lower correlation, consistent with a run which doesn't pass QC (Spearman's correlation coefficients of 0.33 vs 0.46, 0.57, respectively, Fig. 3b. Supplementary Table 9, Supplementary Fig 8c). These relative trends remained true across most normal tissue types, though we found that thyroid, pancreas, and lymph nodes showed the lowest correlations across all panels while prostate, tonsil, and liver showed the highest correlations (Supplementary Table 9). We also evaluated the expression of tissue-specific transcript markers across each platform by selecting marker genes from the GTEx database (see Methods). In nTMA (23), we found tissue-specific expression patterns of several of these markers across all selected panels when visualized across each healthy tissue type with Xenium showing the most distinct pattern followed by CosMx and finally MERSCOPE (Supplementary Fig. 8d). Overall, our comparison to TCGA and GTEx 2023 data suggests that while platforms may be more highly correlated to reference datasets in some cases, all are within a similar correlation regime regardless of tissue type. We next sought to validate the consistently higher correlation of CosMx vs Xenium vs MERSCOPE. Since TCGA and GTEx data are not generated from matched samples, we also performed a more stringent comparison by generating single-cell transcriptomic data for both tTMA1(24) and tTMA2(24), acquired on sequential sections (Fig. 3c–e, Supplementary Table. 5). This resulted in a matched single-cell reference dataset comprised of 14,945 and 17,749 high-quality single cells respectively for tTMA1 and tTMA2. Since TMAs include many cell types which are difficult to separate in single cell workflows, we decided to subset out vascular smooth muscle cells based on canonical marker genes identified (Methods). This cell type is readily recognizable in each platform and thus serves as a good basis of comparison of relative gene expression across modalities. The observed population's showed high expression of genes known to be associated with smooth muscle cells (but not used for selection) such as MYH11, DST, and LUM; while showing low expression of genes not associated with smooth muscle cells such as CSTG, CD86, and PDCD1LG2.

We then aggregated pseudo-bulk expression from all three spatial platforms and single-cell data and performed correlation analyses across all spatially measured genes in this cell type27. When we compared Spearman correlation coefficients, we recapitulated the trends observed in 2024 data compared to reference bulk RNA-seq: namely, CosMx had the highest correlation coefficients, followed by Xenium, and finally MERSCOPE (Fig. 3c–e). Importantly, this is true for both tTMA1 (23) and tTMA1 (24). We found that on tTMA1 (24), CosMx has significantly higher correlation coefficients relative to Xenium (0.77 vs 0.53, p = 1.2 × 10−10, Fisher's z transformation throughout) and MERSCOPE (0.6, p = 1.7 × 10−6) on tTMA1. This was consistent with results on tTMA2 (24): (CosMx: 0.78, Xenium: 0.72, p = 0.02, MERSCOPE: 0.23, p = 0) (Fig. 3d, e). However, when we restricted the same correlation analysis to only the expression of the common genes measured by each spatial platform relative to single-cell, the differences in correlation to single-cell data among the platforms were reduced and were no longer statistically significant on tTMA1 (24) (CosMx: 0.60, Xenium: 0.53, p = 0.23, MERSCOPE: 0.54, p = 0.20) while on tTMA2 (24) only the MERSCOPE difference remained significant (CosMx: 0.61, Xenium: 0.69, p = 0.84, MERSCOPE: 0.3, p = 1.9 × 10−3) (Supplementary Fig. 8e–g). We therefore conclude that the primary factor contributing to the higher correlation of CosMx was the larger panel size, which encompassed genes with a broader range of expression values.

The availability of a matched reference data set across several replicates allowed us to probe whether there were platform specific systematic biases in measuring certain genes. By comparing the residuals of the fits to single cell data we found that all three platforms consistently over- or undercounted- certain genes—largely non-overlapping sets—relative to single-cell measurements, presumably due to differences in sensitivities among probe designs and decoding chemistries (Fig. 3f). While the random noise between replicates could be of equal magnitude to this effect as evidence by genes with large residuals in one data set or another, this systematic effect could explain the spread in gene expression observed between platforms in Fig. 2a–c.

Next, we compared the performance of each iST method on a single-cell level. As of 2024, all three platforms generate cell boundaries based on a DAPI image combined with a membrane marker (Fig. 4a). Raw images are provided for these stains to facilitate custom cell segmentation approaches, but we opted to use out-of-the-box cell segmentation method for each individual platform to replicate a real-world use-case of these platforms. We evaluated the cell segmentation accuracy by comparing the segmentation outputs against manual annotations of a subset of tTMA1 (24). This subset included three TMA cores selected for their morphological similarity across platforms and their representation of different cellular structures (see Methods) and yielded > 31,400 annotated cells (see Methods) in total. We then computed precision, recall, and F1 score, across three distinct cellular scenarios: dense cells, sparse cells, and elongated cells (Fig. 4b). In dense cell distributions, CosMx and Xenium achieved significantly higher precision (0.90) than MERSCOPE (0.83, p < 0.01). Recall and F1 score results are consistent with precision across each platform. The segmentation accuracy of all three platforms decreased in elongated cells and followed by sparse cells but the relative performance of the platforms remained the same. The reduced performance is likely due to the complex and irregular shapes of elongated cells and the reduced contextual information surrounding sparse cells, increasing the likelihood of false positive and negatives. No significant performance difference was detected between CosMx and Xenium across the three scenarios.

a Top row: Subset of data showing DAPI (blue fill) and membrane staining (green fill) overlaid with cell segmentation boundaries (white outline) and manually annotated cell centroid (red point). Middle row: all the transcripts in green dots and EPCAM in blue dots. Bottom row: segmented cell boundaries (white outline) before and after filtration (Cyan outline: Cells kept after quality control; Orange outline: Cells excluded after quality control). We acquired imaging data from 263 TMA cores (170 from tTMA1, 48 from tTMA2, and 45 from nTMA) using Xenium, MERSCOPE, and CosMx, respectively. Segmentation was performed on three representative TMA cores for each IST platform, yielding a total of 9 cores and 31,384 annotated cells. b Segmentation accuracy evaluated by three metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, in various scenarios including dense cells, sparse cells, and elongated cells. Pairwise platform differences were tested using two-sided Tukey's HSD following one-way grouping by platform (per core and scenario). Reported p-values are Tukey-adjusted for multiple comparisons. Asterisks indicate significance thresholds (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001). Exact adjusted p-values are shown above brackets. c Heatmap of transcripts per cell after filtration. All available genes are considered here for each panel. We filtered out cells with fewer than 10 transcripts for Xenium and MERSCOPE, and fewer than 20 transcripts for CosMx, in accordance with each platform's recommended threshold. d Same as (c) but showing unique genes per cell. e Same as (c) but reanalyzed using only shared genes. f Same as (d) but reanalyzed using only shared genes. g Co-expression density map for three pairs of disjoint genes (rows) from all three platforms (columns) from tTMA1 (24). MERSCOPE breast dataset does not have enough cells to generate the 2D histogram for PPARG vs. CD68. All cells across all tissues which include at least one detected transcript of either of the indicated genes are plotted together, with color indicating the number of cells at the indicated expression levels of each gene. Data throughout is from tTMA1 (24) and tTMA2 (24).

We next filtered out empty regions of space and cells without any transcripts for downstream examination and quantified the fraction of cells containing differing numbers of transcripts per cell (Supplementary Fig. 10a). We chose a permissive threshold of removing cells with fewer than 10 transcripts for Xenium and MERSCOPE, and 20 transcripts for CosMx from downstream analysis as recommended by each technology11,28,29. tTMA1 (24) consistently had a greater fraction of cells passing filtration, with CosMx retaining the most cells (95.97%) followed by Xenium (94.28%) and MERSCOPE (27.97%) (Supplementary Table 6) while tTMA2 (24) had lower cell retention in Xenium (92.66%) and MERSCOPE (2.98%) but slightly higher cell retention in CosMx (96.30%). The relative order of the platforms based on the fractions of cells remained the same. Unsurprisingly, filtration decreased the number of retained cells per unit area for all platforms, with the smallest decrease coming for CosMx and Xenium (Supplementary Fig. 10b). The cells retained from CosMx and Xenium had similar areas, while filtration of the MERSCOPE data sets resulted in a higher average cell area (Supplementary Fig. 10c). This effect is largely driven by the removal of low-quality cells, specifically those with fewer than 10 detected transcripts.

After filtration, we compared the number of transcripts and the number of unique genes per retained cell across all tissues and all panels, focusing on tumor cores that were sampled by all three platforms (Fig. 4c–f). As expected, given its larger panel size, CosMx detected the highest number of transcripts per cell and the highest number of unique genes per cell in all tissue types, followed by Xenium breast panel and then MERSCOPE breast panel (Fig. 4c, d). If these analyses were restricted to only the shared genes across all panels, numbers were much lower (Fig. 4e, f), with the Xenium breast panel giving the highest numbers of transcripts per cell in 21 out of 22 TMA-cancer type combinations. The CosMx data showed the highest number of transcripts per cell in liver cancer and comparable transcript counts in testicular cancer to the Xenium breast panel. The MERSCOPE data generally had the lowest number of transcripts per cell, though pancreatic cancer approached the results from Xenium, and had higher transcripts per cell than CosMx (Fig. 4e). Xenium had the highest number of unique genes per cell across all tissue types and followed by CosMx and MERSCOPE (Fig. 4f). When we performed similar analyses for the 2023 datasets, even though these did not include membrane segmentation for Xenium (Supplementary Fig. 10d–g) and note that MERSCOPE showed significantly higher numbers of transcripts. This is consistent with our previous results (Supplementary Fig. 2i) showing that in certain conditions MERSCOPE could approach Xenium transcript counts.

We then determined how different iST platforms' segmentation algorithms perform by assessing the expression of canonical markers. We examined the co-expression of CD3E, a canonical T-cell marker, and EPCAM, a marker for epithelial cells30,31 across all filtered cells; the co-expression of CD4 and CD8A, markers of T-cell subsets32,33,34; and the co-expression of PPARG, a marker for adipocytes and CD68, a marker for macrophages35,36,37. We reasoned that all these marker gene pairs are disjointly expressed, and a well-performing segmentation algorithm should yield few cells expressing both markers. We pooled all the filtered cells from matched tTMA1 (24) cores of each platform and plotted the expression of one gene against the other and converted the scatter plot to a 2D histogram showing cell numbers in each co-expression bin. We found that Xenium showed clear patterns of disjoint expression, separating cells from different lineages, while MERSCOPE showed such a pattern for CD3E vs. EPCAM but not for the other two pairs (Fig. 4g). Higher quality MERSCOPE data from tTMA1 (23) showed such a pattern for CD3E vs. CD19, CD4 vs. CD8A, and CD3E vs. EPCAM (Supplementary Fig. 10h–i). Similarly, CosMx only showed such a pattern for PPARG vs. CD68 but not for the other two pairs. Nevertheless, since the CosMx panel is much higher plex, and retained similar numbers of transcripts and genes to Xenium, we next wondered how these two methods performed in terms of cell type recovery.

In a typical iST workflow, a key step is reducing the dimensionality of the data by identifying cell types, their unique states, and their expression patterns for further analysis leveraging spatial information38. To compare across platforms, we clustered the data from the filtered cells from all the cores for each TMA with a focus on breast tissues. The initial clustering of whole TMA datasets (except MERSCOPE normal tissue) showed expected batch effects caused by patients and tissue types with broadly similar cluster arrangements around morphological tissue features (Supplementary Fig. 11). We removed batch effects (see Methods) and then performed targeted clustering and cell type annotation for breast samples from tTMA1 (23), tTMA1 (24) and tTMA2 (24) for Xenium breast panel, MERSCOPE breast panel and CosMx multi-tissue panel (Supplementary Fig. 12).

When looking at tTMA1 (23), in breast cancer, after batch effect removal (Supplementary Fig. 12d–f), Xenium resulted in nine cell types (alveolar cells, B cells, basal cells, fibroblast, hormone-sensing cells, immune cells, myeloid, T cells, and vascular & lymphatic cells) (Fig. 5a). On the other hand, CosMx resulted in eight cell types (alveolar cells, basal cells, epithelial cells, fibroblast cells, hormone-sensing cells, immune cells, myeloid, and vascular & lymphatic cells). MERSCOPE resulted in six cell types, including alveolar cells, fibroblast cells, hormone-sensing cells, myeloid cells, T cells, and vascular & lymphatic cells. The cell type annotation of Xenium and CosMx was comparable in terms of both transcriptomic profile and subtype depth, with CosMx only unable to annotate immune cell subtypes (B cell and T cell). Gene expression of the same cell type from both platforms correlated well (Fig. 5a). MERSCOPE, on the other hand, identified most, but not all, the cell types recognized by Xenium and CosMx, including alveolar cells, fibroblast cells, hormone-sensing cells, myeloid, T cells, and vascular & lymphatic cells. MERSCOPE and Xenium showed a high correlation for almost all matching clusters. The correlation map shows a clearer one-to-one mapping between MERSCOPE and Xenium clusters than Xenium and CosMx clusters (Fig. 5a).

Correlation plot showing the correlation between cell types identified in CosMx and Xenium.

Results remained similar when the same sample was rerun with all spatial methods receiving the same slicing protocol a year later (Fig. 5b). Xenium identified all nine cell types as well as one additional cell type, epithelial cells, while CosMx and MERFISH identified the exact same set of cell types. Further, the cell types identified from tTMA1 (23) and tTMA1 (24), the two experiments, correlated well (Fig. 5c), where all cell types from tTMA1 (23) show high correlation with the same identifications in tTMA1 (24). However, CosMx, Xenium, and MERSCOPE exhibit differences in cell type annotations, particularly in the identification of cell subtypes. For example, in Core 99, Xenium appears blue in the center because many cells are identified as alveolar, while CosMx appears yellow due to the identification of epithelial cells. Alveolar cells are a subtype of epithelial cells, and closer examination of the heatmaps reveals that the transcriptomic profiles of alveolar cells identified in Xenium often exhibit high correlation with epithelial clusters in CosMx and MERSCOPE (Fig. 5b). While performing the cell type annotations independently for each platform, the markers provided by CosMx and MERFISH cannot support a confident classification of the cells as alveolar, unlike Xenium, which shows clear alveolar markers (Supplementary Fig. 13). This lack of specificity is also observed with immune cells: Xenium identifies more subtypes with distinct markers, whereas CosMx and MERSCOPE often only produce clusters broad enough to indicate immune cells without further subtyping. These limitations result in correlation heatmaps where cell type clusters do not always align one-to-one between platforms, such as seen in tTMA1 (24), where the Xenium alveolar cluster correlated with both alveolar and epithelial clusters in CosMx and MERSCOPE.

The results in tTMA1(24) stand in contrast to those in tTMA2 (24). In the Invasive Breast Cancer samples in tTMA2 (24) CosMx found seven cell types, including alveolar cells, basal cells, fibroblasts, hormone-sensing cells, immune cells, myeloid, and vascular & lymphatic cells; whereas Xenium only annotated five cell types, including basal cells, fibroblast cells, hormone-sensing cells, immune cells and vascular & lymphatic cells. MERSCOPE is not included due to its low number of transcripts. High correlation is again found between the cell types of CosMx and Xenium. In conclusion, for all TMAs in 23 and 24, all platforms are capable of generating results that support reasonable, consistent cell type annotations that would allow further biological analyses. We find that CosMx or Xenium can resolve higher numbers of cell types, with the relative performance likely dictated by the presence of key marker genes in the panel (more likely in the larger CosMx panel) vs the higher sensitivity and lower false positives (more likely in Xenium measurements).

In this study, we compared data obtained with three commercially available iST platforms with archival FFPE tissues to assess overall technical performance and help guide experimental design with human patient-derived samples that represent an important use case of these platforms. We focused our analyses on technical performance as a function of tissue source, including 17 different tumor types and 16 normal tissue types. Overall, we found that each iST platform presented various tradeoffs in terms of implementation, panel design and panel options, and resulting total transcript quantification and downstream analyses, including cell segmentation, cell quality, and biological interpretation. All these factors must be considered when designing iST experiments.

There are significant workflow differences between the different platforms which factor into the choice of method. Cutting samples onto MERSCOPE coverslips is more technically challenging than on standard microscope slides. The total hands-on time for running a slide on Xenium is 2–3 days compared to 5–7 days for MERSCOPE and 2 days on CosMx. We found that MERSCOPE and CosMx are well set up for batch processing in the wet lab, either due to built-in pause points or the instrument's ability to run multiple samples. Xenium is limited for batch processing by a need for a separate thermocycler for each slide pair processed in parallel. After staining, selecting regions of interest (ROIs) presented a surprising challenge for some systems: the Xenium platform could readily image the entire slide as a single ROI which easily covered entire TMAs, but the MERSCOPE ran into a 1 cm2 imaging area limit which meant cores in the addressable region were left unimaged, while the CosMx workflow required a demanding manual selection of ROIs for each core. These factors are likely to change as each company updates its protocol, but currently, Xenium offers the shortest, least hands-on workflow.

We analyzed each resulting dataset with a combination of manufacturer recommended processes for each platform and computational tools that can be implemented by the user downstream. These pipelines each result in count matrices and detected transcripts that can be analyzed using a suite of emerging tools. To facilitate the comparisons of iST platforms at a high level and enhance readability, we synthesized our findings into a qualitative summary table (Table 1).

When analyzed at a core level to abrogate the effects of individual cell-segmentation performance, we found that the total number of transcripts varied substantially across iST platform. With 2023 chemistry, Xenium yielded the highest number of transcripts, followed by CosMx and MERSCOPE, but with updated chemistry in 2024, CosMx showed higher total numbers of transcripts, consistent with a larger overall panel size. However, when this analysis was restricted to shared genes, Xenium generally had higher sensitivity for the same genes over CosMx and MERSCOPE across each tissue type, panel, sample, histological preparation, and acquisition round. The Xenium platform also showed the highest specificity by several false discovery rate metrics relative to CosMx and MERSCOPE.

The most prominent observation across these comparisons for CosMx was the improvement from 2024 to 2023 chemistry. With 2024 protocols, CosMx showed the smallest difference relative to Xenium, a roughly two-fold decrease in transcript counts in samples prepared the same way (tTMA1) and in samples prepared according to manufacturer instructions (tTMA2). This is a dramatic improvement over the ~12-15 fold difference in sensitivity observed with 2023 protocols. The improvement in sensitivity also comes with an improvement in specificity, which, for some tissues, reached almost a 10-fold difference. This suggests that the new version of the CosMx algorithm presents a substantial improvement and presents a choice in slightly lower specificity and sensitivity relative to Xenium vs higher molecular plex.

The most prominent observation for MERSCOPE was the large degree of variability between samples, TMAs, and protocols. Relative to Xenium, MERSCOPE sensitivities for shared genes varied between 2.6- and 100-fold lower. However, the highest MERSCOPE sensitivity obtained from the highest quality samples (tTMA1) measured at the earlier time point (2023) and following manufacturer recommended protocols. While the test case here was for typical archival tissues, these results underscore the importance of pre-screening samples for RNA-integrity for MERSCOPE to ensure high quality input tissue. This would require more tissue and limit the number of compatible samples, which can be weighed against the benefit of highly customizable panel design.

Across all methods, we note that because of the small number of replicates from each tissue we stop short of making blanket statements about relative performance across a particular tissue type. Instead, we conclude that Xenium shows the highest per-gene sensitivity on matched samples, though with updated protocols CosMx's sensitivity approaches Xenium and provides more overall transcripts when considering the larger panel size. MERSCOPE can achieve similar sensitivities relative to Xenium, but is highly sensitive to sample input quality and protocol deviations. While this paper was in review, two other comparison studies came to similar conclusions. A similar head-to-head comparison in FFPE tissue between CosMx and Xenium by Cook et al. found a similar difference in sensitivity to our results39. Interestingly, a comparison of public (unmatched) data from high quality mouse brain by Hartman and Satija found that MERSCOPE provided the highest sensitivities40, in line with the idea that this technique is highly sensitive to input tissue quality.

Regardless of these differences in specificity and sensitivity we found that on matched samples, all platforms were highly correlated to each other. Genes profiled across different panels within the same technology, at different time points, with different histology protocols, or even with different slicing rounds were all generally highly correlated. Similarly cores from the same patient were also highly correlated. This suggests that all three platforms can be trusted for normalized measurements of gene expression within a sample. Furthermore, all three platforms also show similar performance relative to orthogonal (non-spatial) technologies, finding comparable correlation of pseudo-bulk data to RNA-seq data from GTEx or the TCGA, as well as scRNA-seq data generated for tTMA1 and tTMA2, across each panel and platform. The correlation to orthogonal data was high but not perfect, and we found that each platform appeared to repeatedly over- or under-estimate the expression of a small number of genes (Fig. 3F)—suggesting, in some cases, middlingly-expressed genes could be seen as highly or lowly expressing.

A significant advantage of spatial transcriptomics data is the ability to map expression in single cells. We compared each platform on a cell-level basis by assessing cell identification and cell clustering. Overall, it appears that the out-of-the-box segmentation from CosMx and Xenium achieved better accuracy than MERSCOPE in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score across dense, sparse, and elongated cells. All platforms now use a membrane marker for segmentation, but the specific markers and segmentation algorithms are different, which could affect cell typing41,42,43,44, by misattributing marker genes to adjacent cells or by missing cells whose nuclei are out of the imaging plane. It is likely that segmentation performance could be improved on a sample-by-sample or tissue-type-by tissue-type basis, and future work should seek to assess cell segmentation tools and their performance across data from each platform to help inform the choice of analytical method where needed. After applying an expression level filter, CosMx overall retained the highest number of cells across various filtering stringencies. Xenium was able to effectively separate cells from different lineage markers, as judged by finding minimal coexpression of disjoint markers, while CosMx and MERSCOPE either showed more double positive cells or had fewer cells expressing the target genes overall).

To determine whether clearer identification of lineage markers resulted in improved ability to identify cell types, we performed clustering analyses specifically in breast cancer samples. We found that all three platforms had similar cell type annotation results and similar transcriptomic profile for tTMA1 (23) and tTMA1 (24). This consistency across platforms and over 2 years of sequencing highlights the reproducibility and robustness of our cell type annotations and transcriptomic profiling for TMAs. On the highest quality cores in tTMA1, MERSCOPE still successfully identified cell groups, capturing the patterns seen in other platforms, consistent with the trends in the overall transcript counts which show that high quality samples could achieve similar performance to the other platforms. We note that while similar numbers of cell types are recovered, the spatial component of the data shows that occasionally low expression of key marker genes can result in misannotation of a cell subtype which is identified in another technique.

Examining the latest protocols (2024 data), in some cases, Xenium showed larger number of annotated cell types while in others CosMx did. Since we used the full panel, not only the shared genes, when performing these clustering analyses, these differences are likely due to a balance between the benefit of more sensitive detection of tissue relevant genes and the possibility of missing informative genes in the larger panel. The number of genes included in a panel or plex is an important factor in ST experiments, and we recommend subsampling existing atlas data to determine whether the gene set which can be studied will be sufficient to cluster the cell types of interest and identify the necessary biological programs. We note that each of the manufacturers has released new products and now offer increased panel sizes since the completion of these experiments with panels now reaching 5000 genes for Xenium, 6000 genes for CosMx, and 1000 genes for MERSCOPE.

There are several limitations of our study. Our panel design for MERSCOPE required the removal of genes so the panel was compatible with all tissues, lowering the plexity slightly. This could have compromised MERSCOPE's ability to identify cell types relative to Xenium. Due to insufficient tissue, we were unable to run the same TMA across multiple years and multiple slicing and fixation protocols, requiring us to split our efforts between tTMA1 and tTMA2. Nonetheless, we were able to show both the effects on matched sample preparation and sample preparation following manufacturer recommendations. A similar limitation affected our ability to compare to single cell data. Because of insufficient tissue and the TMA design we could not achieve an equal level of sampling with single cell approaches as with spatial methods. Thus, while we were able to identify similar cell subpopulations for the purposes of exploring relative gene expression, we leave the question of the ability of spatial methods to perform generalized cell type clustering relative to single cell to other investigations. This limit did not apply to comparing clustering between spatial platforms, where we had similar numbers of cells and could identify tissues of origin based on TMA location.

Most importantly, we only attempted to compare the performance of iST platforms under typical use cases for clinical samples obtained from archival biobanks. Our results don't necessarily extend to non-human samples, frozen samples, and even FFPE samples which have been extensively validated for high RNA integrity. Indeed, there have been reports that MERSCOPE, in previous studies of the mouse brain, shows comparable or even superior results to those reported by 10x Xenium45. Given the large change in data quality between TMAs, and even the same sample run multiple times, we cannot exclude the possibility that in the highest quality samples MERSCOPE would provide higher transcript numbers, with the associated downstream benefits relative to Xenium and CosMx. However, the current guidance of DV200 > 0.6 restricts studies to the upper regime sample quality and limits archival investigations. Finally, we note that this study only compares the ability of spatial transcriptomic platforms to reveal transcriptional information. Specifically, we do not answer whether ST can predict protein expression of clinical biomarkers. Our preliminary exploration based on PD-L1 status annotation in tTMA1 did not show significant expression differences for any platform, but rigorous testing of this would require larger powered cohorts in each individual tissue type and clinical annotation.

Despite these limitations, our overall interpretation of these results is that amplification of RNA signal is especially important for recovery of transcript counts by iST in low-quality samples where RNA may be highly degraded and fewer landing sites are available for probes. Platforms (such as Xenium and CosMx) which rely on small numbers of landing sites and are subsequently heavily amplified are robust to RNA degradation and are thus more broadly compatible with a broad range of samples. On the other hand, when sample quality is high (as in some of our tumor samples) the gap between amplified and unamplified platforms' performance closes and most platforms can yield useful data for subsequent downstream spatial analysis.

Three TMAs were constructed using FFPE clinical discards at Brigham and Women's Hospital Pathology Core and were acquired with a waiver of consent for non-sequencing based readouts under IRB 2014P001026. The project adheres to all applicable ethical regulations, and the study protocol has been approved by the Human Research Committee of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Mass General Brigham. The samples included:

Tumor TMA 1(tTMA1): A tumor TMA of 170 cores, 0.6 mm in diameter, including a variety of cancer samples and healthy lymphoid tissue as a positive staining control. The TMA samples were selected from samples previously characterized by ImmunoProfile and were selected to encompass both high and low levels of the biomarkers in the ImmunoProfile panel [CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, Foxp3, tumor marker (Cytokeratin, Sox10, or PAX8)]. Annotations were performed by KF and SR based on H&E and immunofluorescence staining. Cores included both tumor and healthy control annotation, though for the purpose of this study, all were combined under their tumor label. Tumors were also chosen to be a mixture of PD-L1 high and PD-L1 low. This TMA had previously been studied by both H&E, and several highly multiplexed immunostaining approaches, and was known to be of high morphological integrity.

Tumor TMA 2 (tTMA2): A tumor TMA of 48 cores, 1.2 mm in diameter, including a variety of cancer. This TMA was chosen for the breadth of tissue lineages included and the relatively large core size.

Normal TMA(nTMA): A normal TMA of 45 cores 1.2 mm in diameter representing a broad range of normal tissues. Samples were sourced from the same patient in either duplicate or triplicate. This TMA was chosen for the breadth of tissue lineages included and the relatively large core size.

All samples were fully de-identified before assembly into TMAs. The breakdown of the number of samples per tissue and the number of cores per tissue is included in Supplementary Tables 1–3.

Sequential sections were prepared according to manufacturer instructions (“Tissue Preparation Guide Demonstrated Protocol CG000578” for Xenium, “91600112 MERSCOPE User Guide Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Tissue Sample Preparation RevB” for Vizgen, and “MAN-10159-01CosMx SMI Manual Slide Preparation Manual” for CosMx) at the Brigham and Women's Hospital Pathology Core. Prior to collecting samples, ~50 µm of each TMA were faced off to reach deeper into the sample where RNA integrity was likely higher. 5 µm sequential sections were then collected, floated in a 37 °C water bath, and adhered to Xenium slides (10x, PN 1000460), Vizgen FFPE coverslips (Vizgen, PN 10500102), or standard Superfrost+ slides for CosMx (Leica BOND PLUS slides, Leica Biosystems S21.2113.A). TMAs were sliced as close to the center of the active area as possible for each platform. Samples were baked at 42 °C for 3 h for Xenium, 55  °C for 15 minutes for MERSCOPE, and 60 °C for 16 h for CosMx. Sections were stored according to manufacturer instructions prior to processing, with 10x Xenium stored in a desiccator at room temperature, Vizgen MERSCOPE coverslips stored at −20 °C, and NanoString CosMx slides stored at 4 °C. To benchmark technologies under same preparation protocol, samples of tTMA1 (24) data were baked overnight and stored at room temperature. Samples for 10x Xenium and Vizgen MERSCOPE were brought to the Spatial Technology Platform at the Broad Institute for processing, while samples for NanoString CosMx were processed at the Wei lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

Pre-designed probe panels from Vizgen were not available at the time of the experiment. Therefore, we ordered custom gene panels to match the pre-released gene panels from 10x for the human breast and human lung panels. Gene lists were uploaded to the Vizgen panel design portal and were checked against all profiled tissues, removing genes that were overexpressed in any individual tissue based on Vizgen's design guidelines (FPKM > 900), and ensuring that the total panel FPKM did not exceed the allowed limit in any individual sample type. Panels were manufactured at the 300 gene scale as custom panels BP0892 and BP0893. The final gene lists, for all three iST modalities are available in Supplementary Table 4.

MERSCOPE samples were imaged according to manufacturer protocol “9160001 MERSCOPE Instrument User Guide RevF”. Samples were processed in two batches, the first of four samples, two of each TMA and with each library prepped in parallel; and a follow up sample of each TMA re-run with the breast panel. Samples were first hybridized with anchoring probes overnight before being embedded in a polyacrylamide gel. Samples were incubated for two hours with a digestion solution at 37 °C and then overnight at 47 °C overnight in a detergent clearing solution and proteinase K to remove native proteins while the anchoring probes kept nucleic acids bound to the gel. After clearing, samples were additionally photobleached using Vizgen's MERSCOPE Photobleacher for three hours at room temperature in the clearing solution. Samples were hybridized with encoding probes and a cell boundary stain (PN 10400118) and then imaged with imaging kits (PN 10400005). Samples were stored at 37 °C in clearing solution after hybridization and before final imaging. After an initial examination of the data, a second batch of both TMAs was run a second time with the human breast panel, increasing the set imaging capture thickness from 5 µm to 10 µm to capture more tissue from cores that had lifted during the gel embedding process. MERSCOPE data acquired with a 10 µm imaging depth (Supplementary Table 5), resulted in a median 3.0-fold increase in expression across all transcripts. We excluded the 5 µm MERSCOPE breast panel data from most comparisons have left references to the lung panel data in as an illustrative example of an unsuccessful run (indicated as such throughout the figures). Data was processed on premises through the standard Vizgen workflow to generate cell by gene and transcript by location matrices. We segmented the data with a built-in Cellpose method on the most accurate looking cell boundary stain.

10x Xenium samples were processed in three batches according to manufacturer protocols “Probe Hybridization, Ligation & Amplification, User Guide CG0000582” and “Decoding & Imaging, User Guide CG000584”. Samples were stained utilizing 10x's predesigned Human Breast (10x, PN 1000463), Human Multi-Tissue and Cancer (10x, PN 1000626), and Human Lung panels (10x, PN 1000601), as they became available from the manufacturer. Slides for both TMAs were processed in pairs according to which probe library they were receiving. Slides were stained with a Xenium imaging kit according to manufacturer instructions (10x, PN 1000460). Briefly, padlock probes were incubated overnight before rolling circle amplification and native protein autofluorescence was reduced with a chemical autofluorescence quencher. Slides were processed on a 10 Xenium Analyzer, with ROIs selected to cover the entire TMA region. Data was processed on premises through the standard 10x workflow to generate cell by gene and transcript by location matrices. The 10x multimodal segmentation kit and protocol was used for 2024 but not for 2023 data acquisition.

NanoString CosMx samples were prepared with one 1000 plex panel. Samples were hybridized with probes and stained with cell markers. Samples were loaded onto the CosMx SMI at the same time for imaging, during which branched fluorescent probes were hybridized onto the samples to amplify the signal above the background.

NanoString CosMx samples were prepared with Human Universal Cell Characterization 1000 Plex Panel (part number 122000157) according to manufacturer protocol “MAN-10159-01 CosMx SMI Manual Slide Preparation Manual”. Firstly, slides were baked at 60°C overnight for better tissue adherence. After baking, slides were treated sequentially with deparaffinization, target retrieval (15 min at 100°C), permeabilization (3 µg/mL proteinase K, 15 min at 40 °C), fiducials application, post-fixation, NHS-acetate application and then hybridized with denatured probes from universal panel and default add-on panel. After in situ hybridization (18 h at 37 °C), slides were washed and incubated with DAPI (15 min at RT) and marker stain mix (with PanCK, CD45, CD68 and cell segmentation marker CD298/B2M). Slides were washed and loaded onto the CosMx SMI for UV bleaching, imaging, cycling and scanning. Raw images were decoded by default pipeline on Atomx SIP (cloud-based service). Machine: CosMx_0020. Serial Number: INS2301H0020.

After data acquisition, the resulting outputs were uploaded to a Google bucket associated with a terra.bio Workspace for distribution and follow on analysis.

To facilitate standardized data formatting and subsequent analytical processes, we built a data ingestion pipeline with the following objectives: (a) to grab cell-level and transcript-level data from diverse platforms and normalize the data structure; (b) to tag each cell and transcript with essential metadata including tissue type, tumor status, PD-L1 status, among others (Supplementary Fig. 14); and (c) to transform the data into various formats tailored to the requirements of particularized analyses. Specifically, to tag the data, core centers in the TMA were manually identified using DAPI images (Xenium) or cell metadata that contains global coordinates (MERSCOPE and CosMx) using QGIS(version:3.16.10-Hannover). Cells or transcripts within a specified radius were then labeled with core metadata via spatial joining (implemented by GeoPandas, version:0.13.0). In instances where cores are in close proximity or when a uniform radius cannot be applied effectively, we manually generated the core boundary masks.

For each sample, two formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) curls (25 μm each) were dissociated using the Miltenyi Biotech FFPE Tissue Dissociation Kit (CG000632 RevA, 10X Genomics). The resulting cell suspension was divided equally into four centrifuge tubes, each containing approximately 300,000 cells. Cells in each tube were hybridized with a unique Probe Barcode, as per the instructions in the “Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling Reagent Kits for Multiplexed Samples” user guide (CG000527, 10X Genomics). Post-hybridization, cells from the four tubes were washed, counted, and pooled in equal proportions. Approximately 40,000 cells from the pooled suspension were loaded onto a Chromium Q chip (PN-1000422, 10X Genomics). Sequencing libraries were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq platform using paired-end dual-indexing (49 cycles for Read 1, 10 cycles for i7, 10 cycles for i5, and 90 cycles for Read 2). The sequencing data was demultiplexed using bcl2fastq (Illumina). The resulting FASTQ files were processed with Cell Ranger v7.0.1 (10X Genomics) using the multi pipeline and the GRCh38-2020-A reference genome.

To evaluate panel to panel reproducibility using tTMA1 (23) and nTMA (23) we summed the expression level of shared genes between indicated panels (breast vs. multi-tissue and breast vs. lung panels from Xenium and breast vs. lung panels from MERCOPE) over an individual core and plotted all cores present in each panel, before calculating a Spearman's correlation. The format of the data used is shown in Supplementary Table 10. To evaluate core to core reproducibility, the individual gene counts of replica 1 were plotted against those of replica 2 and a Spearman's correlation was calculated.

To further leveraged data from tTMA1 (24) to evaluate run-to-run reproducibility or check how consistent each platform's results were across different experiments, we compared the total gene expression levels of the same genes measured in 2023 and 2024 from the same panel using scatter plots. We did this for all matching tissue samples and calculated Spearman's correlation to quantify the reproducibility. The format of the data used is shown in Supplementary Table 10. To assess consistency between different but similar samples or sample-to-sample reproducibility, we performed the same comparison on a core basis for all the cores that have matching shapes and cellular structures when imaged in 2023 and 2024. We then summarize the Spearman's correlation values in boxplot to show the relative performance between different iST platforms. While a high correlation value shows that the gene expression patterns are similar, it doesn't account for the overall levels of expression. To get a more complete picture, we also calculated the average log2 fold change values of gene expression between 2024 and 2023 of a core and presented the results in a boxplot (Supplementary Fig. 2i,j).

To compare across panels and platforms, we subset all datasets to include only cores assayed in all runs. The fraction of on-target barcodes was calculated as a percentage of all transcripts corresponding to genes relative to the total number of calls (including negative control probes and unused barcodes or blank barcodes). These measurements were performed on individual cores and averaged across all cores of the same tissue type.

Because the difference in relative numbers of controls and target barcodes across different platforms, we adopted the false discovery rate (FDR) calculation to evaluate the specificity in a more normalized way (Fig. 2e, f, Supplementary Fig. 6b,c). We calculated the FDR of platform p panel m data in tissue t using the following Eq. (1) and cell level data (see example in Supplementary Table 11):

Where N is the total number of cores that belong to tissue type t, I is the total number of unique genes, J is the total number of negative control probes, \({g}_{{in}}\) is the gene expression of gene i in core n, \({{neg}}_{{jn}}\) is the total calls negative control probe j in core.

Since MERSCOPE does not include negative control probes, FDR was recalculated by substituting negative control with blank barcodes (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 6c) using the following Eq. (2):

Where N is the total number of cores that belong to tissue type t, I is the total number of unique genes, L is the total number of unused barcodes or blank barcodes, \({g}_{{in}}\) is the gene expression of gene i in core n, \({{blank}}_{{{\mathrm{ln}}}}\) is the total calls of unused barcode or blank barcode l in core n, specifically, we used “BLANK” for Xenium, “Blank” for MERSCOPE, and “SystemControl” for CosMx. We only used the data from matched cores, so N is same for different platform p.

Sensitivity was measured by the percentage of the total number of unique genes detected above noise level, where the noise was estimated as two standard deviations above average expression of the negative control probes.

Cell Ranger from 10x Genomics was used to demultiplex the raw sequencing data into FASTQ and to align the FASTQ files. R version 4.2.2 and Seurat version 4 were used for all downstream analyses. RNA sequencing results for tTMA1 and tTMA2 went through quality filtering where cells with greater than 5% mitochondrial gene expression or less than 200 expression counts were removed, resulting in 14,945 and 17,749 cells respectively. The number of features and percent mitochondrial can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 9. The data was scaled and normalized, and PCA with dim 1:20 as well as FindCluster with resolution 0.5 were used to find the cell clusters. No batch effect is observed. Markers for each cluster were found and used for cell type annotation. Cells that are used for RNA correspondence analysis are ACTA2-active cells (ACTA > 0), that are 526 and 1117 cells for tTMA1 and tTMA2 respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5c).

RNA TCGA cancer sample gene data summarizes 7932 samples from 17 different cancer types, and it provides FPKM for each gene documented. We used all samples which were annotated as BRCA (Breast cancer), BLCA (Bladder cancer), COAD and READ (colorectal cancer), HNSC (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma), LUAD and LUSC (non-small cell lung cancer), SKCM (melanoma), and OV (ovarian cancer). For GTEx, we selected the tissue types matching the annotation in our normal tissue TMA. For each panel, the genes probed by iST were averaged across all patients with the matching tissue label from the RNA-seq database.

To get pseudo-bulked iST values, the expression level of each gene in each core was normalized to the sum of all genes in that core and scaled by 100,000. We then averaged these scaled pseudo-bulk expression values across cores and plotted them against the averaged FPKMs from reference RNA-seq data sets.

ACTA2-active cells (ACTA > 0, 526 and 1117 cells for tTMA1 and tTMA2 respectively) from single-cell RNA sequencing experiment are also used to compare to the iST data. The single-cell gene expression is aggregated by summing the counts. We used the Cell x Gene portal46. to identify the top gene identifying smooth muscle cells which was contained in each panel: ACTA2-active cells (ACTA > 0) for Xenium and CosMx or MYLK-active cells (MYLK > 0) for MERSCOPE are extracted from the iST datasets. (ACTA2 was too highly expressed to include in the MERSCOPE panel.) Then, gene expression is also aggregated by summing the transcript counts. We use Spearman's correlation to compute the correlation coefficient, and lm (linear model) is used to fit the line.

To determine the assay's ability to specifically identify known lineage markers, we focused on the normal tissue TMA profiled with multi-tissue panel of Xenium, breast panel of MERSCOPE, and 1 K panel of CosMx. We selected genes with known canonical expression patterns using based on transcriptomics data from GTEx. If a gene had 20-fold higher expression in a specific tissue than every other tissue combined, this gene was considered to be a tissue marker and was used for assessing specificity for each platform. Counts for each gene were normalized to the total counts within the core, and then the Z-score of this gene across tissue types was plotted in a heatmap (Supplementary Fig. 8d). We calculated average expression of a gene across cores of the same tissue type and normalized to the total averaged expression of all genes. Z-scores were calculated with the mean and standard deviation across all averaged genes.

In this study, the cell segmentation accuracy of three iST platforms was systematically evaluated using manually annotated ground truth data (31384 cells in total) from 3 TMA cores. These cores were selected to represent 3 distinct cellular scenarios—dense, sparse, and elongated cell distributions—and were morphologically matched across the platforms. We employed both DAPI and membrane staining to identify cells, then marked their centroids using the open-source software QGIS (version 3.16.10-Hannover). The resulting shapefiles were subsequently processed in Python (version 3.10) with GeoPandas (version 0.13.1) for data analysis.

For each platform across three distinct cellular scenarios: dense cells, sparse cells, and elongated cells. Multiple segmentation instances were generated to account for variability and ensure statistical robustness. We used precision, recall, and F1 score as performance metrics. Precision was calculated as the ratio of correctly identified positive segments to the total predicted positive segments, reflecting the accuracy of positive predictions. Recall measured the ratio of correctly identified positive segments to the actual positive segments, indicating the platform's ability to capture all relevant segments. The F1 score, representing the harmonic mean of precision and recall, provided a balanced assessment of the segmentation performance by combining both metrics. To compare the performance across different platforms and core types, statistical analyses were performed using one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) post-hoc tests for pairwise comparisons.

To evaluate the biological performance of the segmentation, we plotted coexpression plots of gene pairs that are mutually exclusive including CD3E vs. EPCAM, CD4 vs. CD8, and PPARG vs. CD68. We pooled all the filtered cells from matched cores of each platform from tTMA1, dropped cells which do not express either gene, plotted the expression of one gene against the other, and converted the scatter plot to a 2D histogram showing cell numbers in each co-expression bin (Fig. 4g, Supplementary Fig. 10h,i).

Segmented cells were aggregated by TMA cores. For Xenium and MERSCOPE data, the estimation of tissue area was performed by calculating the area of a discernible circle, utilizing respective radius of 0.3 µm, 0.6 µm, and 0.6 µm for tTMA1, tTMA2, and nTMA, respectively. Conversely, for the CosMx dataset, the tissue area estimation was approached differently due to its square-like data presentation, a result of the FOV selection process. Here, the tissue area was deduced by multiplying the number of FOVs covered by each core with the area of a single FOV.

For cell filtering, cells with less than 10 transcript counts in MERFISH and Xenium datasets were removed, and cells with less than 20 transcript counts in CosMx datasets were removed. We followed standard processes to then cluster and annotate cell types across each dataset using Scanpy47. Briefly, data was normalized and scaled, dimensionality reduction was performed and cell clusters were identified48,49. To identify the cell type for each cluster, we used a t-test to find the markers for each Leiden cluster and annotated them according to previous literature50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57. These are some of the example markers used for cell type annotation: in breast samples, PIGR and KIT for alveolar cells, for B cells, KRT5, DST, and MYLK for basal cells, LUM, MMP2 and CXCL12 for fibroblast, etc. Heatmaps of the top 3 markers for each cluster are drawn for each dataset from all three panels (refer to Supplementary Fig. 13a–c). For datasets that showed batch effect with patients, Harmony was used to remove this variance58. Correlation heatmaps were generated over overlapping genes that exist in both datasets, and the Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated.

Sea level rise (SLR) increases the risk of flooding at coastal sites that use and produce hazardous substances. We assess whether socially marginalized populations in the United States are more likely to be impacted by projected SLR-related flooding of hazardous sites that could result in contaminant releases. We identify 5500 facilities at risk of a 1-in-100-year flood event by 2100 under a scenario of continued high greenhouse gas emissions, including coastal power plants, sewage treatment facilities, fossil fuel infrastructure, industrial facilities, and formerly used defense sites. Seven states (Louisiana, Florida, New Jersey, Texas, California, New York, and Massachusetts) account for nearly 80% of projected at-risk facilities. Controlling for population density and county, a one standard deviation increase in the proportion of linguistically isolated households, neighborhood residents identifying as Hispanic, households with incomes below twice the federal poverty line, households without a vehicle, non-voters, and renters is associated with 19-41% higher likelihood of having a site at risk of SLR-related flooding within 1 kilometer (odds ratios [95% confidence intervals]: 1.19 [1.09, 1.31], 1.22 [1.08, 1.37], 1.27 [1.16, 1.39], 1.35 [1.21-1.51], 1.36 [1.21, 1.53], and 1.41 [1.32, 1.52], respectively). Results elucidate the need for disaster planning, land-use decision-making, as well as mitigation strategies that address the inequitable hazards and potential health threats posed by SLR.

Global sea level has risen more than 11 cm over the last three decades and that rate is accelerating1, leading to an increase in coastal flooding due to high tides, waves, storm surge, El Niño events and other factors. Extreme coastal flooding is projected to more than double by 2050 across much of the world2. By 2100, nearly all of the coastal United States (U.S.) is expected to experience elevated water levels on a daily basis that today occur only twice per century3, with a rapid increase in the frequency of high tide flooding projected to begin in multiple cities during the next decade4.

Extreme flood events result in the release of toxic substances into the environment. For example, over 200 contaminant releases were reported in the Texas Gulf Coast after flooding resulting from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Over 10 million pounds of regulated air pollutants were released from refineries, petrochemical, and other industrial facilities5, and the catastrophic explosion of a chemical plant due to the loss of power for refrigeration necessitated the evacuation of 40,000 people6. Around the world, industrial facilities are disproportionately located along coastlines due to the historical importance of maritime trade to the establishment of industrial port cities, strategic access to global trade routes for raw materials and finished products via ports, and need for sea water for cooling and wastewater disposal. Marginalized racial and ethnic groups are more likely to live near hazardous waste sites and industrial facilities, and fenceline communities are typically subject to multiple forms of discrimination resulting in limited financial, political, and social capital to mitigate contaminant exposures7. Moreover, longitudinal analyses show that disproportionate hazard burdens faced by racially and economically marginalized groups are largely due to discriminatory land-use, permitting, and facility siting decisions8,9,10,11. Racial residential segregation and the inequitable distribution of stormwater infrastructure further contribute to racialized patterns of flood risk across U.S. cities12.

Building upon a prior California analysis13, we conducted a nationwide equity assessment of flood risk at hazardous sites in the U.S. due to sea level rise (SLR). We derived probabilistic estimates of flood risk in 2050 and 2100 across an expanded range of legacy contamination sites and facilities that contain, handle, produce or emit hazardous substances. We then assessed the geographic distribution of at-risk sites with respect to multiple present-day measures of social marginalization, including race/ethnicity, poverty (household income below twice the federal poverty line), voter turnout, housing tenure, and linguistic isolation. Our objectives were to characterize inequities in residential proximity to hazardous sites at risk of future flooding due to sea-level rise and identify communities where additional resources are needed to prevent exposure to toxic substances and enhance climate resilience.

We first assessed the annual probability of at least one flood exceeding the land elevation of over 47,646 coastal hazardous site locations compiled from one proprietary and four publicly available administrative data sources (Supplemental Table S1). We considered all sites within counties with land area below the 18 m elevation above current mean higher high water line across all coastal U.S. states and Puerto Rico. We defined sites as at risk if their projected annual probabilities exceeded 0.01 (i.e., they were threatened by a 1-in-100-year flood event) integrated across the full distribution of SLR projections using the law of total probability for one low (Reference Concentration Pathway [RCP] 4.5) and one high (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas emissions scenario (see “Methods”).

We found that over 11% of coastal sites in our analysis are at risk of SLR-related flooding by 2100 under the high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) (Table 1). Figure 1 shows the distribution of at-risk sites by state or territory under RCP 8.5 in 2050 and 2100. Seven states (Louisiana, Florida, New Jersey, Texas, California, New York, and Massachusetts) account for nearly 80% of projected at-risk sites in 2100 (Fig. 1). Restricting greenhouse gas emissions to the low emissions scenario makes little difference in terms of the number of projected sites at risk in the near term (2050) but would reduce the number of at-risk sites from 5500 to 5138 (a reduction of 362 or 7% of sites) in the long term (2100) (Table 1). Oil and gas wells and industrial facilities that emit quantities of hazardous substances that require reporting to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory (hereafter “TRI sites”) make up the largest proportion of sites we considered and sites at risk (Table 1). Under the high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), over a fifth of coastal sewage treatment facilities, refineries and formerly used defense sites, roughly a third of power plants, and over 40% fossil fuel ports and terminals are projected to be at risk by 2100 (Table 1).

States are shaded by the total number of at-risk sites, with darker colors representing a higher number of sites at risk (maps). The number of sites at risk in each state is broken down by type, with each facility type represented by a unique color (bar chart).

We next considered the distribution of at-risk sites with respect to community demographics and indicators of social marginalization derived from three secondary datasets: the American Community Survey, a proprietary data source on recent voter turnout, and the federal Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool14. We utilized census block groups as the geographic unit of analysis (hereafter “neighborhoods”) and considered block groups with at least one at-risk site located within 1 km of a populated area as being potentially affected (see “Methods”). Given the prominence of racial discrimination as a means of establishing and maintaining social inequality in the U.S.15, we considered measures of racial and ethnic makeup, as well as indicators of socioeconomic status, civic engagement (voter turnout), and vulnerability that relate to communities' ability to anticipate, mitigate, and cope with flooding, such as age, linguistic isolation (% of households where no one 14 years or older speaks English “very well”), and vehicle ownership.

Table 2 summarizes the population characteristics of neighborhoods near versus far from hazardous sites at risk of flooding due to SLR in 2100 under a high emissions scenario. Figure 2 shows the increase in the likelihood of an at-risk site within 1 km per one standard deviation increase in each demographic and social vulnerability measure, which we estimated using logistic regression models controlling for population density and county to minimize bias related to the higher concentration of people of color and renters in urban areas and demographic variation across U.S. regions.

Black circles are adjusted odds ratios from models that considered one population characteristic at a time and controlled for population density and county fixed effects. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals and were calculated using robust standard errors. The dashed line indicates no association. Disadvantaged status (as defined by the federal Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool [CEJST]) is a binary variable; all other variables are continuous and were scaled by unit standard deviation to facilitate comparisons between effect estimates.

Compared to other coastal neighborhoods, neighborhoods with one or more at-risk site nearby have lower voter turnout, proportions of residents identifying as Asian/Pacific Islander, and individuals under the age of 18, and higher present-day proportions of renters, households living in poverty, residents identifying as Hispanic and Black, linguistically isolated households, households without a vehicle, single-parent households, and individuals over the age of 65 (Table 2). In the multivariable regression models, all these bivariate associations remained statistically significant with the exception of the proportion of Black and Asian/Pacific Islander residents (Fig. 2). Neighborhoods designated as disadvantaged by the federal Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, a nationwide composite assessment of cumulative impact associated with multiple measures of social vulnerability (e.g., poverty) and the presence of climatic and environmental hazardous, had a 50% higher odds of having an at-risk site within 1 km, compared to other coastal, non-disadvantaged neighborhoods (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.50 [1.23, 1.83], Fig. 2). A one standard-deviation increase in the proportion of residents over age 65, linguistically isolated households, residents identifying as Hispanic, households in poverty, households without a vehicle, non-voters, and renters was associated with 15–41% higher likelihood of an at-risk site within 1 km (ORs and 95% CIs shown in Fig. 2). Associations were similar when we considered the presence of at-risk sites within 3 km instead of 1 km of neighborhoods (Supplementary Table S2).

Among neighborhoods within 1 km of an at-risk site, social marginalization was also associated with an increase in the number of at-risk sites nearby and the severity of flood risk across those sites (Supplementary Fig. S1). Here we quantify flood risk severity by estimating the neighborhood expected annual exposure (EAE), calculated by summing the annual probabilities of at least one flood occurring at all hazardous sites within 1 km of populated portions of census block groups. This expected value reflects the total number of sites likely to be exposed to flooding in a given year—either 2050 or 2100 (see “Methods”). Among neighborhoods with an at-risk site within 1 km, a one standard deviation increase in the proportion of Hispanic residents, households in poverty, households without a vehicle, non-voters, and renters was associated with a 7–13% higher number of at-risk sites in 2100 under RCP 8.5 and a 0.10–0.21 unit increase in EAE (see Incidence Rate Ratios, mean differences and corresponding 95% CIs in Supplemental Fig S1). These estimates again control for population density and county to minimize bias.

Figure 3 presents concentration indices and 95% confidence intervals summarizing the degree of inequality in the distribution of at-risk sites with respect to demographic and social marginalization indicators. We utilized concentration indices to identify the categories of facilities that were the most inequitably distributed for particular populations. Similar to the Gini coefficient commonly used to characterize income inequality, a concentration index ranges from −1 to 1, with negative values (in orange) indicating that the burden of at-risk sites is disproportionately higher for more marginalized groups and positive values (in blue) indicating that the burden is disproportionately lower for marginalized groups. Values are shaded white when confidence intervals include the null, indicating no significant evidence of a disparity. Concentration curves corresponding to the indices given in Fig. 3 are included in Fig. 4. These display the distribution of at-risk sites with respect to demographic and social marginalization measures, with the area between the curve and diagonal line of equality being equivalent to the concentration index (e.g. between −1 and 1). To increase the legibility of Fig. 4, for each demographic and social marginalization measure we display only the five site categories with the strongest concentration indices, while the full set of concentration indices is shown in Fig. 3.

Negative values (in orange) indicate a disproportionately higher burden of at-risk sites for marginalized groups, while positive values (in blue) indicate that the burden is disproportionately lower for these groups. White values indicate a lack of statistical significance at P > 0.05. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons.

The X-axis gives the cumulative share of block groups in descending order of each of the demographic and social marginalization variables. Curves above the equality line indicate a disproportionately higher burden of at-risk sites for marginalized groups, while a curve below the equality line indicate that the burden is disproportionately lower for these groups. For example, the top left panel shows that the 50% of low-lying block groups with the highest proportion of renters (indicated by the x-axis value of 0.5) host roughly 80% of at-risk fossil fuel ports and terminals and industrial facilities (indicated by y-axis values of 0.8), whereas if these sites were equitably distributed, the y-axis value would be close to 0.5 and the curves would fall closer to the bolded diagonal line of equality. For legibility, the top 5 facility categories with the strongest concentration indices for each measure are shown.

At-risk power plants, industrial TRI sites, clean-up sites, and fossil fuel ports and terminals disproportionately burdened neighborhoods with higher proportions of renters, non-voters, households without a vehicle, households living in poverty, and linguistically isolated households, as indicated by negative concentration index values in Fig. 3 and curves above the line of equality in Fig. 4. In contrast, at-risk concentrated animal feeding operations and active oil and gas wells more often did not disproportionately burden marginalized groups, as indicated by mostly positive concentration index values in Fig. 3 and curves below the line of equality for many panels in Fig. 4, although there were exceptions. At-risk refineries disproportionately burden neighborhoods with higher proportions of non-voters, households in poverty, and Black residents, and at-risk TRI facilities disproportionately burden neighborhoods with higher proportions of Black, Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander residents. In contrast, neighborhoods with a higher proportion of Native American residents are projected to be disproportionately burdened by at-risk active oil and gas wells, hazardous waste sites, landfills, and formerly used defense sites (Figs. 3,  4).

Conclusions about which at-risk site types are inequitably distributed are largely but not entirely consistent across different metrics of flood risk (number of at-risk sites, which is presented in Fig. 3 vs. EAE across sites which is presented in Supplementary Fig S2). For example, neighborhoods with higher proportions of renters, linguistically isolated households, and households without a vehicle were not burdened by a disproportionate share of at-risk refineries (Fig. 3), but when assessing EAE, they were disproportionately burdened (Supplementary Fig S2 and S3). Similarly, Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islanders were not burdened by a disproportionate share of at-risk refineries (Fig. 3), but are disproportionately burdened when considering EAE (Supplementary Fig S2 and S3). This may be because although the number of at-risk refineries tends to be higher near neighborhoods with smaller proportions of these residents, the severity of projected flooding at those refineries is higher than it is near other neighborhoods.

We present a national assessment of projected SLR-related flooding threats to multiple categories of coastal sites and facilities that contain, use or produce hazardous materials. Our results show that of the more than 47,600 coastal facilities in the U.S. included in our analysis, over 11% (5500 facilities) are projected to be at risk of a 1-in-100-year or more frequent flood event by the end of the 21st century (2100) under a high (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenario. A handful of states, including Louisiana, Florida, New Jersey, Texas, California, New York, and Massachusetts account for nearly 80% of projected at-risk sites.

Facilities at risk include 22% of coastal sewage treatment facilities, 24% of refineries, 44% of fossil fuel ports and terminals, 12% of industrial facilities, 21% of formerly used defense sites and 30% of fossil fuel and nuclear power plants. A prior study estimated the number of wastewater treatment plants and service populations across the U.S. that could be exposed to SLR scenarios from 1 to 6 ft, with projections ranging from 60 impacted treatment plants serving 4 million people to 394 plants serving over 31 million people16. That analysis did not incorporate elevated water levels due to tides, waves, and storm surge, which likely explains why we projected a larger number of sewage treatment facilities to be at risk of SLR-related flooding in the RCP 8.5 scenario. Another prior assessment of how unmitigated greenhouse gas emissions could affect U.S. power-generating capacity in 2100 among power plants in coastal areas estimated a similar number of power plants at risk as we did in our analysis. That study additionally considered the generation capacity of at-risk power plants. The authors found significant variation across states with exposed power capacities relative to current generation capacities being highest in Delaware, New Jersey and Florida (80%, 63% and 43%, respectively)17.

Our analysis shows that industrial facilities that are part of the Toxic Release Inventory make up nearly a third (34%) of the total sites at risk of SLR-related flooding (N = 1870), second to fossil fuel infrastructure (41%), including refineries, fossil fuel ports and terminals and active oil and gas wells. Because we did not include pipelines in our analysis, our projections of the extent to which the nation's fossil fuel infrastructure may threaten coastal communities due to SLR-related flooding and associated contaminant releases are likely an underestimate. Indeed, extreme weather events such as Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Harvey, while very different from the slower moving, incremental flooding related to SLR, have dramatically revealed the vulnerability of industrial facilities and oil and gas infrastructure. Flooding following these hurricanes led to oil and chemical spills, pipeline ruptures, as well as excess air pollutant emissions due to incidental releases as well as intentional shutdowns, flaring, and subsequent restarting of operations at petrochemical facilities18,19,20,21,22,23. Our prior equity analysis of contaminant releases related to Hurricanes Harvey, Rita and Ike found that these natural-technological (natech) disasters disproportionately impacted Hispanic, renter, low-income, and rural populations5. Similarly, results in this study show significant inequities in projected SLR flooding threats to potentially hazardous facilities; communities defined as disadvantaged by the federal Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) have a 50% higher odds of having an at-risk site within 1 km, and a one standard deviation increase in the proportion of linguistically isolated households, neighborhood residents identifying as Hispanic, households in poverty, households without a vehicle, non-voters, and renters is associated with 19–41% higher likelihood of an at-risk site.

Our findings align with prior equity studies of current and projected distributional burdens of flood risk among diverse populations in the U.S. A national study using Federal Emergency Management Agency maps from 2001–2019 in urban areas along with National Land Cover Data and county-level Census data found that 100-year flood zones, particularly in coastal counties, are often occupied by a higher proportion of disadvantaged populations24. Another study of coastal and inland areas estimated an average increase of 26.4% (24.1–29.1%) in climate change related flooding by 2050 under an RCP4.5 scenario, with the future increase in flooding risk concentrated on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and disproportionately affecting Black communities25; although this study examined flooding and economic losses related to residential and non-residential properties, it did not consider risks to potentially hazardous sites. Other studies have examined flooding threats to active and legacy sites containing hazardous material. For example, a report found low-income communities were disproportionately represented among the populations living in proximity to clean-up sites (listed or candidate sites for the Superfund program) at risk of coastal flooding under low, medium, and high SLR scenarios in the East and Gulf Coasts26. A follow-up study identified coastal land below 10 m of elevation as potentially exposed to rising groundwater and identified 326 Superfund sites in these coastal areas that could experience mobilization of toxic compounds from contaminated soil due to groundwater inundation driven by SLR; results also showed that socially marginalized groups in several states would be disproportionately affected by this groundwater rise scenario27. Another analysis of former hazardous manufacturing facilities in six U.S. cities identified more than 6000 relic industrial sites with elevated flood risk over the next 30 years (2050), with socially vulnerable groups, including people of color and low income, disproportionately likely to live in these areas28. Studies outside of the U.S., for example in coastal regions in India, Copenhagen, Vietnam and Italy have investigated the risks posed by climate change-driven SLR and storm surge on infrastructure and vulnerable sites29,30,31,32, but none to our knowledge have evaluated these risks using an environmental justice framework.

Strengths of our study include the use of tax parcel data to characterize the extent of facility boundaries, a probabilistic approach to estimating SLR-related flood risk, and the application of dasymetric mapping techniques to estimate populations and community demographics near at-risk sites. Limitations of our analysis include the fact that our flood models assume that the frequency and magnitude of flood events will remain static over the next century. However, studies indicate that tropical cyclone activity is likely to intensify due to the acceleration of climate change33,34,35, which would result in more damaging impacts to coastal communities36. Additionally, our estimations of annual probabilities of flood level exceedance, based on a modified “bathtub” approach, do not consider scenarios of groundwater intrusion and upwelling or nonlinear interactions between extreme flood events and local topography. These dynamics could cause increased flood levels at inland locations, especially where marshlands shrink, and land becomes more developed37. Our analysis also does not account for floodwater level attenuation particularly in areas where land is wide and flat, which may overestimate exposure during extreme storm events38. Locational errors for hazardous sites may have also led to over- or under-estimates of the number of at-risk sites, and data limitations precluded inclusion of other facility types, including underground storage tanks, brownfields, and non-National Priority List Superfund sites that could experience contaminant releases due to SLR-related flooding. Inaccuracies in the delineation of coastline boundaries may have resulted in the inclusion of offshore drilling sites and the overestimation of flood risk. Finally, we did not account for future flood risk mitigation efforts or population and demographic shifts, given the high degree of uncertainty in predicting these scenarios. Therefore, future actions to mitigate flood risk near hazardous sites, gentrification, displacement, migration, and other factors could change the associations we observed between demographics, measures of social marginalization, and proximity to at-risk sites.

Our analysis highlights the disproportionate burden of projected SLR-related flooding threats to hazardous sites on marginalized racial and socioeconomic groups and elevates the importance of centering environmental justice in future climate change adaptation and land-use planning strategies to protect vulnerable coastal communities from natech disasters. Given that nearly 80% of projected at-risk sites are in seven states, future in-depth work can target these areas and more precisely characterize the potential hazards posed by these facilities to nearby communities with the goal of mitigating and preventing future harmful exposures and health risks. With over 30% of nuclear and fossil fuel power plants, 23% of refineries, and 44% of fossil fuel ports and terminals in coastal areas projected to be at risk, federal reporting requirements for these facilities could be expanded to include the forecasting of SLR-related flooding threats and preventive plans for mitigation, including future relocation, to avoid catastrophic contamination. Critical to these efforts will be ensuring that federal and state agencies provide publicly available, accessible, and continually updated data on projections of SLR-related flooding threats to hazardous sites for diverse end-users, in particular at-risk communities, planners, regulatory agencies, scientists, and decision-makers39. Future research focusing on a smaller subset of facilities and more localized regions or municipalities could further elucidate and potentially untangle the extent to which place-based trends in industrial, economic, labor market, and housing development trajectories, demographic churning, changes in land-use decision-making as well as other shifting structural factors account for the origins and persistence of inequities in exposures to at-risk sites that disproportionately affect marginalized populations.

Finally, many other climate-related phenomena, such as groundwater rise, wildfires, landslides, major storms, and extreme heat, also threaten clean-up sites and active facilities that use and store hazardous materials27,40,41. To achieve a fuller picture, information on these threats should be integrated with projected SLR flood risk data. Risks may be reduced through enhanced regulatory requirements (1) for at-risk facilities to mitigate and prevent contamination threats and (2) for more robust assessment of clean-up sites to inform abatement activities and decisions about future land reuse. Action-oriented partnerships between communities living near at-risk sites and government agencies at local, state, and federal levels may increase the chances for success of these strategies by marshalling much-needed resources aimed at preventing contamination from acute natech disasters and slower-moving threats, including SLR-related flooding.

Our analytic approach entailed four steps: 1) the identification of coastal hazardous site locations and the cleaning of associated descriptive data; 2) the estimation of future flood risk due to sea level rise at each site location; 3) the compilation of measures of demographics and social marginalization; and 4) a neighborhood-level analysis of the relationship between these measures and residential proximity to at-risk sites. We co-developed these methods with an advisory committee comprised of staff members from environmental justice and public health organizations with whom we collectively decided on greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, timeframes (2050 and 2100), flood risk metrics, categorization of sites, and the demographic and social vulnerability metrics to include13.

The spatial extent of our analysis was U.S counties and county equivalents with any land area below 18 meters elevation above current mean higher high water line across all coastal U.S. states and Puerto Rico (see Supplementary Fig S4). Areas farther inland are at no conceivable risk of flooding due to sea level rise this century and were therefore excluded. We scaled up an approach for a prior analysis of California13 to compile a national dataset of active industrial facilities and other potentially hazardous sites. To achieve this, we sourced data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Facility Registry Service (FRS)42, the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Energy Atlas43 (petroleum refineries and terminals), the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers' (USACE) Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center44 (petroleum ports) and Formerly Used Defense Sites database45, and a proprietary dataset of active oil and gas production and stimulation wells from EnverusTM 46. For the FRS, we chose to exclude remediated and closed facilities and facilities with inaccurate or imprecise locational information (e.g. latitude and longitude values derived from zip codes only or with inaccuracy >50 m). This included sites with environmental interest “end dates” indicating they would no longer be regulated after 2020 or where records indicated contamination had been addressed or the site was permanently closed. We retained inactive facilities and facilities with expired permits because residual hazardous materials may remain at these sites. We organized the remaining sites into one of seven categories using (1) environmental permits or regulatory programs; (2) the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code; and/or (3) keyword filters (see Cushing et al. 13 for further detail). We made sure that each category was mutually exclusive and without duplicate entries, as sites can have more than one environmental permit and/or NAICS code and appear in more than one database. We manually removed FRS entries for refineries using refinery names and coordinates from the EIA Energy Atlas dataset.

For oil and gas wells, we utilized latitude and longitude point locations to represent sites due to the small size of well pads compared to other site categories. We identified offshore oil and gas wells as those that were beyond the boundaries of 2010 Census block groups, and excluded them from the analysis to focus on wells located on land. Block group boundaries from the National Historical Geographic Information System do not include coastal water areas and terminate at the coastline. All other site types were represented as polygons in our analysis to better approximate a site's extent. For FRS, EIA, and USACE petroleum port sites, we used the Google API47 to (re)geo-code addresses, then joined the resulting coordinates to tax parcels obtained from Loveland Technologies (now Regrid)48 to approximate their spatial boundaries. Wherever a site's geocoded location overlapped with a tax parcel, we used that parcel to approximate that site's spatial extent for the purposes of projecting flood risk. Around 79% of our geocoded site locations fell within tax parcel boundaries. For sites that did not intersect tax parcels, we approximated boundaries by drawing a buffer equal to the median parcel area of intersected parcels for each site category (See Supplementary Material Table S1 for median areas applied for each category). For formerly used defense sites (FUDS), spatial data were available in both point and polygon format. Not all sites had a point or polygon, while some sites had both. To ensure we included all FUDS in our dataset, we (i) first included all facilities with polygon data, then (ii) identified facilities with point locations falling outside of these provided polygon boundaries, and (iii) drew a buffer around these point facilities using a circular radius that would result in the median area observed among facilities in (i). Wherever a polygon boundary overlapped with a buffered point, we clipped the latter based on the physical extent of the former (n = 25). For overlaps between two polygon boundaries, we used an overlap ratio (calculated as the area of the overlap divided by the area of the smaller polygon) to determine whether to split the overlapping area evenly between two facilities with minimal overlap (≤45%, n = 33), or to merge substantially overlapping facilities together into one (>45% overlap, n = 42). We resolved 13 complex cases involving three or more overlapping facilities manually on a case-by-case basis. The result of this process was a dataset of FUDS boundaries derived from original point locations or polygon boundary extents that contained no spatial overlaps between sites. For all sites, we then clipped parcels and circular buffer areas at the coast if they extended past the mean high tide line.

As a final cleaning step, we flagged and subsequently consolidated duplicate sites (n = 656) if they met three criteria: they were assigned to the same category, had identical geo-coded coordinates, and were associated with the same or similar addresses (we quantified similarity using a fuzzy text match). We retained facilities with identical coordinates and similar addresses if they had been assigned to different categories (n = 232). We dropped facilities with matching coordinates but dissimilar addresses (n = 30) if their geocoded coordinates appeared inaccurate or implausible via manual visual inspection (e.g., located in the middle of a forest far away from any established roads).

We used the same approach to assess flood risk at individual site locations as detailed in Cushing et al. (see Supplementary Fig S5)13,49,50. In brief, we considered probabilistic sea level rise projections51 for two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (Reference Concentration Pathway [RCP] 4.5 and 8.5) and 2 years (2050, 2100)51. For each site, year, and emissions scenario, we estimated the total annual probability of at least one flood event exceeding, in height, the 25th percentile of land elevation for a given site's parcel or buffer boundary. Projections account for vertical land movement and coastal flood height return level curves using methods from Tebaldi et al. and updated tide station data from across the United States52. We derived elevation profiles from NOAA's Coastal Topographic Lidar digital elevation model53, and estimated the annual flooding probabilities using Equation (1) from Buchanan et al.50 We considered sites to be at risk if their projected annual probabilities exceeded 0.01 (i.e., threatened by a 1-in-100 year flood event). We also summed these probabilities across sites to derive a total expected annual exposure (EAE) across all at-risk sites within a given distance of neighborhood (block group) boundaries.

We used 2010 U.S. Census block group boundaries as our definition of geographic neighborhoods. Census block groups are generally contiguous geographic areas that contain between 600 and 3000 people and are the smallest unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau reports a full range of demographic statistics. We used the U.S. Census American Community Survey's (ACS) 2015–2019 five-year estimates54 to approximate demographic characteristics at the block group level: age (% under 18 and % 65 and older), race/ethnicity (% people of color, defined as the inverse of % non-Hispanic White and disaggregated into % Hispanic, and % non-Hispanic [NH] Black, NH Asian or Pacific Islander, NH Native American, and NH other including multiracial), poverty (% below twice the federal poverty line), housing tenure (% renter-occupied units), vehicle ownership (% of households without a vehicle), family structure (% single parent-headed households), linguistic isolation (% of households where no one 14 years or older speaks English “very well”). We used voter turnout data from the 2016 and 2020 general elections from Catalist's National Database to approximate civic engagement (% of registered voters that did not vote averaged across the two elections). Finally, we used the federal Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) that identifies disadvantaged communities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Territories55. Developed as part of the Justice40 Initiative, CEJST was used by federal agencies to identify disadvantaged communities facing disproportionate climate and environmental burdens as well as economic marginalization. CEJST identifies disadvantaged communities through eight categories of vulnerability metrics related to climate change, energy, health, housing, legacy pollution, transportation, water and wastewater, and workforce development. Census tracts are identified as disadvantaged if they meet 90th percentile thresholds for indicators within any of the eight categories and are at or above the 65th percentile for low-income.

We began by identifying and including only counties in our study area with at least one site at risk under RCP 8.5 by 2100. We then further restricted the geographic extent of our analysis to “coastal” block groups in these counties within 3-km Euclidean distance of the 10-m elevation line above mean higher high water line. Our primary outcome of interest was the presence of at least one at-risk site within 1 km. We considered block groups to have this outcome if they contained populated areas within a kilometer of at least one at-risk site (see Supplementary Fig S4). Because block groups can be quite large in rural areas, we utilized gridded population estimates at a 30 × 30 m resolution56 to define populated portions of block groups with the exception of Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico for which these estimates were not available and where we therefore relied on block group boundaries alone. We secondarily considered (1) the total number of at-risk sites within 1 km, and (2) the sum of annual flood event probabilities (total “expected annual exposure”, EAE) across all at-risk sites within 1 km. We conducted sensitivity analyses considering alternate versions of these outcomes using a 3 km rather than 1 km buffer distance.

We examined descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients between our demographic measures and indicators of social marginalization and compared the distribution of neighborhood characteristics between exposed and unexposed block groups using Mann-Whitney U test because variables were not normally distributed. We then ran multivariable regression models for each outcome variable and vulnerability indicator pair, with block-group population density (people per square kilometer), and county fixed effects as additional independent variables. We did not include multiple demographic or social marginalization indicators in the same model due to multicollinearity. We chose to include population density as a potential confounder due to known associations between race/ethnicity, population density, and proximity to industrial facilities57,58. We included county fixed effects to control for regional demographic differences and in effect compare block groups with and without at-risk sites within the same county. We scaled continuous variables by unit standard deviation (SD), using the mean and SD from all block groups in our universe to allow for easier comparisons between effect estimates. In our primary analysis, we used a logistic model to estimate the odds of proximity to an at-risk site (yes/no variable). Restricting to exposed block groups, we used a negative binomial model to estimate associations with the number of sites nearby (count variable) and a linear model to estimate associations with EAE (continuous variable). We used county-clustered robust standard errors to control for the spatial autocorrelation.

Finally, we used concentration curves to visualize the cumulative distribution of the number of exposed facilities and EAE with respect to each indicator of social marginalization. We also derived the concentration index (C) equal to the area beneath the curve and line of equality in our concentration plots to quantify the cumulative distributions. C ranges between −1 and 1, with negative values indicating that block groups with higher proportions of residents from socially marginalized groups have a greater number of at-risk facilities and EAE, and positive values indicating they have a smaller burden of at-risk sites and EAE. A C value with a confidence interval that includes the null value of 0 indicates that the number of exposed facilities and EAE are similar between more and less marginalized populations. We calculated C using all coastal block groups, and we calculated separate indices for each facility category focusing on year 2100 under RCP 8.5. Concentration curves and indices were computed using R (version 4.5.0). All other statistical analyses were conducted using Python (version 3.13.7).

A new study has identified a molecular cue that cancer cells use to exhaust the T cells responsible for destroying them, and the findings show that shutting down this signal may help restore the body's immune defenses. The work, led by researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine and published Nov. 17 in Nature Immunology, reveals that tumors do more than slip past the immune system. They can also alter immune cells in ways that reduce their ability to fight back.

"Our dream is to make immune-based therapies available to every patient. To overcome resistance, we must unlock the power of exhausted T cells, reviving them to destroy cancer. This discovery moves us closer to a future where the immune system itself defeats tumors," said the study's co-senior author, Dr. Taha Merghoub, Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor in Oncology Research, and professor of pharmacology at Weill Cornell Medicine.

Why Immunotherapies Sometimes Fall Short

Modern immunotherapies have reshaped cancer treatment by boosting the body's own defense system. However, not all patients benefit, and even those who do may see their response diminish as their T cells become overworked.

"Our findings reveal a completely new way that tumors suppress the immune system," said co-senior author Dr. Jedd Wolchok, the Meyer Director of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, professor of medicine at Weill Cornell and an oncologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. "By blocking this pathway, we can help exhausted T cells recover their strength and make existing immunotherapies work better for more patients."

How T Cells Lose Their Ability to Fight

T cell exhaustion occurs when the immune system faces long-term infections or persistent tumor activity. Under these conditions, T cells can still recognize harmful cells, yet they stop attacking. "So, they're primed, but they're no longer killing," explained Dr. Merghoub, who is also deputy director of the Meyer Cancer Center and co-director of the Parker Institute of Cancer Immunotherapy at Weill Cornell. He added that although this loss of activity seems harmful, it can prevent uncontrolled inflammation and sepsis.

Earlier studies showed that a surface protein called PD1 contributes to this exhaustion process. Drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors target PD1 and have already proven effective at reviving T cells in cancers such as melanoma.

CD47 Emerges as a Second Immune Brake

The research team set out to determine whether CD47, a molecule found on cancer cells, also plays a role in pushing T cells toward exhaustion. Previous work revealed that tumors use CD47 as a "don't eat me signal" to prevent certain immune cells from ingesting them.

What surprised the scientists was discovering that T cells themselves display CD47. "When T cells are activated, they express CD47. And when they get exhausted, they increase CD47 to very high levels," Dr. Merghoub said.

Experiments showed that mice lacking CD47 had slower tumor growth, suggesting the exhaustion effect came from CD47 on immune cells rather than on cancer cells. In further tests, T cells missing CD47 were more effective against melanoma tumors than T cells that still carried the protein.

Thrombospondin-1 and CD47 Work Together to Exhaust T Cells

The team then investigated how cancer cells might manipulate this process. Their attention turned to thrombospondin-1, a large protein produced by metastatic cancer cells that binds to CD47. When mice were engineered to lack thrombospondin-1, their T cells showed fewer signs of exhaustion.

"That was the real eureka moment," said Dr. Merghoub. "It showed us that CD47 and thrombospondin are clearly key players because eliminating either one gives you the same effect."

Disrupting the Exhaustion Signal With TAX2

To understand the interaction more closely, the researchers used a peptide called TAX2, which was designed to block the connection between CD47 and thrombospondin-1. The results were clear: TAX2 helped maintain T cell activity and slowed tumor progression in mice with melanoma or colorectal cancer.

T cells in treated animals stayed more active, released more immune-boosting cytokines, and were better at entering tumors. TAX2 also enhanced the effectiveness of PD1 immunotherapy in colorectal tumor models.

"We used the TAX2 peptide as a proof-of-concept to confirm that disrupting the crosstalk between TSP-1 and CD47 prevents T cell exhaustion in mice with tumors," said Dr. Chien-Huan (Gil) Weng, an instructor in pharmacology and the study's lead author. "Next, we plan to study both upstream and downstream modulators that regulate the TSP-1:CD47 pathway and develop means to selectively, effectively and safely disrupt this pathway to improve T cell-based cancer immunotherapy."

Toward Stronger, Longer-Lasting Immune Therapies

Blocking this interaction could serve as an effective therapy by itself and may also help sustain tumor-targeting T cells in patients who are at risk of becoming resistant to current immune checkpoint treatments. According to Dr. Merghoub, early experiments in animal models suggest that inhibiting both PD1 and CD47 creates T cells that are significantly better at destroying cancer cells. "We plan to explore this therapeutic angle."

University of Washington President Robert Jones wants to expand computer science access for undergraduates and build new public-private partnerships to tackle society's grand challenges — and he has concrete ideas on how to make that happen.

More than 100 days into his tenure as the UW's 34th president, Jones is also working to dispel two persistent myths: that it's nearly impossible to get into the UW's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, and that AI is taking everyone's jobs.

This fall, the Allen School — a top tech program nationally — accepted 37% of the direct applicants from Washington state high schools, though out-of-state admissions is only 4%. “We actually accept many more students than the general public believes,” Jones said in an interview this week with GeekWire.

As to the AI job apocalypse? “That's an overblown fear,” Jones said. AI is a “critically important tool to have in your tool chest to be more effective in the future.”

Drawing on his experience leading the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Jones wants to give a bigger slice of the UW's 45,000 undergraduates access to computer science courses — even if they're in unrelated degree programs. 

The idea is modeled on the groundbreaking “CS + X” initiative that he helped expand during his past presidency in Illinois. The program created tech-infused studies in 17 degree programs including advertising, astronomy, economics, music, philosophy and physics.

In Illinois, CS + X launched in crop sciences more than a decade ago because agricultural tech was, and continues to be, one of the fastest growing sectors in the state. Jones himself began his career as a professor in plant physiology and became an international authority in the field.

“AI is just an amazing tool, and we're doing work here to try to make sure that our students are getting as comprehensive an education as possible,” Jones said. Bolstering a graduate's knowledge of computer science and artificial intelligence in addition to their focus area makes them “much more employable.”

A $10 million gift  announced Tuesday from Microsoft pioneer Charles Simonyi and his wife, Lisa Simonyi, will help facilitate the integration of AI into education and research across the university through the newly formed AI@UW initiative. 

AI@UW, which includes a new Vice Provost for Artificial Intelligence position, will help the UW maintain its “strategic advantage” as an AI leader, Jones said. It's also an example of the sort of public-private collaborations he'd like to foster.

Jones envisions expanding what he calls “radical partnerships” — building diverse coalitions across geographies, institutions and sectors to tackle problems “that are too big for any one entity to solve alone.”

The collaborations can bring together both expertise and funding. The university faces a difficult financial landscape as Washington state's revenue forecast continues to weaken, drawing down an already strained budget. Add to that ongoing worries about funding cuts to federal research programs that the UW heavily relies upon.

Jones pointed to the university's long-running WWAMI program, which serves medical students from Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho who earn their degrees at the UW and return to their communities to practice medicine, as a prime example of the radical partnership approach.

“I've done about three or four of these over the last 10 years,” he said, “and they're just amazing ways to bring people together and to think about doing research in a different, in a much more collaborative, much more impactful way than we've ever thought about.”

The strategy is particularly suited to AI, quantum computing or other massive technological challenges, he said. Jones was involved in partnerships with the University of Chicago to bolster quantum science research in Illinois and a human biology collaboration with the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago. 

In future collaborations in his new role, Jones is eager to work “seamlessly” with the region's tech sector, leveraging the fact that UW helped create an ecosystem that includes giants like Amazon and Microsoft, as well as hundreds of smaller companies. More than 110 UW spinoffs currently operate in the state, according to the university's CoMotion program, which supports entrepreneurship.

“What we have to do more of is working together to fund and to create the next big idea that's going to be transformative,” Jones said, “not only for the state of Washington, but for the nation and the world.”

Mount Rainier is not getting ready to erupt, but scientists at the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network might blow their stacks over having to respond to a rumor about increased tremor activity at the Washington state volcano.

The Daily Mail reported this week that the mountain was sending up “a flurry of strange signals” and raising concern “that something inside the volcano might be shifting.”  

“This towering stratovolcano looms over more than 3.3 million people across the Seattle-Tacoma metro area, threatening to cripple entire communities with ashfall, flooding, and catastrophic mudflows if it erupts,” The Daily Mail reported in dramatic fashion in a story that went viral online. 

PNSN was forced to respond on Wednesday with a detailed blog post debunking the story, explaining that a likely buildup of ice on the antenna of a Rainier seismic station was causing radio interference misread as seismic activity.

PNSN said the station at St. Andrews Rock (STAR) is “one of the last remaining old analog sites on the mountain and uses very low-power radio transmission to send data down to a receiver site.” The system, located just west of the summit, is susceptible to weather-related interference and PNSN said recent stormy weather likely caused “rime ice buildup.”

The blog post contains recent seismograms and further explanation about how the station's typical signals are affected by glacier slips, rock falls and high winds. PNSN said any unusual seismic activity such as significant earthquakes or volcanic tremor would show up on numerous other stations that are on or near the volcano and would be detected and reported by PNSN within a short time.

“We realized that what they were seeing was one, just one, of our many seismic stations that was sending out essentially static, just noise, instead of actual data,” PNSN Director Harold Tobin told KING 5. “And that's the whole problem, and the thing that people think is tremor at the volcano, it's just some static.”

Washington's Mount Rainier has suddenly awoken and is buzzing with almost nonstop activity for days, stoking fears that an eruption could come soon. 🔗 https://t.co/ZQeqGiKetq pic.twitter.com/KfZ6cUvWi3

PNSN is operated cooperatively by the University of Washington, the University of Oregon, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)'s Seattle Field Office to monitor earthquake and volcanic activity across the Pacific Northwest.

The last minor eruption at Mount Rainier was recorded in 1884.

The last minor eruption at PNSN was Wednesday in response to The Daily Mail.

“Unfortunately, sloppy journalism by non-scientists who don't understand seismology nor check with those that do can generate confusion in the public and more work for those who need to correct the clearly incorrect information,” PNSN's blog post read. “It is no wonder that some publications are only considered tabloids and should never be believed.”

I understand that some people get confused and overwhelmed by a directory structure, but I see that as an education problem, not a UX problem. I was taught all of this in elementary and middle school computer classes in the '90s and early '00s. Having this knowledge early on made me less afraid of my computer, made it feel less like a magical black box, and gave me the confidence to learn more complex topics on my own.Computers become way more capable when the people using them understand fundamentals like directory structures and command line usage. I don't think either of these things are as difficult to learn as reading, writing, and arithmetic (especially if you already have a base level education in those three things).If more "everyday people" just had a little bit more knowledge about these things, they would be able to do way more with their computers with less of a reliance on proprietary solutions that funnel them down whatever path makes someone else the most money.

I know that read/write conflict concerns are what got USB Mass Storage mode removed from Android, but surely there's some way to resolve that. Like it wouldn't bother me a bit if Android just locked the device and put it in "file transfer mode" when it's mounted on a computer, similar to how iPods used to and how Kobo e-readers do now. It'd be worth the universal robust multi-platform support.

The answer to your first question may simply be they want to sell more Pixel 10 phones.The investment into custom silicon is more likely to pay off when new and exiting features are exclusive to the newer platform.

This feature does not use a workaround; the connection is direct and peer-to-peer, meaning your data is never routed through a server, shared content is never logged, and no extra data is shared. As with "Everyone for 10 minutes" mode on any device when you're sharing between non-contacts, you can ensure you're sharing with the right person by confirming their device name on your screen with them in person.This implementation using "Everyone for 10 minutes” mode is just the first step in seamless cross-platform sharing, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Apple to enable “Contacts Only” mode in the future.

Short story: I did a long trip across two continent with my wife. Me with an Android devices, her on iOS. We did backup our photos in our own private cloud but guess how we had to quick exchange photos while in the wild (no wifi and sometimes no network)? We couldn't. Because Google and Apple did everything so we couldn't.Google wants to your data and fought for the cloud. Apple don't want Android users to easily partake in some data exchange with iOS users (you gotta buy your ticket to their jail). So sad you don't realize how backward that is.

3 decades later, hooray, now we can share files between Android and iPhone!

Operating systems have always used their own filesystems, and it persists to this day.The only obvious exceptions that come to mind are iso9660 as a standard for CDs, and people generally go out of their way to use FAT/FAT32/whatever on USB keys and SD cards for compatibility with cameras or whatever device they're plugging the card into. But the latter is a choice users actively make to ensure the FS is compatible with the device, rather than a default.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused content monetization startup Curastory of overstating revenue to investors and misrepresenting true client numbers, according to paperwork seen by TechCrunch.  

As a result of a settlement with the SEC, Curastory's founder and CEO, Tiffany Kelly, has resigned from the role and replaced herself with Dave Dickman, former CEO of the influencer marketing platform Tagger. 

Under Dickman's leadership, the company has begun fundraising, international expansion plans, and product updates, Kelly and Dickman tell TechCrunch. 

The settlement agreement specifically barred Kelly for 10 years from serving on the board of directors or as an executive at any company that would, essentially, fundraise. TechCrunch saw a version of this agreement that had not yet been finalized. It stated that Kelly agreed to these stipulations without admitting to or denying the allegations.  

Although Kelly remains a major shareholder and will remain an adviser, she told TechCrunch that “stepping aside was truly the only decision that I could make just to keep the company alive and thriving,” she said. 

Kelly founded the company in 2021. Curastory is a platform that helps content creators monetize their videos and has grown to about 400,000 creators using it, she said. It lets advertisers buy in-video ads from creators, while tracking metrics and supporting other features, like video editing.  

It has raised around $3 million to date from investors, including Lightspeed's Scout Fund, Feld Ventures, and Mindspring Capital, according to PitchBook, which also listed it as having participated in a few accelerator programs like Techstars and the SPARK Program, held by AMEX Ventures and Project W, according to PitchBook. 

“It's been a wild ride,” she admitted. As part of the settlement, Kelly also agreed to pay a fine. She told TechCrunch that she did not know what triggered the SEC investigation. She said she received a subpoena in June and in January was issued the violations notice from the SEC.  

She hopes for time and grace. “It's interesting having and being forced to step down,” she said. She still has majority ownership in the company but said she's happy that fundraising and finances are off her plate.  

She said she's also happy she was able to pick her successor, finding Dickman through an executive recruiter. Many other ousted founders are not able to do so. She asked the recruiter to find someone who was a good person, who wouldn't strip and sell the company for quick cash, and who would understand the technology.  

“Early-stage companies have all kinds of challenges across the board. In the end, it happened. It's been resolved,” Dickman told TechCrunch. He compared him and Kelly to yin and yang, as he spent decades in the creator space and has worked at a few early-stage startups. She is analytical, he said, and very product-focused, while he likes having more of a leadership role.  

“I feel like we're a good combo and complementary to drive this forward,” he said.  

Kelly, meanwhile, is already seeing some changes, as Dickman has been CEO for a few weeks already. She said his fundraising deck made it to the desk of a VC fund, and they forwarded it to someone else, nudging them to take a look at the product.  

“I have not had that experience with fundraising, as you could probably imagine,” she said, referring to the experience that women, especially Black women, often face when raising venture money. “So that has been eye-opening.”  

Under Dickman, she hopes for a bright future for the company. Curastory already has plans to expand into Canada, Australia, and the U.K. soon.   The company is working on new features to target creators on other platforms like Spotify video and to add AI to the product to make their advertising technology a bit more agentic, she said. Its current video enablement tools include YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook Watch. 

It also plans to add a more enhanced attribution model for advertisers that would eliminate the need for influencer promo codes.  

“Those are the immediate, near-term product, sales, globalization things,” Kelly said.  

Despite this shocking end to her run as the CEO of her company, she told TechCrunch, “Being a founder and CEO is one of the most humbling and rewarding experiences I think anyone can have.” She hopes to share her lessons learned and experiences with others, “especially women and people of color.”

Spotify is making it easier for users to make the switch from other streaming services. On Thursday, the company announced an integration with TuneMyMusic, a tool that can transfer playlists from other streaming services into users' Spotify libraries.

The new feature, which is rolling out now to all Spotify users, will be found in the “Your Library” section of the Spotify mobile app. To use TuneMyMusic, you'll scroll to the bottom of the page, then tap on the new option to “Import your music” and follow the prompts to connect with the service.

You can then choose the platform you'd like to transfer playlists from, and they'll appear in your Spotify library. 

To be clear, this process doesn't delete the original playlists — it only copies them over to Spotify. At launch, TuneMyMusic supports transferring playlists from services like Amazon Music, Apple Music, Deezer, Pandora, SoundCloud, Tidal, YouTube Music, and others.

The addition of the new feature ramps up the competition in the streaming wars, while also serving as a win for data portability. 

One of Spotify's top competitors, Apple Music, already offers a way for iPhone and iPad users to transfer their saved music and playlists from other services to their Apple Music library via a feature that's built directly into the iOS and iPadOS Settings app. That option is also available within the Android version of the Apple Music app.

YouTube Music Premium users can import their playlists from other services, including Spotify, as well.

For customers thinking of switching to Spotify, having the transfer feature built into Spotify could push them to make the jump. It's a nice perk, too, since the online version of TuneMyMusic only offers to transfer 500 tracks for free. For unlimited transfers, users would have to upgrade to a paid plan. 

Spotify isn't sharing the terms of its deal with TuneMyMusic, but it's likely a win for both companies, as it could bring more customers to Spotify while TuneMyMusic snags a large client.

by Todd Bishop on Nov 20, 2025 at 7:15 amNovember 20, 2025 at 7:16 am

The Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) released a new generation of its flagship large language models, designed to compete more squarely with industry and academic heavyweights.

The Seattle-based nonprofit unveiled Olmo 3, a collection of open language models that it says outperforms fully open models such as Stanford's Marin and commercial open-weight models like Meta's Llama 3.1.

Earlier versions of Olmo were framed mainly as scientific tools for understanding how AI models are built. With Olmo 3, Ai2 is expanding its focus, positioning the models as powerful, efficient, and transparent systems suitable for real-world use, including commercial applications.

“Olmo 3 proves that openness and performance can advance together,” said Ali Farhadi, the Ai2 CEO, in a press release Thursday morning announcing the new models.

It's part of a broader evolution in the AI world. Over the past year, increasingly powerful open models from companies and universities — including Meta, DeepSeek, Qwen, and Stanford — have started to rival the performance of proprietary systems from big tech companies.

Many of the latest open models are designed to show their reasoning step-by-step — commonly called “thinking” models — which has become a key benchmark in the field.

Ai2 is releasing Olmo 3 in multiple versions: Olmo 3 Base (the core foundation model); Olmo 3 Instruct (tuned to follow user directions); Olmo 3 Think (designed to show more explicit reasoning); and Olmo 3 RL Zero (an experimental model trained with reinforcement learning).

Open models have been gaining traction with startups and businesses that want more control over costs and data, along with clearer visibility into how the technology works. 

Ai2 is going further by releasing the full “model flow” behind Olmo 3 — a set of snapshots showing how the model progressed through each stage of training. In addition, an updated OlmoTrace tool will let researchers link a model's reasoning steps back to the specific data and training decisions that influenced them.

In terms of energy and cost efficiency, Ai2 says the new Olmo base model is 2.5 times more efficient to train than Meta's Llama 3.1 (based on GPU-hours per token, comparing Olmo 3 Base to Meta's 8B post-trained model). Much of this gain comes from training Olmo 3 on far fewer tokens than comparable systems, in some cases six times fewer than rival models.

Among other improvements, Ai2 says Olmo 3 can read or analyze much longer documents at once, with support for inputs up to 65,000 tokens, about the length of a short book chapter.

Founded in 2014 by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Ai2 has long operated as a research-focused nonprofit, developing open-source tools and models while bigger commercial labs dominated the spotlight. The institute has made a series of moves this year to elevate its profile while preserving its mission of developing AI to solve the world's biggest problems.

In August, Ai2 was selected by the National Science Foundation and Nvidia for a landmark $152 million initiative to build fully open multimodal AI models for scientific research, positioning the institute to serve as a key contributor to the nation's AI backbone. 

It also serves as the key technical partner for the Cancer AI Alliance, helping Fred Hutch and other top U.S. cancer centers train AI models on clinical data without exposing patient records.

Olmo 3 is available now on Hugging Face and Ai2's model playground.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

Fix one thing, but break two others.

Nvidia just released the GeForce Hotfix Display Driver 581.94, which it says fixes performance issues seen in some games after Microsoft released KB5066835. The problematic mandatory patch was released in October and affected systems that ran Windows 11 25H2 and 24H2, which introduced a bug that reduced game FPS in some instances, according to Windows Latest. Since this is a mandatory cumulative update, future Windows patches are also expected to experience the same problem, so it's highly recommended that you download and apply the latest GPU driver if you experience some performance loss while gaming after installing the update.

While Nvidia says that only some games were affected by the bug, it seems to have been significant enough for it to release a hotfix instead of waiting for its regular driver update release schedule. Team Green says that GPU drivers are incredibly complex, especially as it has to deal with a potentially infinite number of hardware and software configurations. Because of this, it usually releases driver updates in line with major hardware and game launches after extensive testing.

However, this means that major issues could remain unaddressed as existing users wait for Nvidia's regular release cadence. Because of this, the company drops hotfixes, which are released in advance to resolve major issues as soon as possible. For example, when the newly-launched 50-series GPUs started crashing and producing black screens, Nvidia dropped a hotfix outside of its usual release cadence to address the problem. When some issues remained unsolved, the company dropped another hotfix just a week after that to further address crashes and clock speeds.

Windows Updates have recently been breaking a lot of stuff, including one that made USB keyboards and mice unusable in the Windows Recovery Environment and another that triggers BitLocker and encrypts your hard drive without warning. Thankfully, Nvidia stepped up relatively quickly and released an update to fix what the Windows Update broke. It's unclear if Intel and AMD will release driver updates of their own to deal with KB5066835, especially as neither company has acknowledged any Windows Update-related problems so far, but Windows Latest said that GPUs from Intel and AMD are also suffering from performance issues brought about by this particular patch.

Google is upgrading its image-generation model with new editing chops, higher resolutions, more accurate text rendering, and the ability to search the web.

Dubbed Nano Banana Pro, the new model is built on Google's latest large language model, Gemini 3, released earlier this week. The company claims Nano Banana Pro improves on its predecessor, Nano Banana, with the ability to create more detailed images and accurate text, and generate text in different styles, fonts, and languages.

The model also has web-searching capabilities, so you can do things like ask it to look up a recipe and generate flash cards.

Google says Nano Banana Pro is geared toward giving professionals more control over images, and lets users control aspects like camera angles, scene lighting, depth of field, focus, and color grading. And compared to Nano Banana's resolution cap of 1024 x 1024px, users can generate 2K or 4K images with Nano Banana Pro.

The company noted that while Nano Banana Pro can generate images at a higher quality, it is slower and costlier than the original model, which cost $0.039 per 1024px image. Comparatively, the new model costs $0.139 for each 1080p or 2K image, and $0.24 for every 4K image.

The new model can use six high-fidelity shots or blend up to 14 objects within an image. It can also maintain consistency and resemblance of up to five people. The company has released a demo app where you can try some of these capabilities.

Nano Banana Pro is being rolled out across many of Google's existing AI tools. The Gemini app will now use the new model to generate images by default, though users on the free subscription tier will be able to use the model to generate a limited number of images, after which they will be defaulted to the original Nano Banana model. 

Google AI Plus, Pro, and Ultra subscribers will get higher-generation thresholds, though the company did not disclose the exact limits. These subscribers will also get access to the model within NotebookLM.

Google is also making the model available in search through AI mode for AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the U.S. Ultra subscribers can access the model in the company's video tool, Flow, and it is available to Workspace customers in Google Slides and Vids, too.

Developers can tap Nano Banana Pro through the Gemini API, Google AI Studio, and the company's new IDE, Antigravity.

The company is also baking SynthID, its tech to watermark and detect AI-generated images, into the Gemini app. Users can upload an image, and the chatbot will tell them if the image has been created or modified by the company's image models.

Google said that over time, it will include support for C2PA content credential detection for content verification. 

The story has been updated to reflect Google's approach to support C2PA.

Reports emerged Wednesday that the White House is preparing an executive order directing federal agencies to challenge or block state-level AI regulations. 

Seattle entrepreneur Joe Braidwood sees the news as a major opportunity. 

Braidwood is CEO and co-founder of Glacis, a new startup backed by the AI2 Incubator that is building software to help companies prove that their AI safety measures are executed as intended. Glacis creates tamper-proof “receipts” for every AI decision, allowing companies to prove their safety systems actually ran.

“Think of it as a flight recorder for enterprise AI,” Braidwood said.

Braidwood said the potential White House order to block state AI laws transforms Glacis from a startup just getting off the ground into “infrastructure necessity.” In an environment where the Justice Department would sue states that pass AI rules, a neutral, platform-agnostic trust layer could become increasingly relevant.

Glacis' origins are rooted in regulatory complexity.

Braidwood, a longtime tech marketing leader, recently shuttered Yara, his year-old startup that aimed to use AI to improve mental wellness. He cited Illinois regulations that made AI therapy “effectively uninsurable.”

In a LinkedIn post that has since gone viral, Braidwood explained the decision to close Yara and open-source a set of safety prompts he had developed.

He wrote that Yara closed after he realized AI became “dangerous” when interacting with people facing deep trauma or suicidal ideation — not just inadequate. The experience, he said, showed “where the boundaries need to be,” and demonstrated how startups working in high-risk AI categories face unmanageable liability and regulatory pressure.

After the post, regulators, clinicians, engineers, founders and insurance executives reached out — many pointing the same problem: when AI systems make decisions, no one can independently verify whether safety policies actually fired.

That clarity became the seed for Glacis.

Every time an AI model answers a question or takes an action, Glacis creates a signed record showing the input, the safety checks that ran, and the final decision. The record can't be altered and takes less than 50 milliseconds to generate. Regulators and insurers can verify these receipts without seeing any personal data, and Braidwood said insurers believe this could finally make it possible to insure AI systems that can prove they followed the rules.

Braidwood co-founded Glacis with Dr. Jennifer Shannon, a psychiatrist and adjunct professor at the University of Washington. 

The company is currently in private beta with digital health customers, including nVoq, and is targeting healthcare, fintech, and insurance sectors. It's also part of Cloudflare's Launchpad program.

Braidwood was previously chief strategy officer of Vektor Medical. He also co-founded social TV platform Scener and was chief marketing officer at SwiftKey.

Shannon has been a psychiatrist for nearly two decades. She was also a medical director at Cognoa and serves on the AI Resource Committee for the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

Cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks announced Wednesday it will acquire Chronosphere in a deal valued at $3.35 billion.

Founded in 2019, Chronosphere sells observability software that helps engineering teams spot problems quickly and keep cloud applications running. Palo Alto Networks said the acquisition will help it meet the massive data demands created by modern AI workloads.

Chronosphere CEO Martin Mao and CTO Rob Skillington first met in the Seattle area at Microsoft, where they worked on migrating Office to the cloud-based Office 365 format. They both later joined Uber's engineering teams. 

The company describes itself as a “distributed team” with major hubs in New York City, Seattle, and Vilnius. Mao is based in the Seattle region, along with several Chronosphere employees. The team, including Mao and Skillington, will join Palo Alto once the acquisition closes. Chronosphere has more than 250 employees.

On the company's earnings call with analysts Wednesday, Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora described Chronosphere as “one of the fastest-growing software companies in history.” It counts two of the “premier LLMs” as customers.

Arora said existing observability tools were not built for the AI era and that full observability has become cost prohibitive for many organizations. Chronosphere, he said, can deliver observability at one-third the cost of other leading solutions. 

He added that Chronosphere has “changed the observability model” with its combination of open source and architectural techniques.

When Palo Alto evaluated observability and data-pipeline vendors, Arora said the team was struck by Chronosphere's engineering chops. “Generally, engineers have too much pride to tell you that somebody else is good,” he said. “But our team came back and said, ‘these guys are the best engineers we've run into.'”

Chronosphere reports more than $160 million in annual recurring revenue, growing at triple-digit rates, according to Palo Alto. 

Chronosphere will remain “largely standalone” after the deal closes next year. “They are basically a bunch of really smart engineers and forward-deployed engineers, as well as a few salespeople,” Arora said. “So, we're going to give them some support by introducing the right customers in very targeted fashion.”

The company's investors include General Atlantic; Greylock Partners; Lux Capital; Addition; Founders Fund; Spark Capital; and Glynn Capital.

“When Rob Skillington and I started Chronosphere six years ago, we set out to build a next-generation observability platform capable of handling the most complex cloud native workloads,” Mao wrote on LinkedIn. “Today, we are the observability leader trusted by the world's top AI and digital-native innovators.”

Earlier this year Palo Alto Networks also acquired Protect AI, a Seattle startup that helps companies monitor machine learning systems.

After the Hunger Games franchise returned with Suzanne Collins' 2020 prequel book The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, it didn't take much time before Lionsgate decided to bring it to film. That ended up being a hit, so, to no one's surprise, they've decided to also adapt Sunrise on the Reaping, the second prequel that was released earlier this year.

Set decades after Ballad, the new film focuses on a young Haymitch Abernathy, played first by Woody Harrelson in the original movies and here by Joseph Zada. As a candidate in the 50th Hunger Games, Haymitch is fighting against 47 other kids handpicked by the Capital. “Twice the number of tributes, twice the glory,” beams Glenn Close's Drusilla Sickle.

Longtime fans of the books will recognize young versions of series characters like Effie Trinket (Elle Fanning) and President Snow (Jesse Plemons), alongside other young players Haymitch encounters, played by the likes of Mckenna Grace and Ben Wang. It's not going to be a good time for Haymitch and the other kids, but Lionsgate is hoping it'll be a good time for the audience when The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping hits theaters one year from today—November 20, 2026.

The White House and European leaders rarely see eye-to-eye on much, but they are gradually finding common ground on the issue of deregulating AI companies to spur even more unfettered development.

The EU's executive branch, the European Commission, announced on Wednesday that it wants to “simplify” its AI and privacy laws. The move is impacting two major pieces of European tech regulation that have had a global impact: the first-of-its-kind AI Act of 2024 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a comprehensive online privacy law that reshaped the internet when it passed in 2018.

For the GDPR, that's going to look like slashing data privacy laws for the sake of AI. Under the proposed changes, tech companies will have more leeway to use anonymized user data to train their AI models.

“Artificial intelligence is becoming a driving force of our economies, both in the tech sector and beyond, as it provides new solutions across industries. To be able to compete in this new global market, the EU must be able to fuel AI with high-quality data,” the Commission wrote while explaining the new changes.

The bloc's sweeping cookie laws will also get a revamp. That set of regulations was to blame for the global influx of cookie pop-ups, as many companies found it easier to switch their systems completely rather than create a Europe-specific version of their websites. If the new proposals are accepted, the EU will reduce the pop-ups by allowing users to save their cookie preferences in browsers, in a move that was largely expected for some time now.

For the landmark AI Act, that simplification would include delaying the enforcement of some key facets. Although it went into law in 2024, the act's stricter rules on AI systems that have been deemed “high-risk” were going to be applied after a grace period ending in August 2026. The latest proposal wants to delay that until “standards, specifications and guidelines are in place,” the Commission's executive vice-president Henna Virkkunen said in remarks. High-risk AI includes technology that is used to profile people in use cases like biometrics, job applications, border control, and more.

These proposals are not law yet. They will first be submitted to the European Parliament, where they need the approval of a qualified majority.

The main objective of this regulatory loosening is to boost European tech competitiveness, the Commission said, and Wednesday's proposals are apparently only “the first step.”

While it's not certain how much the Trump administration's pro-tech anti-regulation push has impacted the European Commission's thinking, one official wasn't afraid to make the connection.

“No one is fooled over the transatlantic origin of these attempts,” the EU's former commissioner for the internal market Thierry Breton wrote in an op-ed published by the Guardian. “We can't let ourselves be intimidated.”

President Trump has defined the EU's attempts to regulate American tech as “overseas extortion,” and made fighting it a central point of his trade offensive against the EU. Standing ten toes behind him in this fight are Silicon Valley giants.

“Europe has an ever-increasing number of laws institutionalizing censorship and making it difficult to build anything innovative there,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January ahead of Trump's inauguration. “We're going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies.”

Meanwhile, it's been a good day for AI companies stateside as well.

Republicans are gunning for a moratorium on state AI laws, either as a standalone bill or to be added to the National Defense Authorization Act, which is likely to be finalized soon and voted on next month. Trump posted in support of that in his Truth Social account on Tuesday night, saying that “we MUST have one Federal Standard instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.”

It's not clear, though, if that moratorium request would pass. A similar Republican attempt to add a moratorium in the Big Beautiful Bill fell through, mostly because of worries that it would help AI companies evade regulation on child safety laws.

But in his second term, Trump has been no fan of waiting for Congress to advise and consent. On Wednesday, The Verge obtained a draft of an executive order that the President is reportedly expected to sign as soon as Friday. The order would create an “AI Litigation Task Force” that would be charged with suing states over laws that are determined to obstruct the progress of Big Tech's AI development.

But this time around, while Congress ponders that moratorium, a pro-AI group is forming on the sidelines. According to Axios, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema will be co-chairing a new group that wants to “push back” on scrutiny of the AI industry. Called the AI Infrastructure Coalition, the organization will officially launch on Wednesday evening. The members allegedly include the usual pro-AI suspects like Andreessen Horowitz, Cisco, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and some energy companies.

From their perspective, they're retaliating with the same force MG is supposedly using against them. I could understand that, if MG was actually behind the harassment, which this lawsuit would be the best place possible to lay out their proof for but ended up not being convincing enough not to cost them 70k pounds.I doubt they'll be convinced that MG isn't behind the attacks, but hopefully their weird lashing out against him will stop now.I hope TR/TM do find and stop the harassment they receive, because as much as their libel is a problem, they actually are victims themselves.

From my limited (non-lawyer) reading of this, they didn't actually offer any evidence. I'm not sure if they had any evidence or not. But it appears that they represented themselves and didn't go through the proper procedures for offering evidence or witnesses. So all they could do was cross-examine.My reading (from just the judgement posted) is that it is a sad thing that it came to a legal dispute at all.

reply

The entire situation is an awful mess. I don't really understand why TR/TM didn't have a solicitor in this case. The moment they showed up without legal representation, they pretty much lost the case. I can only guess at their reasons, but two counter suits failing probably cost them a decent chunk of change that would leave anyone short on cash.

reply

reply

It might end up being more than 70k£ for them, given MG's legal fees may not be included in that price (I can't see any indication either way)

reply

They are probably very high. I'm not a lawyer but other similar cases have fees in the range of 150K to 300K.It's a life changing amount of money. The stakes are very high for both sides.  Honestly it's really sad that this happened and I am not sure anyone has come out happy.

If someone posts a huge amount of articles about how you are various non-good things, then a employer might do a simple Google of your name on and think "Oh, actually, I don't think I want to hire that guy" that's worth quite a lot of money if that's a job that you actually wanted to get (and that results in a loss of income/opportunities)Typically speaking, you should probably only be saying things on the internet or otherwise that you have serious evidence for.

Disclaimer: Being a (currently quite inactive) member of the Debian project myself, I've met Matthew Garrett in the past on a relatively small number of occasions, but I have no inside information on the allegations mentioned in this court judgment and have not discussed them with him or with anyone else involved. I do, however, believe his side of the story based on what context I have about him.

reply

> Mr Hamer asks for a single global sum to vindicate Dr Garrett's reputation and compensate him for distress in relation to all the publications complained of. He proposed a range of comparator decisions for my consideration, in support of a submission that libel damages approaching £100,000 would be appropriate. I have considered these. I noted in particular the case of Fentiman v Marsh [2019] EWHC 2099 in which an award of £55,000 was made in respect of allegations in a blog read by about 500 people that the claimant, a company CEO, was a hacker responsible for illegal cyber-attacks on a company. The tone of the allegations there were something comparable to those in the present case – somewhat personally and floridly put. I hold the effects of inflation in mind.> In my judgment, in all these circumstances, the minimum sum necessary to convince a fair-minded bystander of the baselessness of the allegations against him, to vindicate his reputation and restore his standing, and to compensate him for the consequences he has suffered, is £70,000.The fact techrights is a somewhat popular and respected publication on free software (at least by some circles) probably cost them.This isn't just about someone calling someone else an asshole, this is about a long and continuous series of accusations and (now legally confirmed) libel, neatly documented and organised on a dedicated hate page: https://techrights.org/wiki/Matthew_J_Garrett/ Looking at the dates on those links, they were especially active during August of 2023, accusing him of everything from misogyny and racism to committing hate crimes.

Taken literally it's accusing someone of a specific depraved act, but it's also clearly a term of abuse. My guess (not a lawyer!) is that once a term becomes more associated with abuse the more you're protected.Hustler basically called Jerry Falwell a motherf!cker but attributed to him a specific act, which they highlighted was satire and not to be taken seriously. Hustler lost in a jury trial and also on an appeal to the 4th circuit. The Supreme Court eventually ruled in Hustler's favor [0]. This is dramatized in the movie The People vs Larry Flint.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustler_Magazine_v._Falwell[1] https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-people-vs-larry-flynt/

Meanwhile, a pedophile is something that a person capable of bringing a defamation suit could also literally be, and where a reasonable member of the audience for a description of them as such might (given the right other circumstances) view the description as a literal fact claim.

reply

"That diver is a pedophile" is pretty clearly a factual statement, implying that the person abuses kids, or has been convicted of such. (I know that, uh, the original statement was basically just an insult, but: it does posit a fact.)

reply

The judgments in these cases take all of the context into consideration.In general, though, accusing someone of pedophilia is substantially more serious than calling them an asshole. The former has objective meaning and can be associated with crimes against minor victims. The latter just means you don't like someone.

Merely adjudicating truthfulness with injunctive relief might be understandable in this day and age of persistent shameless lying. But the hefty monetary damages for what seems to be good faith (though seemingly entirely unsupported and possibly even delusional [0]) speech is a tough pill to swallow.[0] I took a quick scan through Techrights's wiki page "documenting" all this and the only thing substantiating the connection I could find was Garrett and the IRC harasser ping-timing-out at the same time. But there are many different ways that could happen. Yet every screenshot is captioned as if it was definitely Garrett saying those things.

> Dr Garrett is chiefly accused of an online campaign of material which is (variously) criminal, illegal or offensive. The criminal matters alleged include cybercrime, hate crime, blackmail, issuing threats of violence or death, and matters adjacent to terrorism. Other illegal matters alleged include defamation, harassment and online abuse. Offensive matters alleged include material that is variously racist, antisemitic, misogynist, homophobic or otherwise hateful or discriminatory, sexually incontinent, or drugs-related. Dr Garrett is alleged to have waged this campaign through the medium of IRC ‘sockpuppet' accounts – accounts under pseudonymous user nicknames intended to be a vehicle for distributing material anonymously and deniably. Many posts from these accounts are reproduced in the articles complained of. Dr Garrett is also repeatedly alleged to be an uncontrolled user of illegal class A drugs, principally crack cocaine.The evidence for the allegations was apparently very thin (¶¶59–60):> First, the defence relies on an incident a few years prior to the sockpuppet campaign, in which Dr Garrett admittedly registered himself online in two borrowed names for the purpose of making a rhetorical or satirical point about the owner of those names. Dr Garrett's evidence is that he did so openly, and with the knowledge of the owner (who had himself vacated the names in order to borrow another user's nickname – which was in part Dr Garrett's point in also doing so). Dr Schestowitz clearly takes exception to that particular piece of theatricality as a major breach of netiquette in its own right, and regards it as a sign or symptom of propensity for sockpuppetry. But the incident in question, on its face, is plainly something quite different from the covert use of sockpuppet accounts to publish illegal or offensive material, and is not in my judgment capable of indicating any sort of propensity to do that.> Second, it is said there was an incident in which Dr Garrett's own named account and one of the sockpuppet accounts experienced simultaneous dropped connections. If established, that could indicate dual operation by a single individual. The evidence from the Claimant is that the dropped connections were not in fact simultaneous. I have no evidential basis for doing otherwise than proceeding on that basis. This pleading cannot in the circumstances support an inference of Dr Garrett's authorship of the sockpuppet posts.¶¶61–75 have further, even weaker evidence.

Defendants Roy and Rianne Schestowitz were the targets of online harassment. They decided that claimant Matthew Garrett was behind it, and initiated their own hate campaign against him, in particular using their websites www.techrights.org and news.tuxmachines.org to do so.The defendants did a very poor job of going to court, even by the standards of amateurs representing themselves, producing almost no evidence, none of which the judge found to be relevant.Damages of £70K were awarded.

>This is a dispute between prominent ‘free software movement' activists. The free software movement advances a philosophy and practice which values the freedom of users to create and share software enabling internet access, and challenges the dominance of ‘big tech' software and systems over the online experience. That includes a preference for internet relay chat (‘IRC'), an online instant messaging system dating in origin from the 1990s, over the big social media platforms. The challenge the free software movement makes is not only of a technical, but also of a social, economic or ethical nature, and it espouses some wider sets of values accordingly

The U.S. and its global partners have sunk trillions of dollars into the AI arms race, with Silicon Valley's prime movers swearing that the technology is destined to transform our world for the better. Now, a new study joins a growing chorus that seek to highlight an inconvenient truth: so far, a vast majority of companies that adopt AI are making no money from it at all.

The new study comes from KPMG, a British accounting and professional services firm. The study, published Wednesday, looked at businesses in Canada, surveying them for evidence that AI was providing anything in the way of a ROI. Sadly, the study found that, no, pretty much nobody who is using AI has managed to find its financial upside yet. Indeed, the survey found that, while more and more businesses are using AI, only about 2 percent of respondents claimed that they had seen a “return on their generative AI investments.”

The survey, which involved 753 business leaders from across the nation, found that the slim amount of respondents who did report positive results from AI were from very large companies that reported at least $1 billion in annual revenue. A lot of companies have yet to fully integrate AI into their workflows, and many of them are still merely experimenting with the technology, the report adds.

AI is seeing the largest rates of adoption in IT and sales and marketing, the study shows. Other areas where it has seen broad adoption include research and development, finance and accounting, and engineering, it says.

Canadian Managing Partner of Digital and Transformation at KPMG Canada Stephanie Terrill laid it out the general outlook like this:

“Only a small sliver of Canadian businesses are generating growth from their AI investments today, and that's understandable – new technologies take time to be adopted and demonstrate identifiable return on investment,” Terrill said. “However, Canada is facing near-term threats to its economic competitiveness and grappling with declining productivity and prosperity, so waiting years for AI investments to create value isn't realistic in this environment – in fact, it's downright risky.”

Despite that fairly negative outlook, Terrill's takeaway isn't what you might think—that AI just isn't very helpful and that companies should ditch it. Instead, she says that Canadian companies should turbocharge their AI investments so as to increase national “competitiveness” and see that elusive ROI that is currently eluding them:

Canadian organizations need to accelerate AI implementation into core operations to start achieving near- to medium-term productivity gains if we hope to become more economically competitive as a country,” she added.

How long do companies have to wait until AI starts doing what it's supposed to do? Many business leaders expect to wait a number of years before AI has its intended effect, the study reports. Despite the fact that it's currently useless, a certain portion of companies (3 in 10) expect to start seeing a return on their AI investment within a year, it adds. A greater portion (6 in 10) said they expect to see that ROI in one to five years. Hope springs eternal, I guess.

A new music streaming service created with the cooperation of all the major record labels will soon debut, with generative AI functionality as its centerpiece, Bloomberg's Lucas Shaw reports. The labels in question are Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group, and Sony Music.

That report says the service is called “Klay,” a fun misspelling of a word for a mushy, formless substance. Incidentally, another word for a mushy, formless substance is “slop.”

About a year ago, Klay struck a deal with Universal to team up on an AI music project touting itself as “ethical,” but reports at the time didn't make it clear what kind of product or service that partnership might produce. 

Someone named Ary Attie is listed on LinkedIn as the founder of Klay. Klay has a website, klay.vision, where users can join a waitlist, and see the slogan “Music set free,” but there's no other information.   

On the same day as Bloomberg's report, news also broke that Warner, one of the companies involved in this deal, had settled a lawsuit with the AI music generation company Udio, and was preparing to join forces with Udio on a song creation platform—presumably a separate venture from Klay, although that's not totally clear yet. (Gizmodo reached out to Warner for clarity, and will update if we hear back). Universal settled a similar suit against Udio on October 30.

Assuming the Bloomberg report is correct, it's clear that these record companies have now fully evolved into a new form in which they see themselves as AI companies too. They never seemed especially hostile to the technology. Even with lawsuits against companies like Udio ongoing, Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement in June of last year, “The music community has embraced AI.” But Glazier and his allies would “only succeed,” he said, “if developers are willing to work together with us. Unlicensed services like Suno and Udio that claim it's ‘fair' to copy an artist's life's work and exploit it for their own profit without consent or pay set back the promise of genuinely innovative AI for us all.” 

This new service apparently resolves all these concerns to the labels' satisfaction, coming with “assurances that the artists and labels will have some control over how their work is used,” Shaw writes.

Details about how Klay would work are scant. Shaw indicates that it will resemble Spotify, but that AI functions will be available so the user can “remake” songs “in different styles.” By partnering with all the major labels, Klay was able to license “thousands” of hit songs for apparently legal training purposes. 

Reading between the lines, it sounds like there will probably be some sort of text input. Perhaps you'll be able to fire up Queen's “Bohemian Rhapsody,” and type “make this a polka.” Presumably after some processing, Klay will spit out something that sounds a little like “Weird Al” Yankovic's brilliant, faithful uptempo reconstruction of “Bohemian Rhapsody” with a new arrangement and a virtuosic polka performance, minus all the joy, spontaneity, and palpable love for the original material that such a feat of artistry entails. 

And since artists typically own their sheet music and their voice likenesses, if not their actual recordings, it stands to reason that they might have some legal say, which explains why there would be controls in place for the artist. For instance, while I'm not a copyright lawyer, it seems like the label probably wouldn't be legally allowed to let the user create, say, a realistic Alicia Keys voice singing one of her actual melodies, but with words about poop and farts. 

And if Klay's audio outputs are up to the standard set by the existing AI music generators, it will probably sound tolerable. A recent survey fairly convincingly showed that people can't really distinguish AI-generated music from human-generated music at all. But 51% of respondents to that survey also said they think AI-generated music will lead to the existence of more generic, low-quality music in the world. 

Gizmodo reached out to Klay for confirmation and details, and will update if we hear back.

When it comes to recycling, few materials can match aluminum. It can be reused an infinite number of times, and it's often cheaper to recycle than to produce new aluminum because it requires so much less energy. Yet only about a third of the aluminum used in the U.S. gets recycled.

The problem lies in sorting mixed aluminum scrap — a challenge that has long stumped the recycling industry.

Michael Siemer, CEO of Sortera, thinks his company has found the key, though. Sortera says it has developed a system that can separate aluminum grades with over 95% accuracy — a breakthrough that could unlock a massive untapped resource in the recycling industry.

Here's how it works: The company uses an AI model that identifies different grades of aluminum based on data from lasers, X-ray fluorescence, and high-speed cameras. The system has to classify each chip — about the size of a large potato chip — in a fraction of a second. “Ten milliseconds is a long time,” Siemer says. Once the vision system identifies the grade, a series of nozzles blow precise puffs of air to flip the chip off the belt and into the correct bin.

That speed and accuracy matters because other recycling operations must melt the aluminum first before they can tell which type of alloy it is. And if alloys aren't sorted properly, the mixed heap is worth far less because customers can't be confident it will have the properties they need.

“People have been wanting to go after [this unsorted aluminum], and nobody's been able to unlock it,” says Siemer.

Sortera's sorting accuracy has further helped the company unlock something else many startups seek: profitability. “The margin is exponential above 90%, [while] 92% gets you a nice little margin, 95% gets you a big margin, [and] 98% is a really big margin.”

That's helped the company become cash flow positive since August, he says, all based on the operation of a single plant in Indiana. To build a second plant in Tennessee, Sortera recently raised $20 million in equity and $25 million in debt in a round led by VXI Capital and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price, with participation from Overlay Capital and Yamaha Motor Ventures, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Trinity Capital is providing additional equipment funding.

The new plant, which is being built near Nashville, will come online in April or May. “It's a replica of our Indiana plant,” Siemer says. At the Indiana facility, he says, “we run full-tilt, 24-7, and we're running millions of pounds a month.”

So where does all that aluminum come from? The scrap aluminum that Sortera receives tends to come from shredded automobiles. Each aluminum grade fractures differently when shredded, and those visual differences help the AI classify the metal. “The chemical differences manifest themselves in the shredding,” Siemer says. Different alloys produce distinctive tears and folds that give the system clues. “You gain these little insights so that in about a 10-millisecond time window, you go, ‘I'm pretty darn sure that's 356 [grade aluminum],” Siemer says.

As Sortera expands, much of its aluminum will likely end up back on automotive assembly lines. Automotive manufacturers have been using increasing amounts of the metal to reduce vehicle weight and improve fuel efficiency. “Every auto OEM on the planet has been to Indiana at least twice,” Siemer says.

Sortera is currently working on ways to process other metals like copper and titanium, but for the near future, the company remains focused on aluminum. “We could instantly sort the 18 billion tons of aluminum made annually in the U.S. Every piece of that, every pound would be sold at a profit in the U.S.”

The price of the rare earth element Yttrium has jumped through the roof, with a kilogram of the material currently sitting at $126 per kilogram. According to Bloomberg, this resource cost less than $8 at the end of 2024, meaning its price has increased by nearly 1, 500% in the past 12 months. This is an all-time high for Yttrium, with the trade war between the U.S. and China fueling the price hikes. This material is crucial for semiconductor manufacturing, where it's used in various processes, including thin-film deposition and wafer polishing.

While there has already been some brewing rivalry between Washington, D.C., and Beijing, it came to a head in April when U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on all of the U.S.'s trading partners. This has led to an escalation between the East and the West, culminating in a 145% tariff on Chinese goods entering the United States and a reciprocal 125% import levy for American products landing on China's shores.

The two parties eventually started trade negotiations, which resulted in the lifting of these threats. It seemed that progress was being made at the negotiating table, but China suddenly put strict export controls on rare-earth materials in early October. This move could gravely impact the global semiconductor supply chain, and Trump responded by threatening a 100% tariff on all Chinese goods and a far more devastating critical software ban. The two parties eventually realized that such a move would not do anyone good, so they agreed to a one-year tariff truce, resulting in China suspending its more recent rare-earth export control measures. However, the April ban on some rare earth exports to the U.S. remains, meaning supply remains tight.

Because of this, Yttrium prices continue to creep higher, even as the U.S. and its allies seek alternative sources. At the moment, more than 90% of the rare earth metals that the U.S. needs are sourced from China, but it's working on expanding its own domestic source from the Mountain Pass project in California. Trump is also considering allocating $2 billion in CHIPS Act funds to the critical minerals supply chain to help bolster its resiliency. Australia is also working on extracting more rare earths from its mining waste, while Canada is looking to open a new rare earths mine in its Critical Mineral Strategy Annual Report 2024.

Brain implant developer Paradromics has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to test its device in an early-stage human trial, the company announced Thursday.

The Austin-based company is aiming to give a digital voice to people who have lost the ability to speak due to severe motor impairment. The trial will assess the long-term safety of the Paradromics device, as well as its ability to enable synthesized speech and text communication.

Paradromics is one of several companies—which include Neuralink, Synchron, Precision Neuroscience, and Cognixion—working on technology to control computers and other devices using brain waves. Known as brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, these systems capture brain signals associated with movement intention and translate them into commands.

The Paradromics study is slated to begin early next year and include two individuals. After collecting data on the first two participants for six months, the company plans to ask the FDA to expand the study to include more volunteers.

“It's reasonable to think that someone will be communicating at 60 words per minute and be able to really sustain the conversation,” says Matt Angle, Paradromics' CEO and founder, referring to a rate achieved by previous BCI trials led by academic groups. Normal speaking speed is between 120 and 150 words per minute.

BCIs for speech restoration do not read a person's inner thoughts. Rather, they decode certain signals from the brain's motor cortex that are generated when a person tries to move their muscles to speak. Users are asked to attempt to say sentences out loud so that the BCI learns how to recognize those brain patterns associated with speaking.

“They will just try to say words, and those words will appear very quickly on a screen. They'll press play, and the words will be read in their own voice,” Angle says. Assuming that there is an existing recording of the participant's voice, Angle says the company plans to generate a voice clone of that person using AI.

Earlier this year, Paradromics briefly implanted its device in a person who was already undergoing brain surgery. Surgeons used an EpiPen-like instrument to insert and remove the implant. In that procedure, the device stayed in the brain for just 10 minutes and wasn't used to restore speech. In the trial slated for next year, the device will be implanted long-term.

Paradromics' implant, called the Connexus, is a metal disk smaller than the size of a dime with 421 microwire electrodes that rest in the brain tissue and record from individual neurons. By comparison, Neuralink's implant is a quarter-sized chip that sits in the skull and has more than 1,000 electrodes across 64 tiny wires that are “threaded” into the brain by a custom-built robot. Neuralink has implanted at least 12 people around the world with its device.

Other BCI companies are taking a less invasive approach by attempting to decode signals from the brain's surface or outside of the brain entirely. The trade-off is a lower signal quality and data transfer rate because these devices sit away from the neurons they're reading.

“Individual neurons are the information carriers in the brain. So the more individual neurons you can record from, the more data you have,” Angle says.

Paradromics' goal is to develop an extremely high-bandwidth BCI—one that can transfer a large amount of neural data between the brain and a computer. A high data rate usually allows for faster performance and a shorter lag time between a user's intent and the system's reaction.

In sheep, the company has achieved a 200-bits-per-second data transfer rate, according to a recent scientific preprint. Neuralink previously claimed a record for BCI cursor control at eight bits per second.

Jacob Robinson, the cofounder and CEO of Motif Neurotech, a BCI company aiming to treat mood disorders, says that the two data points can't exactly be compared side by side. Notably, the sheep implanted with the Paradromics device were not being asked to control a cursor. In those experiments, the sheep were listening to sounds and their implanted BCIs were interpreting them. But he says the Paradromics data hints at an impressive bandwidth.

“In the same way that Neuralink broke the record for bandwidth with their device, I expect Paradromics to break it yet again,” Robinson says. “That's the kind of shift we're seeing, where we had these academic prototypes, and now that we're on an industrial track, we should expect performance improvements in the same way we see iPhones released every few years.”

It's moving from making flying machines to making machines that can make flying machines.

Embattled drone maker DJI has reportedly invested in 3D printer manufacturing, helping diversify its business as it faces challenges in the U.S. According to TechNode, 3D printing brand Elegoo's parent company, Shenzhen Zhinengpai Technology, added DJI as one of its shareholders following an update to its business registration on November 18. It has also reported a capital of CNY 6.44 million, or around US$900,000, which should be a small amount given the company's standing as the world's largest drone maker.

This move can be seen as the company hedging its bets and diversifying its business, especially as it's currently targeted by Washington, D.C. There have been security concerns with DJI drones since 2016, with the authorities growing more concerned in 2017 when Beijing passed its National Intelligence Law, which requires companies to cooperate with state intelligence when asked. By 2020, the company was added to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Entity List, which prohibited it from buying from U.S. firms. Despite that, it was still allowed to sell its drones to the American public.

2024 saw significant action in the U.S. House of Representatives, where a provision that would have banned all DJI sales in the U.S. was dropped at the last moment from the 2025 NDAA. Despite that, the company was given one year to prove that it is not a national security risk. The company received another blow earlier this year when a U.S. court ruled that the Department of Defense could designate it as a “Chinese military company.” Even though the court rejected the DoD's justifications for adding DJI to its list, it still upheld the move, saying that its products have “substantial dual-use applications.” The drone maker is not taking this lying down, though, and it's currently appealing this ruling.

However, the deadline to clear itself is quickly approaching, especially as we only have a few days left until December of this year. So, it seems that its investment in 3D printing is a way for the company to diversify its business and move away from drones. Elegoo has been manufacturing affordable 3D printers, like the Elegoo Centauri Carbon, and it has a massive Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale with a lot of great deals.

Although DJI is unlikely to step away from drone manufacturing, it makes sense for it to invest in 3D printer manufacturing, especially as the industry is burgeoning.

They sent someone out to intercept me at 3 am.  Just drug traffic monitoring.  Once I was cleared by having “just as surprised to see you as you are to see me” conversation, I was on my way.  Two things about being near the border at night: 1) don't ride dirty, 2) you will get pulled over just speed anyway.

If this is in Texas, absolutely. Doing 75 in an 80 is suspicious AF.A few decades ago I did contracting work on Texas military bases; I would always smoke a pre-rolled blunt between the border bases and inland-checkpoints. To the chagrin of drug dogs just looking for people to harass (surprisingly: rarely me).>don't ride dirtyWe were always taught to only break one law at a time.

Oh, please. Half the damn signage in Texas hasn't been updated from 75, and if you weren't a Texas resident to read when the State updated the daytime speed limit to 80 in the newspapers, you wouldn't know that signs notwithstanding, 80 is the speed you should be going in the day. If you're just passing through the state, speed limit signs on parts of the interstate that haven't been updated still tell you 75. If anything it was a masterful move by Texas LE to engineer probable cause to do a traffic stop on anyone who wasn't a local, which would tend to select for non-resident traffickers.I say this as someone who was a resident in the state when that change happened and is disgusted every time I go through and see unupdated signs. It is disingenuous, yet effective, profiling of the worst sort that seems to be ignored by most in favor of thinking like quoted poster's.I seem to be of a minority that believe that a State has an obligation to clearly and consistently communicate the actual state of their traffic management regime to drivers from in and out of state via signage. Not play games to manufacture justification to surveil subpopulations that aren't likely to be represented/incapable of voting.

Given the sheer number of cameras and data sensors mounted everywhere, I guess I kinda assumed this was happening already. I think most of us are well aware that when we are in public, the government can pretty much take our picture our license plate anything. Unfortunately, I don't think there's much we can do about that which has grown under every administration and congress since 9/11.The solvable crime is the pulling someone over without probable cause, which has been used in ridiculous civil forfeiture cases to flat out rob people on the side of the highway.In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged “conducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns” as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.This smacks in the face of the free right to movement across state lines. We are letting the computers tell us what's probable cause, and that must stop.

Aging digital infrastructure equipment like routers, network switches, and network-attached storage—has long posed a silent risk to organizations. In the short term, it's cheaper and easier to just leave those boxes running in a forgotten closet. But this infrastructure may have old, insecure configurations, and legacy tech is often no longer supported by vendors for software patches and other protections. As generative AI platforms make it easier for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities in targets' systems, the network tech company Cisco is launching an effort to raise awareness about the issue and promote improvements—both for ancient Cisco devices and products from other companies that are still in use.

Dubbed “Resilient Infrastructure,” the initiative includes research and industry outreach as well as technical shifts in how Cisco manages its own legacy products. The company says that it is launching new warnings for its products that are approaching end of life, so if customers are running known insecure configurations or attempt to add them, they will receive a clear and explicit prompt when they update a device. Eventually, Cisco will go a step further to completely remove historic settings and interoperability options that are no longer considered safe.

“Infrastructure globally is aging, and that creates a ton of risk,” says Anthony Grieco, Cisco's chief security and trust officer. “The thing we've got to get across is this aging infrastructure wasn't designed for today's threat environments. And by not updating it, it's fostering opportunities for adversaries.”

Research conducted for Cisco by the British advisory firm WPI Strategy looked at the prevalence and impact of end-of-life technology in the “critical national infrastructure” of five countries: the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. The study found that the UK (followed closely by the US) faces the biggest relative risk of the group from widespread use of outmoded, legacy technology in key sectors. Japan had the lowest relative risk—thanks, the report says, to more emphasis on consistent upgrades, decentralization in critical infrastructure, and “a stronger, more consistent national focus on digital resilience.”

In general, the research also emphasizes that breaches and other cybersecurity incidents around the world regularly involve attackers exploiting known vulnerabilities that could be avoided through patching or upgrading end-of-life technology.

“The status quo is not free—there is actually a cost, it's just not being accounted for,” says Eric Wenger, Cisco's senior director for technology policy. “If we can help elevate this risk to something that is treated as a board-level concern, then hopefully that will help to underscore the importance of making an investment here.” As an industry, he adds, “we're not making it hard enough for the attackers.”

Founded in 1984, Cisco has been a titan of network computing for decades, and its devices are deeply embedded in digital infrastructure around the world. To the extent that it may feel self-serving, then, for such a company to champion renewed spending on network equipment, Wenger points out that whether customers will choose to buy Cisco equipment again is a different question from whether they should upgrade at all.

“Look, we don't make money on the stuff that we sold two decades ago. When we convince somebody that they need to move off of the old technology—what we're selling now is innovative, it's cost effective, but we're not going to win everyone over,” he says. “But we need to start the conversation either way."

Cisco's Grieco points out, too, that he and his colleagues have been attempting to highlight the risks posed by end-of-life technology for years. In an August 2016 Cisco blog post, for example, he wrote, “Systems that were designed, built and deployed in decades past didn't anticipate the hostile security environment of today. Until now, very few have thought about securing infrastructure because they didn't think adversaries would target these systems and devices, or they had ‘higher priorities' to fix. This must change.”

While generative AI platforms still can't devise and execute layered digital attacks on their own, evidence is mounting that AI tools are already making it quicker and easier for attackers to launch social engineering attacks, identify and exploit vulnerabilities, and refine malware. For attackers with little technical expertise, this can give them a crucial leg up, and for teams of highly skilled, well-resourced hackers, AI tools are helping to streamline some of the most labor-intensive aspects of attacks.

“It's time to give people a jolt about the silent risk of aging infrastructure,” Grieco says. "We're going to make it loud.”

It has a very weird feeling complaining about build.rs when any semi-serious Zig project comes with a build.zig that's always more complex than any build.rs.

reply

But to address the serious question: We can't have all three of: a simple language, zero-cost abstractions, and memory safety.Most interpreted language pick simplicity and memory safety, at a runtime cost. Rust picks zero-cost abstractions and memory safety, at an increasingly high language complexity cost. C and Zig choose zero-cost abstractions in a simple language, but as a consequence, there's no language-enforced memory safety.(Also, having a simple language doesn't mean that any particular piece of code is short. Often, quite the opposite.)

    pub fn main() !void {
        std.debug.print("Hello, World!\n", .{});
    }

The only difference is this writes to stderr and does not fail (and explicitly says it is meant for debug), while their example writes to stdout. In zig if you want to write to stdout you need to explicitly pick the std and handle all the details (like error handling).He gave the possible worst example, this article is nonsense.

This makes it sound like Zig built Rust equivalent safety but its manual memory model suggests otherwise?

reply

Exactly. That's what Rust defends us from. It makes breaking things way harder. Rust forces you to think differently, you cannot just do what you want, but that's it's selling point. The article focuses mainly on feelings not facts and that's ok, but I don't feel exhausted writing Rust. I like that it's safe and I'm happy to sacrifice some freedom if I get safety in return.That's a weird article. Rust wanted to be safe systems language and it is. Where's the issue? Zig has different goals. That's ok. What are actually discussing here?

I could only see the first few paragraphs, but the writing is giving off a lot of "AI slop" vibes (or perhaps even "human-written slop", let's give the author the benefit of the doubt).  So maybe it's no great loss if it's behind a Medium paywall.

And a second thought since the article seems to be flagged now: considering the fan reaction to a post disparaging their favorite language, how is the Rust community different from a religious cult now?

How so?> considering the fan reaction to a post disparaging their favorite language, how is the Rust community different from a religious cult now?Believe it or not, not all criticism is created equal. High-quality criticism is consistently well-received from what I've seen. This doesn't seem to get particularly close to that bar.

As in: we're using a safe language, it's not our fault.

reply

In addition, there's almost always something more going on than using a particular tool and you're generally still going to be responsible for that other stuff anyways. For example, if you're working on something critical and high-integrity you're responsible for the end product functioning as intended no matter how exactly you go about doing that. Using something like SPARK might be a smart way to go about that, but you still need to have processes before using SPARK (e.g., verifying the specifications you're going to implement are what you intend) and processes after using SPARK (e.g., verifying what you implemented is actually what you intended, that the product is indeed working as expected, etc.). If a bug in SPARK results in something unintended happening, you may not be responsible for the faulty proof itself but that's only one failure out of multiple in the entire pipeline - for example, you can't pin a failure to catch the error in testing on SPARK.

As Blackwell Ultra ramps, Nvidia gets even more money.

Nvidia on Wednesday announced its financial results for the third quarter of its fiscal year 2025, once again beating its own sales records as all its data center GPUs were sold out during the quarter. The company's earnings totaled $57 billion, as sales of all its products — except gaming GPUs — were up. Nvidia does not expect its revenue growth to stop, so it models that its revenue will hit $65 billion in Q4 FY2026, and the company expects sales of its Blackwell and Rubin GPU platforms to hit $0.5 trillion by the end of calendar 2026.

Nvidia's GAAP revenue reached $57.006 billion, up 62% year-over-year and 22% quarter-over-quarter, in the third quarter of the company's fiscal year 2026. The company's net income hit $31.91 billion, a 65% increase compared to Q3 FY2025, while its gross margin totaled 73.4%, up 1% sequentially, but down 1.2% YoY.

 




Nvidia's data center business delivered a rather whopping $51.215 billion revenue in Q3 FY2026, rising 66% year-over-year and 25% sequentially. Within the segment, compute revenue — comprising CPU and GPU sales — reached $43 billion, as the Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra platforms were adopted by all major clients, including cloud hyperscalers, enterprise AI, sovereign AI projects, and industrial. Networking revenue totaled $8.2 billion, up an extraordinary 162% year-over-year, as customers purchased more networking hardware while switching from individual AI servers to rack-scale solutions.

"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out," said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia. "Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We have entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once."

 




Nvidia's gaming segment generated $4.265 billion in the third quarter of the fiscal year, rising 30% YoY but slipping 1% sequentially, which was a surprise. Nvidia said channel inventories normalized ahead of the holiday season, though GPUs are normally strongest in the third quarter, so it looks like other factors were affecting sales of graphics cards. Nonetheless, at $4.265 billion, Nvidia's Q3 of FY2025 is the company's second-best quarter for consumer GPUs ever, suggesting the market has peaked for the company at this time.

While sales of GeForce RTX graphics cards were so strong in Q2 and Q3 that they could no longer grow, sales of professional visualization solutions increased to $760 million, rising 56% year-over-year and 26% sequentially, setting an all-time record for Nvidia and likely the whole industry. The improvement was driven primarily by the launch and ramp of the DGX Spark AI workstation platform and increased demand for Blackwell-based professional GPUs used in CAD, CAM, DCC, and various emerging creative workflows.

Nvidia's Automotive and Robotics revenue reached $592 million in Q3 FY2026, increasing 32% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, which was driven by continued adoption of the company's self-driving platforms. During the quarter, Nvidia announced that its next-generation Drive AGX Hyperion 10 Level 4-capable vehicle platform has been adopted by major partners, including Uber, so expect this segment to become even more important for the company going forward.

The OEM and Other segment recorded $174 million in revenue for the third quarter, up 79% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.

 




Nvidia expects another quarter of strong growth, so it guides revenue to $65 billion ±2% and GAAP gross margin of 74.8%. These results will be primarily driven by continued adoption of Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra platforms by various customers in the West. It is noteworthy that the company said nothing about sales of its AI GPUs to China, perhaps reflecting sentiment that this market has largely been lost for now.

Investigators from the Center for Advanced Gerotherapeutics at Cedars-Sinai found that aged blood vessel cells play a key role in the development of metabolic disorders, including diabetes. The preclinical findings, published in Cell Metabolism, could lead to new treatments for these complex disorders.

Obesity increases the accumulation of senescent cells, aged cells that have stopped dividing but have not died, in several organs and tissues.

Senescent cells differ depending on the originating cell types, diseases and other factors. Some senescent cells help with wound healing, but others cause harm and are known contributors to age-related diseases. Our goal is to identify and target these harmful types of senescent cells while sparing helpful cells."

Masayoshi Suda, MD, PhD, assistant professor of Medicine at Cedars-Sinai and lead author of the study

Previous research by the investigators showed that eliminating senescent cells with drugs called senolytics improved metabolic function, the body's method for turning food and drink into energy.

In the current study, investigators focused on senescent blood vessel cells. They selectively removed these cells from obese laboratory mice and found that the animals' inflammation and fat mass were reduced-and blood sugar levels improved.

When the investigators transplanted senescent blood vessel cells into lean laboratory mice, those mice developed inflammation in fat tissue and metabolic dysfunction.

Suda said this occurred because senescent blood vessel cells release high levels of inflammatory molecules.

The investigators next treated both groups of mice with fisetin, a naturally occurring senolytic compound, and found that the mice had fewer senescent blood vessel cells and improved diabetic symptoms. Investigators saw a similar decline in senescent blood vessel cells when they treated tissue samples from obese human patients with fisetin.

"Preliminary findings like these are crucial to translating aging research into clinical care," said James Kirkland, MD, PhD, director of the Center for Advanced Gerotherapeutics and senior author of the study. "While more research is needed, we aim to eventually treat multiple age-related diseases simultaneously by using fisetin and related senolytics for aging and metabolic health."

Suda said his team will next work to test this approach in clinical trials. 

"If we can target senescent cells safely in humans, it could help address not just diabetes but a range of age-related conditions," he said.

Mayo Clinic researchers have developed a new, personalized approach to deep brain stimulation (DBS) for people with drug-resistant epilepsy. By mapping each patient's unique brain wave patterns, the method allows physicians to target the precise area in the brain where stimulation is most effective, moving beyond the traditional one-size-fits-all approach.

DBS involves implanting electrodes in the brain to deliver electrical pulses that help prevent and control seizures. While effective, DBS is typically administered with electrodes placed in the same brain region across most patients. Mayo Clinic physician-scientists are now tailoring the treatment to an individual's seizure network before DBS placement.

"Our unique approach aims to tailor neuromodulation for each patient," says Nick Gregg, M.D., a Mayo Clinic neurologist and lead author of a paper published in the Annals of Neurology. "We're moving away from one-size-fits-all to an individualized approach that maximizes seizure network engagement to better modulate abnormal brain wave activity."

Once researchers identify the specific area in the thalamus - a small relay hub deep within the brain - that connects to a patient's seizure network, they can fine-tune stimulation settings for that individual. Because seizures occur infrequently, clinicians analyze erratic brain wave patterns that signal abnormal activity.

We're trying to disrupt the pathological hypersynchrony and reduce network excitability to lower seizure risk." 

Dr. Nick Gregg, M.D., Mayo Clinic neurologist

Ten patients received this personalized approach while being evaluated for epilepsy surgery. The next phase of research will follow those who have since received permanent DBS implants using this personalized approach.

"The long-term goal is to quiet the seizure network, so it is eventually forgotten. Reorganizing the neuronal network could move us beyond controlling seizures to actually curing epilepsy," says Dr. Gregg.

This research is part of Mayo Clinic's Bioelectronic Neuromodulation Innovation to Cure (BIONIC) initiative, which unites clinical insight with cutting-edge engineering to deliver novel diagnostics and therapies. Through intellectual property development, strategic partnerships and patient-centered trials, BIONIC transforms innovation into impact - advancing care for complex neurological conditions.

A new study has uncovered promising therapeutic strategies against one of the deadliest forms of prostate cancer.

McGill University researchers at the Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Institute (GCI) identified a mechanism driving neuroendocrine prostate cancer, a rare and highly aggressive subtype for which there currently are no effective treatment options.

Findings published in Genes & Development show that prostate tumors in mice became more aggressive when the protein ERRγ was lost, while restoring its production in human cancer cells reversed this effect.

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in Canada. tumors that stop responding to hormone therapy evolve into neuroendocrine prostate cancer in about 15 per cent of patients, according to past research. After this shift, life expectancy typically falls below 18 months.

Therapy resistance remains one of the biggest challenges in cancer treatment, and prostate cancer is no exception. Our findings highlight ERRγ as a promising new therapeutic target."

Vincent Giguère, Lead Author, Professor, McGill's Department of Biochemistry and GCI researcher

The researchers used advanced genetic and metabolic analysis to understand how losing ERRγ drives tumor growth. Their investigation revealed that two genes linked to cancer become overactive when ERRγ is missing.

As drugs that block these genes already exist for other cancers, the team tested two of them in mouse and human prostate cancer cells. When combined, the two drugs slowed the cancerous growth far more effectively than either drug alone.

"These findings have major clinical implications," said Giguère. "By targeting the genes that take over when ERRγ activity is low or lost, we open the door to new treatment strategies for patients who currently have few options."

Understanding why ERRγ function becomes impaired in the first place is still being investigated, he added.

ERRγ, previously known for its role in energy metabolism, appears to act as a brake that prevents prostate cancer from advancing.

Preclinical findings led by first author Ting Li, a post-doctoral fellow in Giguère's lab, have revealed that neuroendocrine prostate cancers have much lower levels of ERRγ than other types of prostate tumors. Removing the protein in mice sped up tumor progression, while reactivating the protein in human prostate cancer cells reversed the process, confirming its protective effect.

Research published in Contemporary Economic Policy reveals that despite widespread adoption of indoor vaccine mandates in major US cities during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no consistent evidence that these policies significantly increased vaccination rates or reduced COVID-19–related outcomes. The findings contrast with those from other countries, as national mandates abroad boosted vaccine uptake.

For the study, investigators estimated how mandates that restricted access to indoor venues for unvaccinated individuals impacted first-dose uptake, COVID-19 cases, and deaths across 9 US cities through what's called the synthetic difference-in-differences method. The method estimates the effect of a city's indoor vaccine mandate by constructing a "synthetic" control for the city using a weighted average of untreated metropolitan areas that closely matched pre-mandate trends in the outcome of interest.

The scientists found no consistent pattern of statistically significant impacts of the mandates on first-dose vaccine uptake, COVID-19 cases, or deaths across the 9 cities. The results challenge assumptions about the effectiveness of local public health interventions and suggest that local mandates may be less impactful when vaccine coverage is already high, when people can sidestep restrictions by traveling to nearby cities, and when the political environment is highly polarized. The findings could be useful for developing future public health strategies and policies.

We wanted to take a careful, data-driven look at what these policies actually accomplished in the US context. By the time most cities introduced indoor vaccine mandates, vaccination rates were already high, and many unvaccinated individuals were deeply hesitant or resistant, leaving limited room for further gains. Our findings don't suggest that mandates can't work-only that their effectiveness depends on timing, context, and how easily people can sidestep local restrictions."

Planarians are flatworms that have a simple central nervous system (CNS) but an extraordinary ability to regenerate neural tissue. Their CNS is divided into distinct molecular and functional domains defined by specific neural gene expressions 1.

Remarkably, planarians can regenerate functional brains from small body fragments, thanks to pluripotent stem cells known as neoblasts, which can differentiate into various cell types, including neurons. As a result, planarians have become a model organism for studying neural regeneration 2-3.

However, exploring the complex coordination of neural networks in planarian growth and regeneration has always been a challenge, primarily due to the difficulties in capturing high-resolution, three-dimensional images of their central nervous system (CNS) within a practical timeframe.

To overcome these obstacles, researchers from Zhejiang and Westlake University and Tottori University 4 used advanced imaging techniques combining tissue expansion with tiling light-sheet microscopy, enabling nanoscale resolution and significant linear expansion.

Central to this success was Thermo Scientific's Amira Software, which served as the primary environment for image processing and analysis, particularly for segmentation, quantification, and 3D visualization.

By implementing an automated 3D cell segmentation process, researchers mapped neurons and muscle fibers at the single-cell level in over 400 wild-type planarians, both during their normal state and throughout regeneration.

They revealed the complex distribution of neurons across the planarian nervous system, including the brain, ventral nerve cords, optic nerves, and pharyngeal nerve complex. This innovative approach promises to shed new light on the intricate processes underlying planarian biology.

By creating recipes in Amira Software, researchers were able to quantify neurons and nuclei and to collect volumetric parameters such as length and volume.

The recipe solution in Amira Software provides a powerful tool that significantly enhances the efficiency and consistency of image analysis workflows. By allowing users to create, save, and reuse analysis recipes, it ensures that complex image processing tasks can be replicated across different samples with minimal effort.

Using Amira Software capabilities in image analysis and processing, researchers identified differences between a control sample and one where β-catenin, which is crucial for maintaining structural integrity and functional interactions between neurons and muscle fibers, was interfered with (as shown in the figure below).

Specifically, they observed that neural structures have a clear and organized pattern in the control, highlighting the distinct pathways and connections within the sample. In contrast, in β-catenin RNAi planarian, muscle fibers show a more complex and cobweb-like structure, indicating a different or more intricate arrangement of neural connections.

To support open science and reproducibility, the research team released all Amira Software segmentation and quantification recipes via Zenodo.

Lu et al.'s work clearly demonstrates how Amira Software can bridge advanced microscopy and data science, delivering quantitative, reproducible workflows that illuminate how cells, neurons, and tissues organize in three dimensions.

From robust nuclei counting to fiber tracing and 3D rendering, Amira Software enabled the researchers to uncover structural principles of regeneration previously unseen in living systems. This workflow now serves as a model for future imaging studies seeking reproducibility, scalability, and cross-modality integration.

A new synthesis of randomized trials reveals that a carefully supervised very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet can improve weight, insulin control, and androgen levels in women with PCOS, offering short-term clinical gains while underscoring the need for longer-term safety data.

In a recent study published in the British Journal of Nutrition, a group of researchers synthesized randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on the effects of the very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), covering anthropometric, hormonal, and metabolic outcomes.

One in ten women of reproductive age lives with PCOS, a condition tightly linked to insulin resistance (IR), weight gain, and low-grade inflammation, which are factors that ripple into everyday life through irregular cycles, fertility worries, and cardiometabolic risk. Small, strategic weight loss can normalize periods and improve chances of conception, yet many diets feel impractical for busy households. VLCKD induces nutritional ketosis and may lower insulin levels, reduce visceral fat, and rebalance androgen levels, offering a potentially practical, food-based approach. However, because VLCKD trials are short, highly variable, and often restrictive, long-term safety, adherence, and comparative effectiveness versus other eating patterns remain uncertain, and hence further research is needed.

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance and a protocol registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), investigators searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) via PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, and Web of Science for RCTs through July 2025. Eligible participants were adult women with PCOS assigned to a VLCKD.

Outcomes included anthropometric measures such as weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), fat body mass (FBM), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR); hormonal markers such as sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), free and total testosterone, and the LH/FSH ratio; and metabolic endpoints such as fasting glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and total cholesterol.

Data were extracted in duplicate with disagreements resolved by a reviewer. Meta-analyses used weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs). Random-effects models, Hartung-Knapp adjustments, Cochran's Q, and I² quantified uncertainty and heterogeneity, and funnel plots screened publication bias. Certainty of evidence was graded using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).

Across the evidence base, 12 trials were included qualitatively and 11 in meta-analyses, enrolling more than 800 women with PCOS from Italy, China, Pakistan, and the United States, and using parallel and crossover designs over approximately 4 to 24 weeks. Diet protocols ranged from VLCKD (~750–800 kcal/day) to energy-restricted VLCKD (~1300–1500 kcal/day), consistently restricting carbohydrates sufficiently to induce ketosis while providing adequate protein. Several outcomes exhibited very high statistical heterogeneity, reflecting differences in caloric levels, carbohydrate thresholds, lipid composition, adherence monitoring, and concurrent treatments.

Anthropometry showed clinically meaningful improvements that map to real-life wins, such as looser waistbands, better sleep, and easier movement. Body weight fell substantially (WMD −9.57 kg), alongside reductions in WC (WMD −7.75 cm) and FBM (WMD −7.44 kg). BMI decreased (WMD −3.45 kg/m²), and WHR modestly improved (WMD −0.02). Sensitivity analyses supported the direction of these effects, despite I² values often exceeding 90%, and there was no consistent sign of publication bias in the funnel plots.

Hormonal profiles moved in a direction consistent with reduced hyperandrogenism and improved ovulatory potential, outcomes that matter to women tracking cycles at home or planning pregnancy. Free testosterone decreased (WMD −0.31 ng/dL) and total testosterone decreased (WMD −7.21 ng/dL), while SHBG increased (WMD +15.22 nmol/L). LH fell (WMD −3.97 U/L), the LH/FSH ratio declined (WMD −1.04), and FSH showed no significant change, an overall pattern compatible with easing androgen excess and better follicular dynamics.

Glucose-insulin outcomes echoed the anthropometric and hormonal shifts. Fasting glucose dropped (WMD −9.65 mg/dL), fasting insulin declined (WMD −2.41), and HOMA-IR improved (WMD −2.46). These shifts translate to fewer “sugar crashes,” steadier energy, and potentially lower long-term risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In lipid outcomes, triglycerides were reduced (WMD −29.95 mg/dL), whereas total cholesterol, LDL-c, and HDL-c showed no significant pooled changes during the short-to-intermediate follow-up.

Risk-of-bias assessments rated most domains low or with some concerns, but three trials were explicitly judged to have high risk of bias due to non-true randomization or missing outcome data. Importantly, the certainty of evidence by GRADE was generally moderate across key outcomes, reflecting both consistent directionality and substantial heterogeneity, variability in dietary protocols, and limitations in adherence reporting. While adverse effects were not the primary focus of the pooled analyses, reported issues in the broader ketogenic literature, such as transient gastrointestinal discomfort, nutrient gaps without supplementation, and lipid shifts, underscore the need for clinical supervision, a staged reintroduction of carbohydrates, and attention to overall dietary quality. Additionally, none of the included trials stratified results by PCOS phenotype, which may limit interpretability because phenotypes differ markedly in hyperandrogenism, metabolic risk, and potential dietary responsiveness.

Across RCTs, the VLCKD meaningfully improves weight, WC, FBM, BMI, and selected reproductive hormones in women with PCOS, while enhancing glucose-insulin control and lowering triglycerides. These changes support practical, near-term benefits such as more regular cycles, greater comfort, and potentially improved fertility when VLCKD is professionally supervised. However, most trials are short, heterogeneous, and not designed to test long-term safety, lipid trajectories, phenotype-specific responses, or real-world adherence.

Future work should compare VLCKD with other evidence-based patterns over longer periods, track phenotypes, and integrate behavioral support to sustain gains. More consistent protocol standardization and improved adverse-event reporting would further strengthen the evidence base.

New research shows that declining rainfall heightens encounters between people and wildlife, especially carnivores, revealing how drought reshapes ecological and human behaviour across California.

In a recent study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers examined the influence of drought on human-wildlife conflict. Interactions between humans and wildlife have become more prevalent, representing a fundamental challenge for conservation programs. As antagonistic human-wildlife interactions persist, a deeper understanding of how climate change affects resource availability and human-wildlife conflict dynamics is crucial for characterizing future changes in socioecological systems.

Drought is a common manifestation of climate change that strains both wildlife and human populations. While drought may limit resource availability for wildlife in wildlands, human infrastructure often buffers its effects, attracting wildlife to anthropogenic subsidies. As such, opportunities for human-wildlife conflict can intensify due to increased overlap and competition for shared resources. However, the precise behavioral and ecological mechanisms linking drought to increased conflict remain uncertain, and the study emphasizes that these associations do not establish causation because they reflect correlations rather than demonstrated behavioral shifts.

In the present study, researchers investigated the effects of drought on human-wildlife conflict. They leveraged the Wildlife Incident Reporting (WIR) database of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which comprises human-wildlife incident reports from 2017 to 2023. Reported incidents encompass a wide range of interactions within four main categories: depredation, general nuisance, potential human conflict, and sightings.

“Climate change will increase human-wildlife interactions, and as droughts and wildfires become more extreme, we have to plan ways to coexist with wildlife,” said lead author Kendall Calhoun, a member of Justine Smith's lab at UC Davis and of UCLA's Tingley lab on ecology and conservation. “Animals coming into human spaces are generally framed as wildlife trying to take resources from humans, but it's often because we've taken the resources away from the wild areas.”

The team primarily focused on two categories most likely associated with negative interactions, general nuisance, and depredation. The state of California was divided into 50 km by 50 km grid cells for analysis, and reported conflicts within each cell and month were compared with environmental covariates. Environmental covariates included seasonality (month), precipitation, human population density, median household income, and habitat structure (tree cover).

A hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework was adopted to investigate how changes in precipitation and other covariates affect incident frequency. In one model, incident reports for all species were treated agnostically and modeled together. Further, a separate set of diet-specific models was developed to explore whether these effects varied by species and diet guilds, where species were modeled under a shared diet-group hyperparameter.

The influence of each environmental covariate on the frequency of conflict reporting across the four categories was also compared. In addition, three models investigated species-specific responses and the impact of diet on trends in reported conflicts, one for each diet group: carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores. In these species analyses, reports of species with more than 40 reported conflicts were included. The authors also noted that reporting patterns are partly shaped by human behavior and perceptions, which may influence how often conflicts are reported rather than how frequently they actually occur, because shifts in human activity, visibility, and willingness to report can contribute to observed trends.

The WIR database comprised 31,904 incident reports in California between 2017 and 2023. Most reports (57.2%) were related to depredation. The researchers found a significant increase in the number of wildlife conflicts associated with reductions in precipitation. Every 25 mm decrease in annual precipitation increased the frequency of reported incidents by 2.11%.

Further, higher tree cover, higher human population density, and higher median household income, as well as areas with both higher human population density and tree cover, were associated with increased conflict reporting. Independently, depredation, general nuisance, and potential human conflict were negatively associated with precipitation. Notably, reported incidents showed the highest increase with decreased precipitation for carnivores.

Importantly, decreased precipitation was a strong predictor of conflict reporting for carnivores, but not for herbivores or omnivores at the diet-guild level, clarifying that the earlier effects for carnivores remained robust at the species level rather than the guild-level aggregate. Species-specific analyses revealed significant increases in reported conflicts, accompanied by reduced precipitation, for three carnivores (mountain lions, bobcats, and coyotes) and one omnivore (American black bears). This distinction highlights that drought sensitivity is strongest for particular species rather than all members of a diet group.

The number of conflicts increased for every 25 mm reduction in precipitation by 2.97 percent for bobcats, 2.56 percent for American black bears, 2.21 percent for coyotes, and 2.11 percent for mountain lions. Finally, the team investigated whether the frequency of conflict reporting varied with intra-annual drought periods and found that trends in reported incidents sharply increased during the driest and warmest months of the year (May to October) for eight species. These seasonal increases occurred independently of year-to-year precipitation trends, reflecting both ecological and human behavioral patterns, such as greater outdoor activity and higher wildlife detectability during summer months, as well as reduced water availability during peak drought periods.

Taken together, the results underscore that climate change may have significant ramifications for the future of conservation and human-wildlife conflict. The finding that lower precipitation is associated with conflict warrants investigations into how exactly drought affects space use and behavior for human and wildlife communities. The results also showed that carnivores experienced nearly three times the effect of drought as herbivores.

Further, season was a robust determinant of conflict reporting, and this effect is likely replicable in regions where intra-annual water availability influences human-wildlife interactions. While the impact of ongoing droughts may perturb animal behavior year-round, their effects are likely to be most pronounced when precipitation is at its seasonal low. The study also emphasizes that reporting patterns may be influenced by socioeconomic factors, cultural norms, and willingness to report conflicts, suggesting that the observed increases may reflect both ecological responses and human behavioral changes during drought conditions, including shifts in recreation timing, resource use, and opportunities for human-wildlife encounters. Overall, the study provides crucial empirical evidence on the amplification of human-wildlife conflict by climate change.

“I look at ways to improve human-wildlife interactions, and climate change is going to make that path more difficult,” Calhoun said. “But if we can make it worse, then we can make it better. People just need to be invested in their local environment to make conservation work.”

A global panel of scientists and community leaders shows how biology, lifestyle, and culture can work together to help people live longer, healthier, and more purposeful lives.



The illustration conceptualizes how fostering bonds and communication, plant-based communal dining rich in dietary fiber, daily routines with physical activity, and living with gratitude and “Ikigai” collectively support the vision of healthy longevity. 

The first global summit on longevity was recently held in Japan, where experts discussed advances in research, lifestyle interventions, and community-based strategies. The meeting report has been published in the journal npj Aging.

A joint declaration was an outcome of the conference, highlighting four critical components for healthy aging. These included maintaining meaningful social bonds, having a sense of gratitude, being physically active, and following a healthy diet centered on plant-based protein and dietary fiber.

The world is aging at an unprecedented pace, with rising life expectancy and falling fertility reshaping countries' demographic structures across all income levels. While people today live longer than previous generations, many spend their later years managing illness or disability.

The challenge of ensuring that added years are lived with independence and well-being framed the first World Longevity Summit, held in Kyotango, Japan. Japan, where nearly one in three citizens is aged 65 or older, embodies the pressures and possibilities of aging societies.

Within the country, the Kyotango region stands out for its unusually high concentration of centenarians, a phenomenon attributed to strong social ties, plant-forward diets with dietary fiber, daily activity, and cultural continuity.

With these regional strengths as a backdrop, the summit convened researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and community leaders to explore cutting-edge science and practical models for healthy aging. Twenty-eight presentations covered fields ranging from molecular geroscience to public health and community initiatives.

A central theme of the summit was deciphering the biological mechanisms that shape aging. Steve Horvath introduced epigenetic clocks used to estimate biological age and showed how these tools capture organ-specific aging, familial longevity, and environmental influences.

These models show that centenarians' families tend to have slower epigenetic aging. Organs such as the cerebellum and retina age more slowly than tissues like blood or bone. Lifestyle factors produce very modest shifts in biological age, though certain interventions, such as omega-3 supplementation, show small but measurable benefits. Conversely, obesity was highlighted as accelerating liver-specific epigenetic aging. Horvath also noted examples such as the Hispanic paradox and the Tsimane people, whose biological age appears unexpectedly low relative to health risk factors.

Complementing this perspective, Tamotsu Yoshimori highlighted autophagy as a core mechanism of cellular maintenance. He outlined how autophagosomes recycle damaged components, maintaining energy balance and proteostasis.

Suppressing the protein Rubicon, an age-associated inhibitor of autophagy, can extend lifespan and improve neurological function in model systems. Early exploratory interventions, such as fermented tea extracts and lifestyle programs designed to stimulate autophagy, point to possible translational pathways but require rigorous evaluation. Rubicon's role in promoting exosome-mediated spread of senescence signals was also noted as an emerging mechanistic insight. Yoshimori's work has also led to the establishment of a research-oriented company and the Japan Autophagy Consortium, illustrating early efforts to translate autophagy science into public-facing initiatives.

Francis Chan shifted focus to the gut microbiome as a driver of systemic aging. He showed that microbial diversity, metabolite production, and gut barrier integrity decline with age, contributing to inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and cognitive changes. Intriguingly, centenarians exhibit not a young microbiome, but a distinct one characterized by fewer dominant species and greater representation of minor beneficial taxa.

Early-life microbial disruptions can shape long-term health. Recent clinical trials using synbiotics showed promise for improving fatigue and cognitive symptoms in long coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), illustrating how microbiome-targeted interventions may support neurological and systemic health. Chan also described four categories of microbiome-based aging biomarkers: diversity, taxonomic composition, metabolite profile, and functional output.

A second major focus of the summit was designing social systems that enable older adults to thrive. Tomoo Matsuda advocated for the idea of a “Platinum Society.” Such a community views aging not as societal decline but as an opportunity to empower older adults as contributors.

Community-based models such as Exadon, a program combining exercise and taiko drumming, or multi-use centers that facilitate intergenerational engagement, were presented as effective ways to maintain social connection, daily activity, and purpose. However, the summit emphasized that evidence for these initiatives is often observational, and formal evaluation remains limited. Matsuda also proposed policy innovations such as care credits and “second compulsory education” for seniors.

Stefania Bandini expanded the discussion to rural aging, emphasizing that vast regions in Italy, known as “inner areas,” and Japan face population decline, loss of traditional knowledge, and limited access to services. She illustrated how digital tools can identify vulnerabilities such as poor walkability, inadequate access to health facilities, and insufficient caregiving networks. Integrating such technologies with local cultural practices, she argued, is essential for building age-friendly environments that align innovation with human dignity and community needs.

The summit produced four clear principles for healthy longevity: prioritize social connection, share meals centered on plant-based protein and dietary fiber, sustain regular routines and physical activity, and foster gratitude alongside a strong sense of purpose (Ikigai). The declaration affirmed that achieving healthy aging requires a science-based, culturally sensitive, and collective approach.

In synthesizing four days of presentations, the summit underscored that extending healthy life expectancy requires action at multiple levels, namely molecular research, clinical translation, early-life interventions, community design, and policymaking.

In conclusion, the World Longevity Summit emphasized that embracing aging as an opportunity, fostering global partnerships, and integrating science with cultural values are crucial steps toward enabling people worldwide to enjoy longer, healthier, and more meaningful lives.

People with type 1 diabetes (previously called juvenile diabetes) are 4.29 times more likely to develop bladder cancer, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis by researchers at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. The new analysis is the first to control for the effects of tobacco smoking, a factor that likely obscured the heightened risk in earlier studies. The results were just published in the journal Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice.

Bladder cancer is a relatively common disease, affecting about 2% of the U.S. population. Cigarette smoking accounts for about half of all bladder cancer in the United States and Europe, but causes of the remaining half are poorly understood. Recent data suggest that type 2 diabetes may play a role, but years of epidemiological studies found no link between type 1 diabetes and bladder cancer.

Now, a new analysis reveals why a possible link may have been missed. Because smoking is a strong contributor to bladder cancer, research designed to identify other risk factors must control for-or separate out-the influences of smoking from influences of other proposed causes. But no prior studies on type 1 diabetes and cancer had done so.

Of nine original studies and one meta-analysis published before ours, none had adequately controlled for smoking. When we evaluated the vulnerabilities of these studies and addressed them, we found a very clear pattern indicating substantially elevated risk for bladder cancer in people with type 1 diabetes."

Victoria K. Cortessis, PhD, clinical professor of population and public health sciences, Keck School of Medicine and study's senior author

The new findings provide important clues about causes of bladder cancer and may help guide decision making by patients with type 1 diabetes and their providers. For example, avoiding or quitting smoking may be especially important for this group, Cortessis said.

For years, studies that tracked people with type 1 diabetes found no increased risk of bladder cancer-and a closer look reveals why. Most datasets on type 1 diabetes began as studies that followed patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes over time. The initial goal was to learn how the condition impacted patients by tracking events like hospitalizations and early complications. Data on smoking, however, were either not collected or asked about once and not updated.

Years later, researchers used those same datasets to ask a different question: Does type 1 diabetes raise the risk of other diseases, such as bladder cancer, in adulthood? To find out, they compared disease rates among people with type 1 diabetes to rates in the general population. Those analyses found no increased risk for bladder cancer.

The problem with this method: Smoking is a major contributor to bladder cancer. Without accurate data on smoking in the diabetes group or the general population, it was impossible to know how much risk of bladder cancer was linked to smoking versus type 1 diabetes itself.

The Keck School of Medicine team suspected that people with type 1 diabetes may smoke less than the general population. After managing a serious health condition starting early in life, these individuals may have been more health conscious as adolescents and adults. If true, lower smoking rates could skew the comparisons and mask any increased bladder cancer risk tied to diabetes itself.

To investigate that idea, first author Helena Oskoui Bennett, MPH, a student at the Keck School when the research was conducted, gathered data from authoritative sources such as the World Health Organization to estimate smoking prevalence in populations where the original studies were conducted. The patterns the team found using a technique called meta-regression supported the team's hypothesis, helping explain why earlier analyses failed to detect a connection. After accounting for patterns of smoking, they estimated that people with type 1 diabetes were 4.29 times more likely to get bladder cancer.

The reason for the link between type 1 diabetes and bladder cancer is not yet clear, but researchers suspect the disease may trigger biological changes that contribute to the cancer's development. For that reason, careful management of diabetes-including maintaining healthy blood sugar levels-could be key for reducing bladder cancer risk. Those biological changes may also interact with the effects of smoking to further raise risk.

"More work is needed to understand the mechanisms at play, but it's possible that there is a biological synergy between diabetes and smoking that increases risk more than either factor alone," Cortessis said.

The study emerged from the team's larger analysis of type 2 diabetes, another condition linked to bladder cancer. They are now reviewing nearly 100 studies on type 2 diabetes and its treatments to pinpoint what drives the increased risk.

In addition to Cortessis and Bennett, the study's other authors are David Bogumil and Kimberly D. Siegmund from the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine of USC, University of Southern California; Richard M. Watanabe from the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, the Department of Physiology & Neuroscience, and the Diabetes and Obesity Research Center, Keck School of Medicine of USC, University of Southern California; Lynn Kysh from the University of California at Davis; and Piet van den Brandt from Maastricht University Medical Center, Netherlands.

Around two-thirds of pregnancies have weight gain that is more or less than recommended and is associated with complications such as preterm birth, large birth weight, and admission to intensive care.

The findings are part of a Monash University-led systematic review of data from 1.6 million women, published by The BMJ.

Gaining too much or too little weight during pregnancy, known as gestational weight gain or GWG, represents combined growth of mother and baby, and is associated with increased risks to both mother and child.

Each year 130 million births occur globally in total, in the context of increasingly unhealthy and processed food supply and environmental drivers, causing an epidemic of excess GWG.

First author Dr. Rebecca Goldstein, from the Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation (MCHRI), said the study's results underlined the need for international action.

"These findings reinforce the need for international reference standards for healthy GWG alongside lifestyle support and public health measures to improve outcomes for mothers and babies worldwide," Dr Goldstein said.

Most countries rely on Institute of Medicine GWG guidelines*, but these are based on data from predominantly Caucasian women in high income countries in the 1980s, so they don't reflect ethnically diverse populations across low, middle and high-income settings, or changes in food supply and environment that are driving global trends such as rising weight (BMI).

In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched an initiative to develop global healthy GWG standards aimed at defining optimal GWG recommendations across diverse settings.

To support this initiative, Monash University researchers and collaborators from the WHO analyzed data from 40 observational studies involving 1.6 million women aged 18 and over from five of the six WHO defined world regions that reported pregnancy outcomes according to BMI and GWG from 2009 to 2024. Of these 40 studies, 36 were considered to be high quality.

Around half (53 per cent) of study participants had a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI, with others classified as below (6 per cent), above (19 per cent), or well above healthy weight (obese) (22 per cent). Only a third (32 per cent) had GWG within recommended ranges, with 23 per cent gaining below and 45 per cent gaining above recommended.

Based on WHO BMI criteria, the research study found that GWG below the recommended range was associated with: lower risk of caesarean delivery; a large for gestational age infant; and high birth weight (macrosomia) but higher risk of preterm birth; a small for gestational age infant; low birth weight; and respiratory distress.

Conversely, GWG above the recommended range was associated with: a higher birth weight and a higher risk of caesarean delivery; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; a large for gestational age infant (macrosomia), and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit; and a lower risk of preterm birth and a small for gestational age infant.

Similar patterns were apparent when Asian BMI categories were used in studies conducted in this world region.

The researchers point to some limitations, such as variations in BMI and GWG classifications, and note that few studies from low income countries met their inclusion criteria, limiting diversity. Nor can they rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors, such as smoking status, age and ethnicity, may have influenced their results.

However, Senior author Professor Helena Teede, who is Director of the Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, and an Endocrinologist at Monash Health, said the study supported the need for a global approach.

Our findings inform and support the need for optimised, evidence-based WHO international GWG reference standards based on individual patient data, applicable to contemporary and diverse global populations. This work builds on and improves current recommendations and highlights the need for multi-level support to improve the health of mothers and babies worldwide.

Whilst this work supports guidance on healthy GWG, it will need to be incorporated into individualised care to meet the needs of those in pregnancy, limiting stigma and optimizing healthy outcomes for women and the next generation. Ultimately, the burden of health impacts shown here mandate action to support women across policy, healthcare and individual level solutions for the health of mothers and babies."

Researchers at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) revealed important genetic components that affect bone density in children and adolescents. This information could help identify pediatric patients who may benefit from strategies to help improve their bone health at an early age, helping them maintain healthy bones and prevent fractures in adulthood.

Many children experience fractures due to accidents and recover quickly, but there are many reasons why children may have weak bones or be at risk for developing fragile bones. Chronic health conditions, dietary restrictions and steroid use all impact bone mineral metabolism. Genetics plays an additional role, and while most studies have been conducted on adults for whom a fracture could be life-threatening, the role that genetics plays in affecting bone mineral density during childhood has historically been much less understood. Two recent studies from researchers at CHOP explored the importance of genetic and genomic information when it comes to understanding pediatric bone development.

The first study, published in the journal Genome Biology, looked at genetic signals associated with bone mineral density that had been previously identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) across adults and children. Prior studies had not been able to identify a causal gene linked to those signals.

Understanding the causal gene was related to the dynamic between osteoblasts, which form new bone tissue, and osteoclasts, which break down old bone tissue. When children are growing, osteoblasts are far more active to help achieve proper bone growth.

The researchers used CRISPRi – which helps silence gene expression without cutting the DNA like CRISPR-based therapies – and identified four genes (ARID5B, CC2D1B, EIF4G2, and NCOA3) that are linked to osteoblasts and their ability to mature. Additionally, the researchers found that many genetic signals associated with bone mineral density also exhibit their effects on other tissues, indicating that bone density might signify other potential health issues.

"With this information, our hope is to further study these signals specifically in pediatrics and help identify which children are more likely to get a fracture to optimize their bone health for life," said senior study author Struan F.A. Grant, PhD, Director of the Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics and the Daniel B. Burke Endowed Chair for Diabetes Research at CHOP.

The second study, published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, used a polygenic risk score called genetic quantitative ultrasound speed of sound (gSOS). gSOS had been previously used to study the risk of fracture in adults, and CHOP researchers sought to determine whether it was associated with bone health in children. This study utilized two observational studies and associated genetic data, the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) as well as data from CHOP's Center for Applied Genomics spanning more than two decades.

The study found that a higher gSOS score was associated with higher bone mineral density at multiple skeletal sites and reduced odds of fracture across both observational studies. This is particularly important since the researchers' investigation accounted for a wide range of factors, including sex, puberty stage, levels of calcium in the diet, height, weight and BMI, as well as accidents that could have resulted in fractures.

Our study found that genetics represent a powerful component of bone density across the entire lifespan. We were very surprised to see that the polygenic risk score could accurately predict which patients were more likely to experience a fracture, even accounting for the normal childhood activities we most closely associate with broken bones."

Babette S. Zemel, PhD, Senior Study Author, Professor of Pediatrics at CHOP

Both methods could potentially be utilized to enhance bone health earlier in life. While a good diet and regular weight bearing physical activity, particularly sports like volleyball and basketball, are important for bone health, Zemel said, these remain particularly helpful for improving bone health even if genetic risk of fracture is high.

The first study was supported by the University of Colorado Gates Grubstake Award, the National Science Foundation grants DMS 2113072 and DMS 2310654, National Institutes of Health grants R01AI154773, R01DK122586, UL1 TR001878, R01 HD100406, R01 AG072705, and UM1 DK126194, the Henry Ruppenthal Family Professorship for Bioengineering and Orthopaedic Surgery and the Daniel B. Burke Endowed Chair for Diabetes Research.

The second study was supported by the National Institutes of Health grants R01HD100406, R01HD58886 and UL1TR000077, and the Daniel B. Burke Endowed Chair for Diabetes Research. The Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) was also supported by Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development contracts N01-HD-1-3228, -3329, -3330, -3331, -3332, -3333.

A landmark multi-country clinical trial has shown that a structured, sustainable approach to infection prevention and treatment can save women's lives, cutting severe maternal infections and deaths by about one-third (32%) compared to usual care. The maternal program of prevention and treatment (APT-Sepsis) was developed by researchers at the University of Liverpool, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN's Special Programme in Human Reproduction (HRP).Maternal infection and sepsis remain among the leading causes of maternal death worldwide. Every 30 minutes a mother dies from a sepsis-related cause somewhere in the world, with the greatest burden borne by women in low and income countries. The Active Prevention and Treatment of Maternal Sepsis (APT-Sepsis) intervention tackles this challenge through an integrated program focused on three areas: improving hand hygiene, strengthening infection prevention and management, and enhancing sepsis care with the FAST-M sepsis bundle.The trial, conducted across 59 hospitals in Malawi and Uganda and involving more than 430,000 women, assessed whether structured improvements in infection prevention, early recognition, and timely treatment of maternal sepsis could save lives. Findings from the trial show that even within a very resource-limited environment this innovative approach made it possible to support healthcare workers to improve maternal outcomes and can be sustained in resource-limited health systems.

The study report revealed that the APT-Sepsis intervention not only reduced the incidence of maternal infection-related mortality or severe morbidity by 32%, but that the program was equally effective in both Uganda and Malawi. The effectiveness was sustained over time, increasing steadily from the first month of the intervention to the final month, when a 47% reduction was achieved.The program supported healthcare providers to:

Professor David Lissauer, NIHR Professor of Global Maternal and Fetal Health at the University of Liverpool, said: "These results are hugely significant. For too long, maternal sepsis has been a leading but neglected cause of preventable maternal deaths worldwide. Our findings demonstrate that APT-Sepsis provides a practical, sustainable, and effective solution. With a 32% reduction in infection-related maternal deaths and life-threatening complications, this program has the potential to transform care. Policymakers now have compelling evidence to scale up these interventions so that fewer women die from preventable infections during pregnancy and childbirth."Jeremy Farrar, Assistant Director-General, WHO, said: "The APT-Sepsis programme is a testament to what can be achieved when science, policy and frontline care come together. Reducing maternal infections and deaths by over 30% is not just a clinical success - it's a call to action for global health systems to prioritize infection prevention in maternal care. We must ensure these life-saving practices are scaled and sustained across all settings." 

Fungaro Lydia, Midwife and APT Champion at Arua Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda said: "I want to thank APT-Sepsis for coming to our rescue. Previously, we had no reliable way of monitoring mothers. We used to do things in our own way, but now, with the intervention, we can detect danger early."

Henry Mwandumba, Programme Director at the Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Research Programme, MLW, said: "We are immensely proud that MLW contributed to a project that has delivered such a significant reduction in maternal infections and deaths. This is a testament to our commitment to improving the health and wellbeing of women in Malawi and reflects the dedication of our team and partners, and look forward to seeing how this intervention pioneered in Malawi can be scaled-up to help mothers worldwide"

The trial demonstrates that structured, system-level interventions can overcome long-standing barriers such as inconsistent adherence to infection-prevention practices and delays in the recognition and treatment of sepsis.

By embedding improved practices within existing health systems - and without relying on costly additional resources - APT-Sepsis is designed to offer a low-cost, sustainable and rapidly scalable model for national and international health programmes seeking to improve maternal survival globally.

The trial was managed by the Department of Women's and Childrens Health and the Liverpool Clinical Trials Centre at the University of Liverpool and the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome

Research Programme, Malawi and Infectious Diseases Institute, Makereke University, Uganda.

This work was funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), UK AID, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and MSD for Mothers through the Joint Global Health Trials Scheme.

The work of Professor David Lissauer and Professor Catriona Waitt (University of Liverpool and the Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere University) is supported by NIHR Global Health Research Professorships.

Columbia University researchers are the first to show that focused ultrasound - a non-invasive technique that uses sound waves to enhance the delivery of drugs into the brain - can be safely used in children being treated for brain cancer. 

The focused ultrasound technique, developed by Columbia engineers, was tested in combination with chemotherapy in three children with diffuse midline glioma, a rare and aggressive brain cancer that is universally fatal. 

The study found that focused ultrasound successfully opened the blood-brain barrier in all three patients, allowing the chemotherapy drug to reach the tumors and leading to some improvement in patient mobility. (All three patients eventually died from their disease or complications of COVID.

"Now that we've established the safety and feasibility of focused ultrasound in children, we've opened the door for more trials to try the technique earlier in the course of the disease and with lower systemic but higher brain doses. Our hope is that the technology will improve survival for children with brain cancer," says study leader Stergios Zacharoulis, associate professor of pediatrics at Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and a pediatric oncologist at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of Children's Hospital of New York. 

Columbia has already launched a follow-up trial using focused ultrasound with etoposide, an FDA-approved chemotherapy drug that has shown activity against brain cancer cells. 

Though new therapies are transforming the lives of patients with aggressive tumors such as pancreatic cancer and melanoma, the prognosis for brain cancer has remained stubbornly unchanged for decades. Survival for children with midline glioma, which begins deep within the brainstem, is usually less than one year after diagnosis. 

A major impediment to improving survival for brain cancer patients is physical: The blood-brain barrier, which protects the brain from viruses, bacteria, and toxins in the bloodstream, also prevents almost all chemotherapies from reaching brain tumors in sufficient concentration. In the lab, Elisa Konofagou, a professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia, has consistently shown that the barrier can be relaxed safely to allow drugs to permeate the brain and then reinstated. 

Many cancer drugs are capable of killing brain cancer cells, suggesting that techniques that permit more drug molecules to pass through the barrier and target the tumor cells have the potential to transform treatment. 

Focused ultrasound opens the blood brain barrier by using sound waves to vibrate tiny lipid-coated gas bubbles within the barrier. As the vibrating bubbles expand and contract, they pry open pathways in the barrier that drugs can pass through. 

Most focused ultrasound techniques require the use of MRI machines to guide the sound waves to specific locations in the brain. 

"MRIs can be stressful experiences for some of us, but especially for children who find it really difficult to stay still in the machine during the procedure," says Konofagou, who developed the technique. "At Columbia, our innovation was to move the focused ultrasound treatment outside of the MRI machine and perform the treatment in a friendly environment for the child with their family in the room during the procedure." 

With the Columbia-designed device, MRI images for navigation planning are obtained before the focused ultrasound treatment with a hand-guided device. 

Patients can rest their heads on a massage table and play on a tablet or read a book during treatment, and the procedure is entirely noninvasive and painless and only lasts for a few minutes."

The health impacts of eating disorders, such as anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating, are not only complex, affecting many different organ systems, but long-lasting, finds a large tracking study, published in the open access journal BMJ Medicine.

The risks of serious conditions, such as diabetes, renal and liver failure, fractures, and premature death, are particularly high within the first 12 months of diagnosis. But these heightened risks persist for years, highlighting the need for timely integrated multidisciplinary health services and continued monitoring to improve outcomes, conclude the researchers.

UK rates of eating disorders have risen significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, note the researchers. But while the detrimental mental and physical consequences are well known, the long term effects are less well understood, they add.

To strengthen the evidence base, the researchers scrutinised anonymised medical records in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to Hospital Episode Statistics and death certification data for people across England over a 20 year period (1998 to 2018 inclusive).

Some 24,709 people, aged 10-44, with a diagnosed eating disorder, were matched for age, sex, and GP practice with up to 20 others without these disorders (493,001 in total), and their mental and physical health tracked for 10 years.

Most (89%) of the entire sample was female. And among those with eating disorders, 14.5% (3577) had anorexia; 20.5% (5085) had bulimia; 5% (1215) had a binge eating disorder; and in 60% (14,832), the eating disorder was unspecified.

Analysis of the data revealed that eating disorders were associated with substantially higher risks of poor physical and mental health, and premature death.

Within the first year of diagnosis, people with eating disorders were 6 times more likely to be diagnosed with renal failure and nearly 7 times more likely to be diagnosed with liver disease, as well as being at significantly heightened risks of osteoporosis (6 times as high), heart failure (twice as high), and diabetes (3 times as high).

The risks of renal failure and liver disease were still 2.5 to nearly 4 times higher after 5 years, with 110 and 26 more cases than would be expected, respectively, per 10,000 people at 10 years.

Similarly, the risks of poor mental health were significantly higher 12 months after an eating disorder diagnosis: the risks of depression were 7 times higher, with 596 additional cases per 10,000 people, while those of self-harm were more than 9 times as high, with an additional 309 cases/10,000. And although they were lower, these heightened risks persisted after 5 years.

The risk of death from any cause within the first 12 months of diagnosis was also more than 4 times as high, and for unnatural deaths, including suicide, it was 5 times as high. After 5 years, these risks were still 2 and 3 times higher, corresponding to 43/10,000 extra deaths from all causes and 184/100,000 extra deaths from unnatural causes.

And 10 years after diagnosis, the equivalent figures for additional deaths amounted to 95/10,000 and 341/100,000, respectively. The risk of suicide was nearly 14 times higher in the first year but was still nearly 3 times higher after 10 years, accounting for 169 additional deaths/100,000 people.

The researchers acknowledge that the medical records data didn't include the severity of the eating disorder, making it impossible to link severity to worse outcomes.

But they say: "Our data describe the substantial long term effects of eating disorders and emphasize the potential opportunity for primary care to have a greater role in offering support and long term monitoring for individuals who are recovering from an eating disorder."

They suggest: "A closer and more cohesive management approach in primary and specialist care may also be needed, for both physical (nephrology, cardiology, and endocrinology) and mental health services to provide this support."

They add: "A potential gap exists in provision where patients' difficulties are too complex for low intensity brief interventions, but not complex enough for specialist teams."

And they conclude:"Raising awareness among healthcare providers about the lasting effects of eating disorders and the need for ongoing support in managing current symptoms and recovery is essential."

In a linked editorial, Dr Jennifer Couturier and Ethan Nella of McMaster University, Ontario, Canada, point out that despite the high prevalence of eating disorders, "their consequences are under-recognised."

They add: "Earlier studies have illustrated the limited education given during medical training on the topic of eating disorders, and the current study emphasises the importance of disseminating this knowledge to all healthcare professionals.

"Medical education should place greater emphasis on the recognition and management of eating disorders, to equip primary care providers, specialists, and allied health professionals with the tools to identify early warning signs and monitor ongoing risks associated with eating disorders."

They conclude: "Multiple organ systems are affected by eating disorders, which then requires an integration of care to adequately treat patients. This situation places primary care providers in an ideal position for leading and coordinating [their] care, and suggests that primary care settings would be apt for early and ongoing intervention."

Smoking even 2-5 cigarettes a day can more than double your risk of any type of heart disease and raise your risk of death from any cause by 60% compared to people who never smoked, according to new research supported by the American Heart Association's Tobacco Center for Regulatory Science and published in PLOS Medicine. The study found that even after you stop smoking, it could take up to 30 years or more to achieve the same level of health of someone who never smoked.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while cigarette smoking in the U.S. is on the decline, tobacco product use, which includes cigarettes, remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death. Cigarettes continue to be the most commonly used tobacco product in adults.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of people who still smoke, but smoke less. As smoking patterns shift with more people smoking fewer cigarettes, it's important to understand the cardiovascular risks of low-intensity smoking and the long-term benefits of quitting. We could not clearly answer these questions in the past, but the scope of this study, reflecting more than 320,000 U.S. adults over 20 years, gives us the statistical power to see relationships that other smaller studies cannot."

Michael J. Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., study author, lead investigator for the American Heart Association's Tobacco Center for Regulatory Science grant-funded research initiatives

The Cross Cohort Collaboration-Tobacco research group harmonized information (meaning they integrated and standardized studies to make them comparable) from 22 long-term studies of predominately U.S. adults who smoked and those who did not. Researchers used the collective data in their analysis of more than 320,000 adults followed over 20 years. They looked at the relationships among smoking burden, intensity and cessation duration across cardiovascular results, including heart attack, stroke, heart disease, cardiovascular disease (including heart disease and stroke), heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AFib), as well as deaths from coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease and all causes.

Defining cigarette use as a lifetime use of at least 100 cigarettes, the researchers documented more than 125,000 deaths and 54,000 cardiovascular events.

They found:

"Collectively, the findings suggest that no level of smoking is without risk. Smoking one or fewer cigarettes a day was linked to elevated risks for all heart diseases and reasons for death studied, except for stroke and AFib. Smoking a little more - two to five cigarettes daily - was associated with increases for all risks in the study," said Blaha, a professor of cardiology and epidemiology and director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, Baltimore, Maryland. "Even we were surprised by the strength of harm from even a low quantity of cigarettes, and the incredible importance that and quitting early had on long-term heart health."

"The message here is clear - don't smoke - and for those who do, quit early in life and strive to quit entirely versus smoking less, because even occasional use of tobacco has substantial health consequences," said Stacey E. Rosen, M.D., FAHA, volunteer president of the American Heart Association and senior vice president of women's health and executive director of the Katz Institute for Women's Health of Northwell Health in New York City. "This study provides clear evidence of the harmful impact of smoking on individuals. It offers a framework for future research to delve into the complex dynamics among smoking habits, various population subgroups and their associations with cardiovascular health outcomes."

Among the study's limitations, it did not include specific other causes of death, such as cancer, for a comparison. And while researchers considered the baseline smoking status for participants' smoking behaviors, they did not analyze potential smoking behavior changes over time. Information was also lacking about participants' use of other tobacco products.

Research from the American Heart Association's Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science is jointly funded by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health. Through the Center, the Association works closely with investigators at institutions across the country to pursue research that adds to the existing knowledge about the health impacts of smoking and nicotine-related products including e-cigarettes, findings that can help inform public health and the regulation of tobacco products.

A simulated 2026 World Cup group stage draw gives the U.S. men's national team's good odds of advancing to the knockout stage.

The USMNT are riding a five-game unbeaten streak after defeating Uruguay to close out November. While they won't play another international friendly until March, manager Mauricio Pochettino and his players have their eyes fixed on the upcoming group stage draw. 

The event takes place Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., though the field hasn't been fully confirmed yet. Only 42 of the 48 teams that will make up the tournament have qualified at this stage, while the remaining six will be determined through UEFA and intercontinental playoffs in March. 

That being said, simulations are already ongoing as coaches, players and fans try to map out a prospective journey. Being in Pot 1 as a host nation automatically avoids clashes with top dogs like Spain, France, England, Brazil and Argentina.

One simulation run by Sports Illustrated puts the USMNT in a strong position to not only advance, but possibly top their group kicking off a magical summer run.

The USMNT face CONMEBOL's Uruguay, CAF's Egypt and AFC's Saudi Arabia in the simulation. Chances are Pochettino and co. will fancy themselves if this group became a reality. 

Despite numerous absences and a heavily rotated side, the USMNT routed Uruguay in their final match of 2025. A first-half blitz saw Sebastian Berhalter and Alex Freeman score their first senior international goals going on to win 5–1 in a convincing performance. La Celeste were missing key players as well, but the performance instilled belief in Pochettino's project.

Lineups would look largely different if they meet again next summer and the stakes raised. Yet, the USMNT would likely fancy their odds after getting some revenge for their 2024 Copa América exit.

Next up would be Mohamed Salah and Egypt. These two countries have only played twice in a competitive setting, with the USMNT winning their last meeting 3–0 in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup. Salah, being the talismanic presence that he is, can determine any game on his own. Still, the USMNT should be favored on home soil.

Closing out their prospective opponents are Saudi Arabia. The USMNT defeated Hervé Renard's side in the Gold Cup this past summer without names like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Folarin Balogun. Given their improved tactical look and the players that should be involved next summer, the USMNT stand a real chance of advancing to the knockout stage.

Two-time champions AAaUruguay will be favored to advance as well, with the third spot up for grabs. The USMNT vs. Uruguay clash would likely determine who tops the group. If the host nation slips up along the way, they can still qualify if they are among the eight best third-place finishers.

Here are the rest of the groups from the Sports Illustrated simulation ahead of the real thing:

Group A

Mexico

Japan

Ivory Coast

New Zealand

Host nation Mexico face a difficult path having to take on Japan, Ivory Coast and New Zealand. El Tri are winless in their last six games since defeating the USMNT in the Gold Cup final. They need to show improvement between now and the World Cup if they're to be taken seriously. 

They should advance as, at least, a third-place team from this prospective group.

Group B

Canada

Ecuador

Scotland

Jordan

Canada would battle Ecuador, Jordan and UEFA-qualifying darling Scotland. The Tartan Army needed a late stoppage time winner from Kieran Tierney to top their group, sending Denmark to the playoffs. Given Andy Robertson's emotional tribute to the late Diogo Jota after the game, Scotland will be highly motivated to make the most of their first World Cup appearance since 1998.

Like Mexico, Canada should advance from this group.

Group C

Netherlands

Italy (unconfirmed)

Tunisia

Uzbekistan

Italy must go through the playoffs once again this World Cup cycle hoping to avoid a similar heartbreak to 2022. If they qualify and are placed alongside Netherlands in this group, they would be the overwhelming favorites to advance.

Group E

Spain

South Korea

Türkiye (unconfirmed)

Curaçao

As reigning European champions, Spain are one of the favorites to win the tournament next summer. If this is their group, they should qualify for the knockout stage with ease. Among the rest, South Korea and Türkiye are names to watch this tournament. 

Curaçao hope to shock the globe after becoming the smallest nation by population to qualify for a World Cup.

Group F

Belgium

Croatia

Australia

Cape Verde

Belgium and Croatia in a simulated Group F would be overwhelming favorites. This could be the last World Cup fans get to see the likes of Kevin De Bruyne and Luka Modrić play for their respective countries as well.

Group G

Argentina

Senegal

Austria

Qatar

Argentina dominate narratives coming into the tournament. La Albiceleste are not only defending their title as world's best, but this World Cup will likely be Lionel Messi's last. All eyes will be on the superstar to see if he can go back-to-back. 

They slipped up in the group stage back in Qatar losing to Saudi Arabia, so Senegal and Austria are potentially tricky fixtures.

Group H

France

Iran

Paraguay

DR Congo (unconfirmed)

The 2026 World Cup will be Didier Deschamps's last as France boss with Zinedine Zidane rumored as a potential successor. Can he guide Les Bleus to another final appearance? Their simulated group gives them a strong chance of advancing as they look to right the wrongs of a heartbreaking shootout defeat in 2022. 

Elsewhere, Iran and Paraguay likely fight for the second seed. DR Congo have yet to book their spot through the playoffs, so this group could become a bit more difficult.

Group I

Germany

Switzerland

Panama

South Africa

Julian Nagelsmann's Germany would be favored to advance from a simulated Group I, though they are still looking for a signature moment since their 2014 triumph. Die Mannschaft were bounced from the last two World Cups in the group stage. Their quarterfinal exit from Euro 2024 also left much to be desired.

At minimum, Switzerland will fancy themselves against Germany in a match that could determine who tops this prospective group. Panama and South Africa would hope to qualify by being one of the eight best third-place sides.

Group J

Portugal

Colombia

Norway

Ghana

2026 also likely represents Cristiano Ronaldo's final World Cup in a Portugal shirt. Unfortunately for the reigning UEFA Nations League champions, they've been drawn into this simulation's group of death.

Colombia were runner-ups at the 2024 Copa América, while Ghana are always a tough opponent in international competitions. 

Portugal's advancement here would be difficult and a mouthwatering clash against Erling Haaland and Norway, qualified for the first time since 1998, is undeniably box office.

Group K

England

Morocco

Poland (unconfirmed)

Haiti

Thomas Tuchel leads a talented England into a World Cup. If not for Harry Kane's penalty miss against France, who knows how far the Three Lions could've gone in Qatar last time. The German manager looks to get over the line in an international tournament after Sir Gareth Southgate came up just short in consecutive Euros. 

Morocco would be their toughest test here after finishing fourth last World Cup. Poland must go through the playoffs with Haiti rounding out this group.

England Right Back Options. England's Right Back Options—Ranked. dark. Next

Group L

Brazil

Denmark (unconfirmed)

Algeria

Iraq (unconfirmed)

There's no doubting Brazil's pedigree. Yet, they have multiple question marks heading into 2026. Carlo Ancelotti must get the most out of his players as he continues to search for consistency. They would be favored over most sides in this group, but how far this iteration of Brazil can go remains to be seen.

Joining them in the simulation are Algeria and two playoff sides: Denmark and Iraq.

Tottenham loanee Randal Kolo Muani has reportedly been training in a specially fitted mask ahead of the north London derby against Arsenal. During Spurs' 2-2 draw with Manchester United earlier this month, the striker suffered a fractured jaw following a clash with Harry Maguire. However, after the Paris Saint-Germain man did not need to have surgery, Tottenham are doing all they can to give him a chance of facing the Gunners this weekend.

Kolo Muani was withdrawn at half time following the coming together with Maguire, with head coach Thomas Frank later saying: "He actually struggled a little bit but nothing big." Initial suggestions were that the France international could miss up to eight weeks with this injury but last week, news emerged that he did not require surgery. The Telegraph is now reporting that he has trained in a mask he had fitted to help protect his jaw. It is not yet known if he will be okay to face Arsenal at The Emirates on Sunday afternoon. If the forward does return to the field soon, he could take after ex-Spurs striker Harry Kane when he wore a mask after breaking his nose, before scoring a truly world-class goal in a 2-2 draw with the Gunners.

On September 1, Kolo Muani joined Tottenham on loan for the 2025/26 season, sparking a great deal of excitement among Spurs fans. He has featured eight times in all competitions for the north London team but is yet to get off the mark. Tottenham supporters will be hoping he can recapture the form he showed at Juventus last season, where he notched 10 goals in 22 games.

In the final day of the summer transfer window, Tottenham snapped up the Frenchman for the season as they sought to add more firepower to their attack. With Dominic Solanke and Richarlison often struggling with injuries and being somewhat goal-shy, the loan move seemed a savvy deal. Following the move, Frank said the 26-year-old gave their frontline something a bit different.

"Randal is a quality player who has proven himself over a number of years, playing for big teams in the Champions League and also with good experience for the France national team," Frank said of his latest addition in early September. "He's a good age, in the prime of his career, has good qualities that will suit both us and the Premier League, and gives us a different option in the final third being able to play out wide and through the middle."

Tottenham sit fifth in the Premier League with 18 points from 11 matches. Next up, they travel to bitter rivals Arsenal on Sunday, who sit four points clear at the top of the table. A win will boost their hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League, but a loss could leave them languishing behind their neighbours.

Fernandinho has officially decided to bring down the curtain on an extraordinary career, drawing to a close more than two decades at the top of the game and a trophy cabinet that places him among Manchester City's most decorated players of all time. The former Brazil international, now 40, confirmed he will not continue playing, ending speculation that had lingered since his return to Athletico Paranaense in 2022.

Fernandinho spent nine seasons at Manchester City after arriving from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, where he had already earned six Ukrainian league titles and a UEFA Cup. Under Manuel Pellegrini and later Pep Guardiola, he became the anchor of City's midfield. Known for his exceptional reading of the game, immaculate tackling, and unrivalled positional awareness, his influence allowed the club's creative talents to flourish. Across 383 City appearances, Fernandinho lifted five Premier League titles, six League Cups, an FA Cup and a Community Shield.

After leaving Manchester in 2022, Fernandinho went home, rejoining Athletico Paranaense, the club that first introduced him to professional football. His playing time naturally declined as the seasons passed, and the midfielder had not featured since December 2024 in a league match against Atletico Mineiro. Speaking after a charity game this week at the club's stadium, he made clear his body had given him its final warning. 

"I'm already tired. I ran for 30-something minutes today and I'm exhausted," he said. "There's nothing in football that motivates me anymore. I've achieved everything I could. Now it's time to enjoy my family."

The 40-year-old added that his departure came after he and the club failed to reach an agreement on a new deal. 

"We didn't reach an agreement for a new contract, and that's the most natural thing in the world. I've never hidden my gratitude, my respect and affection for Athletico, especially their fans," he said.

When Fernandinho left City, he had not initially informed Guardiola about his decision. 

"I didn't know it," the manager told reporters during a press conference. "You gave me the news. We will see what will happen at the end of the season. I said many times we will see what happens. I said at the end of the season we will talk – maybe it is a family decision, maybe he wants more minutes. I would love to be with him."

Guardiola suggested that the then sporting director, Txiki Begiristain, might have been aware of the development.

"Maybe Txiki knows it and didn't tell me," Guardiola said. "I don't know. It is a surprise for me; I will say to him [Txiki]: 'What happened?' But I know his [Fernandinho's] intentions. Another player would do it for his benefit. Knowing Ferna, it will not be this.

"I want the happiness of my players and absolutely we are going to play tomorrow for him and give him the best farewell moment, reaching again the semi‑final of the Champions League and try to go through again. I understand the players want to play, it is completely understandable. Not just because he is 35 or 36. Look what happened with Ferran Torres: he wanted to play so joined Barcelona. I understand Ferna wants go back to Brazil, with his father and mother there, and I am pretty sure the club is going to help him do what he wants."

Attention now shifts to Fernandinho's future beyond the pitch. The Brazilian has previously expressed interest in coaching, and Manchester City have a history of integrating former players into roles across their academy, global network or ambassadorial programmes. With his intimate knowledge of Guardiola's system, he would be a valuable addition should he choose to pursue the coaching path. However, as he mentioned, right now, he would opt for a quieter period dedicated to family life, after spending years at the elite level.

 Rich Storry / Getty Images

Emerging from the locker room following his team's huge 5-1 win over Uruguay Tuesday night in Tampa, Fla., U.S. national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino didn't like the first question at his press conference. He didn't like the second, either.

Both queries were meant to indicate the program's depth. Few – if any – of the consensus “regular starters” actually started.

It's that phrase Pochettino dug his feet in on and didn't give an inch.

“I hate the ‘no regular players' (question),” Pochettino said. “What does this mean? It's USA playing, it's the national team. Stop with that mindset. Every time our decision to pick a starting XI, it's the U.S. men's national team playing.”

Pochettino changed nine players from the XI that started in a win over Paraguay on Saturday. This from a squad that is already missing stalwarts Christian Pulisic, Chris Richards, Tyler Adams, Tim Weah, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, Malik Tillman and more.

In their place, goalscorers Sebastian Berhalter, Alex Freeman (two), Diego Luna and Tanner Tessmann led the way for the USMNT.

“If you know me, I hate to talk this way,” Pochettino said when asked about players missing. “It's so disrespectful. We need to give credit to all of the guys.”

Pochettino consistently preaches fight, competitiveness and togetherness from his teams. He has pushed back hard at the notion that any roster spot is guaranteed at any time. Players need to consistently fight to earn their place on the roster and in the starting XI.

And he has put that methodology into practice by creating internal competition. The USMNT has called up 71 players to camps in this calendar year. By next summer, only 26 can make the final roster for the World Cup. It's a huge pool and competition is a feature, not a bug, under Pochettino.

“I am the USA coach. Tell me which ‘regular players' you are talking about?” Pochettino asked indignantly. “I don't understand.”

What was expected to be a joyful press conference given the match that preceded it quickly went off the rails and never got back on track.

“Maybe we need to stop the press conference, I need to go to the dressing room, come back and start the press conference again,” Pochettino said with a laugh, “because it's like we lost 5-1!”

Soon after, Pochettino was asked if Berhalter's exquisite goal from a free kick – which was rolled short and touched back to Berhalter before he curled it into the top corner – was rehearsed in training or improvised in the moment.

Pochettino threw his hands up and sarcastically – we think – said: “No, it happened by coincidence.”

There were few big breakdowns of individual performances, like Berhalter, who boosted his chances of making the World Cup squad in a hugely competitive midfield pool. His set-piece delivery alone turned heads, with a goal and assist, let alone his box-to-box performance in the run of play.

Nor was there another shout out to Gio Reyna, who came off the bench for 30 minutes to add an assist after scoring against Paraguay in his return to the national team.

Pochettino, perhaps feeling a need to fight for and protect the group as a whole, insisted the day was about the group of players as a collective.

“To be honest, maybe I'm tired and don't understand the English (questions), but I'm very disappointed at the first two questions,” he said.

No matter what questions were asked or performances given, the USMNT has now put together a five-game unbeaten run (4-0-1) since a disastrous performance against South Korea in September.

While the national team won't reconvene for four months, the group departs on a hugely positive note, with strong results fueled by strong performances.

Pulisic, Richards, Adams, Weah, McKennie and Robinson could all feasibly be back in frame by the spring, but the coaches don't want to look at that. They are proud of the present group – the one that delivered in November.

“The credit is all to the players,” Pochettino insisted.

Barcelona's long-awaited return to the renovated Spotify Camp Nou will feature a secret ceremonial kick-off and multiple performances for the reopening against Athletic Club. With 45,000 fans expected, Barca promise surprises as the stadium comes back to life after 909 days away.

Barcelona's return to the Spotify Camp Nou against Athletic Club marks the end of a 909-day exile and the beginning of a new chapter at the iconic stadium. According to Mundo Deportivo, the club has confirmed that the refurbished venue will welcome 45,000 supporters, with gates opening at 2:15 PM, two hours before the 4:15 PM kick-off, to ensure fans experience the full pre-match lineup of celebrations.

The reopening event is designed to be both emotional and theatrical. As per the report, DJ Mon will be the first to perform as fans enter, followed by the central pre-match segment beginning at 4:00 PM. Catalan duo Figa Flawas will take the stage shortly before kick-off, while the Orfeo Catala will perform the ‘Cant del Barca' accompanied by fireworks, symbolising the club's return to its spiritual home.

But the biggest talking point ahead of the match is Barcelona's deliberate secrecy surrounding a “special ceremonial kickoff.” The club has refused to reveal who will take the honour, teasing supporters with the promise of further surprises throughout the evening. At halftime, popular group The Tyets will perform.

Barca have encouraged fans to arrive early, fill the renovated stands in Blaugrana colours and immerse themselves in what the club describes as a once-in-a-generation moment. 

The reopening is not only a logistical triumph but also a deeply sentimental milestone for the club's leadership. President Joan Laporta has spoken extensively about the emotional weight of the return, calling Saturday's event “a historic moment” and telling RAC1, “It'll be wonderful to be back.”

Sporting director Deco added his personal tribute through a series of messages shared on Instagram, each reflecting pride in Barcelona's homecoming after more than two years away. His posts captured the atmosphere the club wants to create, “The Future is Here: We're Coming Home, to the New Spotify Camp Nou.”

In a second message, he wrote: “It's a pride to see how our house is transformed to house the next chapters of FC Barcelona's history. Long live Barca!” He followed with a third reflection: “The Legend Returns: Back to the New Spotify Camp Nou! I feel immense pride witnessing the return of FC Barcelona to its transformed home.” And finally, echoing the club's historic motto, one more declaration: “More Than A Club!”

These messages underline the importance of the moment internally at Barca. Beyond the performances and the secret kick-off, the reopening is being framed as a symbolic rebirth, a return not just to a stadium, but to identity, history and continuity. For Laporta, Deco and the wider institution, Camp Nou is more than infrastructure; it is the heart of the club.

Barca's return comes at the end of a renovation saga far more complex than anticipated. The club had originally left the Camp Nou in 2023 to begin a €1.5bn modernisation project designed to transform the ageing 1957 structure into a world-class, revenue-generating venue. However, the journey back has been marked by repeated setbacks, shifting deadlines and ongoing construction challenges.

The initial plan targeted November 2024, coinciding with the club's 125th anniversary, but this quickly proved unrealistic. A proposed return for the Gamper Trophy in August 2025 also fell through. Even La Liga's flexibility in allowing multiple away fixtures at the start of the 2025-26 season failed to align with the pace of construction, forcing Barca to temporarily move matches to the Estadi Johan Cruyff and later back to Montjuic.

The delays stemmed from several structural and administrative hurdles, including approvals linked to Phase 1B and ongoing negotiations with the city council. The Espai Barca project itself has a long backstory, Norman Foster's 2007 redesign failed to progress, then the modernisation plan proposed under Josep Maria Bartomeu in 2014 stalled amid financial turmoil. When Laporta returned to the presidency in 2021, he radically revised the project, leading to socios approving a new model in December of that year. Turkish construction firm Limak was hired in early 2023, with funding secured through Goldman Sachs shortly thereafter.

The new stadium features expanded VIP rings, improved infrastructure, modernised changing rooms and a redesigned players' tunnel. These updates aim to increase recurring revenue, projected at around €120 million annually, while elevating the fan experience.

Saturday's match against Athletic Club is more than a celebration; it is a first operational test of the new Camp Nou. The ultimate goal is to reopen the stadium at its full 105,000-seat capacity, though no definitive completion date has been set.

On the sporting side, Hansi Flick's team will hope to turn the emotional return into a performance boost. Playing at the Estadi Olimpic and later splitting games across alternative venues disrupted momentum over the past two seasons. The return to Camp Nou is viewed internally as a psychological turning point for both players and supporters.

Athletic Club arrive as the first visitors to the partially reopened stadium, giving Barca a high-profile opportunity to mark the occasion with a statement result.

TAMPA, Fla. — It feels like a lifetime ago, but it was just June 10 that a heavily-rotated U.S. men's national team squad was played off the field against Switzerland.

So when Mauricio Pochettino named a starting lineup for Tuesday night's friendly against Uruguay that featured nine new starters from the team that beat Paraguay three days before, it was understandable why some might have braced for a similar outcome. Uruguay, after all, was probably the most talented team the U.S. had seen since South Korea in September — and was playing some of its most important players.

Advertisement

Instead, the U.S. overwhelmed and steamrolled Uruguay at Raymond James Stadium, scoring three goals in the first 30 minutes en route to a decisive and signature 5-1 victory.

It spoke to the sheer amount of progress Pochettino had made in a short time with this U.S. team, not just in building out depth in the pool, but in building belief within that expanded pool of players. That he could field one team that looked like by far the better side against Paraguay, then change out so many players and get an even more impressive performance was a testament to that progress.

After the game, Pochettino's press conference started with a surprisingly combative and fiery response to a question about what it meant to get such a positive result despite, “a lot of regulars rested.” Pochettino took it as an attack on the identity he was trying to build in the team; the identity that the result in question was meant to reinforce.

“I don't want to be negative, no, but I hate the ‘no regular players' (question). What does this mean? It's (the) USA playing, it's the national team,” he said. “Stop with that mindset. Every time our decision to pick a starting XI, it's the U.S. men's national team playing. If you know me, I hate to talk this way. It's so disrespectful. We need to give credit to all of the guys.”

The focus on that word — ”regulars” — cut to the core of what Pochettino feels he has had to overcome. It has been a theme of his for months now. He has worked to cut the legs out from any sort of complacency or entitlement within the group. And to change the mentality outside of the group, as well. The talk about a “golden generation” had to end.

It was a journey that he said truly started after March's Nations League, when losses to Panama and Canada sent this U.S. team reeling, but one he hopes ends with this team taking its chance and making a dream run to the decisive stages of next summer's World Cup.

The defeats to the pair of Concacaf rivals in March's Nations League felt like a sobering moment for a U.S. team that may have been hoping that changing the coach would be like pushing a fix-it button.

There had been so much hope and optimism around the U.S. team going into the 2024 Copa América only for them to fall in the group stage. After firing Gregg Berhalter and hiring Pochettino, the belief was that things would get back on track immediately.

The problems ran deeper than that. Pochettino felt the focus wasn't there in camp. He could sense contentment and laxity.

“I think that March (was the turning point). I think with all that negativity, (comes) positive things, because with all this negativity we used (it) to build that journey,” Pochettino said. “Sometimes this type of thing can happen, for changing things. Maybe you see things in a different way. Sometimes our perception, sometimes can be wrong. Even being inside. And that I think when the reality touch, I think that's important.”

It was, in other words, a moment for the U.S. team to come back down to reality.

Whatever the U.S. and its players thought they were — it wasn't and they weren't that. If Pochettino was going to change the mentality of the group, he was going to have to manufacture competition that hadn't existed to a high enough degree in the first years of this cycle.

The ensuing months were spent breaking things down and building them back up again.

“I think that was good for us to see the reality,” Pochettino said. “When you really touch the reality, and it's not the reality that you perceive, or you were convinced was different, I think this is a good point to be.”

The revamp started in the Gold Cup camp with players who mostly had everything to prove.

Going into the Gold Cup, the absence of players like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Yunus Musah – “regulars,” if you will, even though Pochettino won't – opened the door for others to step through. Pochettino leaned into the opportunity. He threw the players onto the field and challenged them to prove they belonged.

Even after the Switzerland loss, Pochettino didn't lose faith in the group he believed could deliver an important message: that there was more talent in this U.S. pool than was being given credit. They just needed the chance. While just two players — Mark McKenzie and Sebastian Berhalter — were in the starting lineup for both the Switzerland loss and Uruguay triumph, a number of other players who featured in two big wins this window were a part of that game, against the Swiss, including Max Arfsten, John Tolkin, Diego Luna, Tim Ream and Brenden Aaronson.

Other players, like Malik Tillman, Matt Freese and Alex Freeman turned the Gold Cup — where the U.S. made a run to the final before falling to Mexico — into important jobs with the U.S.

“We know exactly the big group of players that we can rely on,” Pochettino's assistant Jesús Pérez said. “Depending on the circumstances, now it's a matter of state and injuries. But we know (for example), if we call Alex Freeman, what Alex can give us. When we gave him the opportunity, we saw the potential. And now (he is) just getting better for the national team, for his club.”

It was, Pochettino said, simply a matter of providing the platform and the belief.

The results weren't perfect. But the tournament was less about the results and more about building a different mentality within the pool at large: No one's job was secured. Everyone had a chance to book a ticket to the World Cup.

“At the end of the day, the principles of the games are there. … But none of them are going to be right if you are not fully committed,” Pérez said. “Fully committed with no doubts. And that's the basics. So before we talk (about) other things, we [must] feel that we have a group really committed. And if (there) was some noise around those circumstances, I think everything (is now) clear.”

And it was that clarity — that commitment — that Pochettino felt he had to defend after the decisive victory that closed out 2025 on an enormously positive note for this U.S. team.

On Tuesday night, it was some of the new faces that emerged over the last few months that reignited belief that this U.S. team might be capable of making noise at next summer's World Cup.

Berhalter stung a beautiful finish into the upper corner to start the scoring. Freeman netted the next two. Luna added the fourth.

This is what Pochettino aimed for when he built out his Gold Cup roster. Whether it was Pulisic, McKennie and Weah, or Berhalter, Freeman and Luna, Pochettino was convinced the results could be the same. And that the belief in the team should be the same, too. There are no regulars.

In part because of that depth that has been built out, the U.S. is unbeaten in its last five games against FIFA top-40 opponents for the first time since 2013. It feels like a completely different world than it did less than half a year ago.

“It's a testament to the culture that we're building,” McKenzie said. “It shows, again, the faith that Mauricio has in this team and that the collective have in one another. We're building something special. We have a real brotherhood, a band of guys who are going to go out there and not only play with pride to represent our country, but play for the guys next to us.”

It has been a steady drumbeat of positivity around this U.S. team since it downed Japan in September. Players have looked more confident on the field. There seems to be a strong understanding of how they want to play and what the staff is looking for in the team's approach to games. There has also been less concern or talk about intensity or desire. The complacency that Pochettino was combatting is gone.

Two days before taking the field against Uruguay, Pochettino weaponized the idea of “reality” differently. He could sense the confidence building in front of him. In camp, Pochettino contrasted this team to what it looked like in March, calling it the epitome of “professional.” There was no “silly or stupid” things that happened away from the field.

“The focus, the concentration to perform, to train, to do everything that we propose (was there),” he said.

The reality now, he said, is better than what we might even think. And it's forever away from where it was in March. Sensing that change, in a meeting with the team on Sunday, he reintroduced the goals going into the World Cup.

“Let's be realistic,” Pochettino told the team. “And do the impossible.”

It was about reaching for big goals again. To compete against the best. The team's reality could again be linked to its ambition.

With their heads now out of the clouds, and with the results coming and things clicking on and off the field, the focus could start to once again shift toward next summer and the task at hand. This U.S. team has a chance to do something special in the biggest sports event of all time. To do so, it'll have to make a run deep into the knockout phase — to the quarterfinals or semifinals. The type of performance that would galvanize the nation.

“We're starting to feel the World Cup and the excitement,” Pochettino said. “I think it's important for our fans, this type of victory and the result, because I think it's to push them to really believe in the team. We never doubted, because we saw the quality of the players. It was only to trust in them and to give the possibility to find a way to perform, to behave in the way that we feel in football, what it means to be professional. In all the areas I think we need to improve, because we are very ambitious and we want to win. We want to challenge all the teams. … Of course, the World Cup is going to be different, but I think we need to prepare ourselves to be there and to and to really believe in our chance.”

The further this U.S. team goes in the World Cup, the greater the impact on the sport in this country. If it can continue to build the way it has over the last five months, then the influence of this team and the 2026 World Cup could be as transformational as people hope.

World Cup

The United States are confirmed as being in pot one Marcio Machado/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images

With the latest round of World Cup qualification games complete, we have the clearest idea yet of how the group stages could look at next summer's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The World Cup draw will take place in Washington D.C. on December 5, with the 2026 tournament expanded from 32 teams to 48. During the seeded draw, teams will be put into four pots of 12 based on their FIFA rankings as of November/December 2025 and drawn into 12 groups. The latest rankings were released on Wednesday.

There are still six qualifying pots up for grabs — these will be decided by play-off fixtures in March.

Let's take a look at the pots as things stand, what the ‘group of death' could be and possible outcomes for the USMNT, Canada and England.

Based on the new FIFA rankings, this is how the pots are tracking. There is not due to be another ranking update until December 23 — after the draw:





Pot 1: United States, Mexico, Canada, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany

Pot 2:
Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia

Pot 3:
Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa

Pot 4:
Jordan, Cape Verde, Ghana, Curacao, Haiti, New Zealand, UEFA Play-off Qualifier 1, UEFA Play-off Qualifier 2, UEFA Play-off Qualifier 3, UEFA Play-off Qualifier 4, Confed Play-off Qualifier 1, Confed Play-off Qualifier 2

FIFA has not yet confirmed if play-off teams will be placed into pot four or placed in pots based on rankings, so we have worked on the assumption of the former. They will publish further draw criteria before December 5.

Assuming that play-off teams will be placed into pot four, a possible group of death looks like:

Pot 1: Argentina

The World Cup holders, after beating France on penalties in an all-timer final, finished top of CONMEBOL qualifying having won 12 out of 18 games. Lionel Messi finished as the continent's top scorer, with eight goals and three assists from 12 games.

Pot 2: Morocco

Morocco were the giantkillers of the 2022 World Cup. Captained by one of the best right-backs in the world, Achraf Hakimi, they finished top of a group containing Croatia, Belgium and Canada. In the knockouts, they defeated Spain and Portugal before eventually losing to France in the semi-final.

Pot 3: Norway

Norway have only ever qualified for three World Cups, but entering their fourth, they have players with the ability to hurt any team. Erling Haaland is the most fearsome striker in football and led scoring in UEFA qualifying with 16 goals in eight games.

Pot 4: Italy (were they to qualify from the UEFA play-offs)

Four-time World Cup winners Italy may not be at their most formidable, but it would be unfortunate to draw them in pot four over nations making their tournament debut.

They will have to earn their spot at the competition via the play-offs after finishing second in UEFA qualifying group I behind Norway, but could be included in pot four if they do make it via this route.

In pot two, also look out for Japan, who finished above Spain and Germany in the groups at the 2022 World Cup.

Mohamed Salah's Egypt present a threat in pot three, along with the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) winners Ivory Coast. Ghana, who reached the quarter-finals in 2010, are a strong side in pot four.



The worst-case scenario for the USMNT and Canada would be to be part of the group of death highlighted above, drawn with Morocco, Norway and Italy.

Nations from pots two to four may be hoping to draw one of the host nations from pot one, to avoid the highest-ranked FIFA teams.

England would avoid this exact draw as only two UEFA teams can be in each group, with countries from every other confederation not able to meet at this stage.

A worst-case scenario for England could be: Japan from pot two, Egypt or Ivory Coast from pot three and Italy from pot four.

As for best-case scenarios, being drawn against tournament debutants could be beneficial. In pot three, there is Uzbekistan and in pot four these nations are: Jordan, Cape Verde and Curacao. These teams will be riding a high, but have a lack of experience at the elite level.

England icon Wayne Rooney has revealed the eye-watering details behind his biggest Manchester United contract - leaving the Stick To Football pundits stunned. The forward will go down as one of the greatest players this country has ever produced and many will argue he deserved to get paid as well as he did. But the disparity between his salary and that of his peers left some in shock.

While Rooney has not had much success in management, following his dismissals at Birmingham City and Plymouth Argyle, few can argue about what he achieved as a player. He won five Premier League titles and a Champions League, along with a host of other silverware. The 40-year-old picked up a hatful of individual accolades, scored 53 goals in 120 games for England, and found the net on 313 occasions in 763 appearances. Across his career, greats of the game waxed lyrical about him.

For instance, former team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo said: "He was the kid of England, everyone loved him. He was so powerful, I was calling him ‘Pitbull.' The power of Wayne Rooney is his mentality and strength, and he never stops. He's a fantastic team player, and he scores. He's a fantastic boy, and he helped me a lot when he came to join us in Manchester."

Ronaldo's greatest of all time rival, Lionel Messi, believed that what Rooney could do on a football pitch was "very special".

The Argentine admitted: "There has always been a great deal of respect between myself and Wayne Rooney. For me, he is the great English player of the generation. What he is capable of doing on the field is very special, and he is one of the few players that would improve any squad in Europe."

And Arsenal great Thierry Henry said the consistently high level Rooney produced in his career was "extraordinary".

He added: "To play well for six months or a season in football is nothing. To do so for over a decade like Rooney is extraordinary. I know what it takes, and it isn't easy. Trust me, people talk about him outside of this country. In Spain and France, he is appreciated as a top, top player."

In an enlightening chat about how players brokered deals in their playing days, Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher, Ian Wright, and Roy Keane were lost for words when Rooney talked about the biggest contract he signed at United. In 2014, when Rooney was 28 going on 29, the ex-Everton ace signed a five-year deal with reported wages of around £300,000. And on Stick to Football, Rooney said he got £17 million ($22m) a year after that bit of business. With the ex-footballers blown away by this figure, Neville quipped that he wished he had used an agent during his contract negotiations with the Red Devils. The right-back said he earned a basic salary of £1.75m that rose to £2.25m.

He added: "[Money] was never a focus for me. I never once worried about the money side of it. I just thought that if I can get to the end of my career at 35 or 36 at United then I know I'll be alright. When they offered me seven years on less money, it was better for me than signing for four years on higher money. I always thought in a more cautious way."

Carragher piped up that his biggest deal was around £3m and Keane said he earned around £5m at his peak. 

Rooney retired from playing in the 2020/21 season with Championship side Derby County, with the veteran then taking up the role of Rams manager. Ergo, many football fans growing up now will not have seen him in his pomp. But the plaudits that came his way give some indication as to how good a player he was. 

Former England and United team-mate Rio Ferdinand once said: "I laid eyes on him when he was 16 or 17 years old, and I remember after an England game as well, I said to his mum and dad in the players' lounge ‘make sure he signs for Manchester United'. They looked at me and laughed and thought, ‘we have already done that'. What a player. He did it all, he scored a ridiculous amount of goals, scored absolute bangers from anywhere on the pitch, great passer, aggressive, passion, desire, work rate."

Rooney's former manager, David Moyes, got to see him make the grade at the Toffees, and knew he had something very special on his hands.

"There was a day when we had him in training. He was only a young boy and we had to set up a small-sided game and Wayne chipped a goalkeeper from near the byline. It was a moment when we all looked at each other and said, ‘Did he really do that? Did that happen?'. We knew it before, but when we saw that happen we all thought ‘there is a real special talent here," he said.

For the time being, Rooney has put his managerial career on hold and is giving punditry a go once again. He has a podcast with the BBC and is a Match of the Day pundit, along with other gigs. But another foray in the dugout may be at the back of his mind, too.

BySuzanne Rowan Kelleher,

Forbes Staff.

U.S. tourism is expecting a World Cup boon in 2026—but President Donald Trump's repeated threats to pull games from Democrat-run cities is adding uncertainty for travelers and the economy.

The U.S. tourism industry is counting on the World Cup for a much-needed revenue boost in 2026, following a marked decline of international visitors in 2025.

During an Oval Office press conference Monday, Trump repeated threats to have the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) pull games from Democratic-run cities slated to host World Cup games next summer, saying the governors and mayors “are going to have to behave.”

Trump targeted Seattle's newly elected democratic socialist mayor, asking FIFA president Gianni Infantino, “How close are you going to be watching that city with the crime in the city?”

Seattle Sports Commission president and CEO Beth Knox said the city is “confident the matches will proceed in Seattle as planned” in a statement to The Seattle Times on Wednesday.

The 16 North American host cities—11 in the US, three in Mexico and two in Canada—are contracted with FIFA and are selling sponsorship packages.

As of Wednesday, two of the 12 countries on Trump's travel ban list—Iran and Haiti—have already qualified for the World Cup and one more—the Republic of the Congo—could yet qualify, leaving fans prohibited from traveling to the US to watch their teams.

The World Cup is projected to drive $30.5 billion in economic output and create 185,000 jobs in the U.S. next year, according to an analysis from FIFA and OpenEconomics . According to the report, roughly 40% of the estimated 6.5 million tournament attendees will be international fans who will stay for an average 12 days, buy two tickets per person and spend about $416 daily. FIFA has advised World Cup host cities to expect a 50/50 split between domestic and international visitors, tourism officials from Philadelphia and Kansas City, two World Cup host cities, told Forbes. But Tourism Economics, a division of Oxford Economics, projects the U.S. will see only 1.24 million international visitors for the tournament—less than half of FIFA's projection. Nevertheless, the tourism analytics firm expects the event to help reverse a dramatic 6.3% downturn in inbound international tourism since Trump took office, driven mainly by his tariffs, America First rhetoric and immigration policies. Tourism Economics projects international visitation to rebound 3.7% next year, with nearly one-third of that growth tied directly to the World Cup. While tourism officials are generally optimistic about the potential for a World Cup boon, some have expressed concern that Trump's rhetoric and policies will inevitably turn off some international soccer fans. “The rhetoric from the administration against anything non-U.S. is just pretty prevalent,” Jan Freitag, national director of hospitality analytics at CoStar Group, said last month. “I think some people will say, ‘Look, if I'm from Europe and the next World Cup is in Europe, then maybe I'll sit this one out.'”

It's highly doubtful. With seven months until the tournament kicks off and millions of game tickets already sold, changing host cities would be a legal and logistical nightmare for FIFA. Still, Trump has repeatedly threatened to have Infantino yank the tournament from cities where politicians have opposed his immigration crackdowns. Last month, he singled out Boston when expressing his displeasure with the city's “radical left” mayor, Michelle Wu, saying “we could take [World Cup games] away.” After lambasting Seattle for electing a “communist” mayor, Trump asked Infantino in the Oval Office Monday, “Can I say that we are moving the event to a location where it will be appreciated and safe?” Infantino appeared to appease Trump, saying safety “of course is the responsibility of the government” and “obviously we will discuss, we are working together, we must ensure all fans coming from abroad can experience a celebration of coming together of the sport and with 100 percent safety.” Other FIFA executives have pushed back more definitively on Trump's rhetoric. “At the end of the day it's FIFA's tournament, FIFA makes those decisions,” Victor Montagliani, vice president of FIFA, said at a sports summit in London last month, adding, “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans.” 

Until the tournament groups are announced on Dec. 5, fans who want to see a specific national team play don't know where to plan their travel. It remains to be seen whether FIFA's tournament draw might potentially penalize host cities Trump has criticized by steering countries with the most ardent fanbases to Republican-leaning cities.

“Please do not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle,” Infantino said before the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Since July, FIFA has been a tenant in Manhattan's Trump Tower, which Trump critics have cited as yet another example of the sitting US president co-mingling his role as head of state with his business interests. Infantino was a guest at Trump's inauguration in January and has been an enthusiastic supporter of the president. International soccer organizations, meanwhile, have also criticized Infantino's bromance with Trump. In May, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) excoriated Infantino for arriving late to the FIFA Congress after joining Trump on his Middle East tour, accusing the FIFA chief of putting “private political interests” ahead of his commitment to the world's soccer organization. Earlier this month, Infantino announced Trump will be awarded the new “FIFA Peace Prize” after the president was passed over for the coveted Nobel.

Gab Marcotti and Mark Ogden discuss the World Cup playoff draw which sees Wales at home to Bosnia & Herzegovina and Northern Ireland travel to Italy. (2:41)

The 2026 FIFA men's World Cup kicks off in just 203 days, but six qualification slots are still up for grabs via the Intercontinental and European playoffs.

Two teams will book a place at the event (to be played in the U.S., Mexico and Canada) via the playoffs, which will be staged in Mexico in March, while 16 European nations, including four-time World Cup winners Italy, are set to battle it out for the final four UEFA qualification berths. The path to the World Cup is now clear for the 22 nations still dreaming of a place at the finals next summer.

Following a draw at FIFA HQ in Zurich on Thursday, the playoffs are now locked in, so which teams can start to plan for North America and who has a nightmare route to football's biggest tournament?

With the ties now confirmed, here are ESPN's predictions.

The final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs.

- World Cup seeds set with new FIFA rankings release

The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up, plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UEFA Nations League who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. The teams will be divided into four pots according to FIFA ranking, with the Nations League group winners assigned to Pot 4 and drawn into four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup.

Semifinals to be played on March 26; finals to be played on March 31

Semifinal 1, Italy vs. Northern Ireland: The playoff nightmare returns for Italy following elimination at this stage ahead of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, but they will be happy with a home draw against Northern Ireland in the semifinal.

Michael O'Neill's team are huge outsiders, and despite finishing second in their qualifying group behind Norway, Italy should be too strong and more than capable of erasing memories of failures to beat Sweden (2018) and North Macedonia (2022) at home in their last playoff campaigns.

Winner: Italy

Semifinal 2, Wales vs. Bosnia-Herzegovina: Wales coach Craig Bellamy made huge importance of beating North Macedonia in Cardiff in their final group game because that would guarantee a home semifinal, and that advantage should swing the tie in their favor. The Welsh have a formidable record at the Cardiff City Stadium, playing in front of what has been billed as a "Red Wall" of passionate supporters; Bellamy's team should win this game to seal another home tie against Italy in the final.

Winner: Wales

Final, Wales vs. Italy: Despite being the highest-ranked nation in the playoffs, sitting 12th in the FIFA Rankings, Italy lack a proven goal scorer, and they struggle to break opponents down.

If key men Sandro Tonali and Giacomo Raspadori are fit and in form, Italy should have enough to shade this tie, but Wales are strong at home, and if these two meet in the final, don't be surprised if Wales inflict yet another playoff heartbreak on the Azzurri.

Prediction: Wales advances

Semifinal 1, Ukraine vs. Sweden: While Ukraine have home advantage, the ongoing conflict in the country means Sergiy Rebrov's team will likely play this tie in neutral Poland, and that could tilt the game in Sweden's favor.

Sweden were dismal in qualification, finishing at the bottom of Group B without a win in six games, but their Nations League success last year sealed a playoff spot, and star forwards Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyökeres will surely see this as a second chance to qualify that they cannot pass up. Sweden are hugely fortunate to be in the playoffs, but they will be too strong for Ukraine.

Winner: Sweden

Semifinal 2, Poland vs. Albania: Poland have become the team that always qualifies for major tournaments but fails to deliver once on the big stage. But this is a tough tie.

Albania, coached by former Barcelona and Brazil defender Sylvinho, are a well-organized, high-energy team, and they will be confident in beating Poland away from home. At 37, this will be Robert Lewandowski's final World Cup campaign. If the Barcelona forward is on form, Poland will win. If not, back Albania.

Winner: Albania

Final, Sweden vs. Albania: Albania are good enough to cause any opponent problems and could quite easily travel to Sweden and win. But if Sweden overcome Ukraine and seal a home game in the final, it would be tough to deny a team with the attacking qualities of Isak, Gyokeres and Anthony Elanga.

Sweden, now coached by Graham Potter, really shouldn't have this opportunity to reach the World Cup, but they are the strongest squad in Path B, so they will qualify.

Prediction: Sweden advances

Semifinal 1, Turkey vs. Romania: Turkey showed their strength by earning a 2-2 draw against Spain in Seville in their final Group E game, a result that restored some pride after a 6-0 home defeat against the European champions in September. Having scored 12 goals in three games against Bulgaria (twice) and Georgia in between the Spain fixtures, Turkey are clearly an attacking force and loaded with top talent, including Arda Güler, Kenan Yildiz, Deniz Gül and midfielder Hakan Çalhanoglu.

Romania, coached by the 80-year-old Mircea Lucescu, are unpredictable but talented. They will be brave and confident in this game, but Turkey should be too strong.

Winner: Turkey

Semifinal 2, Slovakia vs. Kosovo: Kosovo are the most dangerous outsiders in the European playoffs and much stronger than their FIFA ranking of 80th would suggest. Franco Foda's team lack big names, but their players are based throughout Europe, and Kosovo ran Switzerland close in Group B, beating Sweden home and away before being held at home by the Swiss in the final game.

Slovakia shocked Germany with a 2-0 home win in qualification before losing 6-0 to Julian Nagelsmann's side in Leipzig in the final game. Slovakia are ranked higher (45th) by FIFA, but Kosovo are a better team right now.

Winner: Kosovo

Final, Kosovo vs. Turkey: On paper, Turkey are big favorites to make it through Path C to the finals, but home advantage could be decisive for Kosovo if they eliminate Slovakia.

Having only become a FIFA member in 2015, following a declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, the national fervor for home games in Pristina makes Kosovo a formidable opponent for Turkey. This could be a game in which Turkey's superior talent and depth counts for little against a Kosovo team determined to make history by qualifying for a first World Cup.

Prediction: Kosovo advances 

Mark Ogden backs the Republic of Ireland to make it through the playoffs and end their 24-year World Cup drought.

Semifinal 1, Denmark vs. North Macedonia: Denmark threw away an automatic qualification spot by drawing at home to Belarus and then losing away to Scotland in their final two games having been in control of Group C, so their status as favorites in this tie should be tempered by the scars of their group-stage failure.

North Macedonia's 7-1 defeat away to Wales in their final game should not be taken as a true gauge of their capabilities, though. Blagoja Milevski's team drew home and away with group winners Belgium and they will relish their underdog status, just as they did when eliminating Italy with a 1-0 win in Palermo in the 2018 playoffs. Denmark should be too strong at home, but North Macedonia are primed to record another shocking result.

Winner: North Macedonia

Semifinal 2, Czechia vs. Republic of Ireland: The Czechs were locked in a surprise battle with the Faroe Islands for the runners-up spot in Group L and almost blew it with a 2-1 defeat away to the perennial minnows in Tórshavn in October. But Jaroslav Kostl's squad, which includes West Ham's Tomás Soucek and Bayer Leverkusen forward Patrik Schick, held their nerve to seal second position behind Croatia.

Ireland came from nowhere to claim a playoff place, though, with a shocking 2-0 home win against Portugal before Troy Parrott's hat trick in Budapest, including a 96th-minute winner, denied Hungary and claimed second spot for Heimir Hallgrimsson's team. Ireland have momentum and belief, so they can win this tie and book a home final in Dublin.

Winner: Republic of Ireland

Final, North Macedonia vs. Republic of Ireland: Home advantage in a game to decide a place in the World Cup will be crucial, and Ireland, backed by a crowd of 52,000 in Dublin, might just have enough to make it the World Cup.

North Macedonia are more individually talented, and the same applies to Denmark if they make the final, but Ireland coach Hallgrimsson made his name guiding Iceland to a series of shocking wins, and he can do it again if key players Troy Parrott, Caoimhin Kelleher and Evan Ferguson are fit and in form in March.

Prediction: Republic of Ireland advances 

The playoffs, to be held in March, will determine the final two qualifiers. Six countries will take part. Each of the five confederations (apart from UEFA) will provide one country, while the host confederation (Concacaf) receives a second slot.

The two nations with the best FIFA world ranking will be seeded and go straight into one of the two finals. The four other countries will be drawn to play a semifinal, feeding through to play a seed for one of the two places at the World Cup.

Steve McClaren quits his job as Jamaica boss after their failure to directly qualify for the FIFA World Cup.

Congo DR await the winners of the New Caledonia vs. Jamaica semifinal, and it would be a huge upset if Jamaica fail to book a final clash against the African nation.

New Caledonia are the lowest-ranked team in the playoffs, sitting at 149th in the FIFA rankings, and coach Johann Sidaner told ESPN last month that his team, from an archipelago in the South Pacific, have a "1 percent chance" of qualifying for the World Cup.

Jamaica blew their chance of automatic qualification with a 0-0 draw at home to Curacao in the final round of Concacaf qualifiers, and that result forced coach Steve McClaren to quit. Jamaica will be too strong for New Caledonia, and they will face Congo DR as underdogs.

Congo DR have Premier League experience in Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Arthur Masuaku and Axel Tuanzebe, but Jamaica can also rely on Brentford's Rico Henry and Ethan Pinnock. This tie is a close call, but Congo DR look to have just a little bit more quality and will claim the qualification spot.

Prediction: Congo DR advances 

Iraq won a two-legged Asian playoff against United Arab Emirates to clinch their place in the Intercontinental playoffs -- their winning goal was a penalty 17 minutes into stoppage time.

Due to their FIFA ranking of 58th, Iraq are seeded through to the final, where they will expect to face Bolivia. Coached by former Australia coach Graham Arnold, Iraq's squad are largely based in the Middle East, but former Manchester United youngster Zidane Iqbal, now at FC Utrecht, is a player with European experience.

Suriname, ranked 123rd, have a squad of players based in Europe, but while Bolivia's squad is largely drawn from South American leagues, they have a recent win against Brazil on their form guide, so they should be too strong for Suriname. If Bolivia face Iraq in the final, it will be tough to call, but their experience of playing at altitude could be crucial in Mexico, and it should give them the edge.

Prediction: Bolivia advances

Wayne Rooney has compared Harry Kane's “incredible evolution” into England's GOAT with the development that Cristiano Ronaldo once enjoyed at Manchester United. Kane is already his country's all-time leading goalscorer and appears set to smash records on the appearance front as well. If he could win an international trophy, then it would be difficult to argue against him being the greatest.

At 32 years of age, the former Tottenham striker is showing no sign of slowing down. Remarkable numbers are being posted at Bayern Munich, with the target being found there on 108 occasions through 113 appearances. He has also broken his trophy duck by becoming a Bundesliga title winner.

On the international stage, Kane remains the talismanic captain of England. He is rarely rested, with few alternative No.9 options breathing down his neck, and has helped the Three Lions secure qualification for the 2026 World Cup.

He has reached 78 goals for his nation and boasts 112 caps. Kane needs to reach 126 in order to pass legendary former goalkeeper Peter Shilton. Another shot at major glory will be taken in next summer - having suffered defeat in back-to-back European Championship finals - with the plan being to emulate Bobby Moore when it comes to claiming the most prestigious of prizes.

Explaining why Kane will pass Moore, Bobby Charlton, Kevin Keegan, Bryan Robson, Paul Gascoigne, David Beckham, Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer on the GOAT front, ex-England captain Rooney told The Overlap: “Just the goals he has scored and his performances. He will go on and get the caps record as well, you would imagine - the caps he is on.

“I just think how he has evolved as a player is incredible. He reminds me of Cristiano when we were at United and he was younger. Sometimes he's at a mad angle and he's shooting and you're like ‘what are you doing shooting?' You might say ‘pass it' but it doesn't bother him, he'll try it again and keep going - right and left foot. I think he's, for me, the best England player. The numbers he is getting are incredible.”

Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher agreed with that assessment, suggesting that Kane still does not get the recognition that his stunning exploits deserve. The former England defender said: “I absolutely love him. I think he is a little bit underrated. There was always that thing about trophies.

“Shearer was always the centre-forward of the Premier League when it started - for six or seven years, Shearer was the guy and he was England's guy, most goals in the Premier League. I think if you asked most people up and down the country: Shearer of Kane? I think the majority would go with Shearer.

“I've always been Kane. Shearer was amazing but I don't know what you can say against Kane. He has gone to Bayern Munich and he is like Ronaldo and Messi level. He's going to get more goals and caps than Lineker, Shearer, Jimmy Greaves, Rooney. What hasn't the lad done? What can you throw at him?”

One-time England striker Jermain Defoe, who also graced the books at Spurs, has previously told GOAL when asked if Kane will go down as England's greatest: “I think if he wins something, you have to put him in the conversation. Of course there have been others that are iconic figures and legends in terms of caps – Beckham, Ashley Cole, all the great players. But to be England's leading goalscorer, that's a special achievement. If you go on to win a major tournament and have the most caps, of course you have to put him in the conversation.”

Kane has spoken of his admiration for Rooney, with inspiration being taken from the Manchester United great and fellow frontman that he took England's all-time goal record from. Rooney was unable to win anything during the Three Lions' so-called ‘Golden Generation', but Kane has an opportunity to grab himself a gold medal before hanging up his boots.

Bayern Munich honorary president Uli Hoeness has praised the influence of striker Harry Kane and head coach Vincent Kompany, lauding the English forward as the embodiment of how the team should play. Hoeness also revealed a recent conversation he had with Kompany over dinner, telling the manager that he doesn't want Bayern's matches to end because of how enjoyable the team is to watch at the moment.

It has been a rip-roaring start to the 2025-26 season from Bayern Munich. The reigning Bundesliga champions won 16 consecutive games to begin the campaign, breaking AC Milan's record of 13 wins out of the opening 13 games of the 1992-93 season across all competitions. Kompany's men have dominated and obliterated their opponents. The only game they've not managed to win was their most recent outing, a 2-2 draw against Union Berlin.

It all began with a closely-contested 2-1 win over last season's DFB-Pokal winners Stuttgart in the DFL-Supercup. A statement 6-0 win over RB Leipzig helped them carry early momentum in the Bundesliga. Wins over Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain – last season's Club World Cup and Champions League winners, respectively – have sent a dangerous warning to the rest of Europe, while domestic rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen's efforts have been in vain, too.

Speaking at a health-related event at the FC Bayern Museum on Thursday, honorary president Hoeness expressed his delight over how well Bayern have started the season and revealed what he recently told Kompany over dinner.

"We are, of course, very, very satisfied with what we're seeing," he exclaimed in euphoria. "I've always said that when you have a team you're very happy with, you can finally relax in the stands. I recently met Vincent Kompany for dinner and told him: 'It used to be that in the 80th minute, you hoped the game would end soon.' And now, in the 80th minute, you say: 'I hope they keep playing for a long time, because it's so much fun!' The players are having fun. The fans are having fun. And we in the stands are having fun too. And that's actually the ideal situation right now, the way you want to imagine FC Bayern."

Hoeness went on to wax lyrical about Kane, who has already scored a staggering 23 goals in 17 games this season. He also became the quickest player in history to reach 100 goals for a single club in Europe's big five leagues, taking just 104 games to achieve the feat.

"What Harry Kane has produced here in the last year or two is absolutely top-notch," said Hoeness. "And what I like best about him: In the beginning, he was a goal scorer who played in his box, who waited for the balls to come. But today he's long since become a playmaker, he's a finisher, and above all, he's a player with a personality who inspires others on the pitch, who sets the direction, and that's exactly what we were looking for."

Hoeness heaped further praise on Kompany, who has been doing a ridiculously phenomenal job at the Allianz Arena. The honorary president explained what sets the Belgian manager apart from previous Bayern coaches such as Thomas Tuchel. 

"He has two or three advantages. For example, as a journalist, you actually have to work again. The previous coaches here always gave you the go-ahead to discuss for weeks. That's not the case with him, because he wants to talk to them about football, and that's good for the whole of FC Bayern," he said.

In a recent interview, the red-hot Englishman claimed that his individual numbers would be worthless as long as he fails to help his team win titles. "I could score 100 goals this season but if I don't win the Champions League or the World Cup, you're probably not going to win the Ballon d'Or," Kane said.

"It's the same with Erling Haaland, it's the same with any player. You have to be winning those major trophies. With the way the season is going as a team with Bayern Munich, it looks like we're in great shape.

"It looks like we're one of the favourites for the Champions League, for sure. So that maybe makes the odds a little bit more in my favour. Same with England. I think we're going to go into the tournament as one of the favourites. Whenever you are going into a year, like a World Cup year, there is a lot of excitement, a lot of talk, a lot of noise around everything. You have to try and stay focused on the now.

"From my point of view, I've got six more weeks before I get a nice break. I am feeling good. And that break will help for us but hopefully if things go my way for club and country then I'm definitely going to be in the conversation for a trophy like the Ballon d'Or."

JUMP TO:

Qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup is into its final stages.

At the end of the November international break, the identity of 42 of the 48 finalists for the expanded international football showpiece will be known.

The remaining six spots will be filled by the UEFA and inter-confederation playoffs in March.

Argentina will defend their title after Lionel Messi completed his long and occasionally tortuous path to glory at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. La Albiceleste have since retained their Copa America title and finished top of the notoriously gruelling CONMEBOL qualifying section.

Here's everything you need to know about World Cup qualification, who has made it to the finals and how many teams from each continent will take part.

Each confederation has more slots available under the expanded format. The AFC has double the qualification spots it had at Qatar 2022, up from four guaranteed places to eight, while there will be nine African nations instead of five.

CONCACAF will have at least double its 2022 representatives, up from three to six, although half of those slots are accounted for by the United States, Mexico and Canada qualifying automatically as hosts. As was the case at the previous World Cup, two slots will be decided via an inter-continental playoff.

Of note, Uzbekistan and Jordan both qualified for their first-ever World Cup appearances in the summer of 2025. By finishing top two in their group in the third round of AFC qualification, they secured an automatic bid to the competition.

Following them shortly after was Cape Verde, as the tiny island nation of just 600,000 people earned their first-ever World Cup spot by winning their group ahead of Cameroon. Beating that in November was Curacao, who became the smallest-ever nation to qualify for a World Cup with their population of 150,000.

The AFC began its crucial third round of qualification in September 2024. Eighteen teams were split across three six-team groups to contest 10 games in a round-robin format. The top two in each of Groups A, B and C qualified automatically for the World Cup.

The teams placed third and fourth in each group advanced to a fourth round split between two groups of three. Those groups were played out during the October international break, with Qatar and Saudi Arabia - the previous and next World Cup hosts - going through to the finals.

Runners-up the United Arab Emirates and Iraq played a two-legged tie in November to decide the AFC representative at the inter-confederation playoff. Iraq prevailed 3-2 on aggregate.

Nine groups of six teams played each other home and away in Africa. The winner of each section at the end of the 10 games progressed directly to the World Cup.

The four best runners-up from the initial round-robin phase entered into a playoff. DR Congo prevailed to with the playoff on penalties against Nigeria, moving them into March's inter-confederation round.

CONCACAF began the second round of its qualification phase in June 2024, with 30 teams drawn into six groups of five. Each team played every opponent in their group once, with two away games and two home games once the phase concluded in June 2025.

The top two in each group advanced to the 12-team third round, where there were three groups of four. Beginning in September 2025, the nations in each group played one another home and away. The three group winners advance to the World Cup, with the two best-ranked runners-up going into the inter-confederation playoff.

South America retained its celebrated marathon World Cup qualification round, with all 10 of the confederation's countries playing one another home and away in a gruelling league format. 

The expanded World Cup means qualification is a little easier, with the top six advancing automatically. Seventh-placed Bolivia will attempt to return to the World Cup for the first time since USA '94 in the inter-confederation playoff.

Argentina clinched their place at the finals thanks to a memorable 4-1 demolition of arch rivals Brazil. The Selecao ended the campaign in fifth spot, one of four teams to finish the campaign on 28 points.

The 2026 World Cup is the first time the OFC has been guaranteed a representative at the finals. The second round, running across October and November 2024, saw two groups of four playing for the four spots in round three.

The top two in each round-two group advanced to a three-match playoff in March 2025. New Caledonia defeated Tahiti in the first semifinal, with New Zealand thrashing Fiji 7-0 in the other.

New Zealand then claimed the automatic qualifying place by winning the OFC final 3-0. New Caledonia will enter the inter-confederation playoffs, so they have another chance to get there, albeit a slim one.

Twelve of UEFA's 16 spots were taken by the group winners from the initial format of four or five-team groups. The 12 runners-up, along with the four best UEFA Nations League group winners that finished outside of the top two in their World Cup qualifying groups, enter the playoffs.

Those 16 teams were drawn into four paths with two single-game rounds. The seeded teams will be at home in the semifinals, with a home nation for the four finals drawn in advance. The winners from each path advance to the World Cup. UEFA is the only confederation without a representative in the inter-continental playoff.

The full draw and brackets for the UEFA playoffs are detailed here.

The two teams in the six-nation playoff with the highest FIFA ranking are seeded. The four unseeded teams play an effective semifinal, with the two winners progressing to face a seed apiece to decide the final two places at the World Cup.

The four-game playoff will be used as a World Cup test event and played in two venues in Mexico.

The full draw and brackets for the intercontinenal playoffs are detailed here.

Intercontinental Playoff participants

The 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off on June 11, with co-hosts Mexico in action at the Azteca, which hosted the 1970 and 1986 World Cup finals.

MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, will host the final on July 19. The overall span of 40 days will make this the longest World Cup in history, with the 48 finalists contesting a total of 104 matches.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw takes place on December 5, 2025 in Washington, D.C.

After Mauricio Pochettino's makeshift United States men's national team beat Uruguay 5-1 in their final fixture of 2025 on Tuesday night, this much is clear: No one's spot on the 2026 World Cup roster should feel secure, not even for those Americans playing for some of the world's most famous European clubs.

With only one more international window to go before the 2025-2026 European club season ends, it may be more important than ever for every player with World Cup hopes to earn regular minutes and make contributions at the club level.

However, that doesn't describe everyone in the current USMNT player pool, including several names who were expected to be cornerstones of the 2026 squad when Pochettino took over just over a year ago.

Here are five USMNT players who desperately need to play more minutes for their club sides to lock down a spot on the final tournament squad.

Reyna was excellent during his 104 minutes across two November matches for Pochettino, scoring one goal, assisting another, and setting up a third.

The problem is that it's nearly equal to his total workload so far during the German Bundesliga campaign with Borussia Mönchengladbach. 

A thigh injury interrupted Reyna's acclimation to his new club after his long-awaited departure from Borussia Dortmund. And while it's clear he can contribute at the international level, he needs to prove his durability.

The World Cup is a lot different from an international window, with the U.S. facing as many as eight matches between June 12 and July 19 if it can make a run to the semifinals as a host nation.

Reyna, 23, hasn't played a World Cup-worth of minutes during a single club season since his age-17 campaign at Dortmund in 2020-2021.

At his best, Robinson is arguably the first name on the USMNT team sheet and one of the world's elite left-backs, a position that carries a premium.

However, the 28-year-old is struggling to regain full fitness after surgery to repair his quadriceps tendon in May. After briefly returning to the pitch, he hasn't played a competitive fixture for Fulham since late September.

Additionally, because Pochettino has switched to playing primarily in a 3-4-3 formation this fall, it may be riskier to wait until June to reintroduce Robinson than it would have been had the U.S. coach kept playing a back-four system.

Robinson has rarely played as a left wing-back for his Premier League club, and the overwhelming majority of his international experience for the USA has also been in a back four.

If he can get back into match fitness, he may have more equity built than anyone else in the program, even Christian Pulisic. But that's looking like a bigger "if" with each passing week.

This was always the concern when Cardoso made his big move from Real Betis to Atlético Madrid over the summer. 

While Betis had a phenomenal season in 2024-25, no one can blame the 23-year-old for wanting to join a club that regularly contends for La Liga titles and UEFA Champions League places.

However, the 24-year-old's international performances were generally underwhelming relative to his efforts in La Liga and the UEFA Europa Conference League last year.

And now, after recovering from an ankle sprain early in his first campaign for Atleti, he's been supplanted by veteran captain Koke in his box-to-box midfield role.

At this point, it feels like Cardoso needs a pretty dramatic turn in his club's fortunes to climb back into Pochettino's consideration.

But Koke is 33, and it's a grueling season for Champions League sides, more so than ever with the new format. Things can still change quickly and unexpectedly.

With Weston McKennie spared from Pochettino's November roster and Tyler Adams forced to withdraw with an injury, this felt like a camp where Musah could have earned his way back into Pochettino's good graces.

The call didn't come, though, with the versatile central midfielder still not seeing starting minutes while on loan at Atalanta in Serie A, and having declined an invite to participate with the USMNT at the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup to recover from the previous season.

Musah probably wishes he could get a do-over on that choice. Now, Cristian Roldan's reemergence has made him less essential, even though most think the AC Milan player has a much higher ceiling.

More than anyone else on this list presently, Musah now needs to prove himself capable of approaching that upper limit by winning a more integral role on the club level. He needs to do it soon.

No one's stock has risen more this year than Freeman, who opened his international goal-scoring account with a first-half brace on Tuesday. But the defender faces a potentially pivotal winter for both his club and international futures.

While the 21-year-old became one of coach Oscar Pareja's most reliable players for Orlando City this season, he's well underpaid on his current rookie contract and has yet to agree to a new MLS deal. 

The Lions are also already eliminated from the MLS Cup playoffs, and credible rumors of European interest are circulating. 

You can understand why Freeman might want to take advantage of his rocketing USMNT stock now, similar to how Patrick Agyemang parlayed his into a giant pay raise at Derby County.

However, finding immediate minutes after joining a new club during the winter window can be a daunting task even for seasoned veterans. And if he doesn't, it's certainly the kind of thing that could interrupt the meteoric rise of a player who has only played one full first-division season.

Discover the paths and matchups for the men's national teams fighting for the last six spots at the next football World Cup.

The road to the 2026 FIFA World Cup is shaping up following the draws for the Play-Off Tournament and European play-offs to assign the last qualifying spots available for the global men's football showpiece.

With 203 days to go until the football World Cup kicks off, the play-off draws were made on Thursday (20 November) in Zürich, Switzerland.

Six spots remain up for grabs at the newly expanded 48-team tournament, which will be held in the USA, Canada, and Mexico, between 11 June and 19 July 2026.

Two of those spots are for the winners of the Play-Off Tournament, while the other four spots are for the winners of the European play-offs. The play-offs will take place across Europe and Mexico in March 2026.

In the inter-continental play-off tournament, six teams are split into two paths. The two highest-ranked teams, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Iraq, have a bye into the two finals.

The remaining teams have been drawn into semi-finals for a place in the final, where the two winners will qualify for the FIFA World Cup. Matches will take place in two host cities for the finals: Guadalajara and Monterrey, both located in Mexico.

Exploring the history of football at the Olympics takes us to the Uruguay football team, led by their captain and famous player José Nassassi also known as El Gran Mariscal. They went on winning Gold at Paris 1924 after a six-weeks journey across the Ocean. Four years later, in Anvers 1928, they won their second consecutive gold. And in 1930, the first World Cup was organised in Uruguay and guess who won this tournament?

In the European play-offs, 16 teams from the UEFA confederation will be drawn into four paths. They will all start from the semi-finals, where they play a single match to advance to the final. The first team drawn in each last four clash will host the match.

The winners of the four finals will book the last four spots for the FIFA World Cup. Matches are set to be played in March 2026.

World Cup

The United States Soccer Federation is launching a new strategy to try to create more world-class players, win World Cups, reduce the cost for young people to play the game and make soccer the highest participation sport in the country.

In an interview with The Athletic, U.S. Soccer chief executive JT Batson revealed the “Pathway Strategy” has buy-in from key components of the country's soccer ecosystem, including MLS, NWSL, USL, youth soccer organizations, key sponsors and community organizations. While many details and methods are still to be publicly disclosed, he said that early-stage memorandums of understanding have been signed, with timelines and deadlines for actions to come into effect.

Batson said the landmark moment of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, provided impetus for key stakeholders to work together.

He said: “We're all here because we want to win World Cups and we want millions of kids to be able to play soccer. We want people to believe that U.S. Soccer is supporting them in their soccer journey, whether it's a fan, a player, coach or a family member. We know we have more work to do on that on the men's side.

“At the Women's World Cup in New Zealand and Australia, we did not achieve what we wanted (the U.S. women's national team went out in the round of 16). We did the hard work to understand what actually needs to be done, so that we are the No. 1 played sport in the country and so tens of millions of people are in love with our teams.

“We have talked to anyone we could learn from. We did research, we took data, we had thousands of conversations with people within the U.S. and outside the U.S. to understand our environments, opportunities or challenges, and to ultimately put forward a real plan that we think can be successful.

“It is not the one you slap on a bumper sticker. We're committed to doing the long, hard work here.”

The research undertaken by U.S. Soccer included consultations with soccer experts around the world. Batson says the legendary former Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, now in a role as FIFA's chief of global development, “deserves a lot of credit” for the generosity of time and insights provided by him and his team in outlining ideas and practices. The U.S. Soccer sporting director, Matt Crocker, has also brought insights from his extensive time with the English Football Association and Premier League.

The federation has also enlisted the support of the Twenty First Group, a sports intelligence consultancy. They are working to benchmark how many players out of the top 1,000 in the world would, on average, be required in a squad at a World Cup for a team to go to the quarter-finals or beyond in the competition, providing the federation with one method of benchmarking its future talent development.

Batson said the objective is to get U.S. teams, at all levels, into a position to win major tournaments. “On the women's side, we have proven we are there,” he added. “But the rest of the world is not sitting around hanging, so we have to keep pressing. On the men's side, we have ambitions of proving we are there too.”

One of the previous challenges has soccer stakeholders disagreeing about the issues and solutions for the game. Batson says the consensus has moved closer.

“We agree we need to work together,” he said. “We agree we need to make soccer more accessible. We agree we need easy, simple-to-understand pathways for kids to decide what journey they should go on. We agree that we need to get some of the funding and resourcing models right. There's a belief that there needs to be a whole lot more opportunities for kids to play soccer close to home, and local models and regional models that provide an opportunity for kids to play much longer, much easier and much cheaper than what exists today.

“There's buy-in around the U.S. way: a sporting strategy around player-centric development and best practices. Clubs can have different playing styles, but it is about having a core philosophy around how we make sure that every kid is put in a position to be successful.”

Batson warned that the size and geography of the U.S. mean there is no “copy and paste” solution from other countries. The federation has taken learnings from outside of the soccer and sports world to understand how to bring greater agreement and uniformity.

The federation has studied the smoking cessation efforts within the United States, which drastically reduced the number of smokers in the country, as well as public information campaigns that persuaded many people of the risks of driving under the influence of alcohol.

That level of buy-in will be required to smooth access and participation, particularly costs, for children to play soccer in the country. Many current and former U.S. national team players have bemoaned the financial risks taken by their families in pursuit of their soccer dreams.

Batson said, “This is going to be a long-term journey. But for a country as wealthy as we are, with the resources that we have, beyond monetary, these are solvable things. With people in the room, working together, it's possible.

“Our task is to use the big moments of '26, '28 (Olympic Games in Los Angeles) and '31 (bid to host the Women's World Cup) to get governments to invest in fields, to get schools to put soccer in, because it's not just one thing, it's all of the things. You've got this incredible base of strength and support.

“The commercial market of soccer in this country is growing. MLS owners now spend nine figures a year on free-to-play youth soccer opportunities as part of their player development efforts. Ten years ago, that was essentially nothing. That alone is massive. Part of what we will be calling out is how soccer is a more affordable way to impact way more kids than, say, baseball or football, where equipment is way more expensive.”

In 2024, 31.9 million Americans over the age of six participated in basketball versus 17.3 million in baseball, according to the Sports and Fitness Industry Association (SFIA). In football, across flag, tackle, touch and 7-on-7, the combined participation was 18.8 million. Soccer's participation across indoor and outdoor in 2024 was 20.5 million, which is a rise of more than three million since 2019.

The plan has major backing. MLS Commissioner Don Garber has said the Pathway Strategy “represents an important step toward a more unified development system in this country.”

Emma Hayes, head coach of USWNT, told The Athletic: “We want to be the most inclusive sport in the U.S. and give players opportunities to have the most fun and enjoy maximum growth, as people and players, regardless of their background or where they live.”

Her men's team counterpart, Mauricio Pochettino, added that he is “so happy to see that U.S. Soccer is taking the right steps forward in this process.”

Plenty will ask where the money will come from to bring the strategy to fruition. Batson said, “Part of this is realizing the soccer market in the U.S. is actually really big. There are already billions of dollars being spent. Taking the existing market and resourcing it more effectively frees up a lot of resources.

“Additionally, there are big untapped dollars from school districts and local governments that today still are spending way more on football than they should be based on participation numbers. There are continued opportunities as Major League Soccer, USL and NWSL grow for this to flow back into youth development.

“Look at the revenue growth of U.S. soccer over the last few years — we've more than doubled in that time period — and have opportunities to continue to grow. There's a lot of money that, if organized, we'll be able to unlock a lot of opportunity.”

As the World Cup edges into view, FIFA received one concession this week from the Donald Trump administration when it was announced that ticket holders for the tournament next summer will be granted expedited visa appointments. This is important due to lengthy wait times for nationals of several countries, such as Colombia, Ecuador and Morocco, who have qualified already for the tournament.

Another plan to reassure fans is to use “FIFA legends” (famous ex-players) to put out videos to their local markets back home to tell supporters the U.S. remains a cuddly and welcoming place to visit.

The Republican congressman Darin LaHood, who attended the Oval Office news conference on Monday in which FIFA president Gianni Infantino and President Trump unveiled the expedited visa appointments plan, recently spoke at the “Going for Gold: America's Tourism Opportunity in the Mega Decade of Sports” conference in Washington, D.C.

While speaking on a panel event, Rep. LaHood, co-chair of the Congressional Soccer Caucus, said, “We have to have a strong welcoming message to the United States — we are going to partner with our FIFA legends in all the countries around the world to have messaging that will go out probably in December or January, welcoming people to the United States for soccer, for sport, for the World Cup. And that will be an important PR, communications mechanism that we're working on in the White House now.”

On Monday, President Trump again reiterated his threats to relocate World Cup games — this time from Los Angeles and Seattle — to other cities he deems to be “safer.” In the same news conference, he also did not rule out launching strikes in World Cup co-hosts Mexico against drug cartels. FIFA president Infantino stood behind him throughout.

While host city executives are by now accustomed to the United States president's broadsides, several, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships, are growing exasperated with FIFA's refusal to stand up for host cities, with Infantino once again deferring to the Trump administration on Monday.

Trump said, “If we think there is going to be a sign of any trouble, I would ask Gianni to move that to a different city. We have a lot of cities who would love to have it and would do it very safely. If we think there is a problem in Seattle, where there is a liberal, communist mayor. I watched her (Katie Wilson) over the weekend, wow, that is another ‘beauty' we have got there. Gianni, can I say we will move the event to some place it will be appreciated and safe?”

Infantino answered: “Safety and security are the No. 1 priority for a successful World Cup. We can see people have trust in the United States because we have record-breaking ticket sales. Tickets are almost two million sold already. People know they will be coming here to experience a safe and secure World Cup. This, of course, is the responsibility of the government and obviously we will discuss, we are working together, we must ensure all fans coming from abroad can experience a celebration of coming together of the sport and with 100 per cent safety.”

Host cities, which are seeking to sell sponsorship packages for fan festivals around the tournament, are hoping for more backing from FIFA, particularly because the governing body's contracts are directly with host cities, rather than the federal government. Some host city executives are even privately questioning why they should bother continuing to invest money into FIFA's events when the sporting body's officials appear so reluctant to defend them publicly, according to people familiar with discussions.

In a recent statement to Sky News, FIFA reiterated that “safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety.”

FIFA declined to comment for this story, but did point to comments made at the Global Citizen Festival in September shortly after Trump first discussed the possibility of relocating games, where Infantino said there are “16 beautiful host cities” across the three countries hosting the World Cup.

We have a lot of cities who would love to have it and would do it very safely. If we think there is a problem in Seattle, where there is a liberal, communist mayor. I watched her (Katie Wilson) over the weekend, wow, that is another ‘beauty' we have got there. Gianni, can I say we will move the event to some place it will be appreciated and safe?”

Infantino answered: “Safety and security are the No. 1 priority for a successful World Cup. We can see people have trust in the United States because we have record-breaking ticket sales. Tickets are almost two million sold already. People know they will be coming here to experience a safe and secure World Cup. This, of course, is the responsibility of the government and obviously we will discuss, we are working together, we must ensure all fans coming from abroad can experience a celebration of coming together of the sport and with 100 per cent safety.”

Host cities, which are seeking to sell sponsorship packages for fan festivals around the tournament, are hoping for more backing from FIFA, particularly because the governing body's contracts are directly with host cities, rather than the federal government. Some host city executives are even privately questioning why they should bother continuing to invest money into FIFA's events when the sporting body's officials appear so reluctant to defend them publicly, according to people familiar with discussions.

In a recent statement to Sky News, FIFA reiterated that “safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety.”

FIFA declined to comment for this story, but did point to comments made at the Global Citizen Festival in September shortly after Trump first discussed the possibility of relocating games, where Infantino said there are “16 beautiful host cities” across the three countries hosting the World Cup.

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Leclerc: 'The best thing I can do is keep doing my best'

After taking his best result in F1 so far last time in Sao Paulo, Kimi Antonelli has high hopes this weekend in Las Vegas.

Kimi Antonelli has revealed that "a bit of a tough" meeting earlier in the season has spurred him on to a run of strong results recently, with the Mercedes driver eyeing another this weekend in Las Vegas.

The Formula 1 rookie claimed his best result so far last time out in Sao Paulo, finishing second having also finished runner-up in the Sprint as well that weekend.

It meant the Italian has finished in the points five times in the last six races, which is in stark contrast to the barren run he had in the middle of the season, which included six pointless races in seven that was only broken by his maiden podium in Canada.

Ahead of the Las Vegas GP this weekend, Antonelli said that a meeting with Mercedes management allowed him to refocus and put his season back on track.

“After Monza, we had a big meeting – a bit of a tough one – but it was good," he said. "It really helped me to reset and to refocus on the task and on the important things, so I think it was a new beginning after the difficult period.

“Brazil was just a matter of putting the weekend together, doing a good Sprint Quali, a good Sprint race, and then a good Quali and a good race. The main difference was that for the first time this season, I was able to put the full weekend together and to be consistently up there.

He added: "Obviously, after Monza, after the meeting, I recognised that I needed to change something, and that's why I reset and realised again what to focus on, what task, and also on the basics, trying to drive well and put things together. I know that if I do all of these things right, the result will come by itself.”

Las Vegas has been a strong track for Mercedes since it was added to the calendar in 2023, with the cold conditions suiting the German manufacturer's car as George Russell took victory 12 months ago, leading home team mate Lewis Hamilton.

Despite it being a new venue for Antonelli, the 20-year-old was optimistic on his chances.

“It's another new track, so it's always very exciting coming into a new track," he said.

"Obviously, it's very different conditions to what we've been used to recently; it's very cold and unexpectedly wet.

"It looks like it's going to be wet probably as well for FP2 tomorrow, so it's going to be interesting to see. But as always, we're trying to focus on the process, trying to learn the track as quickly as possible and get up to speed.

“Last year was good. It doesn't mean we're going to be good this year as well, but I really hope we can be as strong as last year, and on my side, I'll try to deliver the best result possible and to enjoy it as well.”

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Leclerc: 'The best thing I can do is keep doing my best'

Check out the odds for this weekend's Las Vegas Grand Prix, from pole position to the Grand Prix victory.

Formula 1 enters the final triple header of the season as the Las Vegas Grand Prix hosts Round 22 of the championship, but what do the odds say about who might come out on top? Read on to find out...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

The Drivers' Championship leader, Lando Norris, has upped his game in recent rounds to win back-to-back races convincingly. In Mexico, he crossed the line 30.324 seconds ahead of runner-up Charles Leclerc, and in Brazil he was 10.388 seconds clear of Kimi Antonelli. The McLaren driver is also developing a reputation for winning from pole, having prevailed five times in six starts from the front row this term.

Recent races would suggest that Norris' biggest threat will come from the RB21 of Max Verstappen. The Dutchman will start in Nevada with seven consecutive rostrums to his name, including three victories in the same period. However, minor placings won't help his cause in the title fight, as he needs to recover 49 points on the leader. Despite the mountain ahead, he holds fond memories of this circuit, taking top honours in 2023.

On the value end of the scale, George Russell is a worthy selection, given his success on street circuits this campaign. The Mercedes racer took victories on the streets of Montreal and Singapore, racking up five podiums in seven races on similar circuits. He'll also arrive in Nevada as the defending race winner.

After the start that Oscar Piastri had to the season, looking at him for the minor podium places is not something that would have been expected at this stage of the campaign.

The Australian registered 14 top-threes in the first 16 rounds, but hasn't joined in the post-race festivities since his third place at Monza. Piastri arrives in the States with three consecutive fifth-place returns to his name, but he knows how to win on the streets, collecting first prize in Jeddah and Miami earlier this year.

Ferrari enter the fray after failing to collect any points in Sao Paulo, the third such occurrence this year. However, they managed to put a driver on the podium in Las Vegas in 2023 and 2024. As it stands, Leclerc is their best chance of that, arriving with two in his past three outings.

Credit is due to the rookie, Antonelli, who snatched his second career top-three down in South America, and his best finish, a runner-up behind Norris. Can he repeat that feat this weekend?

We need to dedicate some space to young Ollie Bearman, who has been nothing short of sensational in the latter part of the calendar. The Haas driver tackles the final street circuit of the year with four straight top-10s under the belt and consecutive top-sixes. He carries the lowest midfield finishing average in the previous five Grands Prix at 8.00. One factor that counts against the rookie, however, is his performance on street tracks this year, where his best return was ninth in Singapore.

Seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton continues his tough maiden season at Ferrari. He failed to cross the line in Brazil for his second DNF of the campaign, but has captured nine top-sixes across the year, making him a serious contender in Nevada. He also enjoyed a successful visit here in 2024, finishing second behind his then-team mate Russell.

Then we get the Williams duo of Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon, who are more than capable of a top-six finish. The issue for them is consistency, both from a driver's standpoint and car performance. If they show up in Las Vegas, you can expect them to challenge for points, but we'll find out which Williams fares better.

Albon leads the midfield in top-10s this season, racking up 11, but he hasn't finished inside the cut since Monza. Next up in this rank in this division is rookie Isack Hadjar, who captured his ninth top-10 in Sao Paulo. Despite his impressive record, he's struggled at the backend of the campaign, falling outside of the threshold in 60% of his past five races.

Moving away from youngsters, we settle on Fernando Alonso, who has driven himself into this category eight times this year, twice in the last five Grands Prix. Sticking with the veterans, Nico Hulkenberg produced his seventh top-10 performance of 2025 last time out. It was the second such result in three races, and still, he offers value for money.

Liam Lawson continues to show grit, despite an uncertain future in the sport's top flight. The Kiwi took off from Brazil after finishing inside the first 10 spots for the sixth time in his rookie season. Finally, Pierre Gasly collected welcome points for Alpine down in South America for his fifth Grand Prix score of the campaign. However, he's struggled with street layouts this year and will likely endure another tough weekend in Las Vegas.

Norris has usurped the power in the past two Qualifying rounds, taking pole position in the subsequent Grand Prix. The McLaren enters Las Vegas with six starts from the front of the grid this season, but only two coming on street circuits. He now trails Verstappen by one in the Pirelli Pole Position Award.

Speaking of the four-time World Champion, he's stopped the clock fastest on Saturday in three out of the seven street races this year, making him the most successful on these set-ups. He is closely followed by Norris, and last year's Grand Prix victor, Russell.

Both of Russell's pole positions this season have occurred on street circuits, that being Canada and Singapore respectively – both races that he went on to win. And while Piastri's form might have seemingly dipped lately, he has qualified fastest on five occasions this term, the last one arriving in the Netherlands.

McLaren find themselves back in the driver's seat after handing over the reins to Red Bull for a few races, with the Woking outfit touching down in Vegas after two consecutive victories. They've produced the winning vehicle in 66.67% of Sunday races this year, but they'll find it challenging in Las Vegas. While the papayas have snatched three street showdowns this year, the last one was in Monaco, courtesy of Norris.

Red Bull have found their groove late in the season and still hold a long shot of producing the Drivers' Champion. The Austrian-owned team have collected five triumphs this campaign, courtesy of Verstappen, and provided the victorious car at this event in 2023.

Mercedes are the value for money offer in the Teams' fight, arriving as the defending champions. They've also enjoyed themselves on the road circuits this year, winning two of the last three.

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Leclerc: 'The best thing I can do is keep doing my best'

Max Verstappen has given his assessment on his season, with the Red Bull driver taking pride in how he was able to reduce the significant points lead of his title rivals.

Max Verstappen feels that he and Red Bull can be “proud” after reducing the significant points gap that they faced earlier in the season, though the Dutchman acknowledged that the performance level was “not where I wanted it to be” for most of the campaign.

Following the Dutch Grand Prix in August – the first race after F1's summer break – Verstappen was more than 100 points adrift of then-championship leader Oscar Piastri. However, a strong run for the four-time World Champion saw him win three out of the four next Grands Prix, bolstering his points tally and bringing him back into the title fight.

While the margin is now at 49 points from Lando Norris – who retook the standings lead in Mexico – Verstappen is happy with how he managed to bounce back.

Asked ahead of the upcoming Las Vegas Grand Prix if he would rate this season as his best in Formula 1 in terms of what he has achieved behind the wheel, the 28-year-old responded: “It's been good, for sure.

“I think every season you want to try and be better, which is not always easy but you try to be more consistent. Otherwise we tried to really optimise everything we can with the car, and I think most of the time we really did that, so I'm pleased with that.

“It's not where I wanted it to be for most of the season, otherwise you're fighting all season for the title, which we haven't really. I enjoyed the highs and the wins that we did score, but at the same time of course the lows were also not fantastic.

“At the same time, in the middle of the season or after the summer break, we were looking at a points gap of more than 100 points and it really looked like it was only going to get bigger, and at one point we were really overturning that by quite a bit. A bit of luck in some places, but I think that's something we can be proud of, to still score some good results at the end of the season.”

Ahead of the final three rounds of the season, Verstappen insisted that his approach to the championship battle remains the “same as always”, adding: “It doesn't really change. It's a lot of points so I'm not really thinking about it too much.

“There's also not much I can do – we need a lot of luck now until the end to even have an opportunity, so personally I don't think about that.”

For now Verstappen's focus is on Round 22 in Las Vegas, a weekend that he arrives into off the back of an impressive comeback drive last time out in Sao Paulo that saw him climb from a pit lane start to a final result of P3.

Pushed on whether he could be in with a chance of challenging for victory should he get a similar feeling from the RB21 as in Brazil, Verstappen said: “Looking back at Brazil, yeah, I guess so, because the race pace was pretty decent.

“Of course I would have liked to start more at the front, but at the same time it was fun. I had a good time out there racing through the pack and fighting until the final lap. Of course it was only for P2, but I had good fun and I hope we can be competitive this weekend.”

In the case of Max Greenfield, you will like him when he's angry. No, the former “New Girl” and current “Neighborhood” star isn't joining the MCU as our latest (and undoubtedly most) Incredible Hulk, but in “A Man on the Inside” Season 2, he does play an academic forging a financially advantageous partnership with a rich, goateed jackass. And, more to the point, he's really, really funny. 

Greenfield plays Jack Beringer, the president of Wheeler College and a gleeful narcissist whose smug sense of superiority is so secure he doesn't even wait around for affirmation. Jack will backdoor-brag about his surgically enhanced calves or boast about a farcical flirtation with a celebrity seated next to him on a flight, then flee (or cease paying attention) before anyone has time to congratulate him (or cut him down a peg).

So it's striking whenever he slows down, as he does after a masked assailant plasters him with a bucket of mud. The public incident (on a stage, during his speech) sends Jack spiraling, and he directs his ire at the man hired to protect him: Charles Nieuwendyk (Ted Danson). “What if it's not mud next time?” Jack says, staring a hole through Charles' thick black spectacles. “What if it's… poo?!”

 










Between each rhetorical question, Greenfield punctuates Jack's silly worst-case scenario by stepping closer to Charles. But he doesn't break eye contact. He doesn't even blink. And when he drops the punchline, he pumps his eyebrows ever so slightly on the word “poo.” There's no questioning how serious Jack takes the situation, just as there's no doubting how unserious the situation actually is. That's the fun of the scene, magnified by Greenfield's concocted whirlwind coming to a full and sudden stop in order to deliver what, in his mind, is a frightening revelation, but to everyone else reads as an absurdly oblivious poop joke. It's wonderful. I love it. And I'll cherish it as long as my diminishing memory allows. 

But despite the four paragraphs I've dedicated to Greenfield's hysterical line reading, his is a small moment in “A Man on the Inside” Season 2, and Jack is a small character — not just small-minded, but short on screen time. He's not the main reason to watch Michael Schur's sweet, sly Netflix sitcom, but he does illustrate its excellence. Self-aware, adaptable, and smart, the series is the exact opposite of Jack Beringer, highlighted by the fact it knows exactly who Jack Beringer is and how to draw out the best of him. 

The mere fact that Season 2 makes time for Greenfield to max out speaks to its astute understanding of what makes for a great sitcom: Sometimes, like in Season 1, it's a combination of bright jokes and poignant humanity. Sometimes, like in Season 2, it's evolving without forgetting about the little flourishes that last in an audience's mind, endearing them not only to the ensemble, but to the show around them. 

 










In a season without the melancholic emotional core of its predecessor — when Charles was processing the loss of his wife — “A Man on the Inside” inhabits the same compassionate, curious, and chucklesome space as before, while fitting a new case, a new cast, and a new romance into Charles' evolving spy story. That it's premiering 364 days after the first season is another not-so-small blessing. (Thank you, veteran TV producers.) 

Season 2 picks up with Charles' first enticing assignment in some time. Wheeler College needs help. Admissions are down, expenses are up, and federal aid is all but non-existent. (Sound familiar?) For a quick fix, Jack turned to America's favorite lifeline — billionaires — and found Brad Vinick (Gary Cole): a Wheeler alumnus worth more than $6 billion who agreed to donate $400 million to his old stomping grounds.

“Agreed” is the key word there, because he hasn't handed over the dough just yet, and the administration has good reason to worry he won't: Someone stole Jack's laptop and is threatening to expose all his secrets if Wheeler accepts Brad's “blood money.” Fearing any knowledge of the scandal would scare off Vinick, Jack hires Charles and his boss, Julie (Lilah Richcreek), to find the laptop, identify the thief, and save Wheeler College. 

 










Simple enough, right? Once again, “A Man on the Inside” relies on a rather straightforward mystery to support its higher priorities: comedy, chemistry, and (light) social commentary. That may irk genre fans looking to do some serious sleuthing (from the safe remove of their living room sofa), but there are plenty of shows to scratch that itch, and far fewer that deftly balance so many characters and tones while still getting a well-earned laugh from a well-placed “poo.” 

To get as close as he can to the staff (all of whom are suspects), Charles joins Wheeler as a guest lecturer — a cover story so perfect he doesn't even need a fake name, since he used to teach engineering at a different university (and, as he may have mentioned, wrote a book on the subject). Instead, his mission grows complicated for personal reasons. Like a small-town freshman who can't navigate his huge new college campus, Professor Nieuwendyk misses most of his (fake) classes to spend time with Mona Margadoff (Mary Steenburgen), a music theory instructor whose impulsive spirit proves irresistible to the ever-sensible egghead. 

Danson and Steenburgen, whose offscreen marriage has inspired regular swooning over the last 30 years, are fantastic together. At times, it feels like the comic-mystery series has shifted into full rom-com mode, as Schur gives them plenty of scenes to flirt and fool around (in a joking sense, although when Mona poses as a nude model, the prim Charles flies into a hilarious fit of excessive modesty). Their relationship manages to give us exactly what we want while packing in a few savvy surprises — and pushing Charles forward. He's dating again! That's a big deal! (But that's not all his arc with Mona is out to accomplish.) 

 










Season 2 doesn't go off without a hitch. Trying to replicate Charles' uniquely moving emotional arc from Season 1 would've been a fool's errand, but Season 2 still feels emptier without comparable soul-searching. (Julie reconnecting with her ex-con mom ventures into similar territory, but its a B- or even C-plot and can't reach the same sentimental register). Also, balancing a cast as extraordinary and expansive as this is always going to be impossible, and with time at a premium in 30-minute sitcoms, a few favorites go neglected. (David Strathairn, as an English professor with an unshakable grudge against Charles, is a lovely, yet underserved, curmudgeon.)

But you'll always want more time with the people you love, and “A Man on the Inside” knows that well enough to make peace with it. Season 2 is solid on its own, and even better at proving the series' sustainability. Future editions can keep the friends and family who prove important to Charles (Stephen McKinley Henderson's Calbert and more Pacific View retirees return!) while continuing to expand his second career through new cases. At the same time, it keeps the door open for what those cases might be, who may be involved in working them, and who may be called in to flesh out Charles' personal life. 

With Danson on “the Inside” and Schur the “Man” behind the scenes, their series is a guaranteed good time. What makes it simultaneously rewarding and exciting is seeing how hard they work to make it more than that. Neither rests on their laurels (as Sam Malone and the creator of “Parks and Rec” certainly could), instead endeavoring to bring out the best in each other and those around them — whether that means casting their offscreen partner of 30 years as a crush-worthy onscreen girlfriend, or finding room for a brilliant supporting actor to get good and angry, it's a winning formula. 

 










“A Man on the Inside” Season 2 premieres Thursday, November 20 on Netflix. All eight episodes will be released at once.

	On Wednesday, Fox News Media announced in a splashy rollout that its religious vertical, Fox Faith, was expanding. 


	As part of a new tentpole project, the network is launching The Life of Jesus Podcast, a 52-episode series that will guide listeners “through the life, teachings, and miracles of Jesus Christ.” Hosted by Fox & Friends star Ainsley Earhardt, the press release boasted that more than 100 notable actors were signed on, including megastar Kristen Bell as the voice of Mary Magdalene. 


	But that was news to Bell, who was blindsided by the announcement as she had recorded the audio for a separate project 15 years ago. Her rep tells Rolling Stone that she only learned that Fox Faith had acquired the long-forgotten project and was spinning it into a brand-new podcast when her team received a request for her to appear on Fox & Friends a day before the announcement was blasted out. The rep adds that Bell never gave permission for the old audiobook to be repurposed into a new podcast series. 

	











	Originally, Bell voiced Mary Magdalene for The Truth and Life Dramatized Audio Bible, a New Testament audiobook released in 2010. A producer tied to the Bible audiobook has since partnered with Gulfstream Studios, which is licensing The Life of Jesus Podcast to Fox Faith, according to publicly available information. 


	What's more, the audio Bible includes the same celebrity names that are now being touted in Fox's press release, including Brian Cox, Sean Astin, Neal McDonough, Malcolm McDowell, John Rhys-Davies, and Julia Ormond. While some of the actors have been open about their Christian faith, Cox, who is voicing the role of God, has previously called Fox News “the devil.” A rep for Rhys-Davies also confirms to Rolling Stone that the actor only learned of the “repurposed” project earlier this week. (Rolling Stone has reached out to the other stars involved for further comment.)

	The network seems to have taken the 15-year-old, 23-hour audiobook and retooled it into a multipart podcast series, with the new additions coming from Earhardt. In a note obtained by Rolling Stone, a producer associated with the podcast has asked at least one celebrity star to “not mention that this audio New Testament Bible was produced years ago, we'd like it to feel like something that was produced more recently.” (Rolling Stone has reached out to Fox News Media for comment.) 


	The first batch of episodes for The Life of Jesus Podcast will air on Nov. 30.

Cardi B gave birth to a baby boy on November 4. He is her fourth child and first with her boyfriend, Stefon Diggs, who is a wide receiver for the New England Patriots.

To commemorate the experience, the rapper turned to Mommy Made Encapsulation for their Umbilical Cord Keepsake.

The one-of-a-kind item is exactly what it sounds like: a keepsake made from the detached piece of an umbilical cord.

According to the company's website, it is “your baby's umbilical cord dehydrated in the shape of a heart, and then dipped in gold chrome.”

The stylized and preserved umbilical cord is relatively affordable at just $50. However, it is an add-on to the company's pricey $500 Placenta Encapsulation Service, which converts the temporary gestational organ into pill form to be ingested post-partum.

The 33-year-old also opted for a Placenta Print ($65); the shape is meant to evoke the Tree of Life.

The company posted a graphic video on Instagram that demonstrated how the umbilical cord is fed with a metal wire for shaping and then dehydrated for preservation. Commenters were still confused.

“It's giving… umbilical pretzel,” shared one. “This is so gross & so warming all at the same time! Love this 🔥🔥,” noted another.

The brand also shared a video of Cardi B's placenta, dyed blue, before being processed.

Summarizing the mixed sentiments, another Instagram fan wrote, “I'm all for memories, but keeping my babies fried, dyed, and dried umbilical cord is not one of them.”

The singer used Mommy Made for at least her third child, Blossom Belle Cephus, as the brand posted images of the 2024 procedure to their Instagram feed last year.

Cardi B is not the only famous parent who has used this service. The company shared that they had completed the same procedures for Megan Fox and  Vanessa Hudgens.

Cardi sparked engagement rumors when a diamond ring was spotted on her left hand in some of the images that she shared of the new baby.

She has yet to comment on her current relationship status with Diggs.

But, in the meantime, she has a new piece of gold jewelry — made from her baby's umbilical cord — that she can wear on repeat.

The viral track, which used AI to alter its vocals, is in the center of a legal firestorm over allegations that it used singer Jorja Smith's voice without permission.


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


	Even before its release to streaming services, “I Run,” a dance/EDM track by the artist HAVEN., was a viral sensation online, amassing millions of plays on TikTok after it was teased on Oct. 10. “I love this song so much,” said one TikTok commenter. “DROP THIS RIGHT NOW PLEASEEEE,” commented another.


	For HAVEN., a new artist project from British producers Harrison Walker and Jacob Donaghue, who also makes music under the name Waypoint, it was the kind of debut that could change the trajectory of their lives. But now, a swirl of legal complaints and takedown notices have engulfed the song, resulting in it being removed and reuploaded to streaming services multiple times — and stopping its momentum just as it was poised to reach the Billboard charts.


	The frenzy of activity around “I Run” prompted multiple A&Rs at major and independent music companies to look into signing the track and the people that created it as it awaited official release. It also caught the attention of the popular UK R&B singer Jorja Smith. The uncredited female vocalist on “I Run” sounded eerily similar to Smith, prompting the singer to to post a video of herself on TikTok using it. She asked in the caption: “who actually is this?” and noted in a reply to a comment “it's not meeeee” when fans asked if she sang on the track or if it was AI. (The video has since been deleted). Around that time, HAVEN. jumped in, adding #jorjasmith to a now-deleted social post about the song, according to a member of their team. “It was more so just embracing that it does sound like her,” a spokesperson for HAVEN. said. “It became an organic trend.”


	That's when questions started circulating about the origins of HAVEN.'s viral track — and whether or not it was an unauthorized AI deepfake of Smith's voice. Ultimately, the song was released in late October by Isekai Records, Broke Records and AAO Records, and it continued to amass major listenership — so much so that it quickly reached #11 on the U.S. Spotify chart and #25 on Spotify globally. Meanwhile videos using the song kept going viral on social media, including one in which the rapper Offset apparently played the song during a Boiler Room DJ set, with the video overlaid with text that said, “Unreleased Jorja Smith.” (The song was not actually used during Offset's recent Boiler Room set.)


	Just as the song was taking off, it was taken down from streaming services. The Orchard — to whom Smith is signed — as well as the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and International Federation of the Phonograph Industry (IFPI), issued dozens of takedown notices for “I Run” upon its official release, according to screenshots of the notices, alleging various issues with the song, including that the song “misrepresents” another artist and that it constitutes copyright infringement.


	As a result of the dispute, the song has also been withheld from the Billboard charts, including the Billboard Hot 100, on which some chart prognosticators had predicted it would debut this week. Billboard reserves the right to withhold or remove titles from appearing on the charts that are known to be involved in active legal disputes related to copyright infringement that may extend to the deletion of such content on digital service providers.


	Broke Records tells Billboard that it filed dozens of counter-notices, asserting HAVEN.'s ownership of the song and noting that no lawsuit has been filed against them to date in association with the song. (The Orchard declined to comment.)


	Donaghue and Walker maintain that they wrote and produced the song in ProTools, sharing screenshots and videos of the ProTools session files and stems with Billboard. They admit, however, that “AI-assisted vocal processing” was used to “transform solely [their] voice” in the song. Specifically, they say they used AI music generator Suno to turn Walker's voice into that of a woman's — without referencing Smith. According to Suno prompts shared with Billboard, the producers wrote into the model a prompt that included, among other requests, “soulful vocal samples” to get the voice they ultimately used on the song.


	“It's been such an honor to see the love and support for ‘I Run' these past few weeks,” HAVEN. said in a statement to Billboard. “What started as something fun and experimental between two producers and music-lovers ended up taking the internet by storm. I'm aware that AI has become part of that storm. It shouldn't be any secret that I used AI-assisted vocal processing to transform solely my voice for ‘I Run.' As a songwriter and producer I enjoy using new tools, techniques and staying on the cutting edge of what's happening. To set the record straight, the artists behind HAVEN. are real and human, and all we want to do is make great music for other humans.”


	Suno does not allow users to request specific artist or song names. But the company is currently in the midst of a blockbuster lawsuit with the three major music companies — Sony, Universal and Warner — over allegations of widespread copyright infringement of the majors' sound recordings during the AI training process. Given Smith is signed to The Orchard, a Sony Music-owned distributor, it is possible her sound recordings were used in Suno's training. According to the lawsuit and to AI music expert Ed Newton-Rex in an article for Music Business Worldwide, users can find savvy or accidental ways to prompt Suno into providing results that seem to contain recognizable pieces of intellectual property from artists like ABBA, James Brown, Michael Buble and more.


	The takedowns list a variety of reasons for the request for removal, according to emails obtained by Billboard, including one from Spotify that says, “We have received a complaint that your content infringes the sound recording rights of a third party. While this claim is under investigation, the content has been removed.” Another from Spotify says the content “violates exclusive rights.” A third reads, “Spotify may remove content that misrepresents a track as originating from or featuring an artist or that uses an artist's name in a misleading way.” One from TikTok also lists the reason why the track is muted as “it contains unauthorized copyrighted music.”


	“Sound recording copyrights are not going to protect her voice if the voice sounded like her. There would have to be a sample of her sound recordings,” says Theresa Weisenberger, lawyer and co-lead at BakerHostetler's AI practice, adding that voices are only protected by publicity rights — the legal right that varies state-to-state in the U.S. which protects one's name, image and likeness from exploitation. 


	Historically, these rights have been mostly limited to commercial contexts, like misleading endorsements. The singer Bette Midler once famously sued the Ford Motor Co. over ads featuring a Midler impersonator who was hired by the company. Amid the boom in AI and deepfakes, however, lawmakers in Tennessee passed a new law, called the ELVIS Act, to dramatically expand the right to stop voice cloning in any context. And federally, lawmakers are currently considering a similar law, the NO FAKES Act, that would do the same thing nationally.


	“I think this ought to be a wake up call for people to look at the status of the NO FAKES Act and to deal with how long it will take to get that moving and into a national uniform law,” adds Kenneth Anderson, an attorney at Rimon Law who recently advised his client, Ben Folds, though a deepfake situation. “We have a problem that is rapidly overtaking the music industry. It's rampant and it's increasing.”


	To fight the takedowns, HAVEN.'s labels started reuploading the song over and over, leading to a seemingly endless game of whack-a-mole for both sides. The impact on “I Run” became even more pronounced when the song did not appear on The Official Charts in the U.K. or the Billboard charts.


	“Once that counter notice is filed and then a lawsuit is not filed, a platform is free to put the song back up if they want to,” explains Weisenberger. “But the fact that platforms aren't doing that might speak to the PR issue this song causes.”


	For Broke, an indie record label founded in 2023, “I Run” was gearing up to be their (and HAVEN.'s) biggest hit yet, and its founders tell Billboard they feel the song is being discriminated against by bigger industry players. “HAVEN., an independent producer-songwriter who created a global breakout hit on his own, is the one being fully de-platformed through a sophisticated campaign by a major label,” the label said in a statement to Billboard. “It is difficult to imagine this recording, if released by a major label, being treated in the same way as HAVEN.”


	The song has become a lightning rod for conversations around generative AI use in the creation of popular music. To date, some music streaming services still do not have AI-specific policies in place, and those that do, like Deezer and SoundCloud, tend to only penalize fully AI-generated works, not something like “I Run,” which contains significant human input. As Billboard reported in 2023, however, an increasing number of platforms have broadened the ability of rightholders to issue takedowns when publicity rights — the right to one's name image likeness and voice — are violated, due to the rise of AI-generated deepfakes. This is done on a voluntary basis and is not required by law.


	Spotify added to these publicity rights protections just last month when it announced that it was strengthening its policies against negative uses of AI. This included increased protections around impersonation, and according to a source close to the situation, the platform's impersonation rules did come into play with the takedowns for HAVEN.'s track specifically. The source adds that Spotify tends to side with the party that feels they have been deepfaked. (Spotify declined to comment.)


	Now, HAVEN. is gearing up to release a re-recording of the song, featuring the vocals of a singer named Kaitlin Aragon. She was discovered by the team after posting a TikTok video, covering “I Run” which sounds fairly similar to the original. The hope is, for HAVEN.'s team, that they can recapture the same buzz as they achieved with the last version of the song and restart HAVEN.'s career — but this time, with human vocals.

The Duchess has arrived.

Meghan Markle's staff announces the royal before she enters a room — even if there are only two guests.

During an interview with Harper's Bazaar, writer Kaitlyn Greenidge said she and the Duchess of Sussex entered a New York City “grand” brownstone that belonged to one of Markle's friends.

“When I enter, the house manager announces, ‘Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,' even though we appear to be the only other two people in the house,” Greenidge wrote.

Elsewhere in the interview, Greenidge also said that someone announced Markle when she arrived at the La Brea Tar Pits, an active fossil-dig site and natural-history museum in Los Angeles, to meet with a group of girls from a local STEM school.

“A golf cart pulls up, the gravel crunching beneath its tires. ‘The Duchess of Sussex,' someone in the scrum announces,” Greenidge wrote.

“Meghan descends, dressed in wide-leg trousers, a silk blouse, and a small pair of pavé-diamond studs by the Ukrainian brand Guzema,” she added.

“They were a gift from her husband, Prince Harry, picked up on a recent trip to Kyiv with his Invictus Games Foundation.”

Elsewhere in the interview, Markle opened up about giving herself “grace” when it comes to mistakes.

“You learn not to do it again,” she shared. “If it all goes swimmingly, you don't learn from it. If you don't learn anything, you're not going to grow.”

Harry, 41, and Markle, 44, tied the knot in May 2018 and quit their royal duties two years later.

The couple, who have welcomed son Prince Archie, 6, and daughter Princess Lilibet, 4, now reside in a $14 million mansion in Montecito, Calif.

Though Markle and the Duke of Sussex left the royal family, they and their children were allowed to keep their titles.

In a March interview with People, the “Suits” alum said the Sussex name held a deeper significance since she became a mother.

“I love that that is something that Archie, Lili, [Harry] and I all have together. It means a lot to me,” she said of her family.

“I think as the kids get older, they're so excited about, ‘Oh my gosh, Mama and Papa, how did you meet?'” Markle continued. 

“I think that will come with time as they get older, but for right now a huge part of our love story is that we share the name Sussex.”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	Ahead of the January 18 premiere of HBO‘s A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, the Game of Thrones prequel has been renewed for a second season to debut in 2027. The announcement was made by Casey Bloys, Chairman and CEO, HBO and HBO Max Content, at the network's press presentation Thursday morning in New York. 


	The adaptation of George R.R. Martin's Dunk and Egg novellas was originally slated to premiere in late 2025; the debut was subsequently delayed to January 2026. The slight shift would keep the series out of the HBO-Sky deal, which is coming to an end, and available for the launch of HBO Max in the UK and Ireland.

			Watch on Deadline		







A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms will debut almost three years after the series was greenlighted in April 2023. The second season will cut the gap roughly in half with a 2027 debut.


	The nature of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms allows for a quicker turnaround vs. fellow prequel House of the Dragon, which releases a new season every 2 years. A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms also produces shorter seasons consisting of six half-hour episodes each vs 8-10 hourlong episodes a season for HoD.

	HBO‘s Head of Drama Series and Films Francesca Orsi told Deadline in February that A Knight of Seven Kingdoms is done on a smaller, more “intimate” scale than the other Game of Thrones series. She also confirmed that the show is still on track for a three-season run spanning Martin's three Dunk and Egg books.“You're going be so impressed by Peter Claffey and Dexter Sol Ansell as Dunk and Egg, the two leads,” she said at the time. “So much so that we're already planning on how do we build this for the three seasons in total.”

A Knight of Seven Kingdoms stars Claffey as Ser Duncan “Dunk” the Tall, Ansell as Egg, Daniel Ings, Bertie Carvel, Danny Webb, Sam Spruell, Shaun Thomas, Finn Bennett, Edward Ashley, Tanzyn Crawford, Henry Ashton, Youssef Kerkour, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor and Daniel Monks. Martin and Ira Parker are co-creators/executive produces, with the latter serving as showrunner. Sarah Bradshaw, Owen Harris, Ryan Condal and Vince Gerardis also executive produce; Owen Harris and Sarah Adina Smith direct. 


	Set a century before the events of Game of Thrones and 72 years after House of the Dragon, A Knight of Seven Kingdom follows two unlikely heroes wandering Westeros … a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall (Claffey), and his diminutive squire, Egg (Ansell) … Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends. (You can watch a trailer below, which shows Martin's ambition for the series to feature “the best jousting sequences that were ever done on film.”)

	Along with the A Knight of Seven Kingdom renewal, HBO on Thursday also gave an early Season 4 pickup to House of the Dragon to premiere in 2028. Both series will air on HBO and be available to stream on HBO Max.


	“We are thrilled to be able to deliver new seasons of these two series for the next three years, for the legion of fans of the Game of Thrones universe,” Orsi said. “Together, House of the Dragon and A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms reveal just how expansive and richly imagined George R. R. Martin's universe continues to be. In January, I think audiences will be delighted by the inspiring underdog tale of Dunk and Egg that George and Ira Parker have captured so beautifully. And this summer, House of the Dragon is set to ignite once again with some of its most epic battles yet.”

As “The Real Housewives of Orange County” prepares to celebrate its 20th season, Bravo fans are buzzing about which familiar faces — and potential new ones — will shape the milestone year.

According to a tip sent to Bravo and Cocktails, Vicki Gunvalson is set to join Tamra Judge, Heather Dubrow, Shannon Beador, Gina Kirschenheiter, and Jennifer Pedranti as full-time cast members in season 20. Emily Simpson, Katie Ginella, and Gretchen Rossi are still “on the bubble,” with their returns being evaluated based on storyline direction and chemistry.

The tip also claims Evolution Media is interested in having Rossi return — which would explain the recent effort to help her clean up a social-media scandal storyline — but producers remain uncertain whether she could realistically film alongside Judge after their long-running tension. In addition to determining which veterans will be full-time Housewives, the production team is seeking to introduce one brand-new cast member for the upcoming season.

Several familiar alumni — including Jeana Keough, Jo De La Rosa, Lauri Peterson, Kimberly Bryant, and Alexis Bellino — are reportedly expected to appear in special guest scenes throughout season 20.

Gunvalson's return became official during BravoCon 2025, when Andy Cohen surprised her onstage by officially giving her orange back.

“Yes!” she exclaimed as the crowd erupted. “I love you guys out there. I love Bravo. It's been a great ride.”

Judge — recently back on good terms with Gunvalson — celebrated the moment, signaling fresh potential for a Tres Amigas revival with Beador.

But not all former cast relationships are on the mend. Speaking to Us Weekly at BravoCon, Judge said she sees no path forward with Rossi.

“Unfortunately, no,” Judge said. “She wants to blame everybody for things that she does. She's accused me of things I've never done. I tried my hardest to move forward. She came in and could not move on.”

Meanwhile, Ginella offered a candid look at her own standing with the cast during an Entertainment Tonight interview. Calling BravoCon a “baptism by fire,” Ginella said she's open to reconciliation but uncertain whether the rest of the group feels the same.

“It doesn't seem, right now, that they're open to that,” she admitted. Still, she noted her friendships with Judge and Gunvalson give her hope as season 20 approaches.

I was hoping that neurotic Vicki would never return.
I'm so pissed that Tamrat is back.  How many times is she going to cry wolf?
I never want to see Alexis, Jeana Keough or Joe de la Rosa return.
I've watched this show since day one but due to Tamrat being allowed to return I think I'm done.  Andy & Bravo allowing the bullying from that sewer rat is mind blowing.
Anyone else notice how different Shannon looks in this picture?   I think she looks better here 🤔

I agree – Tamrat needs to go!  I could do without Emily and Gina as well.

The telcom giant becomes the latest to shed thousands of staff, but also sets up a training program for employees it is handing pink slips to. 


							By 

	Erik Hayden


Executive Editor, Business


	If this is the year of publicly-traded companies signaling to Wall Street that they're going to do more with less, in preparation for an AI-driven economy, add Verizon to the list of giants cutting a substantial number of jobs in a pivot. 


	The company, newly led by former PayPal mogul Dan Schulman, said Thursday that it is reducing its workforce by 13,000 employees and cutting its outsourced and outside labor expenses. As of the end of Dec. 2024, Verizon had 99,600 full-time staffers, some 88 percent of them are based in the U.S.

	The cuts are not unusual: Amazon revealed it was slashing 14,000 jobs, Microsoft has exited 15,000 employees, Paramount's new ownership is cutting roughly 2,000 roles and many other blue-chip companies have seen a thousand-plus staffers cut this year. CEOs have implied that they're reshaping reshaping workforces to compete in the AI age — whether that's the reason for the timing of the cuts has been debated.


	One interesting detail in Verizon's Nov. 20 announcement is the unveiling of a $20 million program for those 13,000 cut employees in “reskilling” (i.e. retraining) the staffers that are being exited, in hopes of finding them new roles at other companies.


	“To help our people prepare for their future, we have established a $20 million Reskilling and Career Transition Fund for employees departing Verizon,” Schulman wrote in a public memo. “This fund will focus on skill development, digital training and job placement to help our people take their next steps. Verizon is the first company to set up a fund to specifically focus on the opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI. It is my intent to also work with other companies and the public sector to address the opportunities and challenges in a world where technology will impact all of us.”

	











	One employee that was recently exited at the telcom giant was CEO Hans Vestberg, who had led the company for eight years and was bumped from the role on Oct. 6. During Vestberg's tenure he effectively shuffled Verizon out of the media business, selling Yahoo and AOL to private equity giant Apollo for $5 billion. He'll stay on as an advisor through next October. 


	During Schulman's first earnings call as CEO on October 29, he candidly set expectations for a major shake-up. “When I look at our performance objectively, Verizon is clearly falling short of our potential,” the exec told analysts. 


	“For the past few years, our financial growth has relied too heavily on price increases, a strategic approach that relies too much on price without subscriber growth is not a sustainable strategy,” Schulman added. “This cannot continue, and there is no question that meaningful change is needed.”


	The new CEO thinks AI will reverse that trend. “I am a strong believer in the growing power and resulting opportunities created by AI,” he said on the call. “We have barely scratched the surface of how AI-powered innovation can transform our customer experience. I intend to use AI as a key tool to simplify offers, improve the customer experience and reduce churn through smart, consistent and more personalized marketing and offers.”


	Year-to-date Verizon stock has been mostly flat, as of Nov. 20 it's trading at $40.78 a share and is up about 1 percent for the year.

The president took to his social media platform to renew his feud with the ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' host after an Epstein-focused monologue.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	U.S. President Donald Trump has renewed his beef with late night show host Jimmy Kimmel with a call for ABC to take him off the air, again.


	“Why does ABC Fake News keep Jimmy Kimmel, a man with NO TALENT and VERY POOR TELEVISION RATINGS, on the air? Why do the TV Syndicates put up with it? Also, totally biased coverage. Get the bum off the air!!!” Trump wrote late Wednesday night on his Truth Social platform.




	His social media post followed Kimmel in a late night show monologue suggesting Trump “loses his mind” every time he is asked why he hadn't released the so-called Jeffrey Epstein files. Asking for Kimmel to be yanked also comes two days after Trump called for ABC's broadcast license to be revoked after an ABC News reporter asked again why he had chosen not to release the government's files on the late convicted sex offender Epstein.

	That was followed by successful votes on Capitol Hill to get all government Epstein files released and Trump in a reversal signing the legislation when it came to his desk at the White House. Reigniting the feud with Kimmel also followed Disney's ABC deciding to temporarily preempt its marquee late night show in September following monologue comments he made in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination.


	Kimmel was soon back on the airwaves, however. His benching came in the wake of monologue jokes referencing MAGA Republicans scrambling to distance their politics from the ideologies of conservative pundit Kirk's alleged shooter Tyler Robinson.


	The remarks were interpreted by many on the right as an incorrect classification of Robinson's beliefs and a direct or indirect placement of blame for Kirk's murder on extreme-right politics. Kimmel made an emotional return to hosting his late night show, before getting back to his normal programming that routinely mocks Trump during opening monologues.

A documentary about iconic rabble-rousing journalist Seymour Hersh makes for an intriguing enough premise, but Laura Poitras and Mark Obenhaus' lauded “Cover-Up” takes that promise and goes much further, using Hersh's own reporting to frame a damning look at the enduring moral crimes of America itself.

Per its official logline: “‘Cover-Up‘ is a political thriller that traces the explosive career of Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Seymour Hersh. Urgent and deeply reported, ‘Cover-Up' is both a portrait of a relentless journalist and an indictment of institutional violence — revealing a cycle of impunity in the U.S. military and intelligence agencies. Drawing on exclusive access to Hersh's notes, and interweaving primary documents and archival footage, ‘Cover-Up' captures the power and process of investigative journalism.”

Poitras and Obenhaus' film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival and went on to play Telluride, TIFF, NYFF, London, and IDFA. It's already been nominated for a variety of awards, including from the IDA Documentary Awards, the Critics Choice Documentary Awards, and the Cinema Eye Honors.

 










In his glowing review out of Venice, IndieWire's David Ehrlich wrote, “Poitras (‘Citizenfour,' ‘All the Beauty and the Bloodshed'), like Hersh, has made a career of unpacking the kind of civil violations and moral atrocities that would have been committed with impunity if not for a dedicated effort to bring the truth to light. In Hersh, whose ongoing body of work represents a chronology of American malfeasance that spans from the Vietnam War to the Gaza genocide, she and her co-director Mark Obenhaus have found the perfect opportunity to step back and see the big picture — to make one film that outlines a historic cycle of obfuscation rather than 10 films that grapple with each of these different subjects in a vacuum.”

Ehrlich also made sure to note that the film, while remarkable as an overarching look at some of the stories Hersh has covered during his career, also works as a film about Hersh himself. Ehrlich wrote, “There's no doubt that Poitras and Obenhaus see Hersh as a hero, but the nature of their work — and of his — refuses to let ‘Cover-Up' tip into hagiography. Poitras has been guilty of presenting her subjects in an overly beatific light in the past … but her latest film is sure to highlight the most egregious missteps of Hersh's career.”

 










In short, it's a must-see for anyone who loves documentary films and the hard truths they can zero in on so fixedly. “Cover-Up” will be released in select theaters in December, with a streaming release on Netflix to follow on Friday, December 26. Check out the film's first trailer below.

	The technical term is an ass-kicking. 


	Democrats came roaring back in the 2025 off-year elections, flipping seats from governor to positions in state and county legislatures, with the GOP failing to win any real pick-ups under the weight of Donald Trump's plummeting popularity.


	Gone is the talk of Trump's single-handed domination of our politics and the futility of resistance. American elections are functioning and Trump's second honeymoon is over, as prices continue to rise and the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein haunts the president and his allies.


	But Democrats need to learn the lessons from their big November night. Because whatever sugar high they may be feeling will soon collide with the fact that their party's approval rating is still stubbornly lower than Trump's, according to multiple polls compiled by CNN. 


	Much of the media focus is on the extraordinary elevation of the 34-year old Democratic Socialist Assemblyman Zorhan Mamdani to the New York mayoralty after polling at one percent a year ago. But if you dig into the data you'll see that over indexing his win risks the danger of misreading the mandate. That reality check should temper any temptation among Democrats to lurch to the far left.

	











	Over in New Jersey and Virginia, Governors-elect Mikie Sherril and Abigail Spanberger won victories, both with 57 percent of the vote, in states that often elect Republican governors. Democrats made gains in gains in virtually every county compared with last year's presidential election. Yes, they benefited from backlash against Trump, but crucially they made gains among middle-class moderates in the suburbs, and even improved margins in rural areas. That's a formula that can propel Democrats to victory in the midterms and beyond. 

	











	Here's the key stat to keep in mind: Mamdani won barely 50 percent of the vote in a city that's six to one Democrat. When all the votes are counted, he could well dip below majority support – which is academic to the extent that his opposition was split between red beret Republican Curtis Sliwa and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, running half-heartedly as an independent. But for the Democratic nominee to barely break 50 percent in NYC is not a massive mandate.

	Yes, Mandami succeeded in inspiring a young liberal base. Yes, he ran a brilliant and simple campaign. More than a million people turned out to support him. His campaign message was relentlessly focused on affordability and personal authenticity expressed through compelling short form digital videos on social media.


	Those are clear lessons that Democrats across the spectrum can learn from. In fact, Governors-elect Sherril and Spanberger also focused their messages almost exclusively on affordability and the economy. They refused to get drawn into divisive culture war debates.


	They also share a broad political profile which can help Democrats expand their appeal nationally. Both women were decidedly centrist members of Congress with national security street cred: Sherril was a former Navy helicopter pilot and Spanberger was a former CIA analyst.


	In contrast, Mamdani's profile is less likely to help win swing districts and swing states. He has never worked in the private sector and has no record of military service or executive experience – which is a practical challenge for managing a $117 billion budget.


	While he is now a national hero to the Bernie Bros, Mamdani is already a punching bag for national Republicans. As my friend, New York 1 anchor Errol Louis has joked: Mamdani is everything the Tea Party accused Barack Obama of being: born in Africa; a Muslim and a socialist. None of that, of course, excuses race-baiting or fear-mongering from Republicans.

	Part of the genius of Mamdani's campaign is that he may have been an avatar for identity politics, but he never played that card hard. While he resisted criticizing policies or people to his left (only half-heartedly distancing himself from calls to “globalize the intifada” and his own past tweets calling to defund the police), Mamdani offered a relentlessly upbeat demeanor and famously smiling face that inspired hope in many at a time when that is in short supply. His success was a prime example of Maya Angelou's admonition that people might not remember what you said but they remember how you made them feel.

	











	That's exactly why the contrast with his victory night speech and those offered up by Spanberger and Sherill was so stark.


	Spanberger called for “pragmatism over partisanship” in a state that has suffered under Trumpism's right-wing policies. But Mamdani met his triumphant moment not with a call to unity in a divided city but something close to a socialist manifesto, name checking Eugene Debs in the opening paragraphs, slamming Trump and Cuomo, and generally promising a new ideological order.


	That's clearly what he believes his mandate to be. But the job of mayor is effective management – it is essentially a non-ideological problem-solving position. As his legendary predecessor Fiorello LaGuardia once said, “There is no Democrat, Republican, or Socialist way to sweep the streets.” When it comes to governing, charisma is important, but competence is essential. 


	After the Bloomberg years, New York's last two mayors have left office in the doghouse with voters, with Bill de Blasio barely showing up for work and Eric Adams beset by a steady stream of corruption allegations from his crony circle. 


	We are living in an era of extremes. Donald Trump's team has tried to normalize the idea that any victory — no matter how narrow — is a mandate to impose their extreme ideological vision on the nation, believing that might makes right.


	To win the country, not just New York City, Democrats need to build a popular, durable majority based on something more than opposition to Trump — which is necessary but not sufficient. Democrats have correctly if belatedly focused on the issue of affordability. The basic social contract which says if you work hard and play by the rules you'll get ahead has been broken, and that righteous frustration is fueling populist fire.

	But that passion needs to be channeled in a constructive direction or it will burn the whole house down. Democrats should not defend a broken status quo but they need to offer reforms in ways that attract more people than they alienate — focusing on rebuilding the middle class and the middle of our politics while ditching the culture war obsessions that drag them down. Because Donald Trump has decided to divide in order to conquer, Democrats have an additional obligation to try and unite.


	This month's election results show that Democrats can win big in swing districts, kicking out candidates who suck up to Trump and excuse his unhinged excesses. But victories in New York City are not a model for winning in rural and purple America. Misreading Democratic mandates and thinking one size fits all  plays into Republican hands, and will only perpetuate the polarization afflicting our nation.

Charli XCX‘s cinephilia has been well documented in recent years, from her viral Letterboxd reviews to her Coachella set that handed the “Brat Summer” baton to some of her favorite indie directors releasing films in 2025. And while she has made several appearances this year in films like “100 Nights of Hero,” “Sacrifice,” and “Erupcja,” 2026 is shaping up to be the year that sees her film career ascend into the stratosphere. In addition to composing songs and releasing a companion album for Emerald Fennel's “Wuthering Heights,” the pop star is set to star in “The Moment,” a new A24 music industry satire based on her own original idea.

“The Moment” marks the feature directorial debut of Aidan Zamiri, a veteran music video and commercial director behind Charli XCX's “360” video and Billie Eilish's video for “Birds of a Feather.” He also directed Timothée Chalamet in a recent commercial for CashApp. Zamiri co-wrote the script with Bertie Brandes, and the cast includes Rosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant, Jamie Demetriou, Hailey Benton Gates, Isaac Powell, Alexander Skarsgård, and Rachel Sennott.

An official synopsis for “The Moment” reads: “A rising pop star navigates the complexities of fame and industry pressure while preparing for her arena tour debut.”

While the film is not explicitly autobiographical, Charli XCX has hinted that its music industry satire reflects her own experiences. “It's fiction, but it's the realest depiction of the music industry that I've ever seen,” she said in an October interview with Vanity Fair.

Music for the film will come from British producer A. G. Cook, who worked on several of the most popular tracks on “Brat” including “Apple,” “Spring Breakers,” and “Von Dutch.” Cook is no stranger to the film world either, having contributed music to the Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri-led comedy “Bottoms.”

Other upcoming projects on Charli XCX's film docket include Gregg Araki's “I Want Your Sex,” which also stars Olivia Wilde, Cooper Hoffman, and Chase Sui Wonders; and an untitled collaboration with “Audition” director Takashi Miike. 

An A24 release, “The Moment” opens in theaters everywhere on Friday, January 30. Watch the teaser below.

Charli XCX stars as herself in the first trailer for the singer's upcoming film The Moment, a movie that goes behind-the-scenes of Brat Summer while simultaneously serving as metafiction about the music industry.


	The A24 film was directed by Aidan Zamiri and “based on an original idea” by XCX. A previous logline teased that The Moment was about “a rising pop star navigates the complexities of fame and industry pressure while preparing for her arena tour debut,” and with the first trailer, it's revealed the “rising pop star” in question is Charli XCX herself.


	As the preview shows, The Moment combines real-life moments from the Brat tour — XCX's stop to The Late Show, concert footage, etc. — with scripted material to form the narrative. “It's fiction, but it's the realest depiction of the music industry that I've ever seen,” XCX previously said of the film, adding that it was “not a tour documentary or a concert film in any way.”

	











	The trailer also hints at some of the film's all-star cast with Rachel Sennott, Alexander Skarsgaard, and Kylie Jenner making quick cameos; the film will also feature Kate Berlant, Rosanna Arquette, Hailey Benton Gates, Jamie Demetriou, and others in XCX's orbit, like Shygirl and A.G. Cook, who's handling of The Moment's music.

The Moment arrives in theaters on January 30, 2026.


	2026 is shaping up to be a big year on the big screen for XCX, who has also crafted an album's worth of music for the upcoming Wuthering Heights adaptation. The singer is also set to star in Dakota Johnson's directorial debut, as well as Gregg Araki's I Want Your Sex, Cathy Yan's The Gallerist and Daniel Goldhaber's take on Faces of Death.

	If you love the Beatles, you definitely want to hear this new “Baby I'm a Rich Man,” from the superb new collection Anthology 4. It's a six-minute take from May 1967, unheard until now, with the lads hard at work in Abbey Road. John calls out to their loyal roadie Mal Evans, “We'd like some Cokes, Mal.” Paul adds, “And if you've got some cannabis resin!” That sounds good to John. “Yeah,” he says. “If you've got cannabis, send it in!” 


	They know the tapes are rolling, but they don't care. They're on top of the world and they know it.  Paul quips, “We've got that taped for the High Court tomorrow.” (This recording session happens to be the day after Mick Jagger and Keith Richards got dragged into court for their recent drug bust. Cheeky lads, these.) John declares, “All right, let's hear some rhythm and soul from London now!” Then they rip into “Baby I'm a Rich Man” — not even one of their most famous 1967 songs, just another day of genius for this crew, thriving on a four-way energy nobody else can reach. It's such a jolt to hear it — how passionately these boys love being the Beatles. 

	











Anthology 4 is a real treasure trove for fans. It's the companion album to the long-awaited new edition of the ultimate Beatles documentary. The original Anthology blew up into a global sensation when it debuted in November 1995, a TV miniseries plus three albums and a book. It's the full Fab Four story, in the words of the boys who lived it out: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Anthology is finally getting its new version, restored and expanded, debuting on Disney+ on November 26. It's got an emotionally powerful new Episode Nine, focusing on footage of the three surviving Beatles coming together in 1994 and 1995. 

	











	The Anthology albums were packed with unreleased tunes, outtakes, demos, and studio banter. Giles Martin, son and heir to original producer George Martin, has remastered the Nineties volumes, but he's also curated the new Anthology 4. The Anthology Collection has 191 tracks in all, available for download and streaming, as well as deluxe box sets with 12 vinyl LPs or 8 CDs. Anthology 4 is separately available as a stand-alone box, either triple-vinyl or 2 CDs.

Anthology 4 has 13 previously unreleased takes, mostly from the 1964-1965 period, where you hear them working out early songs like “Tell Me Why,” “Nowhere Man,” and “Every Little Thing.” It also gathers 23 tracks from previous archival editions, mostly in the past decade. But Anthology 4 weaves all the material together into a jubilant story of the band in full creative frenzy. As John quips at the end of this previously unheard take of “Hey Bulldog,” they're “veering between yer blues and yer comedy.”


	When the original Anthology albums dropped, everybody figured this was the final word on the Beatles — but it turned out the vaults were full of archival treasures that would take decades to emerge. Two of the Anthology 4 songs, “I Saw Her Standing There” and “Money (That's What I Want),” came out on The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963, an oddity released for just a few hours in 2013 to extend the European copyright.


	Most of these tracks come from the Special Editions that have been redefining the Beatles legacy ever since 2017, when the Sgt. Pepper box blew minds, packed with more goodies than even the most hardcore Fabological obsessives could have imagined. There's outtakes of “Got To Get You Into My Life” from the Revolver box, “Here Comes the Sun” from Abbey Road, “Don't Let Me Down” from the Apple rooftop. The topper is “Good Night,” from the 2018 White Album edition, with all four Beatles harmonizing — a stunning performance that somehow sat in the vaults for 50 years.

	But the heart of Anthology 4 is the previously unheard material. There's a revelatory first take of “In My Life,” with John thinking the song out loud, screwing up his courage, with Paul's harmony and Ringo's drums providing the brotherly support he needs. He never sounded more naked. “I've Just Seen A Face” is all madcap comic energy, with John joking about Fifties skiffle pioneer Lonnie Donegan, saying, “Lonnie's gonna be sorry he didn't sing this one.” They break up laughing, as they keep doing all over Anthology 4, and it's a contagious sound — if you savor the sound of these lads laughing at themselves, this album has their highest mirth-per-minute ratio.

	











	There's an amazing early take of “This Boy,” known only to proud owners of the 1995 “Free As a Bird” CD single, which means practically nobody. As it begins, John sneers, “Get that bloody mic out of the way.” But it's breathtaking to hear him leap into the bridge and wail “Oh myyyyy” — there's no holding back, only the most intense emotional urgency. John kept putting down “This Boy” for the rest of his life, dismissing as an early throwaway — but he was probably just threatened by how vulnerable he let himself sound. 


	“Every Little Thing” is a loose studio romp, which falls apart when Paul confesses, “I burped.” There's also a BBC rehearsal of “All You Need Is Love” with comic narration (“Queen Margaret in a low-feathered nightgown”). Ringo belts a fantastic “Matchbox,” sounding live and raw, without the bizarrely overdone reverb from the botched official version, busting out his “all right George” for the guitar solo.


	One of the best moments is the terminally underrated “I Need You,” a George Harrison tune from Help! It's faster and friskier than the final version, bristling with Buddy Holly energy, but you can hear how nervous he is. In the final minute, the rest of the band is snickering at him, yet the Quiet One perseveres and never breaks. (In the final credits of the Help! movie, he keeps repeating his songwriting credit out loud: “‘I Need You' by George Harrison!” It wasn't easy being George.) It isn't hard to hear the link between this “I Need You” and the solemn focus he brought to “Isn't It A Pity” or “Behind that Locked Door,” five chaotic years later.


	But the emotional highlight here is “If I Fell.” John guides himself into the song, as if he's not sure how earnest he dares to get, while Ringo clicks loudly behind him. This session is February 1964, right when the Beatlemania explosion is going global — just a couple weeks after their American conquest on The Ed Sullivan Show. But they're already determined to leave it behind, pushing on with this weirdly constructed ballad, with more chord changes than they'd ever crammed into one tune. The kidding and laughing is all gone as soon as the song begins — John is laser-focused on telling his story, his voice deadly serious, lifted by those hair-raising Paul harmonies. “If I Fell” is a song you've heard a million times, but hearing this version makes you marvel that it ever happened.

	











	The Anthology project inspired the three surviving Beatles, Paul, George, and Ringo, to reunite in the studio and rescue some unfinished John songs, from home cassette demos provided by Yoko Ono. “Free as a Bird” and “Real Love,” both Nineties singles, are here, newly remixed by producer Jeff Lynne. Anthology 4 ends fittingly with “Now and Then,” a John demo the lads tried at the 1994 sessions, but left unfinished.  In the new Episode Nine, Paul muses, “It might not go away, that one.” He was right — decades later, he returned to his old friend's song, until it became the final Beatles single in 2023.

	George Harrison tells a great story in the new episode about the Beatles working late nights at Abbey Road. “Some of the people here — the engineer, for instance — would always be trying to go home at 5:30,” he says in mock horror. “And we'd all be trying to make history.” So Mal Evans brewed a special pot of tea for the studio crew. “We doused the tea with uppers,” George recalls. “‘Can we go home now?' No, you can't, bastard — have a cup of tea.” Ringo adds, “George [Martin] hasn't come down yet.”


	The entire Anthology Collection bristles with that kind of nonstop restless creative spirit — the raw Hamburg punk rock of Volume One, the trippy studio experiments of Volume Two, the mature world-weary grit of Volume Three. There's a comic moment in the new Episode Nine where George and Ringo mock Paul for being the taskmaster in the band, always hustling the others into the studio. As Ringo quips, “We could sit in the garden longer than you.” Paul has to plead guilty. “I was the work fiend,” he admits. “I like the Beatles. I like to work with the Beatles. I'm not ashamed of that. It's what I love in life, all that making music.” You can hear that love loud and clear with all four boys on Anthology.

“Real Housewives of Orange County” alum Kelly Dodd is speaking out in Meghan King's defense.

The 50-year-old took to TikTok on Thursday to defend her former co-star after the latter lost custody of her kids to her ex Jim Edmonds.

“I just got off the phone with Meghan King Edmonds, and, she said that she gave one of her other twins Hayes some Ritalin [used to treat ADHD] and it made her a ‘dangerous mother,'” Dodd alleged in her video, which was shot from her kitchen.

King shares daughter, Aspen, 8, and twins, Hart and Hayes, 7, with Edmonds. 

While Dodd and King have “had a lot of differences and a lot of fights” over the years, she “know[s] for a fact [King is] a good mother.”

Dodd explained, “She stayed at my house … when she got her boobs and nose done — and I can tell you: she loves those babies, she loves those kids.”

She went on to call King, 41, an “excellent” parent before adding that she prays her fellow Bravolebrity “gets her babies back.”

Dodd then urged her fans to pray for King and her family, adding, “Those boys and that daughter need their mom, they need their mother. It's terrible what's going on right now — all we can do is pray for Meghan.”

Page Six has reached out to King's reps for comment, but did not receive any at the time of publication.

On Wednesday, a source told Us Weekly that King lost custody of her three children and was granted supervised visitation following an investigation from Child Protective Services.

The insider noted the arrangement is temporary, with a hearing in December to determine whether it will become permanent.

The investigation was allegedly prompted when a school employee filed a report with CPS about King.

King and Edmonds, 55, welcomed their three children throughout their five-year marriage.

The former couple got married in 2014, but they ultimately split in 2019 after the former MLB star was caught sending lewd messages to another woman. 

Following their divorce, the two agreed to share custody of their children.

However, things soured in May when Jim's now-wife, Kortnie Edmonds, called the cops to complain that King had trespassed on their property after they had made arrangements to drop off her stepdaughter's dress.

According to a police report obtained by PageSix, “Meghan refused to hand Kortnie the dress and ‘pulled away and asked to speak to' [her daughter].”

After being told that Jim and Aspen were at a baseball game, King allegedly yelled for her daughter from inside the house.

Although the former Bravolebrity eventually left the home, she was later confronted by Frontenac Police.

However, no charges were pressed against King, with her rep claiming that the situation had been “mischaracterized.”

“Meghan briefly called to her daughter from the doorway, never stepped inside, had the door slammed in her face, and calmly left her belongings on the porch. Upon leaving, she was unexpectedly blocked by multiple police vehicles and treated in a way that felt unnecessarily hostile,” the rep said.

Body cam footage later surfaced in September, where King could be heard telling authorities that her ex is “incredibly emotionally abusive.”

Candace Cameron Bure and her husband, Valerie Bure, have been married since June 22, 1996. The success of their marriage involves having a realistic outlook. The former Hallmark actress and current Great American Family star is aware that, like any relationship, there will be highs and lows, and she has revealed how they navigate any challenges that arise in their marriage. 

In an episode of the “Stay True” podcast on Monday, November 17, the “Full House” actress discussed her marriage to Bure. “We had great years. We had some years I wish we could take back and do over. It's a constant reevaluation,” Cameron Bure said. 

She also discussed how essential it was to have flexibility in marriage and how having children put pressure on the relationship. “You really, I think, year to year you have to re-evaluate what's working, what's not, how are the schedules changing, and you have to continually adapt to what's new to figure out your rhythms,” she said. “And the rhythms are going to keep changing.”

Cameron Bure continued, “So having flexibility not only in schedule but with each other as husband and wife, because that's the first thing that's going to go. Your marriage gets put to the test because first of all, you have kids that come in and they demand all of you. Then they get a little older, and then they pit you against your husband, and you don't even realize it.”

The couple are parents to three children: a daughter, Natasha, and two sons, Lev and Maksim. Cameron Bure discussed what she meant about the children pitting her and her husband against each other by giving a relatable example. “They're going to ask you for a cookie, and you're going to tell them no. And then they're going to go to daddy, and they're going to go, ‘But I'm having the cookie cuz daddy said yes.' And then you're like, ‘Why did you give that to her? I already told her no.' And he's like, ‘Well, I didn't know that.'”

In the interview, Cameron Bure also discussed what she found worked for her and her husband, helping them keep their 29-year marriage strong. She spoke about finding “rhythms” and the importance of spending time together. 

She also stressed how important it is to have “time with you and your husband are going to be regardless, of career, but just in terms of children.” Cameron Bure continued to offer advice. “If I could lend you some advice that would be it is that you have to prioritize the relationship,” she said. “But I'm not talking about in a superficial way of like, ‘Oh, we just have to have a date night once a week.' I'm like, ‘No, you need to figure out what's important to your spouse and they need to figure out what's important to you.”

Kelsea Ballerini shone like the star she is when she stepped onto the red carpet for the 59th Annual Country Music Association Awards in Nashville, Tennessee, on Wednesday, November 19. Standing out in an eye-catching dress that was also totally on-trend, Kelsea opted to wear a sheer dress in a stunning shade of red that showed a bit of skin and boasted a lot of style.

With a large rose-like swirl on the front of the dress, the gown had a romantic touch. Of course, that's not to mention the sheer fabric that swirled around her and opened up at the top like a blooming flower. Stretching down to her mid-calf (with some pieces falling even further), the material around her legs was also see-through.

Wearing her hair down and parted in the middle, Kelsea opted for red shoes that matched her dress and bold scarlet lips.

When Kelsea stepped onto the CMAs red carpet in a sheer dress, she sparked a buzz among her fans. Indeed, when the singer took to Instagram to share her look, her followers were quick to respond.

“THIS DRESS 👏👏👏🔥,” one person wrote.

Another person added, “Slayed per usual ❤️”

“[I]conic as always,” a third person wrote.

Someone else left a comment, writing, “THE RED ON YOU.”

Even Brandi Cyrus (Miley's sister) commented, saying, “BEST DRESSED BEST GLAM 💥”

“When Kelsea Ballerini stepped onto the country music scene in 2014, she became known for her charming and melodious songwriting, as well as her sweet and playful girl-next-door style,” Fashionista noted in February 2024. “Brightly colored mini dresses, princess-y high/low gowns and plenty of glitter defined Ballerini's appearance at the start of her career. Now, 10 years later, the 30-year-old is in an era of rebirth.”

Kelsea herself explained, “I think there's been an evolution of the way I feel about myself and what I'm comfortable in. I feel comfortable enough in myself to explore different looks and fall in love with my body a little bit more.”

“Learning to accept myself and learn the parts of my body that I like has been a really big part of my style evolution,” she added. “Now I can be like, ‘I am digging my legs this week, let's show 'em off.' It's all part of growing up and leaning into my womanhood.”

As far as franchises where the people making the TV show have gone on to sue the people releasing the TV show, it's hard to beat the relationship between AMC and its former flagship program, The Walking Dead. Take, for instance, news today, when Variety reported that Dave Erickson—who co-created spin-off series Fear The Walking Dead, which ran for eight seasons on AMC—had lodged a lawsuit against the network claiming that he got screwed out of millions of dollars in profit participation on the spin-off. Erickson has now become the seventh high-level Walking Dead producer to sue the network, as his lawsuit joins a currently pending federal one from his co-creator Robert Kirkman, series executive producer Gale Anne Hurd, and several others, focused on the original series—which, in turn, followed one from original showrunner Frank Darabont that AMC actually settled (to the tune of $200 million) back in 2021. There has been a lot of suing attached to this franchise, is our point.

Erickson's argument will be familiar to anyone who's looked into those other suits: He claims that he was promised 5 percent of the modified adjusted gross receipts from Fear, an amount that has apparently added up to a whopping zero dollars. Indeed, AMC claims that, by its accounting, the show was apparently $185 million in the red—with said accounting, and AMC's ability to allegedly manipulate it by being both the show's producer and its distributor, serving as the crux of Erickson's unhappiness. Or, to put it in legal-ese: “When a vertically integrated conglomerate like AMC both produces a series and licenses it to its various affiliates, domestic and international, cable and streaming, concerns about improper self-dealing abound. Erickson brings this action to rectify AMC's egregious misconduct and to obtain the tens of millions of dollars in profits he is rightfully owed.” (Among other things, Erickson is claiming that AMC's calculations for what count as “modified adjusted gross receipts” didn't line up with industry standards, and were “the worst possible definition for a hit show in the history of television.”)

The network, meanwhile, has already fired back with the same ire (and, indeed, some of the same language) it's been using to fight back against Kirkman's multiple suits—and, before that, Darabont's, which it fought for roughly a decade before ultimately relenting. “The contracts here were negotiated by the most experienced and sophisticated legal talent in Hollywood,” AMC's lawyer said in a statement. “And AMC has fully paid what is owed. This is simply another crass money grab.”

New body cam footage showing Porsha Williams detailing her Delta flight altercation has been obtained by Page Six.

In the clip, the “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star claims the incident was prompted after another passenger sitting next to her on the flight called her a “bitch.” 

“I was on my phone and the volume was up,” Williams told authorities of the impetus behind the situation after returning from her recent appearance at BravoCon 2025.

“She turned to me out of nowhere and she said, ‘So you gonna make me listen to that the whole flight?'” Williams, 44, claimed.

Williams allegedly replied, “Do you want to?” Then, the woman allegedly told her no. “I said, ‘Well, there's a nicer way to say that.' And she said, ‘Bitch, you don't tell me.”

At one point, one of the other passengers aboard the plane interrupted Williams' interview with police to check on her well-being. 

The passerby revealed she had been sitting near the “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star on the flight and corroborated her story to authorities, describing the ordeal as “reprehensible.”

“She was doing things that were completely chaotic to [Williams],” she told the officer, further emphasizing that Williams was not the aggressor in the situation.

The other woman involved in the altercation later told police that Williams “assaulted” her and that she was “afraid for my life.”

She claimed the incident took place “after about 25 minutes” of Williams scrolling on her Instagram “full blast.” 

“Every time she would flip because it was apparently from a loud place. I jumped because it was so loud,” she said.

Eventually, the situation allegedly escalated to Williams pointing her “fingernail so close to my eye that I thought I was going to be physically attacked.”

“She had her hands in my face, screaming, calling me crazy, on and on,” the woman claimed, adding that she then attempted to protect herself by recording the incident. But, Williams allegedly threw her phone out of her hand. 

“I'm afraid she's going to have me killed,” the woman told the officer.

After the Nov. 16 incident, the FBI announced that an investigation had been launched into the ordeal.

“FBI Atlanta is aware of incident on a Delta flight on November 16th allegedly involving Porsha Williams and/or at least one other person,” a spokesperson for FBI Atlanta told TMZ.

“We are looking to see whether any federal charges may or may not apply.”

In a new blog post, Robert Kyncl shared his list of non-negotiables in licensing talks with AI companies and said the new technology will further democratize music creation.

	Warner Music Group CEO Robert Kyncl has detailed the company's approach to generative AI in a new blog post published Wednesday (Nov. 19). The missive arrived just hours after WMG announced a settlement and licensing deal with Udio, effectively ending its part in a blockbuster copyright infringement lawsuit against the AI music company, which it brought alongside the other two majors.

	In Kyncl's address, he stressed that while it's “early days” for AI, “this is the moment to shape the business models, set the guardrails and pioneer the future for the benefit of artists and songwriters.” The CEO also revealed his thought process when going into meetings with AI companies, saying that his three non-negotiables include “partners who commit to licensed models”; economic terms that benefit and “reflect the value of music”; and giving the company's signees a choice to “opt-in” to any use of their names, images, likenesses or voices in new AI-generated songs.


	Kyncl also stated his belief that AI tools will further democratize music creation, adding that to stand out “in a sea of AI-generated content, real artistry identity and vision” is needed. He additionally stressed that the music industry should focus on engaging fans and getting them to lean in, saying, “the more interactivity users have with the music they love, the more value is created.”


Read the full blog post below.


AI is still in its early days. Investment is surging, talent is pouring in, and a crop of new, ambitious startups are working with music again for the first time in more than a decade. This is the moment to shape the business models, set the guardrails, and pioneer the future for the benefit of our artists and songwriters.


We're approaching this new era with one priority above all else: protecting and empowering the artists and songwriters who are our reason for being. Every decision we make, every partnership we forge, every principle we establish is designed to ensure that they benefit from AI's possibilities.


Every AI deal we make is guided by three non-negotiable principles:


1. We will only make agreements with partners who commit to licensed models;2. The economic terms must properly reflect the value of music;3. And, most importantly, artists and songwriters will have a choice to opt-in to any use of their name, image, likeness, or voice in new AI-generated songs.


WHY THIS MOMENT MATTERS


Over the last 25 years, we've experienced the democratization of music distribution. Many predicted it would lead to the demise of our industry, but the skeptics were proven wrong.


The barriers to entry have fallen, the world has gotten smaller, and artists are global from day one. Fans love having unlimited personalized access, streaming is driving unprecedented growth, and music is more valuable than ever.


Now, we are entering the next phase of innovation. The democratization of music creation.


We believe Generative AI will lead to a new explosion in creative and commercial opportunities, and that authentic talent will be even more in demand for two reasons


OUR APPROACH


Our approach is clear: legislate, litigate, license. We lobby for legislation that sets clear guidelines. We deploy litigation to halt bad actors. And we use licensing as the most powerful way to shape the future. Licensing is how we can safeguard our artists and songwriters, while collaborating with tech partners, to propel new fan experiences that drive additional revenue. 


The partnerships we forge will offer a variety of specific use cases. Each of them adheres to our principles, winning important protections for artists and songwriters, while ensuring that they share in every dollar that's earned. And as the services grow their revenue, so will the pay outs. 


This space is moving lightning fast. Past lessons teach us that delaying only lets others define our future. The music business learned that during the file-sharing era. And the film & TV industries are still regretting not embracing streaming sooner. So for artists and songwriters to win, the music industry needs to be a leading force in the formative stages of AI, not a passive participant. We will steer the course in this new era to deliver greater value for our artists, songwriters, and their music. 


This is only the beginning.

Meghan Markle just divulged the story behind her viral Paris Fashion Week debut at the Balenciaga runway show last month.

The Duchess of Sussex told Harper's Bazaar in an interview published Wednesday that she went to the show to support her pal and designer Pierpaolo Piccioli.

“I was excited for him,” she said. “I reached out and I said, ‘Happy to come and support you.' We kept it a secret, and it was really fun.”

Markle, 44, explained how she “love[s] being able” to live a life where she can sit “front row at a show” and “play in the sandbox with [her] kids.”

She added, “I think the moment that you start making all of your personal decisions based on external judgment, then you lose your authenticity.” 

Markle lives in Montecito, California, with her husband, Prince Harry, and children, Archie, 6, and Lilibet, 4.

The “Suits” alum turned heads when she was spotted arriving at the Balenciaga show, wearing a pristine white long-sleeve button-up shirt and matching flowy trousers.

She accessorized with a dramatic white cape, black pointy-toed heels, a suede clutch with goldtone hardware and diamond stud earrings.

At the time, her spokesperson revealed that she and Piccioli had “worked closely together” over the years, “collaborating on design for key moments on the world stage,” per People magazine.

The rep added that the actress has “long admired his craftsmanship and modern elegance,” saying that her appearance represented a “culmination of many years of artistry and friendship, reflected in her support for his new creative chapter at Balenciaga.”

Piccioli also gushed over his and Markle's friendship, telling The Cut that they had “been texting” ever since they met “some years ago.”

The Italian designer referred to Markle's appearance as a “real, rare and beautiful” surprise.

In a moment that went viral online, the “With Love, Meghan” star was seen taking in the runway show, at one point bursting into giggles while sitting alongside her friend, Markus Anderson, who remained expressionless.

Though some speculated she was reacting to a model who tripped on the catwalk, a rep for Markle told the Daily Mail that she was not laughing at the model. 

The TV actress — who tied the knot with Prince Harry in 2018 — had previously attended Toronto Fashion Week and New York Fashion Week during her years on “Suits,” and made her front-row debut at the spring 2014 Hervé Léger show. 

Her October outing at Paris Fashion Week marked a first for Markle, who recently made a surprising return to acting. 

Markle's winter 2025 cover shoot with the magazine featured her in a number of stunning couture ensembles — including chic ensembles by The Row, Balenciaga, Ferragamo and Dior — with a mix of jewelry by Cartier, Tiffany & Co. and independent designers.

During her interview, the “As Ever” founder confessed she gives herself “grace” when navigating potential missteps amid enormous public scrutiny.

“You learn not to do it again,” she told the outlet. “If it all goes swimmingly, you don't learn from it. If you don't learn anything, you're not going to grow.”

Get ready to ruin some more childhood memories. Exclusive to IndieWire, Untouchables Entertainment has just dropped a new teaser for “The Dark Domain: Mickey-vs-Winnie.” The low-budget horror flick is expected from Emmy-nominated choreographer-turned-filmmaker Glenn Douglas Packard sometime  in 2026. The new footage includes a debut glimpse of Dark Winnie (Givanni Gotay), a feral version of the cartoon bear made famous by author A.A. Milne and his beloved books set in the Hundred Acre Wood — better known here as Hell Forest. 

In the next chapter for “The Dark Domain,” Packard's rapidly expanding storytelling universe introduces Pooh as ferocious, enormous, and covered in black(!) blood. That's a lot of teddy to take in at the start, but the actor who plays Pooh, Gotay, is smart enough to wield the baked-in chaos of a public-domain horror set like a psychological shield. Effectively keeping Pooh's presence larger-than-life while still maintaining the self-awareness needed to keep Gotay from steering too goofy, the “Mickey-vs-Winnie” star helps Packard commit to the best and push the IP trend deeper into the film fringes with a nightmare that's gorier, grimier, and still full of glee.

Actress Fayna Sanchez, recently seen in “Abraham's Boys” and “House of Ashes,” co-stars as Clare. She's just a woman trying and, by the looks of the brutal teaser, failing to keep her friends alive in a gnarled maze that's ensnared their childhood trauma to manifest more adult memories sure to last for a lifetime. Drawn by a force they don't understand, this cast makes nostalgia look seriously nasty.

 










“They're turning what we love into nightmares,” says Clare… newly aware… of the bear. Playful yet menacing, Packard punches energy into his latest teaser, effectively conveying the feel of a production that leaned hard into physical intensity without dropping its dark comedic buzz.

“We even brought in a body-piercing suspension artist,” Packard said in a press release. That detail that lands somewhere between dedication to the craft and an OSHA violation in the making — but to butcher a phrase, you catch more flies using unbridled depravity than honey.  

“As a director, I was committed to creating the most authentic and intense atmosphere possible,” the filmmaker continued. “It was an intense experience for the cast, a few even vomited. When it was all said and done, we knew we'd done more than just pay homage to public domain horror, we elevated it. We gave horror fans exactly what they've been craving from this sub-genre.”

Dark Winnie and Dark Mickey endeavor to stand out in an increasingly crowded space as dueling monsters. Per Packar, they were respectively envisioned as “Jason Voorhees [leveling] up into the Predator” and “Pennywise meets Freddy Krueger.” (Hey, look! A win for that needlessly controversial IGN article about “The Running Man,” also born this week.)

 










Billed as the first-ever public-domain crossover, “Mickey-vs-Winnie” promises a devilish fight between its titular mousy manipulator and growling quadruped hungry for destruction. Coming on the heels of Dan Trachtenberg's “Predator: Badlands,” that's one small step for Disney — one giant agonizing limb-from-limb ripping for mankind.

“Real Housewives of Potomac” alum Mia Thornton was arrested in Georgia for allegedly stealing thousands of dollars worth of furniture from a condo she was renting.

Thornton, 40, was booked into the Fulton County Jail Wednesday on felony theft charges, Page Six confirmed.

Police at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport reportedly cuffed the Bravolebrity after they were called to the Customs and Border Protection office where they were informed of a wanted person, reports CBS News.

According to a police report obtained by the local CBS outlet, Thornton is accused of stealing the furniture from a condo she was renting in the area.

The condo's manager claimed in the report that Thornton abruptly “moved out of the unit in the middle of the night” without notice on Oct. 28.

The building manager alleged that Thornton took several furniture items and the television, estimating the total cost of the stolen items to be around $11,000.

Police body camera footage showed Thornton tell police that she was aware she had a warrant out for her arrest. 

Page Six has reached out to a contact for Thornton but did not immediately receive a response. The Fulton County Sheriff's Department did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment. 

Thornton announced her departure from the “Real Housewives of Potomac” and move to Atlanta in April after she starred on the reality series for four seasons.

“With every new season comes a new beginning and I have some news to share,” Thornton said in her April 21 Instagram post.

“My family and I have made the decision to relocate to Atlanta, and with that, I will not be returning to ‘The Real Housewives of Potomac' next season.”

“I don't just make headlines — I make History. Atlanta, brace yourself. The empire has expanded,” she closed.

Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black also reprise their roles in director Jake Kasdan's latest sequel for the Sony franchise.


							By

Senior Entertainment Reporter


Jumanji 3 is ready to let the games begin. 


	The forthcoming Sony sequel film's team took to Instagram on Wednesday to share the first photo of the franchise stars in costume following the recent start of production. Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black are featured in the image that includes the caption, “Look who's on the loose.”




	Among those posting the photo was Hart, who added the caption, “Back in action and loving it…I missed you Jumanji.… This one will be our biggest!”

	This film follows 2017's Jumanji: The Next Level, which rebooted the franchise after Robin Williams starred in a 1995 feature version adapting Chris Van Allsburg's 1981 children's book. Jake Kasdan, who directed the 2017 movie and its 2019 sequel, returns to helm the untitled third film from a script he co-wrote with Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg. It hits theaters Dec. 11, 2026.

	











	The day prior, Johnson posted a video to Instagram of himself surprising fans on the Universal Studios backlot as he made his way to the set. “A little day one of Jumanji excitement,” the star said in the footage. “So good to be shooting in Los Angeles. I have not shot a film in Los Angeles in…I don't know when, so it feels so good to bring a production back home to Los Angeles.”


	He went on to reveal that his character will be wearing a necklace containing the dice that was used in the 1995 movie. “This is the dice from the original Jumanji with Robin Williams as a show of respect and a way of honoring Robin and this entire franchise that he started as we film our very last Jumanji,” Johnson explained. 

	











	The cast for the forthcoming film includes Nick Jonas, Alex Wolff, Morgan Turner, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman, Lamorne Morris and Danny DeVito.


	Last week, Johnson posted footage and images to Instagram from the new movie's table read. “Amazing to get the whole gang back together, and our jaws were hurting from laughing so hard,” he wrote.


Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle focused on a group of teenage friends getting trapped inside a video game as a collection of adult avatars. It hit theaters in December 2017 and surpassed $950 million at the global box office. The 2019 sequel, subtitled The Next Level, topped $801 million globally.

Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly” is about a movie star, which is to say it's about how hard it is to be a person — even when you're George Clooney. The film's focus puts a lot of emotional and frankly IMDB-rated baggage on the choices of the people who swirl around Jay's orbit, from his publicist (Laura Dern) and his long-suffering agent (Adam Sandler) to an old mentor (Jim Broadbent) and a former rival who had to get out of the movie game (Billy Crudup). Getting that exact combination of screen presences right required pitch-perfect casting.

 










During IndieWire's recent Crafts Roundtable discussion, presented in partnership with Warner Bros., “Jay Kelly” casting director Nina Gold, who has assembled murderer's row ensembles on everything from “Game of Thrones” and “Andor” to “Conclave” and “Power of the Dog,” spoke about the tradeoffs and the decision making in the casting process as not just its own challenge, but fundamentally part of the film's overall creative process.

“We are doing a very similar creative process to the editor or the costume designer or the cinematographer in that we're assembling the creative possibilities and helping to choose them and [getting to make] the right decisions. It's the same, but just with people,” Gold said.

 










How one establishes a base of knowledge to sort through all those people can take decades. “It's also a kind of ongoing thing, you know. One is — for years, just all the time — trying to amass knowledge and meet new people and have thoughts about who people are, and then when the moment is right that person that you saw, you know, 17 years ago in something, suddenly is in the right place at the right time,” Gold said.

The places where Gold looks for new faces are as varied as the ones that she finds — London theater, a lot of drama school, but also anyone with a phone has almost infinite windows onto the world of actors doing interesting things. “The world is really getting small. We all have so much more access to people from everywhere and more ability to find out who's doing what. It's really good and interesting and diversifying. I think eventually you realize that your intuition and instinct are about all you've really got,” Gold said. “I think it's the same in casting as in the whole of life, probably as luck and timing of everything.”

This conversation is presented in partnership with Netflix.

ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 776

JTA — Every day, it can seem, brings a fresh headline about how AI chatbots are spreading hateful ideas. But researchers tasked with understanding antisemitism and how it can be stopped say they have found evidence that AI chatbots can actually fight hate.

Researchers affiliated with the Anti-Defamation League's Center for Antisemitism Research trained a large-language model, or LLM, on countering antisemitic conspiracy theories, then invited people who subscribed to at least one of those theories to interact with it.

The result, according to a study released on Wednesday: The users soon believed in the antisemitic theories less, while at the same time feeling more favorable about Jews as a group. And the effects were still strong a month later, even without further engagement with the LLM.

The researchers are hailing the finding as a breakthrough in the quest for identifying actionable strategies in the fight against Jew-hatred.

“What's remarkable about these findings is that factual debunking works even for conspiracy theories with deep historical roots and strong connections to identity and prejudice,” David Rand, a Cornell University professor who was the study's senior author, said in a statement.

“Our artificial intelligence debunker bot typically doesn't rely on emotional appeals, empathy-building exercises, or anti-bias tactics to correct false beliefs,” Rand continued, referring to practices frequently employed by advocates seeking to fight antisemitism, including at the ADL. “It mostly provides accurate information and evidence-based counterarguments, demonstrating that facts still matter in changing minds.”

Matt Williams, who has headed the Center for Antisemitism Research since its founding three years ago, says the study builds on a growing body of research that views contemporary antisemitism as primarily a misinformation problem, rather than a civil rights problem.

“We need to think about antisemitism less like feelings about Jews, and more like feelings about Bigfoot,” he said in an interview. “And what I mean by that is, it's not ‘Jews' that are the problem. It is ‘the Jew' as a function of conspiracy theory that is the problem. And the relationship between ‘Jews' and ‘the Jew' in that context is far more tenuous than we might want to think.”

Calling conspiracy theories “malfunctions in the ways that we make truth out of the world,” Williams said the study showed something remarkable. “People can correct those malfunctions,” he said. “They really can, which is super exciting and really impactful.”

The study emerges from the ADL's relatively new effort to come up with evidence-based ways to reduce antisemitism, working with dozens of researchers across a slew of institutions to design and carry out experiments aimed at turning a robust advocacy space into less of a guessing game.

The new experiment, conducted earlier this year, involved more than 1,200 people who said on a previous ADL survey that they believed at least one of six prominent antisemitic conspiracy theories, such as that Jews control the media or the “Great Replacement” theory about Jewish involvement in immigration.

The people then were randomly assigned three different scenarios: A third chatted with an LLM programmed by the researchers to debunk such theories, built within Microsoft's Claude AI model; another third chatted with Claude about an unrelated topic; and the final third were simply told that their belief represented a “dangerous” conspiracy theory. Then they were all tested again about their beliefs.

Members of the group that chatted with what the researchers are calling DebunkBot were far more likely than members of the other groups to have their beliefs weakened, the researchers found.

DebunkBot was hardly a panacea for antisemitism: The study found that those who believed in more antisemitic conspiracy theories experienced less change. And Williams notes that the study found only that belief in antisemitic conspiracies was reduced, not rooted out entirely.

But he said any strategy that can cut against what researchers believe has been a widespread explosion of belief in conspiracy theories is a good thing.

The proportion of Americans subscribing to conspiracy theories over the last decade has reached as much as 45 percent, more than twice the rate that had held steady for 70 to 80 years, Williams said.

“To me, the increase in that level of saturation is far more concerning than any particular conspiracy theory moving through different generations,” he said. “I don't think that we're going to ever create a world in which we go under 15% — but going from 45 back to 30 or 25 seems more doable.”

The new study comes as AI models vault into widespread use among Americans, raising concerns about their implications for Jews. When Elon Musk launched a model of his own earlier this year called Grok, it immediately drew criticism for amplifying antisemitism — kicking off a pattern that has played out repeatedly. Soon, the company apologized and said it would train its model to avoid the same behavior in the future. Criticism of Grok is still widespread, but it no longer praises Hitler — though even this week it reportedly told one user that the Nazi gas chambers were not designed for mass killing, prompting an investigation by French authorities.

Chatbot training is seen as essential for delivering high-quality AI results. DebunkBot can be found online on its own website now, but Williams said efforts were underway within the ADL to convince the companies operating major AI platforms to incorporate its expertise.

“There's far more receptivity than not, by any stretch of the imagination,” he said, while noting that the work was early and he could not share many details.

Whatever happens with that effort, Williams said, the new research demonstrates that combating what's sometimes called the world's oldest hatred is possible.

“AI and LLMs — those are tools, right? And we can use tools for good and for evil,” Williams said. “But the fact that we can subject conspiracy theories to rational conversation and arguments and actually lead to favorable outcomes is itself, I think, relatively innovative, surprising, and extraordinarily useful.”

Kim Kardashian is calling out the psychics she once trusted — but a former medium-turned-Christian says the reality star is focusing on the wrong problem altogether.

Kardashian recently revealed she fell short on the bar exam, a major hurdle for anyone pursuing a law career in the U.S. After sharing the disappointing news, she took aim at the psychics she had reportedly consulted, accusing them of completely blowing their predictions about her success. “I'm just letting you guys know that all of the … psychics that we have met with and that we're obsessed with are all … full of s***,” she said bluntly in a TikTok video.

But Jenn Nizza — once a psychic herself and now a Christian who speaks out about the dangers of the occult — told CBN News that Kardashian's outrage misses the deeper spiritual reality behind psychic practices. “She sees them as a pathological liar because the prediction didn't come true,” Nizza said. “But they're also lying when they're pretending to be her deceased father, and that's what I don't think she understands.”

According to Nizza, the issue isn't merely that the predictions were inaccurate. It's that the source of psychic information is deeply deceptive. “She doesn't realize that psychics get their information from demons,” Nizza warned. “She's just looking at this result of a prediction, which is made by a demon. And demons do not know the future.”

Nizza explained that while psychics can seem accurate at times, their so-called “insight” comes from demons who have observed human behavior for centuries and are able to make educated guesses. “The predictions will not always be correct,” she said. “Does it happen sometimes? Yes, just from the planting of seeds and self-fulfilling counterfeit prophecy. But demons are not God … They don't have the power of God to know the future.”

She said these demonic influences often pretend to be deceased loved ones — in Kardashian's case, her late father Robert Kardashian — in order to create an emotional connection and deepen the deception. “These demons will lie … they're lying spirits, and they'll pretend to be Robert Kardashian to hook Kim,” Nizza said.

While Kardashian may feel justified in calling psychics frauds, Nizza believes the greater danger is that millions are still turning to them without understanding the spiritual trap. “You and I can make predictions… but we're not God,” Nizza said. “Only God knows the future.”

The former medium warned that people who chase psychic readings often end up drifting further from Christ. In their pursuit of answers, she said, they are “kept away from the only way, truth and life, and his name is Jesus Christ.” Instead of finding peace, they begin “walking in the false light,” layering one New Age practice on top of another until they find themselves spiritually oppressed — or worse.

Nizza emphasized that spiritual chaos doesn't just affect someone's faith. It can damage relationships and impact mental, emotional, and even physical health. She hopes Kardashian — and others drawn to psychics — will turn instead to the God who knows the future and offers true guidance.

Moon phases, seasons, and other current happenings

I'm always looking for ways to weave my favorite spirituality practices into everyday life. I've tested (more than) my fair share over the years: astrology chart deep dives, human design readings, akashic records, and dozens of psychic sessions with tarot readers, mediums, and intuitives—but I'm also very particular with my time and energy, and I'm not about to waste hours on practices or tools that don't offer a true takeaway.

On a quest to find the most beneficial daily practices, I've been dipping my toe into the waters of spirituality apps. Most recently, I tested Nebula, one of the top spiritual platforms with both astrology and psychic insights.

I was most impressed by the Nebula reviews on the Apple Store, where the popular pick has collected 160,000+ ratings with an overall 4.6-star rating. So, how did Nebula astrology and Nebula psychic readings compare to those that I've had in the past?

Keep reading for my full Nebula review after testing the platform for a couple of weeks, including my final verdict on whether Nebula is legit. (FYI, some people might refer to asknebula reviews due to the brand's domain! Don't worry—they're the same company!)

Nebula Spiritual Guidance Platform

Nebula is an all-in-one spiritual guidance platform with a strong focus on astrology insights and psychic readings. It's transaction and subscription-based, with various payment options available. Once you set up your account and answer a few brief intake questions, you'll find daily horoscopes, birth chart analyses, compatibility tools, tarot, numerology, and more.

The majority of the Nebula app and desktop site feel like a choose-your-own-adventure, allowing you to dive deep into many aspects of your astrological birth chart on your own. But for those who prefer more one-to-one guidance, there's also an option to chat directly with a psychic. 

Nebula has more than 1,000 spiritual advisors on the platform, and each one has their own experience level and area of focus. Before you select which person you'd like to chat with, you can view their profile with a breakdown of their years of experience, number of consultations, user reviews, and an overall rating out of five stars. You'll also see their cost per minute.

The Nebula app is free to download, while the website is free to visit. Both offer free basic features, but a subscription unlocks the full experience.

When you sign up, you get a free 3-day trial, but it's important to know that you'll start getting charged for your subscription once the trial ends. Choose a weekly subscription for $7.99 per week, a 3-month subscription for $39.99, or an annual subscription for $49.99.

While all horoscopes, astrology, and compatibility features are included in your subscription to the Nebula platform, you'll have to pay more for the one-on-one psychic readings. Your first three minutes are free, and then the cost per minute varies depending on which psychic you choose.

In my experience, the average cost per minute was $3.99 for speaking with a psychic with anywhere from two to 20+ years of experience.

When you first sign up for the Nebula, you'll be prompted to enter your birth details (date, time, and location) to generate a personalized astrology chart. There are also a few brief questions about what you are looking for guidance on (love, career, work, etc.).

From there, you can navigate between five categories: Horoscopes, Psychics, Compatibility, Chatroom, and Readings.

Horoscopes

The Horoscopes tab is where you'll find the most in-depth information on your own. At the top of the screen, you'll see a brief overview of your astrology signs (sun, moon, and rising—in my case: Taurus, Scorpio, Capricorn) along with a link to click to view your full birth chart (more on that in a minute!). 

Per its name, this is also the tab where you'll find your personalized horoscope for today, yesterday, tomorrow, the week, the month, or the year. In your daily horoscope, there's a fun breakdown of your “energy levels” in key life areas (career, love life, health, and family) for that day. 

Similarly, the weekly horoscope will highlight your focus of the week and your monthly horoscope will highlight a focus of the month (e.g. ‘reflect and flow'), along with favorable days and challenging days for the month. 

The yearly horoscope outlines five key themes to guide your 2025, along with a deeper dive into what to expect for the full year and a look at your month by month insights and predictions. There is a lot of information here and it's all personalized based on your actual birth chart, not just your sun sign (like a lot of astrology platforms).

If you do click into your birth chart, you'll go even deeper into personalized insights and easy-to-comprehend explainers on your chart placements, what they mean, and how to use them to (for lack of a better term) live your best life. 

Psychics

The Psychics tab is fairly straight forward. This is where you'll head if you want to start a one-on-one chat with a psychic. You'll see all your available options of who is currently online, broken down into sections based on who is the best match for your profile, who is the most accurate, and who is the best in certain areas (love, career, etc.).

If you start a chat with someone, your chat will live in the Chatroom tab. Otherwise, that tab will be empty.

Compatibility

The Compatibility tab is also exactly what it sounds like: a tool to determine your astrological compatibility with someone. Your own details will already be entered in there, but you'll need to add your partner (or potential partner or friend or family member!) and input their birth date, time, and place. 

Once you've entered that information, you'll get an overview of how compatible you are in a few key areas: love, sex, family, and friendship, along with your overall compatibility. 

Readings

Lastly, the Readings tab is filled with various blogs and resources such as guided meditations and manifestation tips.

My Nebula Astrology Review

The astrology side of the Nebula stood out to me immediately. As much as I love all things intuition and spirituality, horoscopes are the one thing that just always felt too gimmicky for me.

I have never been able to get on board with the idea that everyone who was born within 30 days of each other (in any year!) has the exact same prediction for the day, week, year, etc. 

That's what I really love about Nebula. Every horoscope and astrology insight the app provides is based on your entire birth chart. It's not just about your birth month and date; it's about what year, month, day, and time you were born, and where. I really did notice a difference in how relevant my daily horoscopes were when compared to the average astrology app that just looks at your sun sign. 

I also loved that I could actually see my full birth chart in detail. Of course, there are many ways to pull your chart for free online—but Nebula sets itself apart by pulling out digestible insights for all aspects of your chart. You can keep things high-level, or continue clicking through each element to learn more and more. I think I spent a full hour in the app the first time I opened it, and I was in the horoscopes tab the entire time.

After that first day, I continued to come back daily to read my horoscope. I really enjoyed building this morning routine that didn't take too much time but gave me such a great mindset (and a lot of helpful insights) entering into the day.

I also played around with the Compatibility tab, as I'd like to think any normal 30-something might. I entered my current partner's details and then followed up with everyone I've ever dated and all my best friends and family members. And yes, I even tested it with people I don't get along with so well. This tool was more of a fun activity than anything else, but a few of the insights were very spot on.

My Nebula Psychic Review

The one-on-one psychic chats were my second favorite part of the Nebula app, but I still appreciated the option. Nebula psychics are available either via chatroom or with audio chat. While I love face-to-face readings or a phone call, I definitely have friends who prefer a chatroom.

There are pros and cons to each! The chatroom is nice because if you just have one or two brief questions, you can be in and out in a few minutes. Otherwise, you can chat long with your Nebula psychic to get more info.

I chatted with a few different psychics for my Nebula readings, and I loved that I was able to see a lot of detail about each person before I started a conversation. I also really appreciated the vast array of options and how quickly each person responded. Plus, there were always a few hundred other options to choose from!

The one-stop-shop nature of the Nebula platform makes it a great option for just about anyone who is interested in spirituality and astrology. It's a fun and insightful tool for astrology enthusiasts who are looking for more than just a generic daily horoscope. Nebula is also a great option for beginners who are curious about tarot, astrology, numerology, and psychic readings and don't know where to begin. 

In particular, if you prefer chat-based communication, Nebula psychic readings are definitely worth checking out.

Nebula Spiritual Guidance Platform

The final verdict? Nebula surpassed my expectations. I love the daily horoscopes and the detailed astrology insights it provides, with guidance that genuinely feels aligned. If you're looking for an all-in-one spirituality app that's easy to use and can improve your daily life, I recommend giving this one a try.

The search for extraterrestrial technology around the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has hit a firm scientific wall, with astronomers reporting that the radio signatures detected near the comet are entirely natural.

Using South Africa's MeerKAT radio telescope, researchers captured faint absorption lines shortly after the object reappeared from behind the Sun, sparking excitement online about a potential artificial signal.

But detailed analysis has now confirmed these frequencies match standard cometary chemistry, not alien communication.

The findings quieten weeks of speculation fuelled by unusual behaviour, shifting brightness and bold theories from high-profile commentators, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.

The new results centre on two faint absorption lines at 1,665 MHz and 1,667 MHz, recorded on 24 October, shortly after 3I/ATLAS completed its perihelion. According to the International Business Times UK, these frequencies correspond to hydroxyl (OH) radicals created when sunlight breaks down water molecules in a comet's coma.

Coverage in LiveScience adds that the measured frequencies are textbook examples of comet outgassing, not transmission patterns from engineered technology. The Indian Express likewise reports that, while speculation swirled online, observational evidence points decisively to a natural origin.

As IBTimes UK previously noted, the alignment between the detected lines and known OH absorption behaviour leaves virtually no scientific room for an artificial explanation.

The detection was publicised through an astronomer telegram, prompting curiosity because the object had already shown erratic brightness and unusual polarisation.

Some commentators linked the frequencies to the famous 1977 'Wow! Signal', reviving theories aired by Loeb that 3I/ATLAS might be a probe or beacon, as Newsweek reported.

But planetary scientists have dismissed the extraterrestrial leap. ESA comet expert Michael Küppers told The Guardian: 'It looks like a comet and it behaves like a comet. There is no reason to think it is something else.'

Wired explains why the pattern confused some observers: MeerKAT didn't detect a signal being sent. Instead, it picked up a fingerprint of absorption—the natural imprint left behind when solar radiation interacts with a water-rich coma.

Beyond radio data, multiple instruments have strengthened the case that 3I/ATLAS is simply an unusual interstellar comet. Ultraviolet observations from NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected OH emissions, a classic signature of water activity.

Meanwhile, spectroscopy from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed that the coma is extraordinarily enriched in CO₂—among the highest concentrations ever seen in a comet—alongside carbon monoxide, water and dust, according to an arXiv preprint.

Polarimetric studies add a twist: the object displays 'extreme negative polarisation', an unusual trait that may indicate a distinct class of interstellar comet. But even this quirk points to exotic dust properties rather than alien engineering.

Public reactions remain mixed. Celebrities and media personalities—including Kim Kardashian and podcaster Joe Rogan, according to People and Primetimer summaries—have mused aloud about alien possibilities, amplifying Loeb's fringe speculation.

Astronomers urge caution. Researchers cited by Primetimer note that no evidence points to propulsion, metallic structure or engineered behaviour. They warn against conflating excitement with discovery.

Although MeerKAT's findings are robust, scientists say continued monitoring is warranted. As Wired highlights, Loeb has suggested that NASA's Juno spacecraft may detect low-frequency interactions when 3I/ATLAS passes closer to Jupiter in March 2026.

For now, though, the interstellar visitor speaks the familiar language of comet chemistry—water, sunlight and dust—not beacons from intelligent life.

    Durham Law School's Professor Michael Bohlander contributes to blog published by the Global Policy Journal entitled “Don't look up?“ – Why it is past time for serious holistic research into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena.
  

The highly respected Global Policy Journal has published a blog entitled “Don't look up?“ – Why it is past time for serious holistic research into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, written by Karin Austin (Director of the Center for the Impossible, Rice University, and of the John Mack Institute), Michael Bohlander (Chair in Global Law and SETI Policy at Durham University) and Kimberly S. Engels (Associate Professor of Philosophy at Molloy University and Research Director of the John Mack Institute).

They argue that UAP research needs to be taken more seriously, domestically and on the international level, and should encompass all aspects of the phenomenon, not just the technological side. The enormity of the implications for humanity if some of the UAP are indeed of non-human origin is nothing short of existential. 

It is important and encouraging that serious and rigorous major mainstream academic journals are beginning to include the topic in their wider discussion.

I love a dusty, sunburnt Western. This might have something to do with the fact that I'm a sucker for a period piece. Or maybe it's because of the genre's super distinctive aesthetic. Maybe it's because I'm a horse girl at heart. Whatever the reason, I can't get enough. But despite my affection for the frontier, I admit that Westerns tend to follow a pretty standard storyline. That's not necessarily a bad thing. You know the beats, you know you're going to meet a mysterious drifter, you know there's going to be a showdown at the end. So when a Western has some supernatural elements, it stands out immediately to me as a horror fan as well.

That movie is Pale Rider, which is streaming for free on Tubi (alongside some other Western-horror gems). Directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, the film was released during a transitional moment for the Western genre due to the failure of Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate.

The story begins with a violent raid on a small California gold rush town. When mining baron Coy LaHood's (Richard Dysart) gang of men destroy her community and kill her dog, fourteen-year-old Megan Wheeler (Sydney Penny) prays for a miracle to protect her and her family. Her miracle rides into town in the form of a silent stranger on a pale horse. He doesn't have a name. He's simply known as the Preacher (Clint Eastwood).

I first discovered Pale Rider on Reddit after I saw a post claiming that it's “a lowkey supernatural slasher.” I hate admitting it, but they were right:

I love that the film never defines who or what the Preacher is, and I like that it doesn't feel the need to. The ambiguity is what makes this such an interesting watch. When the Preacher starts dispatching the town's tormentors with brutal, almost slasher-like efficiency in the film's climax, it becomes clear that this town is dealing with something beyond their comprehension. In one of my favorite scenes, the Preacher is sitting in a restaurant, calmly drinking coffee with his back to the gang; he suddenly vanishes only to reappear beside the armed men who didn't see or hear him approach. It's such classic slasher staging, which makes me wonder if Eastwood is a secret horror fan. Is the Preacher the ghost of one of LaHood's victims? An angel? Death itself? Pale Rider leaves every possibility open, which makes it fun to discuss with friends afterwards.

If you're in the mood for something that feels both familiar and unsettling all at once, then Pale Rider is the perfect pick. And the fact that it's streaming for free on Tubi makes it even harder to resist. 

And if you love Westerns or films that blend genres, let me know: @ashjenexi on Instagram and X.
