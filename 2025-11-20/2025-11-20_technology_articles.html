                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 100 days into his tenure as the UW's 34th president, Jones is also working to dispel two persistent myths: that it's nearly impossible to get into the UW's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, and that AI is taking everyone's jobs. “We actually accept many more students than the general public believes,” Jones said in an interview this week with GeekWire. Drawing on his experience leading the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Jones wants to give a bigger slice of the UW's 45,000 undergraduates access to computer science courses — even if they're in unrelated degree programs. The program created tech-infused studies in 17 degree programs including advertising, astronomy, economics, music, philosophy and physics. RELATED: University of Washington lands $10M from billionaire Charles Simonyi to tackle AI in the classroom “AI is just an amazing tool, and we're doing work here to try to make sure that our students are getting as comprehensive an education as possible,” Jones said. Bolstering a graduate's knowledge of computer science and artificial intelligence in addition to their focus area makes them “much more employable.” Jones envisions expanding what he calls “radical partnerships” — building diverse coalitions across geographies, institutions and sectors to tackle problems “that are too big for any one entity to solve alone.” The university faces a difficult financial landscape as Washington state's revenue forecast continues to weaken, drawing down an already strained budget. “I've done about three or four of these over the last 10 years,” he said, “and they're just amazing ways to bring people together and to think about doing research in a different, in a much more collaborative, much more impactful way than we've ever thought about.” The strategy is particularly suited to AI, quantum computing or other massive technological challenges, he said. Jones was involved in partnerships with the University of Chicago to bolster quantum science research in Illinois and a human biology collaboration with the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago. In future collaborations in his new role, Jones is eager to work “seamlessly” with the region's tech sector, leveraging the fact that UW helped create an ecosystem that includes giants like Amazon and Microsoft, as well as hundreds of smaller companies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“This towering stratovolcano looms over more than 3.3 million people across the Seattle-Tacoma metro area, threatening to cripple entire communities with ashfall, flooding, and catastrophic mudflows if it erupts,” The Daily Mail reported in dramatic fashion in a story that went viral online. The blog post contains recent seismograms and further explanation about how the station's typical signals are affected by glacier slips, rock falls and high winds. PNSN said any unusual seismic activity such as significant earthquakes or volcanic tremor would show up on numerous other stations that are on or near the volcano and would be detected and reported by PNSN within a short time. “We realized that what they were seeing was one, just one, of our many seismic stations that was sending out essentially static, just noise, instead of actual data,” PNSN Director Harold Tobin told KING 5. Washington's Mount Rainier has suddenly awoken and is buzzing with almost nonstop activity for days, stoking fears that an eruption could come soon. “Unfortunately, sloppy journalism by non-scientists who don't understand seismology nor check with those that do can generate confusion in the public and more work for those who need to correct the clearly incorrect information,” PNSN's blog post read. “It is no wonder that some publications are only considered tabloids and should never be believed.” AWS re:Invent connects you with global leaders, builders, and innovators.

I understand that some people get confused and overwhelmed by a directory structure, but I see that as an education problem, not a UX problem. Having this knowledge early on made me less afraid of my computer, made it feel less like a magical black box, and gave me the confidence to learn more complex topics on my own.Computers become way more capable when the people using them understand fundamentals like directory structures and command line usage. I don't think either of these things are as difficult to learn as reading, writing, and arithmetic (especially if you already have a base level education in those three things).If more "everyday people" just had a little bit more knowledge about these things, they would be able to do way more with their computers with less of a reliance on proprietary solutions that funnel them down whatever path makes someone else the most money.

Also, on Android, you can choose any file explorer. Android misses the mark so much with MTP and iPhone… waves frantically at iTunes. (At least, in a weird bizarre twist, the iPhone's Files app is actually really useful for me. I find myself formatting flash drives, copying stuff from network shares, etc, all from my phone and it's so nifty to have nearly-first-class features there.)

I find myself formatting flash drives, copying stuff from network shares, etc, all from my phone and it's so nifty to have nearly-first-class features there.) I know that read/write conflict concerns are what got USB Mass Storage mode removed from Android, but surely there's some way to resolve that. Like it wouldn't bother me a bit if Android just locked the device and put it in "file transfer mode" when it's mounted on a computer, similar to how iPods used to and how Kobo e-readers do now. If you're not close, telegram fork allow easy sharing of files too. The investment into custom silicon is more likely to pay off when new and exiting features are exclusive to the newer platform. Also `we welcome the opportunity to work with Apple to enable “Contacts Only” mode in the future` doesn't make it sound like Apple actually helped implement this > I applaud the effort to open more secure information sharing between platforms and encourage Google and Apple to work together more on this.Your move, Apple. If we had a functional government every major tech CEO would get called by congress, grilled about this bullshit, and told to sort it out unless they want to get some bullshit legislation shoved down their throat. https://security.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-quick-share-...To ensure a seamless experience for both Android and iOS users, Quick Share currently works with AirDrop's "Everyone for 10 minutes" mode.

Short story: I did a long trip across two continent with my wife. We did backup our photos in our own private cloud but guess how we had to quick exchange photos while in the wild (no wifi and sometimes no network)? Apple don't want Android users to easily partake in some data exchange with iOS users (you gotta buy your ticket to their jail). So sad you don't realize how backward that is.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused content monetization startup Curastory of overstating revenue to investors and misrepresenting true client numbers, according to paperwork seen by TechCrunch. As a result of a settlement with the SEC, Curastory's founder and CEO, Tiffany Kelly, has resigned from the role and replaced herself with Dave Dickman, former CEO of the influencer marketing platform Tagger. The settlement agreement specifically barred Kelly for 10 years from serving on the board of directors or as an executive at any company that would, essentially, fundraise. TechCrunch saw a version of this agreement that had not yet been finalized. Although Kelly remains a major shareholder and will remain an adviser, she told TechCrunch that “stepping aside was truly the only decision that I could make just to keep the company alive and thriving,” she said. It lets advertisers buy in-video ads from creators, while tracking metrics and supporting other features, like video editing. It has raised around $3 million to date from investors, including Lightspeed's Scout Fund, Feld Ventures, and Mindspring Capital, according to PitchBook, which also listed it as having participated in a few accelerator programs like Techstars and the SPARK Program, held by AMEX Ventures and Project W, according to PitchBook. As part of the settlement, Kelly also agreed to pay a fine. “It's interesting having and being forced to step down,” she said. Many other ousted founders are not able to do so. “Early-stage companies have all kinds of challenges across the board. “I feel like we're a good combo and complementary to drive this forward,” he said. “I have not had that experience with fundraising, as you could probably imagine,” she said, referring to the experience that women, especially Black women, often face when raising venture money. Curastory already has plans to expand into Canada, Australia, and the U.K. soon. Its current video enablement tools include YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook Watch. It also plans to add a more enhanced attribution model for advertisers that would eliminate the need for influencer promo codes. “Those are the immediate, near-term product, sales, globalization things,” Kelly said. Despite this shocking end to her run as the CEO of her company, she told TechCrunch, “Being a founder and CEO is one of the most humbling and rewarding experiences I think anyone can have.” She hopes to share her lessons learned and experiences with others, “especially women and people of color.” Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spotify is making it easier for users to make the switch from other streaming services. On Thursday, the company announced an integration with TuneMyMusic, a tool that can transfer playlists from other streaming services into users' Spotify libraries. One of Spotify's top competitors, Apple Music, already offers a way for iPhone and iPad users to transfer their saved music and playlists from other services to their Apple Music library via a feature that's built directly into the iOS and iPadOS Settings app. YouTube Music Premium users can import their playlists from other services, including Spotify, as well. It's a nice perk, too, since the online version of TuneMyMusic only offers to transfer 500 tracks for free. Spotify isn't sharing the terms of its deal with TuneMyMusic, but it's likely a win for both companies, as it could bring more customers to Spotify while TuneMyMusic snags a large client.

The problematic mandatory patch was released in October and affected systems that ran Windows 11 25H2 and 24H2, which introduced a bug that reduced game FPS in some instances, according to Windows Latest. Since this is a mandatory cumulative update, future Windows patches are also expected to experience the same problem, so it's highly recommended that you download and apply the latest GPU driver if you experience some performance loss while gaming after installing the update. While Nvidia says that only some games were affected by the bug, it seems to have been significant enough for it to release a hotfix instead of waiting for its regular driver update release schedule. Team Green says that GPU drivers are incredibly complex, especially as it has to deal with a potentially infinite number of hardware and software configurations. Because of this, it usually releases driver updates in line with major hardware and game launches after extensive testing. However, this means that major issues could remain unaddressed as existing users wait for Nvidia's regular release cadence. For example, when the newly-launched 50-series GPUs started crashing and producing black screens, Nvidia dropped a hotfix outside of its usual release cadence to address the problem. When some issues remained unsolved, the company dropped another hotfix just a week after that to further address crashes and clock speeds. It's unclear if Intel and AMD will release driver updates of their own to deal with KB5066835, especially as neither company has acknowledged any Windows Update-related problems so far, but Windows Latest said that GPUs from Intel and AMD are also suffering from performance issues brought about by this particular patch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google is upgrading its image-generation model with new editing chops, higher resolutions, more accurate text rendering, and the ability to search the web. The model also has web-searching capabilities, so you can do things like ask it to look up a recipe and generate flash cards. Google says Nano Banana Pro is geared toward giving professionals more control over images, and lets users control aspects like camera angles, scene lighting, depth of field, focus, and color grading. The company noted that while Nano Banana Pro can generate images at a higher quality, it is slower and costlier than the original model, which cost $0.039 per 1024px image. The new model can use six high-fidelity shots or blend up to 14 objects within an image. It can also maintain consistency and resemblance of up to five people. The company has released a demo app where you can try some of these capabilities. Nano Banana Pro is being rolled out across many of Google's existing AI tools. These subscribers will also get access to the model within NotebookLM. Google is also making the model available in search through AI mode for AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the U.S. Ultra subscribers can access the model in the company's video tool, Flow, and it is available to Workspace customers in Google Slides and Vids, too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After the Hunger Games franchise returned with Suzanne Collins' 2020 prequel book The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, it didn't take much time before Lionsgate decided to bring it to film. That ended up being a hit, so, to no one's surprise, they've decided to also adapt Sunrise on the Reaping, the second prequel that was released earlier this year. Set decades after Ballad, the new film focuses on a young Haymitch Abernathy, played first by Woody Harrelson in the original movies and here by Joseph Zada. As a candidate in the 50th Hunger Games, Haymitch is fighting against 47 other kids handpicked by the Capital. Longtime fans of the books will recognize young versions of series characters like Effie Trinket (Elle Fanning) and President Snow (Jesse Plemons), alongside other young players Haymitch encounters, played by the likes of Mckenna Grace and Ben Wang. It's not going to be a good time for Haymitch and the other kids, but Lionsgate is hoping it'll be a good time for the audience when The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping hits theaters one year from today—November 20, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House and European leaders rarely see eye-to-eye on much, but they are gradually finding common ground on the issue of deregulating AI companies to spur even more unfettered development. “Artificial intelligence is becoming a driving force of our economies, both in the tech sector and beyond, as it provides new solutions across industries. The bloc's sweeping cookie laws will also get a revamp. That set of regulations was to blame for the global influx of cookie pop-ups, as many companies found it easier to switch their systems completely rather than create a Europe-specific version of their websites. If the new proposals are accepted, the EU will reduce the pop-ups by allowing users to save their cookie preferences in browsers, in a move that was largely expected for some time now. Although it went into law in 2024, the act's stricter rules on AI systems that have been deemed “high-risk” were going to be applied after a grace period ending in August 2026. The latest proposal wants to delay that until “standards, specifications and guidelines are in place,” the Commission's executive vice-president Henna Virkkunen said in remarks. High-risk AI includes technology that is used to profile people in use cases like biometrics, job applications, border control, and more. President Trump has defined the EU's attempts to regulate American tech as “overseas extortion,” and made fighting it a central point of his trade offensive against the EU. Standing ten toes behind him in this fight are Silicon Valley giants. “Europe has an ever-increasing number of laws institutionalizing censorship and making it difficult to build anything innovative there,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January ahead of Trump's inauguration. “We're going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies.” Meanwhile, it's been a good day for AI companies stateside as well. Republicans are gunning for a moratorium on state AI laws, either as a standalone bill or to be added to the National Defense Authorization Act, which is likely to be finalized soon and voted on next month. It's not clear, though, if that moratorium request would pass. A similar Republican attempt to add a moratorium in the Big Beautiful Bill fell through, mostly because of worries that it would help AI companies evade regulation on child safety laws. But in his second term, Trump has been no fan of waiting for Congress to advise and consent. On Wednesday, The Verge obtained a draft of an executive order that the President is reportedly expected to sign as soon as Friday. The order would create an “AI Litigation Task Force” that would be charged with suing states over laws that are determined to obstruct the progress of Big Tech's AI development. But this time around, while Congress ponders that moratorium, a pro-AI group is forming on the sidelines. According to Axios, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema will be co-chairing a new group that wants to “push back” on scrutiny of the AI industry. Further proof has arrived that the ROI on AI is essentially non-existent. The tech giant aims to offset its carbon emissions by bringing back a nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania. In virtually all the ways that matter, getting summarized information from AI models was less educational than doing the work of search. We don't know, and neither does the government.</p>

He proposed a range of comparator decisions for my consideration, in support of a submission that libel damages approaching £100,000 would be appropriate.

I'm just noting that the American concept of libel and the British concept of libel are wildly different in practice.

I heard of techrights for the first time when someone (Shinigami Eyes listed them green) on fedi wrote a hateful post about them, but i'm not 100% sure if it was Garret... Other illegal matters alleged include defamation, harassment and online abuse. Dr Garrett is alleged to have waged this campaign through the medium of IRC ‘sockpuppet' accounts – accounts under pseudonymous user nicknames intended to be a vehicle for distributing material anonymously and deniably. Many posts from these accounts are reproduced in the articles complained of. Dr Garrett is also repeatedly alleged to be an uncontrolled user of illegal class A drugs, principally crack cocaine.The evidence for the allegations was apparently very thin (¶¶59–60):> First, the defence relies on an incident a few years prior to the sockpuppet campaign, in which Dr Garrett admittedly registered himself online in two borrowed names for the purpose of making a rhetorical or satirical point about the owner of those names. Dr Garrett's evidence is that he did so openly, and with the knowledge of the owner (who had himself vacated the names in order to borrow another user's nickname – which was in part Dr Garrett's point in also doing so). Dr Schestowitz clearly takes exception to that particular piece of theatricality as a major breach of netiquette in its own right, and regards it as a sign or symptom of propensity for sockpuppetry. But the incident in question, on its face, is plainly something quite different from the covert use of sockpuppet accounts to publish illegal or offensive material, and is not in my judgment capable of indicating any sort of propensity to do that.> Second, it is said there was an incident in which Dr Garrett's own named account and one of the sockpuppet accounts experienced simultaneous dropped connections. If established, that could indicate dual operation by a single individual. This pleading cannot in the circumstances support an inference of Dr Garrett's authorship of the sockpuppet posts.¶¶61–75 have further, even weaker evidence.

Defendants Roy and Rianne Schestowitz were the targets of online harassment. They decided that claimant Matthew Garrett was behind it, and initiated their own hate campaign against him, in particular using their websites www.techrights.org and news.tuxmachines.org to do so.The defendants did a very poor job of going to court, even by the standards of amateurs representing themselves, producing almost no evidence, none of which the judge found to be relevant.Damages of £70K were awarded. >This is a dispute between prominent ‘free software movement' activists. That includes a preference for internet relay chat (‘IRC'), an online instant messaging system dating in origin from the 1990s, over the big social media platforms. You can see the harassment they were recieving here. There was some pretty vile stuff directed at Rianne in particular.https://news.tuxmachines.org/n/2023/08/11/Garrett_Committing... http://techrights.org/o/2021/04/21/libel-campaigns/Weirdly enough, mjg59_ was part of those?https://techrights.org/irc-archives/irc-log-techrights-19092...Another internet rabbit hole.

Unfortunately they blamed me for it, and in turn wrote and published an astonishing array of articles making false accusations against me. The case was heard last month and I'm pleased to say that the counterclaim was dismissed and I prevailed in my case.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new study comes from KPMG, a British accounting and professional services firm. The study, published Wednesday, looked at businesses in Canada, surveying them for evidence that AI was providing anything in the way of a ROI. Sadly, the study found that, no, pretty much nobody who is using AI has managed to find its financial upside yet. Indeed, the survey found that, while more and more businesses are using AI, only about 2 percent of respondents claimed that they had seen a “return on their generative AI investments.” The survey, which involved 753 business leaders from across the nation, found that the slim amount of respondents who did report positive results from AI were from very large companies that reported at least $1 billion in annual revenue. A lot of companies have yet to fully integrate AI into their workflows, and many of them are still merely experimenting with the technology, the report adds. Canadian Managing Partner of Digital and Transformation at KPMG Canada Stephanie Terrill laid it out the general outlook like this: “Only a small sliver of Canadian businesses are generating growth from their AI investments today, and that's understandable – new technologies take time to be adopted and demonstrate identifiable return on investment,” Terrill said. “However, Canada is facing near-term threats to its economic competitiveness and grappling with declining productivity and prosperity, so waiting years for AI investments to create value isn't realistic in this environment – in fact, it's downright risky.” Despite that fairly negative outlook, Terrill's takeaway isn't what you might think—that AI just isn't very helpful and that companies should ditch it. Many business leaders expect to wait a number of years before AI has its intended effect, the study reports. Google says it has made significant strides in identifying AI-generated images, as well. Trump's anti-regulation push seems to be bearing fruit globally. LeCun is starting something new, but Meta “will have access to its innovations.” Musk and the Kingdom worked together to buy Twitter, so they already have a nice relationship.</p>

According to Bloomberg, this resource cost less than $8 at the end of 2024, meaning its price has increased by nearly 1, 500% in the past 12 months. This material is crucial for semiconductor manufacturing, where it's used in various processes, including thin-film deposition and wafer polishing. While there has already been some brewing rivalry between Washington, D.C., and Beijing, it came to a head in April when U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on all of the U.S.'s trading partners. This has led to an escalation between the East and the West, culminating in a 145% tariff on Chinese goods entering the United States and a reciprocal 125% import levy for American products landing on China's shores. It seemed that progress was being made at the negotiating table, but China suddenly put strict export controls on rare-earth materials in early October. This move could gravely impact the global semiconductor supply chain, and Trump responded by threatening a 100% tariff on all Chinese goods and a far more devastating critical software ban. The two parties eventually realized that such a move would not do anyone good, so they agreed to a one-year tariff truce, resulting in China suspending its more recent rare-earth export control measures. Because of this, Yttrium prices continue to creep higher, even as the U.S. and its allies seek alternative sources. Australia is also working on extracting more rare earths from its mining waste, while Canada is looking to open a new rare earths mine in its Critical Mineral Strategy Annual Report 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brain implant developer Paradromics has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to test its device in an early-stage human trial, the company announced Thursday. Paradromics is one of several companies—which include Neuralink, Synchron, Precision Neuroscience, and Cognixion—working on technology to control computers and other devices using brain waves. Known as brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, these systems capture brain signals associated with movement intention and translate them into commands. The Paradromics study is slated to begin early next year and include two individuals. “It's reasonable to think that someone will be communicating at 60 words per minute and be able to really sustain the conversation,” says Matt Angle, Paradromics' CEO and founder, referring to a rate achieved by previous BCI trials led by academic groups. Normal speaking speed is between 120 and 150 words per minute. BCIs for speech restoration do not read a person's inner thoughts. Rather, they decode certain signals from the brain's motor cortex that are generated when a person tries to move their muscles to speak. They'll press play, and the words will be read in their own voice,” Angle says. Assuming that there is an existing recording of the participant's voice, Angle says the company plans to generate a voice clone of that person using AI. Earlier this year, Paradromics briefly implanted its device in a person who was already undergoing brain surgery. Surgeons used an EpiPen-like instrument to insert and remove the implant. By comparison, Neuralink's implant is a quarter-sized chip that sits in the skull and has more than 1,000 electrodes across 64 tiny wires that are “threaded” into the brain by a custom-built robot. Neuralink has implanted at least 12 people around the world with its device. Other BCI companies are taking a less invasive approach by attempting to decode signals from the brain's surface or outside of the brain entirely. Paradromics' goal is to develop an extremely high-bandwidth BCI—one that can transfer a large amount of neural data between the brain and a computer. Neuralink previously claimed a record for BCI cursor control at eight bits per second. Jacob Robinson, the cofounder and CEO of Motif Neurotech, a BCI company aiming to treat mood disorders, says that the two data points can't exactly be compared side by side. But he says the Paradromics data hints at an impressive bandwidth. “In the same way that Neuralink broke the record for bandwidth with their device, I expect Paradromics to break it yet again,” Robinson says.

Embattled drone maker DJI has reportedly invested in 3D printer manufacturing, helping diversify its business as it faces challenges in the U.S. According to TechNode, 3D printing brand Elegoo's parent company, Shenzhen Zhinengpai Technology, added DJI as one of its shareholders following an update to its business registration on November 18. It has also reported a capital of CNY 6.44 million, or around US$900,000, which should be a small amount given the company's standing as the world's largest drone maker. This move can be seen as the company hedging its bets and diversifying its business, especially as it's currently targeted by Washington, D.C. There have been security concerns with DJI drones since 2016, with the authorities growing more concerned in 2017 when Beijing passed its National Intelligence Law, which requires companies to cooperate with state intelligence when asked. However, the deadline to clear itself is quickly approaching, especially as we only have a few days left until December of this year. So, it seems that its investment in 3D printing is a way for the company to diversify its business and move away from drones. Elegoo has been manufacturing affordable 3D printers, like the Elegoo Centauri Carbon, and it has a massive Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale with a lot of great deals. Although DJI is unlikely to step away from drone manufacturing, it makes sense for it to invest in 3D printer manufacturing, especially as the industry is burgeoning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aging digital infrastructure equipment like routers, network switches, and network-attached storage—has long posed a silent risk to organizations. But this infrastructure may have old, insecure configurations, and legacy tech is often no longer supported by vendors for software patches and other protections. As generative AI platforms make it easier for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities in targets' systems, the network tech company Cisco is launching an effort to raise awareness about the issue and promote improvements—both for ancient Cisco devices and products from other companies that are still in use. The company says that it is launching new warnings for its products that are approaching end of life, so if customers are running known insecure configurations or attempt to add them, they will receive a clear and explicit prompt when they update a device. Eventually, Cisco will go a step further to completely remove historic settings and interoperability options that are no longer considered safe. “The thing we've got to get across is this aging infrastructure wasn't designed for today's threat environments. Japan had the lowest relative risk—thanks, the report says, to more emphasis on consistent upgrades, decentralization in critical infrastructure, and “a stronger, more consistent national focus on digital resilience.” In general, the research also emphasizes that breaches and other cybersecurity incidents around the world regularly involve attackers exploiting known vulnerabilities that could be avoided through patching or upgrading end-of-life technology. “The status quo is not free—there is actually a cost, it's just not being accounted for,” says Eric Wenger, Cisco's senior director for technology policy. “If we can help elevate this risk to something that is treated as a board-level concern, then hopefully that will help to underscore the importance of making an investment here.” As an industry, he adds, “we're not making it hard enough for the attackers.” Founded in 1984, Cisco has been a titan of network computing for decades, and its devices are deeply embedded in digital infrastructure around the world. To the extent that it may feel self-serving, then, for such a company to champion renewed spending on network equipment, Wenger points out that whether customers will choose to buy Cisco equipment again is a different question from whether they should upgrade at all. Cisco's Grieco points out, too, that he and his colleagues have been attempting to highlight the risks posed by end-of-life technology for years. In an August 2016 Cisco blog post, for example, he wrote, “Systems that were designed, built and deployed in decades past didn't anticipate the hostile security environment of today. Until now, very few have thought about securing infrastructure because they didn't think adversaries would target these systems and devices, or they had ‘higher priorities' to fix. “It's time to give people a jolt about the silent risk of aging infrastructure,” Grieco says.
