                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investigators from the Center for Advanced Gerotherapeutics at Cedars-Sinai found that aged blood vessel cells play a key role in the development of metabolic disorders, including diabetes. The preclinical findings, published in Cell Metabolism, could lead to new treatments for these complex disorders. Senescent cells differ depending on the originating cell types, diseases and other factors. Some senescent cells help with wound healing, but others cause harm and are known contributors to age-related diseases. Previous research by the investigators showed that eliminating senescent cells with drugs called senolytics improved metabolic function, the body's method for turning food and drink into energy. In the current study, investigators focused on senescent blood vessel cells. Suda said this occurred because senescent blood vessel cells release high levels of inflammatory molecules. The investigators next treated both groups of mice with fisetin, a naturally occurring senolytic compound, and found that the mice had fewer senescent blood vessel cells and improved diabetic symptoms. Investigators saw a similar decline in senescent blood vessel cells when they treated tissue samples from obese human patients with fisetin. "Preliminary findings like these are crucial to translating aging research into clinical care," said James Kirkland, MD, PhD, director of the Center for Advanced Gerotherapeutics and senior author of the study. "While more research is needed, we aim to eventually treat multiple age-related diseases simultaneously by using fisetin and related senolytics for aging and metabolic health." Suda said his team will next work to test this approach in clinical trials. "If we can target senescent cells safely in humans, it could help address not just diabetes but a range of age-related conditions," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mayo Clinic researchers have developed a new, personalized approach to deep brain stimulation (DBS) for people with drug-resistant epilepsy. DBS involves implanting electrodes in the brain to deliver electrical pulses that help prevent and control seizures. While effective, DBS is typically administered with electrodes placed in the same brain region across most patients. Mayo Clinic physician-scientists are now tailoring the treatment to an individual's seizure network before DBS placement. "Our unique approach aims to tailor neuromodulation for each patient," says Nick Gregg, M.D., a Mayo Clinic neurologist and lead author of a paper published in the Annals of Neurology. "We're moving away from one-size-fits-all to an individualized approach that maximizes seizure network engagement to better modulate abnormal brain wave activity." Once researchers identify the specific area in the thalamus - a small relay hub deep within the brain - that connects to a patient's seizure network, they can fine-tune stimulation settings for that individual. Because seizures occur infrequently, clinicians analyze erratic brain wave patterns that signal abnormal activity. Ten patients received this personalized approach while being evaluated for epilepsy surgery. The next phase of research will follow those who have since received permanent DBS implants using this personalized approach. Reorganizing the neuronal network could move us beyond controlling seizures to actually curing epilepsy," says Dr. Gregg. This research is part of Mayo Clinic's Bioelectronic Neuromodulation Innovation to Cure (BIONIC) initiative, which unites clinical insight with cutting-edge engineering to deliver novel diagnostics and therapies. Through intellectual property development, strategic partnerships and patient-centered trials, BIONIC transforms innovation into impact - advancing care for complex neurological conditions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>McGill University researchers at the Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Institute (GCI) identified a mechanism driving neuroendocrine prostate cancer, a rare and highly aggressive subtype for which there currently are no effective treatment options. Findings published in Genes & Development show that prostate tumors in mice became more aggressive when the protein ERRγ was lost, while restoring its production in human cancer cells reversed this effect. tumors that stop responding to hormone therapy evolve into neuroendocrine prostate cancer in about 15 per cent of patients, according to past research. After this shift, life expectancy typically falls below 18 months. Our findings highlight ERRγ as a promising new therapeutic target." Vincent Giguère, Lead Author, Professor, McGill's Department of Biochemistry and GCI researcher The researchers used advanced genetic and metabolic analysis to understand how losing ERRγ drives tumor growth. Their investigation revealed that two genes linked to cancer become overactive when ERRγ is missing. As drugs that block these genes already exist for other cancers, the team tested two of them in mouse and human prostate cancer cells. "These findings have major clinical implications," said Giguère. "By targeting the genes that take over when ERRγ activity is low or lost, we open the door to new treatment strategies for patients who currently have few options." Understanding why ERRγ function becomes impaired in the first place is still being investigated, he added. ERRγ, previously known for its role in energy metabolism, appears to act as a brake that prevents prostate cancer from advancing. Preclinical findings led by first author Ting Li, a post-doctoral fellow in Giguère's lab, have revealed that neuroendocrine prostate cancers have much lower levels of ERRγ than other types of prostate tumors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Research published in Contemporary Economic Policy reveals that despite widespread adoption of indoor vaccine mandates in major US cities during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no consistent evidence that these policies significantly increased vaccination rates or reduced COVID-19–related outcomes. The findings contrast with those from other countries, as national mandates abroad boosted vaccine uptake. For the study, investigators estimated how mandates that restricted access to indoor venues for unvaccinated individuals impacted first-dose uptake, COVID-19 cases, and deaths across 9 US cities through what's called the synthetic difference-in-differences method. The results challenge assumptions about the effectiveness of local public health interventions and suggest that local mandates may be less impactful when vaccine coverage is already high, when people can sidestep restrictions by traveling to nearby cities, and when the political environment is highly polarized. The findings could be useful for developing future public health strategies and policies. We wanted to take a careful, data-driven look at what these policies actually accomplished in the US context. By the time most cities introduced indoor vaccine mandates, vaccination rates were already high, and many unvaccinated individuals were deeply hesitant or resistant, leaving limited room for further gains. Our findings don't suggest that mandates can't work-only that their effectiveness depends on timing, context, and how easily people can sidestep local restrictions."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Planarians are flatworms that have a simple central nervous system (CNS) but an extraordinary ability to regenerate neural tissue. Their CNS is divided into distinct molecular and functional domains defined by specific neural gene expressions 1. Remarkably, planarians can regenerate functional brains from small body fragments, thanks to pluripotent stem cells known as neoblasts, which can differentiate into various cell types, including neurons. However, exploring the complex coordination of neural networks in planarian growth and regeneration has always been a challenge, primarily due to the difficulties in capturing high-resolution, three-dimensional images of their central nervous system (CNS) within a practical timeframe. To overcome these obstacles, researchers from Zhejiang and Westlake University and Tottori University 4 used advanced imaging techniques combining tissue expansion with tiling light-sheet microscopy, enabling nanoscale resolution and significant linear expansion. Central to this success was Thermo Scientific's Amira Software, which served as the primary environment for image processing and analysis, particularly for segmentation, quantification, and 3D visualization. By implementing an automated 3D cell segmentation process, researchers mapped neurons and muscle fibers at the single-cell level in over 400 wild-type planarians, both during their normal state and throughout regeneration. They revealed the complex distribution of neurons across the planarian nervous system, including the brain, ventral nerve cords, optic nerves, and pharyngeal nerve complex. This innovative approach promises to shed new light on the intricate processes underlying planarian biology. The recipe solution in Amira Software provides a powerful tool that significantly enhances the efficiency and consistency of image analysis workflows. By allowing users to create, save, and reuse analysis recipes, it ensures that complex image processing tasks can be replicated across different samples with minimal effort. Using Amira Software capabilities in image analysis and processing, researchers identified differences between a control sample and one where β-catenin, which is crucial for maintaining structural integrity and functional interactions between neurons and muscle fibers, was interfered with (as shown in the figure below). In contrast, in β-catenin RNAi planarian, muscle fibers show a more complex and cobweb-like structure, indicating a different or more intricate arrangement of neural connections. Image Credit: Figure from Lu et al. To support open science and reproducibility, the research team released all Amira Software segmentation and quantification recipes via Zenodo. Lu et al.'s work clearly demonstrates how Amira Software can bridge advanced microscopy and data science, delivering quantitative, reproducible workflows that illuminate how cells, neurons, and tissues organize in three dimensions. From robust nuclei counting to fiber tracing and 3D rendering, Amira Software enabled the researchers to uncover structural principles of regeneration previously unseen in living systems. This workflow now serves as a model for future imaging studies seeking reproducibility, scalability, and cross-modality integration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new synthesis of randomized trials reveals that a carefully supervised very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet can improve weight, insulin control, and androgen levels in women with PCOS, offering short-term clinical gains while underscoring the need for longer-term safety data. Study: Effects of the very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: a systematic review with meta-analysis of clinical trials. In a recent study published in the British Journal of Nutrition, a group of researchers synthesized randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on the effects of the very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), covering anthropometric, hormonal, and metabolic outcomes. One in ten women of reproductive age lives with PCOS, a condition tightly linked to insulin resistance (IR), weight gain, and low-grade inflammation, which are factors that ripple into everyday life through irregular cycles, fertility worries, and cardiometabolic risk. Small, strategic weight loss can normalize periods and improve chances of conception, yet many diets feel impractical for busy households. VLCKD induces nutritional ketosis and may lower insulin levels, reduce visceral fat, and rebalance androgen levels, offering a potentially practical, food-based approach. However, because VLCKD trials are short, highly variable, and often restrictive, long-term safety, adherence, and comparative effectiveness versus other eating patterns remain uncertain, and hence further research is needed. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance and a protocol registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), investigators searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) via PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, and Web of Science for RCTs through July 2025. Eligible participants were adult women with PCOS assigned to a VLCKD. Outcomes included anthropometric measures such as weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), fat body mass (FBM), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR); hormonal markers such as sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), free and total testosterone, and the LH/FSH ratio; and metabolic endpoints such as fasting glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and total cholesterol. Data were extracted in duplicate with disagreements resolved by a reviewer. Meta-analyses used weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs). Diet protocols ranged from VLCKD (~750–800 kcal/day) to energy-restricted VLCKD (~1300–1500 kcal/day), consistently restricting carbohydrates sufficiently to induce ketosis while providing adequate protein. Several outcomes exhibited very high statistical heterogeneity, reflecting differences in caloric levels, carbohydrate thresholds, lipid composition, adherence monitoring, and concurrent treatments. Anthropometry showed clinically meaningful improvements that map to real-life wins, such as looser waistbands, better sleep, and easier movement. Sensitivity analyses supported the direction of these effects, despite I² values often exceeding 90%, and there was no consistent sign of publication bias in the funnel plots. Hormonal profiles moved in a direction consistent with reduced hyperandrogenism and improved ovulatory potential, outcomes that matter to women tracking cycles at home or planning pregnancy. LH fell (WMD −3.97 U/L), the LH/FSH ratio declined (WMD −1.04), and FSH showed no significant change, an overall pattern compatible with easing androgen excess and better follicular dynamics. Glucose-insulin outcomes echoed the anthropometric and hormonal shifts. These shifts translate to fewer “sugar crashes,” steadier energy, and potentially lower long-term risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In lipid outcomes, triglycerides were reduced (WMD −29.95 mg/dL), whereas total cholesterol, LDL-c, and HDL-c showed no significant pooled changes during the short-to-intermediate follow-up. Risk-of-bias assessments rated most domains low or with some concerns, but three trials were explicitly judged to have high risk of bias due to non-true randomization or missing outcome data. Importantly, the certainty of evidence by GRADE was generally moderate across key outcomes, reflecting both consistent directionality and substantial heterogeneity, variability in dietary protocols, and limitations in adherence reporting. While adverse effects were not the primary focus of the pooled analyses, reported issues in the broader ketogenic literature, such as transient gastrointestinal discomfort, nutrient gaps without supplementation, and lipid shifts, underscore the need for clinical supervision, a staged reintroduction of carbohydrates, and attention to overall dietary quality. Additionally, none of the included trials stratified results by PCOS phenotype, which may limit interpretability because phenotypes differ markedly in hyperandrogenism, metabolic risk, and potential dietary responsiveness. Across RCTs, the VLCKD meaningfully improves weight, WC, FBM, BMI, and selected reproductive hormones in women with PCOS, while enhancing glucose-insulin control and lowering triglycerides. These changes support practical, near-term benefits such as more regular cycles, greater comfort, and potentially improved fertility when VLCKD is professionally supervised. However, most trials are short, heterogeneous, and not designed to test long-term safety, lipid trajectories, phenotype-specific responses, or real-world adherence. Future work should compare VLCKD with other evidence-based patterns over longer periods, track phenotypes, and integrate behavioral support to sustain gains. More consistent protocol standardization and improved adverse-event reporting would further strengthen the evidence base.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research shows that declining rainfall heightens encounters between people and wildlife, especially carnivores, revealing how drought reshapes ecological and human behaviour across California. Study: Human-wildlife conflict is amplified during periods of drought. In a recent study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers examined the influence of drought on human-wildlife conflict. Interactions between humans and wildlife have become more prevalent, representing a fundamental challenge for conservation programs. As antagonistic human-wildlife interactions persist, a deeper understanding of how climate change affects resource availability and human-wildlife conflict dynamics is crucial for characterizing future changes in socioecological systems. Drought is a common manifestation of climate change that strains both wildlife and human populations. While drought may limit resource availability for wildlife in wildlands, human infrastructure often buffers its effects, attracting wildlife to anthropogenic subsidies. However, the precise behavioral and ecological mechanisms linking drought to increased conflict remain uncertain, and the study emphasizes that these associations do not establish causation because they reflect correlations rather than demonstrated behavioral shifts. They leveraged the Wildlife Incident Reporting (WIR) database of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which comprises human-wildlife incident reports from 2017 to 2023. Reported incidents encompass a wide range of interactions within four main categories: depredation, general nuisance, potential human conflict, and sightings. “Climate change will increase human-wildlife interactions, and as droughts and wildfires become more extreme, we have to plan ways to coexist with wildlife,” said lead author Kendall Calhoun, a member of Justine Smith's lab at UC Davis and of UCLA's Tingley lab on ecology and conservation. “Animals coming into human spaces are generally framed as wildlife trying to take resources from humans, but it's often because we've taken the resources away from the wild areas.” The team primarily focused on two categories most likely associated with negative interactions, general nuisance, and depredation. The state of California was divided into 50 km by 50 km grid cells for analysis, and reported conflicts within each cell and month were compared with environmental covariates. Environmental covariates included seasonality (month), precipitation, human population density, median household income, and habitat structure (tree cover). A hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework was adopted to investigate how changes in precipitation and other covariates affect incident frequency. In one model, incident reports for all species were treated agnostically and modeled together. Further, a separate set of diet-specific models was developed to explore whether these effects varied by species and diet guilds, where species were modeled under a shared diet-group hyperparameter. In addition, three models investigated species-specific responses and the impact of diet on trends in reported conflicts, one for each diet group: carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores. The authors also noted that reporting patterns are partly shaped by human behavior and perceptions, which may influence how often conflicts are reported rather than how frequently they actually occur, because shifts in human activity, visibility, and willingness to report can contribute to observed trends. The WIR database comprised 31,904 incident reports in California between 2017 and 2023. Every 25 mm decrease in annual precipitation increased the frequency of reported incidents by 2.11%. Independently, depredation, general nuisance, and potential human conflict were negatively associated with precipitation. Notably, reported incidents showed the highest increase with decreased precipitation for carnivores. Importantly, decreased precipitation was a strong predictor of conflict reporting for carnivores, but not for herbivores or omnivores at the diet-guild level, clarifying that the earlier effects for carnivores remained robust at the species level rather than the guild-level aggregate. Species-specific analyses revealed significant increases in reported conflicts, accompanied by reduced precipitation, for three carnivores (mountain lions, bobcats, and coyotes) and one omnivore (American black bears). This distinction highlights that drought sensitivity is strongest for particular species rather than all members of a diet group. These seasonal increases occurred independently of year-to-year precipitation trends, reflecting both ecological and human behavioral patterns, such as greater outdoor activity and higher wildlife detectability during summer months, as well as reduced water availability during peak drought periods. Taken together, the results underscore that climate change may have significant ramifications for the future of conservation and human-wildlife conflict. The finding that lower precipitation is associated with conflict warrants investigations into how exactly drought affects space use and behavior for human and wildlife communities. Further, season was a robust determinant of conflict reporting, and this effect is likely replicable in regions where intra-annual water availability influences human-wildlife interactions. While the impact of ongoing droughts may perturb animal behavior year-round, their effects are likely to be most pronounced when precipitation is at its seasonal low. The study also emphasizes that reporting patterns may be influenced by socioeconomic factors, cultural norms, and willingness to report conflicts, suggesting that the observed increases may reflect both ecological responses and human behavioral changes during drought conditions, including shifts in recreation timing, resource use, and opportunities for human-wildlife encounters. “I look at ways to improve human-wildlife interactions, and climate change is going to make that path more difficult,” Calhoun said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A joint declaration was an outcome of the conference, highlighting four critical components for healthy aging. These included maintaining meaningful social bonds, having a sense of gratitude, being physically active, and following a healthy diet centered on plant-based protein and dietary fiber. The world is aging at an unprecedented pace, with rising life expectancy and falling fertility reshaping countries' demographic structures across all income levels. While people today live longer than previous generations, many spend their later years managing illness or disability. The challenge of ensuring that added years are lived with independence and well-being framed the first World Longevity Summit, held in Kyotango, Japan. Japan, where nearly one in three citizens is aged 65 or older, embodies the pressures and possibilities of aging societies. Within the country, the Kyotango region stands out for its unusually high concentration of centenarians, a phenomenon attributed to strong social ties, plant-forward diets with dietary fiber, daily activity, and cultural continuity. With these regional strengths as a backdrop, the summit convened researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and community leaders to explore cutting-edge science and practical models for healthy aging. Twenty-eight presentations covered fields ranging from molecular geroscience to public health and community initiatives. Steve Horvath introduced epigenetic clocks used to estimate biological age and showed how these tools capture organ-specific aging, familial longevity, and environmental influences. These models show that centenarians' families tend to have slower epigenetic aging. Organs such as the cerebellum and retina age more slowly than tissues like blood or bone. Lifestyle factors produce very modest shifts in biological age, though certain interventions, such as omega-3 supplementation, show small but measurable benefits. Conversely, obesity was highlighted as accelerating liver-specific epigenetic aging. Horvath also noted examples such as the Hispanic paradox and the Tsimane people, whose biological age appears unexpectedly low relative to health risk factors. Complementing this perspective, Tamotsu Yoshimori highlighted autophagy as a core mechanism of cellular maintenance. He outlined how autophagosomes recycle damaged components, maintaining energy balance and proteostasis. Suppressing the protein Rubicon, an age-associated inhibitor of autophagy, can extend lifespan and improve neurological function in model systems. Early exploratory interventions, such as fermented tea extracts and lifestyle programs designed to stimulate autophagy, point to possible translational pathways but require rigorous evaluation. Rubicon's role in promoting exosome-mediated spread of senescence signals was also noted as an emerging mechanistic insight. Yoshimori's work has also led to the establishment of a research-oriented company and the Japan Autophagy Consortium, illustrating early efforts to translate autophagy science into public-facing initiatives. Francis Chan shifted focus to the gut microbiome as a driver of systemic aging. Intriguingly, centenarians exhibit not a young microbiome, but a distinct one characterized by fewer dominant species and greater representation of minor beneficial taxa. Recent clinical trials using synbiotics showed promise for improving fatigue and cognitive symptoms in long coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), illustrating how microbiome-targeted interventions may support neurological and systemic health. Chan also described four categories of microbiome-based aging biomarkers: diversity, taxonomic composition, metabolite profile, and functional output. A second major focus of the summit was designing social systems that enable older adults to thrive. Community-based models such as Exadon, a program combining exercise and taiko drumming, or multi-use centers that facilitate intergenerational engagement, were presented as effective ways to maintain social connection, daily activity, and purpose. However, the summit emphasized that evidence for these initiatives is often observational, and formal evaluation remains limited. Matsuda also proposed policy innovations such as care credits and “second compulsory education” for seniors. Stefania Bandini expanded the discussion to rural aging, emphasizing that vast regions in Italy, known as “inner areas,” and Japan face population decline, loss of traditional knowledge, and limited access to services. She illustrated how digital tools can identify vulnerabilities such as poor walkability, inadequate access to health facilities, and insufficient caregiving networks. Integrating such technologies with local cultural practices, she argued, is essential for building age-friendly environments that align innovation with human dignity and community needs. The summit produced four clear principles for healthy longevity: prioritize social connection, share meals centered on plant-based protein and dietary fiber, sustain regular routines and physical activity, and foster gratitude alongside a strong sense of purpose (Ikigai). The declaration affirmed that achieving healthy aging requires a science-based, culturally sensitive, and collective approach. In synthesizing four days of presentations, the summit underscored that extending healthy life expectancy requires action at multiple levels, namely molecular research, clinical translation, early-life interventions, community design, and policymaking. In conclusion, the World Longevity Summit emphasized that embracing aging as an opportunity, fostering global partnerships, and integrating science with cultural values are crucial steps toward enabling people worldwide to enjoy longer, healthier, and more meaningful lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People with type 1 diabetes (previously called juvenile diabetes) are 4.29 times more likely to develop bladder cancer, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis by researchers at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. Bladder cancer is a relatively common disease, affecting about 2% of the U.S. population. Cigarette smoking accounts for about half of all bladder cancer in the United States and Europe, but causes of the remaining half are poorly understood. Recent data suggest that type 2 diabetes may play a role, but years of epidemiological studies found no link between type 1 diabetes and bladder cancer. Because smoking is a strong contributor to bladder cancer, research designed to identify other risk factors must control for-or separate out-the influences of smoking from influences of other proposed causes. But no prior studies on type 1 diabetes and cancer had done so. Of nine original studies and one meta-analysis published before ours, none had adequately controlled for smoking. When we evaluated the vulnerabilities of these studies and addressed them, we found a very clear pattern indicating substantially elevated risk for bladder cancer in people with type 1 diabetes." Victoria K. Cortessis, PhD, clinical professor of population and public health sciences, Keck School of Medicine and study's senior author The new findings provide important clues about causes of bladder cancer and may help guide decision making by patients with type 1 diabetes and their providers. For years, studies that tracked people with type 1 diabetes found no increased risk of bladder cancer-and a closer look reveals why. Years later, researchers used those same datasets to ask a different question: Does type 1 diabetes raise the risk of other diseases, such as bladder cancer, in adulthood? Those analyses found no increased risk for bladder cancer. The problem with this method: Smoking is a major contributor to bladder cancer. Without accurate data on smoking in the diabetes group or the general population, it was impossible to know how much risk of bladder cancer was linked to smoking versus type 1 diabetes itself. The Keck School of Medicine team suspected that people with type 1 diabetes may smoke less than the general population. After managing a serious health condition starting early in life, these individuals may have been more health conscious as adolescents and adults. If true, lower smoking rates could skew the comparisons and mask any increased bladder cancer risk tied to diabetes itself. To investigate that idea, first author Helena Oskoui Bennett, MPH, a student at the Keck School when the research was conducted, gathered data from authoritative sources such as the World Health Organization to estimate smoking prevalence in populations where the original studies were conducted. After accounting for patterns of smoking, they estimated that people with type 1 diabetes were 4.29 times more likely to get bladder cancer. Those biological changes may also interact with the effects of smoking to further raise risk. "More work is needed to understand the mechanisms at play, but it's possible that there is a biological synergy between diabetes and smoking that increases risk more than either factor alone," Cortessis said. They are now reviewing nearly 100 studies on type 2 diabetes and its treatments to pinpoint what drives the increased risk. Systematic review and meta-analysis corrected for history of smoking tobacco identifies type 1 diabetes as a possible risk factor for bladder cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Around two-thirds of pregnancies have weight gain that is more or less than recommended and is associated with complications such as preterm birth, large birth weight, and admission to intensive care. The findings are part of a Monash University-led systematic review of data from 1.6 million women, published by The BMJ. Gaining too much or too little weight during pregnancy, known as gestational weight gain or GWG, represents combined growth of mother and baby, and is associated with increased risks to both mother and child. Each year 130 million births occur globally in total, in the context of increasingly unhealthy and processed food supply and environmental drivers, causing an epidemic of excess GWG. "These findings reinforce the need for international reference standards for healthy GWG alongside lifestyle support and public health measures to improve outcomes for mothers and babies worldwide," Dr Goldstein said. Most countries rely on Institute of Medicine GWG guidelines*, but these are based on data from predominantly Caucasian women in high income countries in the 1980s, so they don't reflect ethnically diverse populations across low, middle and high-income settings, or changes in food supply and environment that are driving global trends such as rising weight (BMI). In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched an initiative to develop global healthy GWG standards aimed at defining optimal GWG recommendations across diverse settings. To support this initiative, Monash University researchers and collaborators from the WHO analyzed data from 40 observational studies involving 1.6 million women aged 18 and over from five of the six WHO defined world regions that reported pregnancy outcomes according to BMI and GWG from 2009 to 2024. Of these 40 studies, 36 were considered to be high quality. Based on WHO BMI criteria, the research study found that GWG below the recommended range was associated with: lower risk of caesarean delivery; a large for gestational age infant; and high birth weight (macrosomia) but higher risk of preterm birth; a small for gestational age infant; low birth weight; and respiratory distress. The researchers point to some limitations, such as variations in BMI and GWG classifications, and note that few studies from low income countries met their inclusion criteria, limiting diversity. Nor can they rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors, such as smoking status, age and ethnicity, may have influenced their results. However, Senior author Professor Helena Teede, who is Director of the Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, and an Endocrinologist at Monash Health, said the study supported the need for a global approach. Our findings inform and support the need for optimised, evidence-based WHO international GWG reference standards based on individual patient data, applicable to contemporary and diverse global populations. Whilst this work supports guidance on healthy GWG, it will need to be incorporated into individualised care to meet the needs of those in pregnancy, limiting stigma and optimizing healthy outcomes for women and the next generation. Ultimately, the burden of health impacts shown here mandate action to support women across policy, healthcare and individual level solutions for the health of mothers and babies."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This information could help identify pediatric patients who may benefit from strategies to help improve their bone health at an early age, helping them maintain healthy bones and prevent fractures in adulthood. Many children experience fractures due to accidents and recover quickly, but there are many reasons why children may have weak bones or be at risk for developing fragile bones. Chronic health conditions, dietary restrictions and steroid use all impact bone mineral metabolism. Genetics plays an additional role, and while most studies have been conducted on adults for whom a fracture could be life-threatening, the role that genetics plays in affecting bone mineral density during childhood has historically been much less understood. Two recent studies from researchers at CHOP explored the importance of genetic and genomic information when it comes to understanding pediatric bone development. The first study, published in the journal Genome Biology, looked at genetic signals associated with bone mineral density that had been previously identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) across adults and children. Understanding the causal gene was related to the dynamic between osteoblasts, which form new bone tissue, and osteoclasts, which break down old bone tissue. Additionally, the researchers found that many genetic signals associated with bone mineral density also exhibit their effects on other tissues, indicating that bone density might signify other potential health issues. The second study, published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, used a polygenic risk score called genetic quantitative ultrasound speed of sound (gSOS). gSOS had been previously used to study the risk of fracture in adults, and CHOP researchers sought to determine whether it was associated with bone health in children. This study utilized two observational studies and associated genetic data, the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) as well as data from CHOP's Center for Applied Genomics spanning more than two decades. The study found that a higher gSOS score was associated with higher bone mineral density at multiple skeletal sites and reduced odds of fracture across both observational studies. This is particularly important since the researchers' investigation accounted for a wide range of factors, including sex, puberty stage, levels of calcium in the diet, height, weight and BMI, as well as accidents that could have resulted in fractures. Our study found that genetics represent a powerful component of bone density across the entire lifespan. We were very surprised to see that the polygenic risk score could accurately predict which patients were more likely to experience a fracture, even accounting for the normal childhood activities we most closely associate with broken bones." Babette S. Zemel, PhD, Senior Study Author, Professor of Pediatrics at CHOP Both methods could potentially be utilized to enhance bone health earlier in life. While a good diet and regular weight bearing physical activity, particularly sports like volleyball and basketball, are important for bone health, Zemel said, these remain particularly helpful for improving bone health even if genetic risk of fracture is high. The Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) was also supported by Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development contracts N01-HD-1-3228, -3329, -3330, -3331, -3332, -3333.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A landmark multi-country clinical trial has shown that a structured, sustainable approach to infection prevention and treatment can save women's lives, cutting severe maternal infections and deaths by about one-third (32%) compared to usual care. Every 30 minutes a mother dies from a sepsis-related cause somewhere in the world, with the greatest burden borne by women in low and income countries. Findings from the trial show that even within a very resource-limited environment this innovative approach made it possible to support healthcare workers to improve maternal outcomes and can be sustained in resource-limited health systems. Professor David Lissauer, NIHR Professor of Global Maternal and Fetal Health at the University of Liverpool, said: "These results are hugely significant. Our findings demonstrate that APT-Sepsis provides a practical, sustainable, and effective solution. With a 32% reduction in infection-related maternal deaths and life-threatening complications, this program has the potential to transform care. Policymakers now have compelling evidence to scale up these interventions so that fewer women die from preventable infections during pregnancy and childbirth. "Jeremy Farrar, Assistant Director-General, WHO, said: "The APT-Sepsis programme is a testament to what can be achieved when science, policy and frontline care come together. Reducing maternal infections and deaths by over 30% is not just a clinical success - it's a call to action for global health systems to prioritize infection prevention in maternal care. We must ensure these life-saving practices are scaled and sustained across all settings." Fungaro Lydia, Midwife and APT Champion at Arua Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda said: "I want to thank APT-Sepsis for coming to our rescue. Previously, we had no reliable way of monitoring mothers. Henry Mwandumba, Programme Director at the Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Research Programme, MLW, said: "We are immensely proud that MLW contributed to a project that has delivered such a significant reduction in maternal infections and deaths. This is a testament to our commitment to improving the health and wellbeing of women in Malawi and reflects the dedication of our team and partners, and look forward to seeing how this intervention pioneered in Malawi can be scaled-up to help mothers worldwide" The trial demonstrates that structured, system-level interventions can overcome long-standing barriers such as inconsistent adherence to infection-prevention practices and delays in the recognition and treatment of sepsis. By embedding improved practices within existing health systems - and without relying on costly additional resources - APT-Sepsis is designed to offer a low-cost, sustainable and rapidly scalable model for national and international health programmes seeking to improve maternal survival globally.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Columbia University researchers are the first to show that focused ultrasound - a non-invasive technique that uses sound waves to enhance the delivery of drugs into the brain - can be safely used in children being treated for brain cancer. The focused ultrasound technique, developed by Columbia engineers, was tested in combination with chemotherapy in three children with diffuse midline glioma, a rare and aggressive brain cancer that is universally fatal. (All three patients eventually died from their disease or complications of COVID. Our hope is that the technology will improve survival for children with brain cancer," says study leader Stergios Zacharoulis, associate professor of pediatrics at Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and a pediatric oncologist at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of Children's Hospital of New York. Columbia has already launched a follow-up trial using focused ultrasound with etoposide, an FDA-approved chemotherapy drug that has shown activity against brain cancer cells. Though new therapies are transforming the lives of patients with aggressive tumors such as pancreatic cancer and melanoma, the prognosis for brain cancer has remained stubbornly unchanged for decades. Survival for children with midline glioma, which begins deep within the brainstem, is usually less than one year after diagnosis. A major impediment to improving survival for brain cancer patients is physical: The blood-brain barrier, which protects the brain from viruses, bacteria, and toxins in the bloodstream, also prevents almost all chemotherapies from reaching brain tumors in sufficient concentration. In the lab, Elisa Konofagou, a professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia, has consistently shown that the barrier can be relaxed safely to allow drugs to permeate the brain and then reinstated. Many cancer drugs are capable of killing brain cancer cells, suggesting that techniques that permit more drug molecules to pass through the barrier and target the tumor cells have the potential to transform treatment. Focused ultrasound opens the blood brain barrier by using sound waves to vibrate tiny lipid-coated gas bubbles within the barrier. As the vibrating bubbles expand and contract, they pry open pathways in the barrier that drugs can pass through. "MRIs can be stressful experiences for some of us, but especially for children who find it really difficult to stay still in the machine during the procedure," says Konofagou, who developed the technique. With the Columbia-designed device, MRI images for navigation planning are obtained before the focused ultrasound treatment with a hand-guided device.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The health impacts of eating disorders, such as anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating, are not only complex, affecting many different organ systems, but long-lasting, finds a large tracking study, published in the open access journal BMJ Medicine. The risks of serious conditions, such as diabetes, renal and liver failure, fractures, and premature death, are particularly high within the first 12 months of diagnosis. But these heightened risks persist for years, highlighting the need for timely integrated multidisciplinary health services and continued monitoring to improve outcomes, conclude the researchers. But while the detrimental mental and physical consequences are well known, the long term effects are less well understood, they add. To strengthen the evidence base, the researchers scrutinised anonymised medical records in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to Hospital Episode Statistics and death certification data for people across England over a 20 year period (1998 to 2018 inclusive). Some 24,709 people, aged 10-44, with a diagnosed eating disorder, were matched for age, sex, and GP practice with up to 20 others without these disorders (493,001 in total), and their mental and physical health tracked for 10 years. Analysis of the data revealed that eating disorders were associated with substantially higher risks of poor physical and mental health, and premature death. Within the first year of diagnosis, people with eating disorders were 6 times more likely to be diagnosed with renal failure and nearly 7 times more likely to be diagnosed with liver disease, as well as being at significantly heightened risks of osteoporosis (6 times as high), heart failure (twice as high), and diabetes (3 times as high). The risks of renal failure and liver disease were still 2.5 to nearly 4 times higher after 5 years, with 110 and 26 more cases than would be expected, respectively, per 10,000 people at 10 years. Similarly, the risks of poor mental health were significantly higher 12 months after an eating disorder diagnosis: the risks of depression were 7 times higher, with 596 additional cases per 10,000 people, while those of self-harm were more than 9 times as high, with an additional 309 cases/10,000. And although they were lower, these heightened risks persisted after 5 years. The risk of death from any cause within the first 12 months of diagnosis was also more than 4 times as high, and for unnatural deaths, including suicide, it was 5 times as high. After 5 years, these risks were still 2 and 3 times higher, corresponding to 43/10,000 extra deaths from all causes and 184/100,000 extra deaths from unnatural causes. The risk of suicide was nearly 14 times higher in the first year but was still nearly 3 times higher after 10 years, accounting for 169 additional deaths/100,000 people. But they say: "Our data describe the substantial long term effects of eating disorders and emphasize the potential opportunity for primary care to have a greater role in offering support and long term monitoring for individuals who are recovering from an eating disorder." They add: "A potential gap exists in provision where patients' difficulties are too complex for low intensity brief interventions, but not complex enough for specialist teams." In a linked editorial, Dr Jennifer Couturier and Ethan Nella of McMaster University, Ontario, Canada, point out that despite the high prevalence of eating disorders, "their consequences are under-recognised." "Medical education should place greater emphasis on the recognition and management of eating disorders, to equip primary care providers, specialists, and allied health professionals with the tools to identify early warning signs and monitor ongoing risks associated with eating disorders." They conclude: "Multiple organ systems are affected by eating disorders, which then requires an integration of care to adequately treat patients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Smoking even 2-5 cigarettes a day can more than double your risk of any type of heart disease and raise your risk of death from any cause by 60% compared to people who never smoked, according to new research supported by the American Heart Association's Tobacco Center for Regulatory Science and published in PLOS Medicine. The study found that even after you stop smoking, it could take up to 30 years or more to achieve the same level of health of someone who never smoked. Cigarettes continue to be the most commonly used tobacco product in adults. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of people who still smoke, but smoke less. We could not clearly answer these questions in the past, but the scope of this study, reflecting more than 320,000 U.S. adults over 20 years, gives us the statistical power to see relationships that other smaller studies cannot." Michael J. Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., study author, lead investigator for the American Heart Association's Tobacco Center for Regulatory Science grant-funded research initiatives The Cross Cohort Collaboration-Tobacco research group harmonized information (meaning they integrated and standardized studies to make them comparable) from 22 long-term studies of predominately U.S. adults who smoked and those who did not. Researchers used the collective data in their analysis of more than 320,000 adults followed over 20 years. Defining cigarette use as a lifetime use of at least 100 cigarettes, the researchers documented more than 125,000 deaths and 54,000 cardiovascular events. "Collectively, the findings suggest that no level of smoking is without risk. Smoking a little more - two to five cigarettes daily - was associated with increases for all risks in the study," said Blaha, a professor of cardiology and epidemiology and director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, Baltimore, Maryland. "Even we were surprised by the strength of harm from even a low quantity of cigarettes, and the incredible importance that and quitting early had on long-term heart health." "The message here is clear - don't smoke - and for those who do, quit early in life and strive to quit entirely versus smoking less, because even occasional use of tobacco has substantial health consequences," said Stacey E. Rosen, M.D., FAHA, volunteer president of the American Heart Association and senior vice president of women's health and executive director of the Katz Institute for Women's Health of Northwell Health in New York City. It offers a framework for future research to delve into the complex dynamics among smoking habits, various population subgroups and their associations with cardiovascular health outcomes."
