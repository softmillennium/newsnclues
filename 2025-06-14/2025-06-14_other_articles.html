                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Supernatural" enjoyed 15 successful seasons on the air, and there are many fans out there who wish that Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) were given more monster-hunting adventures for years to come. Similarly, "Supernatural: The Animation" was put to rest after one season before becoming a forgotten memory — like the many spirits Sam and Dean encounter while traveling America's haunted hotspots. Produced by Madhouse — the legendary Japanese animation studio behind "Death Note," "Perfect Blue" and other beloved anime properties — "Supernatural: The Animation" follows Sam and Dean as they battle all manner of beasts. Most of the episodes are retellings of stories from "Supernatural's" first two seasons, which features monster-of-the-week adventures and an overarching story about the siblings' search for The Yellowed-Eyed Demon who killed their mother. There are some original episodes, too, but the majority of the animated show's one and only season covers well-trodden ground. The live-action series had to contend with budget restraints, meaning that the demons typically look like regular people with black eyes. What's more, the action sequences are pretty basic. While the monster designs add some nightmare juice to familiar tales of terror, "Supernatural: The Animation" is an unnecessary show. The animated series is a fine introduction to Sam and Dean's story for newcomers, but for seasoned fans, it's unessential viewing. Not only that, but some of the animated show's characters leave a lot to be desired. Sam and Dean are similar to their live-action counterparts — Jared Padalecki even voices Sam for the whole season, and Jensen Ackles reprises Dean for two episodes — but their ally, Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver), is unrecognizable. Granted, remakes should bring new ideas and characterizations to the table, but this version of Bobby is inferior to the O.G. Still, the series might have been more memorable and successful if it pitted Sam and Dean against a fresh rogues gallery of creatures, as opposed to spooks they'd already faced before.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Julia Mossbridge, a cognitive neuroscientist and researcher into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs)—the updated term for UFO sightings—warns that we as humans may soon have to grapple with the reality of alien existence and step into a new epoch of comprehension. This comes amid a growing body of information about supposed encounters with UFOs and extraterrestrials. Notably, an odd, spherical artifact uncovered in Colombia is thought by researchers to be a fragment of UFO technology. The artifact features markings reminiscent of ancient scripts such as runes, and scientists are employing AI in attempts to decode the enigmatic symbols. She posts that the potential revelation of extraterrestrial beings could plunge numerous individuals and societies worldwide into turmoil as they struggle to assimilate the truth of their presence, reports the Daily Star. "One of the mistakes we make is [saying] because I think I understand this, everything I think today is true," she observed, noting that it leads to confusion when something arises that doesn't "fit our model of the world." Mossbridge remains cautious about jumping to the conclusion that this find is an actual alien artifact, yet a significant part of the public is already convinced. "The sphere itself seems kind of like an art project," she mentioned. Well, I think it's partly the same reason. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us." Conversely, Dr Jose Luis Velazquez, a radiologist who inspected the sphere, indicated he didn't find any typical hallmarks suggesting human fabrication. More testing is needed to establish its origin," he revealed. They expressed the sentiment: "We interpret it as a message to humanity, encouraging a collective shift in consciousness to help Mother Earth-especially considering the current issues with pollution and environmental decline." Often brushed off as merely an art project, experts now believe the 'alien' mummies of Peru may have been victims of homicide. Scientists studying the enigmatic three-fingered bodies with elongated skulls have unveiled new discoveries they assert confirm the specimens are '100% real'. Preliminary DNA tests indicated they were part-human and part 'unknown species', leading to Mexico's inaugural congressional hearing on UFOs.

Where it lives: Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and northeastern Australia They are often likened to a modern-day dinosaur due to their massive size, vivid colouration and powerful, raptor-like feet, earning them the title of the "world's most dangerous birds." These birds can grow up to 5.6 feet (1.7 meters) tall and belong to the ratite group, which includes ostriches, emus and kiwis, according to the San Diego Zoo Fossil evidence and genetic studies suggest that cassowaries have existed in some form for tens of millions of years. One of the cassowary's most prehistoric-looking features is its feet. Each foot has three toes, with the inner toe bearing a dagger-like claw that can grow up to 5 inches (12 centimeters) long. These claws aren't just for show; they're capable of delivering powerful, slashing kicks that can injure or even kill potential threats, including humans. This coat provides protection from sharp thorns and branches as they move through dense vegetation. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The giant birds also have brightly-coloured pouches of flesh, called wattles, that dangle down from their necks. These are thought to help cassowaries relay social cues to others: For example, if they shake their heads and clap their wattles it may be a sign of territorial aggression. —Hoatzin: The strange 'stinkbird' born with clawed wings that appears to be an evolutionary 'orphan' —Turkey vulture: The bird that vomits acid up to 10 feet and poops antiseptic onto its legs They also have large, helmet-like structures called 'casques' on top of their heads. It may also amplify and direct the birds' low-frequency calls, helping them communicate over long distances. Unlike many animal species, male cassowaries are the primary caregivers for their offspring. However, attacks can occasionally happen if cassowaries are approached by humans.
