                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARIS (AP) — U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz lost in the first round of the French Open as the tournament's No. 4 seed on Monday, eliminated 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 by 66th-ranked Daniel Altmaier of Germany. Altmaier broke Fritz's big serve five times at Court Simonne-Mathieu and ended the Californian's 15-match Grand Slam winning streak against players ranked outside the top 50. Fritz's exit followed another by a top-10 American: No. 9 Emma Navarro was bounced from the women's bracket earlier Monday. In September, Fritz lost the U.S. Open trophy to Jannik Sinner, becoming the first U.S. man to reach a major final since Andy Roddick in 2009. In Paris, Fritz was the highest-seeded American man at the French Open since Roddick was No. While hard courts are Fritz's preferred surface, he did have a run to the second week on the red clay of Roland-Garros a year ago, making it into the fourth round before losing to Casper Ruud. This is not Altmaier's first big win at the French Open. 8 seed Matteo Berrettini there in 2020, and Sinner in 2023.</p>

German qualifier Tatjana Maria reached the Queen's Club final with a stunning 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) win over Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Saturday. Mother of two Maria has enjoyed a memorable run in the first women's tournament at Queen's for 52 years. The 37-year-old reached the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2022, but was forced to qualify for Queen's after dropping to 86th in the WTA rankings. Maria said she was "still living this dream" after shocking former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) in the quarter-finals on Friday.

The German can complete her fairytale week against Chinese top seed Zheng Qinwen Zheng or American world number 15 Amanda Anisimova in Sunday's final.

Maria has never been past the second round of any Grand Slam except Wimbledon, but once again she is proving a formidable force on the grass courts.

Keys' exit was a blow to her preparations for Wimbledon, which gets underway across London at the All England Club on June 30.

The 30-year-old American reached the quarter-finals of the recent French Open after securing her maiden Grand Slam crown in Melbourne in January.

Keys has failed to reach beyond the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in her 10 visits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Belarusian has been enjoying yet another dominant year thus far, hoovering up elite titles and reaching back-to-back Grand Slam finals despite falling to Madison Keys in Melbourne. She was desperate to avenge that defeat, but simply could not adapt to the swirling conditions inside Philippe Chatrier. Meanwhile, the 22-year-old has just been going about her business. In fact, business has been high on the agenda of Gauff, seeking not only to boost her profile but the sport's as a whole. TNT Sport's first year broadcasting the French Open to the US was groundbreaking, as they pulled in record viewing figures with their widespread coverage. Already she is on track to enjoy a long and successful career, having collected a handful of elite-level titles that most could only dream of. Coco Gauff is the new figurehead for American tennis, due to lead a golden generation of success. Her ever-presence since last Sunday is indicative of a player seeking to capitalise on her success, having appeared almost everywhere. She also revealed that other stars, including Lewis Hamilton, had privately sent her messages of congratulations too. Gauff then made her first-ever appearance at a WNBA match, where she was greeted with a standing ovation by the entire arena. @CocoGauff makes a surprise appearance to celebrate her French Open win! That notion was officially solidified when the 2021 US Open champion appeared on Jimmy Fallon's talk show, speaking about the success that only seems to grow. Gauff's presence in every form of media will surely only build the profile of her and her sport and could have huge positive implications for tennis going forward.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (Reuters) -German veteran Tatjana Maria defied the odds to move into the biggest final of her career when she stunned second seed and Australian Open champion Madison Keys 6-3 7-6(3) at the Queen's Club Championships on Saturday. But she put those doubts to bed on the lush green surface at the Andy Murray Arena, where she has now knocked out two Grand Slam champions in back-to-back matches. Having upset former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in the quarter-finals, Maria will now play either top seed Zheng Qinwen or Amanda Anisimova in the final. “Oh my god, to be honest, I cannot believe it. I could not wish a better tournament to be in the final and I'm so, so proud,” a smiling Maria said. “You never can stop, doesn't matter how it goes. I had my ups and downs, but you always have to keep going. I love this sport and we live for these special moments. Keys unleashed raw power, hammering 41 winners to Maria's modest 11. But the German countered with crafty low slices that skidded treacherously off the grass, forcing the American second seed into 37 unforced errors while committing just six herself. However, that ultimately proved to be Keys's undoing on match point when she sprinted up to the net, only for Maria to  loft a perfectly weighted lob into an empty court to move into just her second grasscourt final of her career.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Draper is back on the grass at the HSBC Championships and back doing what he does best: hitting big. Draper, who trained with countryman Billy Harris on Saturday lunchtime, offered fans in west London a glimpse of what they can expect throughout the week. “He's always intense in his practice, ripping big forehands,” Harris told ATPTour.com after their session. “It makes you a bit sharper: You have to be ready for the ball coming through very quick. It's always good to sharpen yourself up against someone who's nailing the ball at you.” A key aspect to Draper's ascent on the ATP Tour has been his adaptability and proven potential across all surfaces. The Londoner recorded his first wins over Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz on the grass at Queen's Club in 2021 and 2024, respectively, and won his first tour-level title on the same surface in Stuttgart 12 months ago. Yet while his ability to achieve success across all surfaces has been pivotal, Draper has also placed renewed emphasis on his strength and conditioning. “He's built like a brick,” one astonished fan remarked after seeing Draper up close on Saturday. With a booming lefty forehand, a devastatingly flat backhand and pinpoint accuracy on serve, Draper is able to do damage from anywhere on the court. “He's obviously shot up the rankings and is leading the way for British tennis, so it's always good to practise with him,” Harris added of Draper. Draper will hope to reignite fond memories from his time at Queen's Club, where he owns a 5-3 record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Competing as a 19-year-old wild card, Draper stunned third-seeded Sinner for his maiden tour-level match win in 2021 and returned to sink then-defending champion Alcaraz last year before falling to eventual winner Tommy Paul in the quarter-finals.

The 22-year-old has been struggling with the issue since competing in Strasbourg last month before the French Open and took an off-court medical timeout during her quarter-final loss to Qinwen Zheng at Queen's Club on Friday. Speaking afterwards, Raducanu said: "It's been lingering for the last few weeks, and I have had back issues before. I think it's just a vulnerability of mine. "I'm not overly concerned that it's something serious, but I know it's something that's very annoying and needs proper and careful management." Raducanu had elected to play in the German capital rather than Nottingham after being offered a wild card into the WTA 500 event, which is set to feature nine of the world's top 10. But the former US Open champion will instead prioritise rest and recovery to ensure she is fully fit for Wimbledon. Raducanu's decision means she will miss out on being seeded for her home grand slam but she is understood to be confident of playing in the Lexus Eastbourne Open the week before Wimbledon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There had been doubts over his participation following last weekend's epic French Open final win, but Alcaraz confirmed his intention to play the event to the tournament Friday, and will give a news conference at Queen's Sunday afternoon. It is a boost for the event, which had already lost last year's finalists Tommy Paul and Lorenzo Musetti, as well as the 2022 champion Matteo Berrettini. Paul and Musetti picked up abdominal and leg injuries at Roland Garros respectively, while Berrettini has not played since retiring from his match against Casper Ruud at last month's Italian Open in Rome because of an ongoing abdominal issue of his own. Last Sunday, Alcaraz defeated Jannik Sinner to win his second French Open title, coming from two sets down for the first time to win a match that lasted five hours and 29 minutes — the second-longest final in Grand Slam history. Alcaraz went on holiday to Ibiza, Spain following the final, as has become an annual post-Roland Garros tradition ahead of playing Queen's, which he won two years ago. Last year, he lost to Britain's Jack Draper in the second round. Alcaraz went on to claim the Wimbledon title in both of those years, and is sticking to that winning formula this year. The men's event at Queen's begins on Monday June 16, and is one of the most high-profile Wimbledon warm-up events.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 Wimbledon men's and women's singles champions will earn the biggest cheque in Grand Slam history after the All England Club confirmed a huge increase in prize money. In terms of the men's and women's singles champions, prize money will be boosted by a handsome 11 per cent while those who lose in the first round will earn 10 per cent more than they did 12 months ago. The US Open came close to that mark in 2024 as champions were handed cheques of $3,600,000 (about £2,8m). Wimbledon first broke the £1m mark for the singles winners' prize money in 2010, six years later it doubled to £2m and nine years later it will hit £3m, although it has to be remembered that prize money at all sporting events took a big blow during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The increase in prize money comes just a few months after the top 20 highest-ranked players in the men's and women's game wrote a letter to the Grand Slams (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open) asking for a bigger share of revenue. The likes of Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz, Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff and Iga Swiatek all signed the letter that stated the Grand Slam should increase prize money “to a more appropriate percentage of tournament revenues, reflective of the players' contribution to tournament value”. Wimbledon women's favourite named by former British No 1 as Coco Gauff barrier revealed Jannik Sinner must overcome his Carlos Alcaraz kryptonite if tennis' next great rivalry is to survive All England chairperson Deborah Jevans says they are listening to concerns by players. “The challenge with tennis is the fact that the players don't have an offseason which they want, they have increasing injuries that they're speaking about, and we've always said that we as Wimbledon are willing to engage and talk with the tours to try and find solutions, and that door remains open.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu has pulled out of next week's Berlin Open after suffering more back issues at the HSBC Championships. In her post-match press conference, she said she would have to re-consider entering the WTA 500 event in the German capital. And asked if she was an fitness doubt for Wimbledon, she said: “I don't know” and added:”It's been lingering for the last few weeks, and I have had back issues before. “I think it's just a vulnerability of mine. I'm not overly concerned that it's something serious, but I know it's something that's very annoying and needs proper and careful management.” After treatment this morning, she has now pulled out of the Berlin Open but her team insists she is still confident of playing the WTA 250 event in Eastbourne starting on June 23. The grasscourt Grand Slam starts in SW19 a week later on June 30. The world No.37 needed to make the final at Queen's Club or go on a deep run in Berlin to break into the world's top 32 by June 23 and secure a Wimbledon seeding. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. But speaking after her straight sets defeat to No.1 seed Qinwen Zheng at Queen's Club, Raducanu said: “I think being seeded obviously helps in Masters, helps in Slams and a lot of tournaments so you're not playing one of the top players early rounds. “But I think maybe my goals have slightly shifted from being seeded to actually improving my game, and when I play those top players, making it closer and feeling more competitive rather than just feeling: ‘Okay, I maybe get to the third round of a slam but then lose comfortably to one of the top players'.
