According to the current Standard Model, four fundamental forces underpin all known physics: electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. However, since the mid-1980s, physicists have wondered if a fifth fundamental force could exist, which would help to explain some observational anomalies. And since then, many studies have boldly claimed discovery of this elusive force. In 1986, for example, scientists at MIT thought that antigravity could maybe could be a fifth force, and in 2000, another group named the force “quintessence” as a way to explain dark energy. In 2015, a study by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences discovered a particle 30 times heavier than an electron that could form the basis of a fifth force, and the U.S.-based Fermilab stated boldly that they were on the cusp of discovering this mysterious force in 2023. One proposed way of examining if such a force could exist is by closely monitoring asteroid trajectories, and few near-Earth asteroids are as well observed as Bennu. A study by an international team of scientists analyzes Bennu to try and placing constraints on a possible fifth fundamental force in the search of ultralight dark matter. Bennu, one of the most dangerous near-Earth objects, has been meticulously tracked by optical and radar astrometric data since it was discovered in 1999. As the destination for the OSIRIS-REx asteroid retrieval mission, additional X-band radiometric and optical navigation tracking data added even more trajectory precision. “The trajectories of objects often feature anomalies that can be useful in discovering new physics.” The trajectories of heavenly objects have yielded incredible discoveries before. Neptune, for example, was first “discovered” not through a telescope, but by the meticulous calculations of Uranus' orbit and discovery of gravitational anomalies therein. However, such a technique isn't foolproof, as some scientists also believed that a planet named Vulcan existed between the Sun and Mercury. “These results highlight the potential for asteroid tracking as a valuable tool in the search for ultralight bosons, dark matter, and several well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model,” Sunny Vagnozzi, assistant professor at the University of Trento in Italy and study co-author, said in a press statement. Because this asteroid will zoom by Earth in 2029, a detailed study of its trajectory will deliver even further restrictions on the fifth force than what Bennu could provide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers using data from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope have identified dozens of small galaxies that played a starring role in a cosmic makeover that transformed the early universe into the one we know today. "When it comes to producing ultraviolet light, these small galaxies punch well above their weight," said Isak Wold, an assistant research scientist at Catholic University of America in Washington and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. "Our analysis of these tiny but mighty galaxies is 10 times more sensitive than previous studies, and shows they existed in sufficient numbers and packed enough ultraviolet power to drive this cosmic renovation." The study took advantage of existing imaging collected by Webb's NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) instrument, as well as new observations made with its NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) instrument. The tiny galaxies were discovered by Wold and his Goddard colleagues, Sangeeta Malhotra and James Rhoads, by sifting through Webb images captured as part of the UNCOVER (Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization) observing program, led by Rachel Bezanson at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. The project mapped a giant galaxy cluster known as Abell 2744, nicknamed Pandora's cluster, located about 4 billion light-years away in the southern constellation Sculptor. The cluster's mass forms a gravitational lens that magnifies distant sources, adding to Webb's already considerable reach. Today, this gas is ionized -- stripped of its electrons. As one of its main goals, NASA's Webb was specifically designed to address key questions about this major transition in the history of the universe. Such galaxies are rare today, making up only about 1% of those around us. But they were abundant when the universe was about 800 million years old, an epoch astronomers refer to as redshift 7, when reionization was well underway. "Low-mass galaxies gather less neutral hydrogen gas around them, which makes it easier for ionizing ultraviolet light to escape," Rhoads said. "Likewise, starburst episodes not only produce plentiful ultraviolet light -- they also carve channels into a galaxy's interstellar matter that helps this light break out." This technique revealed 83 small starburst galaxies as they appear when the universe was 800 million years old, or about 6% of its current age of 13.8 billion years. The team selected 20 of these for deeper inspection using NIRSpec. "These galaxies are so small that, to build the equivalent stellar mass of our own Milky Way galaxy, you'd need from 2,000 to 200,000 of them," Malhotra said. "But we are able to detect them because of our novel sample selection technique combined with gravitational lensing."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a compelling Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, Sophia Shi, PhD, unveils her pioneering research that fundamentally changes our understanding of brain aging and opens revolutionary therapeutic pathways for Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative conditions. Dr. Shi's groundbreaking work focuses on the glycocalyx, a complex "forest" of sugar molecules coating blood-brain barrier endothelial cells. Her research, recently published in Nature, demonstrates that this protective layer deteriorates dramatically with age, leading to blood-brain barrier dysfunction and neuroinflammation, key drivers of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. This discovery represents the first time scientists have successfully reversed age-related blood-brain barrier dysfunction through glycocalyx restoration. Dr. Shi's path to this breakthrough began with childhood fascinations with puzzles and pattern recognition, skills that would later prove invaluable in decoding the complex language of glycosylation. Working under the mentorship of Nobel laureate Carolyn Bertozzi and renowned neurobiologist Tony Wyss-Coray at Stanford, she bridged two distinct fields, glycobiology and neuroscience, to tackle questions others had overlooked. How do you study molecules so structurally complex that they've resisted traditional analysis methods? What techniques can capture the dynamic nature of glycosylation in living brain tissue? Dr. Shi's innovative solutions to these problems exemplify the power of cross-disciplinary thinking in modern biomedical research. Perhaps more remarkably, she is launching her independent laboratory at Harvard's prestigious Rowland Institute directly from doctoral training -- a rare achievement that speaks to the transformative potential of her discoveries. "Post-translational modifications like glycosylation have been understudied for too long," Dr. Shi notes. "These modifications can completely transform protein function, yet we're only beginning to understand their role in brain health and disease." Her work positions glycoscience at the forefront of neurodegeneration research, challenging long-held assumptions about therapeutic targets. This precision approach could lead to treatments that address the root causes of neurodegeneration rather than merely managing symptoms. Intriguing questions emerge from this work: Can glycocalyx restoration prevent or slow Alzheimer's disease progression in humans? How early in the aging process do these protective molecules begin to deteriorate? What environmental or genetic factors influence glycocalyx health throughout the lifespan? These questions will drive the next phase of Dr. Shi's research program at Harvard. Beyond her scientific contributions, Dr. Shi is committed to fostering diversity in science. Dr. Shi's appreciation for hiking and trail running mirrors her approach to research: seeking new perspectives from challenging vantage points. Dr. Shi's discoveries raise fundamental questions about how we approach brain aging and disease. These considerations could reshape preventive medicine approaches for brain health. This new perspective demands innovative research approaches and may explain why previous therapeutic strategies targeting the barrier have shown limited success. Dr. Sophia Shi's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist's impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study published June 12 in the Cell Press journal Current Biology demonstrated that scientists can identify individuals based solely on their breathing patterns with 96.8% accuracy. These nasal respiratory "fingerprints" also offer insights into physical and mental health. This link between the brain and breathing led researchers to wonder: since every brain is unique, wouldn't each person's breathing pattern reflect that? Most breathing tests last just one to 20 minutes, focusing on evaluating lung function or diagnosing disease. But those brief snapshots aren't enough to capture subtle patterns. "You would think that breathing has been measured and analyzed in every way," says author Noam Sobel of the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. "Yet we stumbled upon a completely new way to look at respiration. Sobel's team fitted 100 healthy young adults with the device and asked them to go about their daily lives. This high-level accuracy remained consistent across multiple retests conducted over a two-year period, rivaling the precision of some voice recognition technologies. "I thought it would be really hard to identify someone because everyone is doing different things, like running, studying, or resting," says author Timna Soroka of the Weizmann Institute of Science. "But it turns out their breathing patterns were remarkably distinct." Moreover, the study found that these respiratory fingerprints correlated with a person's body mass index, sleep-wake cycle, levels of depression and anxiety, and even behavioral traits. For example, participants who scored relatively higher on anxiety questionnaires had shorter inhales and more variability in the pauses between breaths during sleep. Soroka noted that none of the participants met clinical diagnostic criteria for mental or behavioral conditions. The results suggest that long-term nasal airflow monitoring may serve as a window into physical and emotional well-being. A tube that runs under the nose is often associated with illness and may deter adoption. The device also doesn't account for mouth breathing and can slip out of place when sleeping. The team aims to design a more discreet and comfortable version for everyday use. Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

At Walmart, dozens of the company's hand tools are discounted in time for summer projects. So stuff like cordless drills, angle grinders, and impact drivers that typically cost you an arm and a leg now cost merely an arm. All kidding aside, we rounded up some of the best deals on premium Milwaukee power tools at Walmart so you don't have to wait until next month's Prime Day. Chances are, even then, you still won't find deals like this. Featuring a powerful brushless motor designed specifically for this device, this angle grinder delivers an impressive 8,500 rpm for a variety of cutting jobs. It can cut up to 135 times per charge, and the paddle switch is both ergonomic and easy to use in a variety of positions. These reliable Redlithium units are compatible with over 150 M18 cordless tools, including the aforementioned angle grinder. Featuring a convenient fuel gauge to monitor run-time through an intricate series of lights, these reliable, durable batteries are far superior to any of their aftermarket opponents, thanks to long-lasting performance and built-in protections against adverse job-site conditions. And with overload protection from overheating and a three-year warranty, the nearly 60 percent savings sound too good to be true, frankly. Everyone needs a reliable ratchet set in their car, and you can't get much more reliable than this ultra-convenient lithium-ion kit from Milwaukee. Delivering 35 foot-pounds of torque, this powerful set has a built-in LED light, eliminating the need for an extra flashlight, as well as a battery indicator. Delivering up to 1,500 inch-pounds of torque, this is a hard-working impact driver that's compact enough to work in tight spaces. It's only 5 inches long and has four drive modes based on the power output you desire, along with an additional self-tapping screw mode. Reaching up to 3,600 rpm in Mode 3, this is one of the most powerful drivers you'll find at this size and comparable to the larger Milwaukee M18 Fuel 2953-20 Impact Driver, our favorite overall unit, which reaches up to 3,900 rpm in a much heavier frame. If you're looking for an impact driver that's a little more budget-friendly (even before the discount!) With a trigger that adjusts the driver speed based on how far you pull it in, a keyless chuck for quick bit changes, and an ergonomic handle for prolonged use, it's plenty user-friendly. A convenient autostop mode helps to prevent over-rotation during bind-ups, and the brushless motor delivers rugged performance under load. We love the premium all-metal ratcheting chuck, which offers enhanced grip strength, durability, and corrosion resistance—and it's now over 60 percent off. And despite its small frame, it still, expectedly, packs a punch. Featuring four-mode drive control for precise fastening and easy control when you're removing fasteners, this intuitive device is worthy of being a staple of your toolbox. Save over $85 on this powerful grinder that delivers up to a whopping 20,000 rpm—equivalent to that of a corded device. Made for a variety of applications, including engraving, cylinder head porting, and the general shaping of a part, it can deburr up to 35 pipes in one charge. Not all of the tools here come with a charger. This one is compatible with MX FuelT Batteries, which are included in quite a number of Milwaukee power tools. This sheet sander is a worthy addition to your garage or shop. For starters, it collects up to 95 percent of dust, thanks largely to the durable cotton dust bag and the universal hose adapter that's compatible with a wide array of vacuum sizes and models. Low vibration levels make this a smooth process (pun intended), all while cutting down on hand fatigue. He has a strong affinity for cats, Batman, and early 90's Nicolas Cage films, in that order.
