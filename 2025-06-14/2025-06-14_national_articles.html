Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions. Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. ‘Fox News Live' panelists Jonathan Fahey and Ren McEachern react to the shooting of multiple Minnesota lawmakers in their homes and the manhunt for suspects police believe carried out the targeted attacks. Authorities have reportedly identified a suspect wanted in connection with an early-morning shooting that left one Minnesota lawmaker and her husband dead, and a second lawmaker and his wife injured. Boelter is reportedly the CEO of Red Lion Group, based in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Praetorian Guard Security Services, according to Minnesota Africans United's website. Boelter's family members and Minnesota Africans United did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. "I have been doing projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo in Central Africa for the last three years with the Red Lion Group," Boelter wrote on his LinkedIn page last month, noting that he is currently open to work. Boelter reportedly earned his undergraduate degree in International Relations at St. A map showing where the two shootings took place in Minnesota. Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman were fatally shot in Brooklyn Park early Saturday in what Gov. Tim Walz described as "targeted political violence." "We must all, in Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence," Walz said. "Those responsible for this will be held accountable." According to authorities, the gunman was allegedly dressed as a uniformed police officer and was driving a vehicle that appeared to be outfitted as a fake patrol car. "[The] suspect exploited the trust of our uniforms, what our uniforms are meant to represent," Public Safety Commissioner Bob Jacobson said. "That betrayal is deeply disturbing to those of us who wear the badge with honor and responsibility." According to authorities, the gunman allegedly escaped through a back door of Hortman's house following an exchange of gunfire with police. Authorities reportedly discovered a pile of "No Kings" protest flyers inside a vehicle believed to be tied to the gunman. State Police Col. Christina Bogojevic asked people to not attend any of the "No Kings" protests scheduled throughout the state Saturday. Bogojevic said authorities do not have any evidence that the suspect would be targeting the protests, but added that police had discovered a pile of "No Kings" flyers inside a vehicle believed to be tied to the gunman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch live coverage of the U.S. military parade in Washington, D.C. PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Demonstrators crowded into streets, parks and plazas across the U.S. Saturday to rally against President Donald Trump as officials urged calm and mobilized National Guard troops ahead a military parade to mark the Army's 250th anniversary that coincides with the president's birthday. Atlanta's 5,000-capacity “No Kings” rally quickly reached its limit, with thousands more demonstrators outside the barrier to hear speakers in front of the state Capitol. Intermittent light rain fell as sign-carrying marchers gathered for the flagship rally in Philadelphia's Love Park, and shouted “Whose streets? Our streets!” as they marched down Ben Franklin Parkway to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Karen Van Trieste, a 61-year-old nurse who drove up from Maryland, said she grew up in Philadelphia and wanted to be with a large group of people showing her support. “I just feel like we need to defend our democracy,” she said. In some places, organizers handed out little American flags while other demonstrators brought larger versions to wave amid signs that ranged from pro-democracy and immigrant-rights messages to a variety of anti-Trump sentiments. Demonstrators dressed in Revolutionary War era clothing march down Benjamin Franklin Parkway during the “No Kings” protest, Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Philadelphia. In Charlotte, North Carolina, crowds cheered anti-Trump speakers in the city's First Ward Park and chanted “we have no kings” before marching behind a “No Kings” banner. Protests were planned in nearly 2,000 locations across the country, from city blocks and small towns to courthouse steps and community parks, organizers said, but no events are scheduled in Washington, D.C., where the military parade will take place in the evening. The demonstrations come on the heels of protests that flared up across the country over federal immigration enforcement raids that began last week and Trump ordering the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, where protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire. Thousands gathered in downtown Love Park, with organizers handing out small American flags and many people carrying protest signs saying things like “fight oligarchy” and “deport the mini-Mussolinis” as they waited for the march to start. Demonstrators march during the “No Kings” protest, Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Philadelphia. “Out of an abundance of caution my Department of Public Safety is recommending that people do not attend any political rallies today in Minnesota until the suspect is apprehended,” he wrote. About a thousand people gathered on the grounds of Florida's old Capitol in Tallahassee, where protesters chanted, “This is what community looks like,” and carried signs with messages like “one nation under distress” and “dissent is patriotic.” Organizers say that one march will go to the gates of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis warned demonstrators that the “line is very clear” between peaceful demonstration and violence, and not to cross it. Demonstrators march down Benjamin Franklin Parkway during the “No Kings” protest, Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Philadelphia. Republican governors in Virginia, Texas, Nebraska and Missouri were mobilizing National Guard troops to help law enforcement manage demonstrations. There will be “zero tolerance” for violence, destruction or disrupting traffic, and “if you violate the law, you're going to be arrested,” Virginia Gov. Some law enforcement agencies announced they were ramping up efforts for the weekend. In California, state troopers were on “tactical alert,” which means all days off are canceled for all officers, while West Virginia's governor put the state police and National Guard on standby. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, called for peaceful protests over the weekend, to ensure Trump doesn't send military to the state. “Donald Trump wants to be able to say that we cannot handle our own public safety in Washington state,” Ferguson said. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, urged protesters “to remain peaceful and calm as they exercise their First Amendment right to make their voices heard.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palestinian families were yet again evacuating southern Gaza on Friday following an Israeli military strike targeting an area in Khan Younis. Two Palestinians ride a small boat at the seafront next to a tent camp in the Gaza City port, Friday, June 13, 2025. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — At least 20 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip overnight and into Saturday, according to local health officials. The 20-month war with Hamas has raged on even as Israel has opened a new front with heavy strikes on Iran that sparked retaliatory drone and missile attacks. Another 11 Palestinians were killed overnight near food distribution points run by an Israeli- and U.S.-supported humanitarian group in the latest of almost daily shootings near the sites since they opened last month. Palestinian witnesses say Israeli forces have fired on the crowds, while the military says it has only fired warning shots near people it describes as suspects who approached its forces. Israel's military said it fired warning shots overnight to distance a group of people near troops operating in the Netzarim corridor, and an aircraft struck a person who kept advancing. Al-Awda Hospital said it received eight bodies and at least 125 wounded people from a shooting near a GHF site in central Gaza. In the southern city of Khan Younis, Nasser Hospital said it received 16 dead, including five women, from multiple Israeli strikes late Friday and early Saturday. It said another three men were killed near two GHF aid sites in the southernmost city of Rafah, now a mostly uninhabited military zone. Israel's military said it was unaware of any gunfire there during that time overnight. An Israeli strike in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, killed four people, Al-Aqsa Hospital said. Meanwhile, Israel's military said two projectiles came from Gaza and fell in open areas, with no injuries. Israel and the United States say the new aid system is intended to replace a U.N.-run network that has distributed aid across Gaza through 20 months of war. They accuse Hamas of siphoning off the aid and reselling it to fund its militant activities. U.N. officials deny Hamas has diverted significant amounts of aid and say the new system is unable to meet mounting needs. They say the new system has militarized aid by allowing Israel to decide who has access and by forcing Palestinians to travel long distances or relocate again after waves of displacement. They say the U.N. has struggled to deliver aid even after Israel eased its blockade last month because of military restrictions and rising lawlessness. Hamas, which is allied with Iran, sparked the war when its fighters led a rampage into southrn Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. They still hold 53 hostages, less than half of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed over 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which has said women and children make up more than half of the dead but does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in count. The war has drawn in Iran and its other allies across the region, igniting a chain of events that led to Israel's major strikes on Iran's nuclear and military facilities on Friday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Lawmaker killed: Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman — the top Democrat in the Minnesota House — and her husband were shot and killed early this morning in “what appears to be a politically motivated assassination,” according to Gov. • Second targeted: Minnesota State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot by the same individual, Walz said. • List found in suspect's car: What officials are calling a “manifesto” identifying “many lawmakers and other officials” was found when law enforcement searched the vehicle of the suspect wanted in the assassination of Hortman, according to police. • Manhunt underway: The suspect is at large, and a massive manhunt is underway, officials said at the news conference. Law enforcement found a hit list in the Minnesota suspect's car that contained nearly 70 names, a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN. Law enforcement also found a Father's Day card addressed to the suspect in a bag full of ammunition, the official said. Former President Joe Biden condemned the recent shootings targeting lawmakers in Minnesota on Saturday. Biden called on Americans to stand united against hate and extremism. “We must give hate and extremism no safe harbor, and we must all unite against political violence as a nation,” the former president wrote in a post on X. “Jill and I are sending strength to everyone affected by this senseless tragedy during an unimaginable time,” Biden concluded. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the agency is monitoring the “horrific shooting” of state lawmakers in Minnesota after state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were shot and killed early this morning in what Gov. Tim Walz said “appears to be a politically motivated assassination.” “DHS is monitoring the horrific shooting of two Minnesota legislators in Brooklyn Park and Champlin,” Noem wrote in a post on X. The secretary added that the department is in contact with interagency partners and pledged to provide updates as more information becomes available. ”I am sickened by the assassination of Speaker Hortman and the attack on Senator Hoffman,” Frey said, noting that he has been in contact with our the Minneapolis Police Commissioner, chief and safety partners “all morning.” We have been working with our federal, state and local partners. For safety reasons, we cannot provide specific details about our security posture,” the US Capitol Police said in a statement to CNN Saturday. Capitol Police are checking in with members of Congress to inform them that they were listed in the shooter's alleged manifesto, one source told CNN. Congressional leaders condemned political violence on Saturday after a Minnesota state representative and her husband were shot and killed early in the morning. “Such horrific political violence has no place in our society, and every leader must unequivocally condemn it. Our prayers are with the Hortman and Hoffman families as well as the people of Minnesota during this tragic time,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said in an X post. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a post on X: “The targeted shootings of Minnesota Senator John Hoffman and State Rep. Melissa Hortman are deeply disturbing. Praying hard for the victims and all who have been affected.” “The ghastly targeted shootings of Sen. Hoffman and Rep. Hortman are not just horrific—they're acts of political extremism and an assault on our democracy itself. We must stand united against political violence in all forms—and bring those responsible to swift and full justice. My heart aches for the victims and their families,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in an X post. Tim Walz said “appears to be a politically-motivated assassination.” Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were also targeted by the same individual and each shot multiple times, Walz said. Col. Christina Bogojevic with the Minnesota State Patrol has asked residents to not attend demonstration events planned throughout the state Saturday, citing safety concerns. “Given the targeted shootings of state law lawmakers that happened overnight, we are asking the public to not attend today's planned demonstrations across Minnesota out of an abundance of caution,” Bogojevic said during a news conference Saturday while adding that “there were some flyers that said, ‘no kings' within the suspect vehicle.” Remember: More than 1,800 protests across all 50 states are planned through the “No Kings” movement, which organizers say seeks to reject “authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarization of our democracy.” Another official, Drew Evans, Superintendent, Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, Minnesota Department of Public Safety said part of the reason for asking the public not to participate in planned protests is due to the fact there's a “very active” manhunt underway. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for unity “against political violence in all forms,” in a post on X following the politically motivated attacks on Minnesota lawmakers overnight. “The ghastly targeted shootings of Sen. Hoffman and Rep. Hortman are not just horrific—they're acts of political extremism and an assault on our democracy itself,” the New York Democrat wrote. “We must stand united against political violence in all forms—and bring those responsible to swift and full justice. My heart aches for the victims and their families,” he added. “I am heartbroken and horrified by the tragic loss of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were taken from us in an act of violence,” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar wrote in a post on X. “Melissa was a good friend and we started in politics at the same time and were always there for each other. Melissa's legacy will endure, but today we grieve deeply. Former Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, now the head of national gun violence prevention organization GIFFORDS, said in a statement that she is “devastated” about Hortman's death. “There will be more to say, but this much is clear: we must protect our democracy from those who try to destroy it with a gun,” added Giffords, who was one of 13 people wounded in an Arizona supermarket parking lot in 2011. What officials are calling a “manifesto” identifying “many lawmakers and other officials,” was found when law enforcement searched the vehicle of the suspect wanted in the assassination of Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley. A “No Kings” event that was planned to take place in Northeast Minneapolis today has since been canceled because of a shelter-in-place order following the attacks on two Minnesota state lawmakers, according to organizers. A grassroots group called Indivisible Twin Cities said it's still holding a “No Kings”-related event — but the group now plans to gather outside of the state Capitol building. In the face of this horror, we will mourn and mark our determination for a peaceful, just, democratic future,” the group said on social media. “Our leadership team is in touch with authorities at the Capitol and will share any updates.” More background: Millions of Americans are expected to attend “No Kings” protests across the country to denounce what organizers describe as President Donald Trump's authoritarian policies and “militarization of our democracy.” It comes on the same day Trump will preside over a military parade in Washington, DC. Local police have issued a shelter-in-place order amid an “active investigation” in the Minneapolis suburbs of Brooklyn Park and Champlin, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said at news conference this morning. President Donald Trump has been briefed on the shootings in Minnesota that appear to have been “a targeted attack against state lawmakers,” the White House said Saturday. “I have been briefed on the terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota, which appears to be a targeted attack against State Lawmakers,” the president said in a statement released by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on X. “Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. Law enforcement was first called around 2 a.m. local time on Saturday with reports that someone had shot Minnesota State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. Around 3:35 a.m., another call came in when officers were proactively checking on Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman's home. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived, they noticed that there was a police vehicle in the driveway with emergency lights on and what appeared to be a police officer at the door, coming out of the house, officials said. That individual immediately fired a weapon at them, Evans said, and an exchange of gunfire took place, during which the suspect was able to escape. The Brooklyn Park Police Department, along with other law enforcement agencies from the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety State Patrol and FBI, and BCA are now actively engaged in a manhunt for the suspect they believe is responsible for both shootings, Evans said. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said she is closely monitoring what appears to be a targeted attack against state lawmakers in Minnesota on Saturday and vowed swift and full prosecution for those responsible. “I am closely monitoring developments in Minnesota after what appears to be a targeted attack against state lawmakers,” Bondi said in a post on X. Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman, a mother of two, grew up in Spring Lake Park and Andover, according to a previous campaign page. She was elected to the state House of Representatives in 2004. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said the FBI is “fully engaged” on the ground in Minnesota after Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were shot and killed early this morning in “what appears to be a politically motivated assassination,” according to Minnesota Gov. Authorities are searching for a male wearing black body armor and a blue shirt who may have impersonated law enforcement, one law enforcement source told CNN. Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were shot and killed early Saturday morning in “what appears to be a politically motivated assassination,” Minnesota Gov. “The Hoffmans are out of surgery at this time and receiving care, and we are cautiously optimally optimistic, they will survive this assassination attempt,” the governor said.</p>

President Donald Trump said that those who hate the U.S. and attempt to protest the parade will face a 'heavy force' in response. WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's military parade honoring the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary is set to kick off at 6:30 p.m. Saturday in the nation's capital, but the patriotic event also is expected to face protests and gloomy weather. The patriotic event is part of Trump's "Task Force 250," which was established in January by an executive order and coordinates plans celebrating the 250th anniversary of American independence on July 4, 2026. The parade, however, comes as riots and protests continue in Los Angeles over the Trump administration's immigration efforts to deport millions of illegal aliens who flooded the nation under the Biden administration, and after Israel launched preemptive strikes on Iran Thursday evening. The parade is also slated to face stormy weather, with forecasters predicting thunderstorms Saturday afternoon and rain going into the evening. Army helicopters, including Black Hawks, Apaches, Chinooks and other military aircraft, will be used in the upcoming U.S. Army's 250th birthday parade, which also coincides with Flag Day and U.S. President Trump's birthday. In Washington, visitors and locals can expect the Refuse Fascism protest, an "equity march" in downtown D.C., as well as a "Pro-Democracy Picnic" at Fort Reno Park, Fox News Digital found. "No Kings" protesters are anticipated to converge on cities nationwide to protest what they say is Trump leading the nation like a "king," though there will not be a "No Kings" protests in D.C. proper on Saturday. Instead, such protests will be held in neighboring towns and cities, such as in the Virginia cities of Alexandria and Arlington. Army soldiers dressed in historic uniforms ahead of the US Army's 250th Anniversary Parade in Washington, June 13, 2025. Trump was asked about the "No Kings" protest during a Thursday bill-signing event at the White House, which sparked Trump to quip he "doesn't feel like a king." "I don't feel like a king," Trump responded. A king would say, 'I'm not gonna get this.' A king would have never had the California mandate to even be talking. He wouldn't have to call up (Speaker) Mike Johnson and (Senate Majority Leader John) Thune and say, ‘Fellas you got to pull this off' and after years we get it done," he said, referring to three resolutions he signed Thursday ending electric vehicle mandates originating in California. Trump previously said that any potential violent protesters targeting the parade will be met with a "very heavy force." President Donald Trump will host a military parade marking the 250th birthday of the US Army, as well as his own 79th birthday, June 14, 2025. "If there's any protest once they come out, they will be met with very big force," Trump told reporters Tuesday. "I haven't even heard about a protest. But people that hate our country … they will be met with very heavy force." "In celebration of 250 years of the U.S. Army, we will throw the biggest and most beautiful military parade in our nation's history." "The president is planning an historic celebration of the Army's 250th birthday that will honor generations of selfless Americans who have risked everything for our freedom," White House Domestic Policy Council Director Vince Haley added in comment to Fox Digital in May, previewing the parade. We owe our freedom to them and to every solider who has given their life for our nation in the 2½ centuries since." US President Donald Trump will host a military parade marking the 250th birthday of the US Army, as well as his own 79th birthday, on June 14. Approximately 6,600 U.S. Army soldiers will participate in the parade. A military parade honoring the Army's 250th anniversary will be held after Trump's "Task Force 250" executive order in January. The parade comes after Israel launched preemptive strikes on Iran Thursday evening following months of attempted and stalled nuclear negotiations and subsequent heightened concern Iran was advancing its nuclear program. The strikes targeted Iran's nuclear and missile infrastructure, and killed at least four Iranian military leaders. Iran has said the strikes were a "declaration of war." I told them what to do, but they just couldn't get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!" Trump posted to Truth Social on Friday ahead of meeting with his National Security Council to discuss the strikes. Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman and Peter Pinedo contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot and killed early Saturday morning in “what appears to be a politically motivated assassination,” Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said at a news conference Saturday. Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were also targeted by the same individual and each shot multiple times, Walz said. “The Hoffmans are out of surgery at this time and receiving care, and we are cautiously optimally optimistic, they will survive this assassination attempt,” the governor said. “This is a very large scale search,” Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said. Bruley also said a “manifesto” identifying “many lawmakers and other officials” was found when law enforcement searched Boelter's vehicle. A law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN law enforcement found a hit list in the Minnesota suspect's car that contained nearly 70 names. Law enforcement was first called around 2 a.m. local time on Saturday with reports that someone had shot Hoffman and his wife. Around 3:35 a.m., another call came in when officers were proactively checking on Hortman's home. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived they noticed that there was a police vehicle in the driveway with emergency lights on and what appeared to be a police officer at the door, coming out of the house, officials said. That individual immediately fired a weapon at them, Evans said, and exchanged gunfire took place during which the suspect was able to escape on foot. The Brooklyn Park Police Department, along with other law enforcement agencies from the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety State Patrol, the FBI and BCA are now actively engaged in a manhunt for Boelter, who they believe is responsible for both shootings, Evans said. “If somebody comes to the door and they knock on the door claiming to be a police officer, please do a couple things: One, call 911 and confirm that the officer belongs there. If they are a police officer, dispatch will be able to confirm that that person is police officer,” Bruley said, addressing the community. “Also, we informed all our officers in Brooklyn Park that they are not to approach anybody by themselves. We are monitoring the situation closely and will share more information soon,” Walz said in a post on X. The Brooklyn Park Police Department issued a shelter-in-place order in a 3-mile radius of Edinburgh Golf Course Saturday morning, according to the City of Brooklyn Park. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has assigned additional police resources to “check on the safety of public officials who may be at risk, and to actively participate in the manhunt.” I'm thankful for all the law enforcement who are responding in real time,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar said in a post on X. “My prayers are with the Hortman and Hoffman families. Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, now the head of national gun violence prevention organization GIFFORDS, said in a statement on Saturday that she is “horrified and heartbroken by last night's attack on two patriotic public servants.” “My family and I know the horror of a targeted shooting all too well. Leaders must speak out and condemn the fomenting violent extremism that threatens everything this country stands for,” Giffords, who was one of 13 people wounded in a shooting in an Arizona supermarket parking lot in 2011, added. Congressional leaders condemned the political violence in posts on social media. “Such horrific political violence has no place in our society, and every leader must unequivocally condemn it. Our prayers are with the Hortman and Hoffman families as well as the people of Minnesota during this tragic time,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said in an X post. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a post on X: “The targeted shootings of Minnesota Senator John Hoffman and State Rep. Melissa Hortman are deeply disturbing. Praying hard for the victims and all who have been affected.” This is a developing story and will be updated.</p>

Education Secretary Linda McMahon discusses the Trump administration's actions on transgender athletes in women's sports on ‘The Faulkner Focus.' EXCLUSIVE: More than two months have passed since women's fencer Stephanie Turner went viral after being punished by USA Fencing for kneeling in protest of a trans opponent. And after nine weeks of immense public and federal scrutiny against USA Fencing in the aftermath of the incident, the organization amended two of its most controversial policies last weekend. The organization's board of directors changed its rule to de-prioritized states with laws deemed "harmful" to the LGBTQ population and a rule that did not guarantee the national anthem be played before every event. Whether to play the national anthem or not should have never been in question. "It makes me wonder if these policies were put into place to punish conservatives and red states. There needs to be a shakeup in USA Fencing's leadership and an audit of their social media and online platforms." U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) (C) speaks to Stephanie Turner (L), a fencer who refused to compete against a transgender athlete, and Payton McNabb (R), a former North Carolina high school volleyball player who was injured by a transgender opponent during the hearing on "Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" held by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Subcommittee at the U.S. Capitol on May 7, 2025, in Washington, D.C.  (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) Turner stepped away from competing in USA Fencing after receiving a 12-month probation for refusing to face trans athlete Redmond Sullivan at the Cherry Blossom Open in Maryland in late March. USA Fencing announced in late April that it is preparing to change its gender-eligibility policy. The men's category "will be open to all other athletes who are otherwise eligible for competition." However, that new policy has not been officially put in place. The incident involving Turner also prompted a Title IX investigation by President Donald Trump's administration and a congressional hearing in May. USA Fencing Chair Damien Lehfeldt was grilled by Republican lawmakers at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Subcommittee's "Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" hearing on May 7. After the hearing, Turner told Fox News Digital that she would devote herself and her platform to pushing for resignations among key leadership figures in USA Fencing. I'd like to see some people resign for the comments that they've made, especially publicly, ones that are harassing and meant to humiliate concerned women, mothers and daughters," Turner said. The organization's policy of prioritizing states with pro-LGBTQ laws was a particular point of scrutiny during the hearing by DOGE Subcommittee Chairwoman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. "In selecting sites for its national fencing events, for instance, the board policy is to avoid states whose laws and policies on LGBTQ rights and abortion it opposes. The previous host site policy placed a number of states on the "do not allow" list were Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas. The states on its "avoid where possible" list included Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Utah, West Virginia, Wyoming, Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. "We merged several overlapping documents into one policy that scores every bid — regardless of state — on cost, safety, and travel convenience. Using this rubric, next season's national events will span nine states including Texas, Missouri, Florida, Utah, Ohio, Virginia, Oregon, Tennessee and Nevada," read a statement to Fox News Digital. USA Fencing has also provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the new anthem policy. The Board simply wrote that long‑standing practice into policy and added that it will also be played on any U.S. holiday that occurs during an event, such as Independence Day, which falls during our upcoming Summer Nationals," the statement read.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk signaled late Friday night that he is providing Iranians with Starlink satellite internet after conservative analyst Mark Levin asked him to turn the service on in Iran during Israel‘s conflict with the country. Iran restricted internet access for millions of people following Israel's strike on the country. There hasn't been a complete block of traffic, however, as Levin's post suggested. ⚠️ Confirmed: Analysis shows a decline in international internet traffic from #Iran, corroborating user reports of poor service, with gateway and virtual server providers particularly impacted as the Ministry of Communications announces temporary internet restrictions; the… pic.twitter.com/a8iEiZqunW Starlink's website does not list Starlink service as available in Iran, though it is available in Jordan, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. Despite this, Musk appears to be able to activate service in areas of need like his activation of it in a Gaza hospital last year. Musk's likely hopes to boost resistance to Islamic rule in Iran with his activation of Starlink in the country. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu encouraged the populace to rise up against its rule. Israel hit Iran with a surprise attack on Thursday, killing multiple high-ranking military leaders and damaging nuclear sites. Iran responded with a missile barrage of its own against Israel, though few made it through to the country's capital of Tel Aviv. Iran launched several waves of missiles toward Israeli military centers and air bases, and Israel restarted strikes on Iran's capital of Tehran. Iranian state media said Israel hit the provinces of East Azerbaijan, Lorestan and Kermanshah. An exact death toll from Israeli strikes on Iran is unclear, but Iran's United Nations envoy said at least 78 people were killed on Friday, and hundreds have been injured. Iranian strikes on Israel have killed at least three and injured dozens.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum this spring to Iran's Supreme Leader: Strike a nuclear deal in 60 days, by mid-June, or face consequences. But even as Trump administration figures were publicly projecting determination to pursue a diplomatic solution, Israel was privately warning the US that it had already decided to attack. Late last month, a small group of House lawmakers visited Netanyahu in Jerusalem, where he stated firmly that Israel was going to strike Iran – and they were not seeking permission from the US to do so, according to a person who attended the meeting and another person briefed on it. In response, two of the lawmakers in attendance May 26, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas and Rep. Michael Lawler of New York, urged Israel to coordinate with the US and stressed that the country must let Trump's 60-day ultimatum for Iran run its course. “This didn't just happen overnight,” the attendee told CNN, adding that Trump's 60-day deadline “was not a bluff.” The attack was much longer in the making – the result of years of meticulous planning by Israel and days of high-stakes talks between Tel Aviv and Washington, according to officials CNN spoke to in both countries. It has long been a priority for Israel to destroy Iran's nuclear capability, which Netanyahu described Friday as a “threat to Israel's very survival.” The Trump administration knew in advance it was coming and that Netanyahu was unlikely to be dissuaded, with the US rallying international pressure on Iran even as diplomats sought to keep negotiations alive to the last minute. Trump has long fashioned himself a dealmaker and, after pulling the US out of the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal in 2018, made clear at the beginning of his second term that he would like to find a new diplomatic solution with Iran. But in the intervening years, Iran had made significant strides toward obtaining a nuclear weapon. The president and top officials had asserted Iran could not obtain a nuclear weapon – but it was unclear whether they would allow Iran to enrich uranium, which hawks in the US and Israel strongly opposed, or how any deal would be different from the Obama agreement. Israel, meanwhile, was watching Iran's enrichment efforts with heightened concern and making meticulous plans for an attack. The officials said Israel also established a base for launching explosive drones inside Iran. Trump had long warned of potential military strikes if a new nuclear deal wasn't reached, and Tehran, in turn, said that any attack on it would drag the US into a broader Middle Eastern conflict. The group last met for talks on May 23 in Rome – three days before Netanyahu told US lawmakers he planned to strike – with a sixth round initially scheduled for Sunday in Muscat. On Thursday, hours before the Israeli strikes began, the International Atomic Energy Agency board, a United Nations nuclear watchdog, met and adopted a resolution declaring Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations. The resolution ultimately passed with 19 nations voting in favor, three against, and 11 abstentions, according to Reuters. Two days earlier, the US sent a demarche to eight countries that it viewed as potentially persuadable, urging them to either vote with the US on the IAEA vote or not vote at all, according to a US official. Witkoff is “ready” to meet Iranian officials when they are, whether it be in Oman on Sunday as previously scheduled or at some date thereafter, according to a source familiar with discussions. Trump suggested Friday that Iranian officials had been in touch with him as he continued to express optimism about a deal. “They're calling me to speak,” Trump said in an interview with NBC News. The US had a relatively clear picture of the scope of the Israeli operation as early as last week, when some intelligence officials were already receiving multiple updates daily and were planning for different contingencies depending on how Iran responded, according to one source with direct knowledge of that planning. On Sunday evening and Monday, Trump and top advisers, including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, huddled at Camp David for previously scheduled meetings on a number of foreign policy issues. That same weekend Witkoff engaged in direct messaging with his Iranian counterpart in the talks, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, according to a source familiar with the matter. It was unclear what prompted the proposal of a new concept, but by Friday, some people involved in the talks began to think that it was a stalling tactic by Witkoff. But a senior administration official said no stalling tactics were used, with Witkoff working “from the outset to reach a deal under the timeline set by President Trump.” Before he departed Camp David, the president and Netanyahu spoke by phone to discuss Iran. During their call, Trump asked Netanyahu to stop talking about an attack on Iran, a source familiar with the conversation said, and halt the leaks and reports about plans. “We're trying to make a deal so that there's no destruction and death. Trump's rhetoric was becoming less optimistic at the same time US officials were beginning to believe that Iran was not going to accept a deal with the US terms. Public signs that something was afoot began to emerge on Wednesday afternoon, US time, when the US State Department prepared to order the departure of non-essential personnel from the US embassy in Iraq and US consulate in Erbil, as well as nonessential personnel and family members at the US embassies in Bahrain and Kuwait, due to what sources described as increased security risks in the region. “We have a lot of American people in this area, and I said, look, we gotta tell them to get out cause something could happen – soon. And I don't want to be the one that didn't give any warning and missiles are flying into their buildings,” he said. They were not always successful in getting through; Tulsi Gabbard, for example, was unable to reach her Israeli counterpart. Trump convened a Cabinet-level meeting Thursday as the strikes took place. “Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense. President Trump and the Administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners. Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.” Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress were not surprised that Israel took the step, though some were privately taken aback by the scope. House Speaker Mike Johnson was briefed ahead of the strikes on Thursday, one person said, though there was no Gang of Eight briefing in Congress, per two congressional sources. Top lawmakers, including committee leaders, were scrambling for briefings from the administration on Thursday night and Friday. And even though US diplomats had worried about the increasing likelihood of an Israeli strike on Iran, they were still surprised when it happened Thursday night. Going into the attacks, intelligence officials believed Iran would have to take stock of what they had left before retaliating, a US official said. If the latter, officials expected Iran could respond with strategic strikes using what was left of their most sophisticated weapons and terror attacks using their various proxy groups in the region. “This was a full-spectrum blitz,” said another source familiar with early damage assessments. By Friday night, Iran had carried out attacks on “dozens of targets, military centers and air bases,” belonging to Israel, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement. It was not clear how much more would be coming. The US is also closely monitoring events in Iraq, where there is a particular concern about the safety of US troops – not only because of the proximity to the Iranian border but also because there are a number of deeply ideological proxy militia groups loyal to Iran operating there. And although US intelligence officials believe Iran will respond to Israel directly first, they also believe it's possible that Iran may eventually launch cyber attacks against domestic US critical infrastructure in retaliation. “The situation is pretty fluid,” a US official said Friday as Iran's response began.</p>

Matthew Fagiana discussed security measures and how local and federal law enforcement officers are keeping the public safe on No Kings Day protests across the U.S. Thousands of people are expected to rally in hundreds of cities across America on Saturday to protest the Trump administration and counter the president's military parade in Washington, D.C. to mark the Army's 250th birthday. The counter-protesters are framing their demonstrations under the slogan "No Kings," describing it as a "day of defiance" against Trump and his allies while other have been calling for the president to be "dethroned." Thousands of people are expected to rally in hundreds of cities across America on Saturday to protest the Trump administration and counter the president's military parade in Washington, D.C. to mark the Army's 250th birthday. One of their key issues is Trump's mass deportation programs, which they oppose. Last week, protests against Trump's immigration crackdown turned violent in Los Angeles, with Trump calling in the National Guard to quell the chaos. Trump will be in the nation's capital to watch the parade, which will feature around 6,600 troops and 150 military vehicles, along with historical reenactments and performances by military bands. Trump wants the parade to demonstrate American military strength and patriotism. Several overlapping organizations are organizing the rallies, including Indivisible, a progressive group formed in 2016 I the wake of Trump's first election win, the American Civil Liberties Union, and 50501, a group formed earlier this year in response to President Trump's second administration. The name 50501 stands for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement. 505051 has organized several protests this year, including the April 5 "Hands Off" protests, encapsulated a broad range of grievances against the Trump administration, including healthcare and civil liberties concerns. Demonstrators hold various signs, including at a "pro-democracy" rally in Hancock Adams Common on April 19, 2025. Demonstrators are trying to portray President Trump as a king who rules with unchecked power and bypasses laws and court rulings. The flagship march and rally will be taking place in Philadelphia, where the phrase "No Kings But Us" is a common phrase seen on flags and pennants outside of homes. Previously, it was a non-political, revolutionary symbol of anti-monarchy and American pride. Recently, it's been adopted by the anti-Trump organization 50501. A military helicopter in Washington, D.C. for Saturday's parade. Trump on Thursday brushed off the protests' central theme that he is a king. "I don't feel like a king, I have to go through hell to get stuff approved," Trump said. "We're not a king at all, thank you very much," he added. Trump said that any demonstrators who turn up to protest the military parade will be met by a "very big force." "[These] people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force." Protesters see the military parade as an extension of Trump's authoritarian rule and seek to counter it. They want to contrast it with their image of a grassroots movement and draw a sharp line between democratic values and authoritarian aesthetics. Protests are set to take place in over 2,000 cities across all 50 U.S. states, as well as in several international locations. New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, Austin and Houston will host rallies as well as Dallas, Fort Worth, Miami, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Kissimmee and Apopka.

President Donald Trump said that those who hate the U.S. and attempt to protest the parade will face a 'heavy force' in response. As President Donald Trump hosts events on Saturday to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, a new national poll indicates more Americans are likely to approve than disapprove of the president's decision to hold a military parade. But six in 10 Americans are concerned about the cost of the parade, saying it's "not a good use" of government money, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey. Trump, who is marking his 79th birthday on Saturday, is scheduled to give a speech during the parade, which will take place Saturday evening along the National Mall in Washington D.C. Defense officials say roughly 6,600 soldiers will march in the parade, with some 50 military aircraft and 150 vehicles, including tanks, rocket launchers, and missiles. Crews work on setting up an archway on the National Mall, during preparations for an upcoming military parade commemorating the Army's 250th anniversary and coinciding with President Donald Trump's 79th birthday, Thursday, Jun. And we're going to celebrate it," the president said. But some in Congress are criticizing the parade, saying the money could be better spent. "If it was really about celebrating military families, we could put $30 million toward helping them offset the cost of their child care, food assistance and tuition," Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who lost both of her legs in combat while piloting an Army Black Hawk helicopter during the Iraq War, said in a social media post. Trump is throwing himself a $30 million birthday parade just to stroke his own ego," Duckworth argued. According to the poll, 40% of adults nationwide approved of the military parade, with 29% disapproving, and three in 10 neither approving nor disapproving. But in a separate question, 60% of those surveyed said holding the parade was not a good use of government funds, with 38% disagreeing. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans said holding the parade was a good use of government funds, while eight in 10 Democrats disagreed. The White House, in a statement, said that the parade "will be a unifying celebration for not only the thousands in attendance, but Americans across the country who can participate in honoring our active-duty servicemembers, Veterans, and fallen heroes." People pass by and take photos with a tank, parked on the National Mall, during preparations for an upcoming military parade commemorating the Army's 250th anniversary and coinciding with President Donald Trump's 79th birthday, Thursday, Jun. Pro-democracy, progressive, and labor activists are planning protests in all 50 states on Saturday that will coincide with Trump's military parade. Many are part of a series of "No Kings" protests across the country, with more than 1,500 rallies scheduled for this weekend. But organizers decided against holding a major protest in the nation's capital and instead will hold their main event in Philadelphia. The survey had an overall margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump, from left, speaks as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., during an event in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, May 12, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration this week provided deportation officials with personal data -- including the immigration status -- on millions of Medicaid enrollees, a move that could make it easier to locate people as part of his sweeping immigration crackdown. An internal memo and emails obtained by The Associated Press show that Medicaid officials unsuccessfully sought to block the data transfer, citing legal and ethical concerns. S. citizens to enroll in Medicaid programs that pay for their expenses using only state taxpayer dollars. Gavin Newsom 's office said in a statement that it was concerned about how deportation officials might utilize the data, especially as federal authorities conduct immigration raids with the assistance of National Guard troops and Marines in Los Angeles. “This potential data transfer brought to our attention by the AP is extremely concerning, and if true, potentially unlawful, particularly given numerous headlines highlighting potential improper federal use of personal information and federal actions to target the personal information of Americans.” This will only lead to more chaos and pain in our communities.” U.S. Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the data sharing was legal. He declined to answer questions about why the data was shared with DHS and how it would be used. “With respect to the recent data sharing between CMS and DHS, HHS acted entirely within its legal authority — and in full compliance with all applicable laws — to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them,” Nixon said. An official with DHS, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement that Trump “promised to protect Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. To keep that promise after Joe Biden flooded our country with tens of millions of illegal aliens CMS and DHS are exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans.” In May, for example, a federal judge refused to block the Internal Revenue Service from sharing immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help agents locate and detain people living without legal status in the U.S. CMS announced late last month that it was reviewing some state's Medicaid enrollees to ensure federal funds have not been used to pay for coverage for people with “unsatisfactory immigration status.” In a letter sent to state Medicaid officials, CMS said that the effort was part of Trump's Feb. 19 executive order titled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders.” As part of the review, California, Washington and Illinois shared details about non-U. S. citizens who have enrolled in their state's Medicaid program, according to a June 6 memo signed by Medicaid Deputy Director Sara Vitolo that was obtained by the AP. The data includes addresses, names, social security numbers and claims data for enrollees in those states, according to the memo and two people familiar with what the states sent to CMS and what was shared with DHS. CMS officials attempted to fight the data sharing request from Homeland Security, saying that to do so would violate federal laws, including the Social Security Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, according to Vitolo's memo. “Multiple federal statutory and regulatory authorities do not permit CMS to share this information with entities outside of CMS,” Vitolo wrote, further explaining that the sharing of such personal data is only allowed for directly administering the Medicaid program. Sharing information about Medicaid applicants or enrollees with DHS officials would violate a “long-standing policy,” wrote Vitolo, a career employee, to Trump appointee Kim Brandt, deputy administrator and chief operating officer of CMS. Former government officials said the move was unusual because CMS, which has access to personal health data for nearly half the country, does not typically share such sensitive information with other departments. “DHS has no role in anything related to Medicaid,” said Jeffrey Grant, a former career employee at CMS. Beyond her legal arguments, Vitolo said sharing the information with DHS could have a chilling effect on states, perhaps prompting them to withhold information. States, she added needed to guard against the “legal risk” they were taking by giving federal officials data that could be shared with deportation officials. All states must legally provide emergency Medicaid services to non-U. Seven states, along with the District, allow immigrants who are not living legally in the country to enroll — with full benefits — in their state's Medicaid program. All of the states — California, New York, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Minnesota and Colorado — have Democratic governors. Due to his state's budget woes, Newsom announced earlier this year he would freeze enrollment into the program; Illinois will also shut down its program for roughly 30,000 non-U. Illinois health officials also said they were “deeply concerned” by the AP's findings that revealed their state's Medicaid customer information was shared with federal agencies outside of CMS, given that their “understanding (is) that the data is protected under the federal Privacy Act of 1974 and other federal regulations — which protects the rights of Americans' sensitive health and personal data.” State health officials from the District and Washington did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal immigration authorities have continued to target illegal immigrant farmworkers under the Trump administration's mass deportation operation despite President Donald Trump saying on Thursday that he would “soon” put in place protections for agricultural workers, according to the national union that represents workers. Not long after Trump told reporters at the White House that he planned to take action to ensure farmworkers were not the focus of arrest efforts by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and federal police, immigrant rights advocates in one targeted region suggested that nothing had changed in 24 hours, likely because the White House has not yet issued a directive. The United Farm Workers, a labor union for farmworkers in the United States, posted pictures and reports from eyewitnesses in Central California's farming region that Customs and Border Protection agents were going after workers on Friday. “NOW: Border Patrol is continuing raids on farm workers in Ventura County, especially Moorpark and Oxnard,” UFW wrote in a post to X Friday. NOW: Border Patrol is continuing raids on farm workers in Ventura County, especially Moorpark and Oxnard. Earlier this week, UFW found federal police targeting illegal immigrant workers in various California communities. One such video that the UFW shared on X showed two federal police officers who appear to be dressed in green CBP uniforms chasing an immigrant through a field. “Any federal actions designed to terrorize and separate farm worker communities is an attack on Californians and a dangerous waste of resources. Indiscriminate raids and chaotic sweeps put public safety at risk.” Very quickly, the White House received pushback about targeting immigrant workers. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) was quick to blast reports that ICE was targeting farmworkers without legal status to be in the United States. “Turns out, chasing hard working people through ranches and farms and snatching women and children off the streets is not good policy,” Newsom wrote in a post to X Thursday shortly after Trump announced the White House was working to put protections in place for that particular population. “We're going to have an order on that pretty soon, I think,” Trump said Thursday at the White House. “We can't do that to our farmers, and leisure too. Trump said in a post on  Truth Social that “our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace. “Clearly we have to ask: who is actually calling the shots? Trump says he doesn't want federal agencies to go after farm workers, but that's exactly what is happening,” UFW wrote in a post to X Thursday evening. Just weeks ago, White House Deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that ICE should be arresting 3,000 illegal immigrants daily, far beyond the roughly 1,500 arrests the agency has made per day in recent weeks. In some cities, including New York City, plainclothes ICE officers elected to show up in immigration courthouses and arrest immigrants as they showed up for court proceedings because it presented an easy way to nab people at specific times and places. This week, ICE began making arrests at job sites on farms in California. Asked if federal law enforcement would continue to go after illegal immigrants working on farms, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said it is following the White House's orders. “We will follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told the Washington Examiner on Friday afternoon that Trump would address both matters, but did not specify when or how. “President Trump has always stood up for our farmers, who were a major part of his November victory, by working to negotiate fairer trade deals and cut red tape,” Kelly said in a statement. “He will continue to strengthen our agricultural industry and boost exports while keeping his promise to enforce our immigration laws and remove the millions of unvetted illegals who flooded into the United States under [former President] Joe Biden.” Others, including Rep. Maria Salazar (R-FL), are looking at permanent solutions to protect illegal immigrants who work on American farms. “President Trump himself has acknowledged what so many of us already know: long-time workers, many of whom have built their lives in this country, are being taken away. “It's time for Congress to act and bring a solution.” Salazar has promised to co-introduce a “revolutionary” bill to fix the immigration system with Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-TX) by the end of June.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palestinian families were yet again evacuating southern Gaza on Friday following an Israeli military strike targeting an area in Khan Younis. Two Palestinians ride a small boat at the seafront next to a tent camp in the Gaza City port, Friday, June 13, 2025. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — At least 20 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip overnight and into Saturday, according to local health officials. The 20-month war with Hamas has raged on even as Israel has opened a new front with heavy strikes on Iran that sparked retaliatory drone and missile attacks. Another 11 Palestinians were killed overnight near food distribution points run by an Israeli- and U.S.-supported humanitarian group in the latest of almost daily shootings near the sites since they opened last month. Palestinian witnesses say Israeli forces have fired on the crowds, while the military says it has only fired warning shots near people it describes as suspects who approached its forces. Israel's military said it fired warning shots overnight to distance a group of people near troops operating in the Netzarim corridor, and an aircraft struck a person who kept advancing. Al-Awda Hospital said it received eight bodies and at least 125 wounded people from a shooting near a GHF site in central Gaza. In the southern city of Khan Younis, Nasser Hospital said it received 16 dead, including five women, from multiple Israeli strikes late Friday and early Saturday. It said another three men were killed near two GHF aid sites in the southernmost city of Rafah, now a mostly uninhabited military zone. Israel's military said it was unaware of any gunfire there during that time overnight. An Israeli strike in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, killed four people, Al-Aqsa Hospital said. Meanwhile, Israel's military said two projectiles came from Gaza and fell in open areas, with no injuries. Israel and the United States say the new aid system is intended to replace a U.N.-run network that has distributed aid across Gaza through 20 months of war. They accuse Hamas of siphoning off the aid and reselling it to fund its militant activities. U.N. officials deny Hamas has diverted significant amounts of aid and say the new system is unable to meet mounting needs. They say the new system has militarized aid by allowing Israel to decide who has access and by forcing Palestinians to travel long distances or relocate again after waves of displacement. They say the U.N. has struggled to deliver aid even after Israel eased its blockade last month because of military restrictions and rising lawlessness. Hamas, which is allied with Iran, sparked the war when its fighters led a rampage into southrn Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. They still hold 53 hostages, less than half of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed over 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which has said women and children make up more than half of the dead but does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in count. The war has drawn in Iran and its other allies across the region, igniting a chain of events that led to Israel's major strikes on Iran's nuclear and military facilities on Friday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elizabeth Mendoza watched nervously as demonstrators protesting President Donald Trump's immigration raids and policies clashed with police outside of her Compton restaurant, Restaurante Y Pupuseria La Ceiba. “It started with just a few people, then it started growing very quickly,” she told CNN in an interview translated from Spanish. Mendoza, herself an immigrant from El Salvador, has gained notoriety after videos of her and her staff sheltering protesters and helping law enforcement agents in her Los Angeles County restaurant spread across social media. In the late afternoon hours on Saturday, June 7, the protest began to ramp up significantly as demonstrators and officers clashed right in front of her business. At one point, Mendoza recalled seeing the police push the protesters away from her storefront and deploying chemical irritants. “I don't know what happened with the tear gas they threw. Inside the restaurant, video at 5:30 p.m. shows Mendoza and her employees getting water for LA County Sheriff's deputies, fanning their blinking, watering eyes and applying wet towels to their faces. In a video Mendoza uploaded to TikTok, three of her employees can be seen taking care of two officers: One employee holds a cloth to the face of an officer while another fans his face. And I told them to cover yourselves with this. Clashes between protesters and law enforcement have resulted in hundreds of arrests in Los Angeles, and Trump invoked a rarely used law to federalize the National Guard over the objection of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom and local officials, which further inflamed the response. The Trump administration also mobilized 700 Marines to the Los Angeles area on Monday, though it is not yet clear when they will be deployed onto the streets to help with protests, according to a US Northern Command spokesperson. “I was at the door, just letting everyone in,” she said. Almost half of Los Angeles County's nearly 10 million residents are Latinos or Hispanics, according to US Census data. Millions of protesters are expected at ‘No Kings' rallies nationwide as President Trump's military parade takes place on his 79th birthday Mendoza felt that she had to stay open to provide for her clients that had stayed with her “through the good and the bad.” While the restaurant workers' compassion has been praised by many, Mendoza said some have criticized her for helping both demonstrators and authorities. “I just want them to know that we did it as human beings,” she said. “I'm happy to have helped those people, just like I did with the people who were there for the protests.” Mendoza said the world could use more “empathy and humanity for all people,” and that as an immigrant, she wants people to know most immigrants who come to the United States do so to work hard and make a better life for themselves and others. The fact that we're darker-skinned doesn't make us different,” she said. “We've all seen it as a wonderful country, and we've all seen a country with better opportunities for our lives. Yes, and maybe that's why we decided to come here, and maybe some of us haven't done it the right way. But in the same way, we've all come with a purpose, which is to work and put in the effort. And often, I think they don't realize that it's us Latinos who come to do the most difficult jobs.” More demonstrations are planned nationwide this week and weekend, when the military parade honoring the Army's 250th birthday is planned in Washington, DC.</p>

In travel news this week: the secret rules of British pubs, what it's like inside one of Asia's biggest fish markets, plus lasting love connections that began on trips to Italy and France. It was summer 2022 and California-based model Ambika Mathur was “feeling kind of stagnant” after breaking up with her partner and moving back in with her parents. The Netflix show, “Emily in Paris,” inspired her to set off on her own European adventure, which is how weeks later she found herself cat-sitting in Milan. That's how she opened the door to an intriguing fellow guest. “He was glowing and glistening,” she says of the Italian man, “all tan and blue eyes.” Within days they were talking about marriage. There was an immediate attraction, too, when American Kerri Cunningham met Hugh Grant-haired Brit Dirk Stevens on a ferry to France in the summer of 1993. The problem was, they were only teenagers on vacation with their families. “It felt like some divine intervention that we were there for each other,” says Kerri. British pubs have their own set of unwritten rules that it pays for international visitors to know. For example, flat-roofed pubs should be approached with caution, bags of crisps (not potato chips) must be split open on the table, and warning bells ring out twice at the end of the night. Find out more in our 21st-century guide to the great British boozer. One chain of 800 British pubs requires further introduction for outsiders. Wetherspoon pubs are a cult-like institution in the UK,  both among admirers, who love the real ale and “pub grub” sold at incredibly low prices, and detractors, who see them as everything that's wrong with the country at large. The reborn Port Ellen distillery on the Isle of Islay offers a luxury visitor experience, which includes, surprisingly, Chinese tea service.

Earlier this year, he became one of a handful of people in the world to have visited all 195 UN-recognized countries and territories. “Visiting every country wasn't just about geography,” he tells CNN. “It was about learning how to live with uncertainty, find calm in discomfort, and connect with people from every walk of life.” Music is the message for Danny Kean, who has been traversing North America for 20 years, improvising on a piano in the back of his pickup. On each of his outings, he invites passersby to tickle the ivory for themselves. “This love for humanity drives me to keep doing good.” She told our partners at CNN Underscored, a product reviews and recommendations guide owned by CNN, what she's brought with her. This tiny Southeast Asia runway was once considered “the most secret place on Earth.” It was a Cold War base for the CIA. Now one of Europe's grandest hotels is being restored to its former glory.</p>

Those protests sparked dozens more over several days around the country, with some leading to clashes with police and hundreds of arrests. Gavin Newsom has called the troop deployment a “serious breach of state sovereignty” and a power grab by Trump, and he has gone to court to stop it.
