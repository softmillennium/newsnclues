                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GENEVA, June 14. Events after Israel's strikes on Iran may start developing according to the worst scenario and the conflict could spread to Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and the Persian Gulf countries, Hicheme Lehmici, secretary of GIPRI, a lecturer at the SWISS UMEF University of Applied Sciences Institute, told TASS. According to him, the Israelis are acting at an accelerated pace in their attacks against Tehran without showing any intention to defuse tensions. "And this is very alarming because it actually signifies a course toward an all-out war between Israel and Iran," Lehmici explained, noting that once it begins, the US will definitely get involved. "And then the risk of an apocalyptic scenario materializing would be very real. We risk seeing either an Iraq-type scenario for Iran or, if Iran's resistance proves stronger, possibly a regionalization of the conflict, which could affect the entire territory from Israel to Iran, including Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and possibly the Gulf countries," the expert believes. Overnight into June 13, Israel kicked off Operation Rising Lion aimed against Iran's nuclear program. The Israel Defense Forces said that 200 fighter jets attacked more than 100 targets in Iran, including nuclear facilities. On the evening of June 13, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps announced that Iran retaliated by attacking dozens of targets in Israel with missiles, including military facilities and air bases, striking, in particular, the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv. Israel said some targets were hit but most of the missiles were intercepted.</p>

DUBAI, June 14. /TASS/. Four critical buildings at the nuclear site in Iran's Esfahan were damaged as a result of attacks by Israel on June 13, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported.

The Uranium Conversion Facility and the Fuel Plate Fabrication Plant were among the damaged buildings, according to the agency. "As in Natanz, no increase in off-site radiation expected," the agency said on social media X.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said earlier that Iran's nuclear facilities in Isfahan had been attacked several times. On June 13, the Israel Defense Forces said that it had carried out an airstrike on a nuclear facility in Iran's Isfahan. Uranium production and enrichment facilities, laboratories, and infrastructure facilities were destroyed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Barrage of strikes: Iran launched a new wave of missiles toward Israel early Saturday, capping off a night of attacks between the two sides that unleashed multiple explosions and destruction in Tel Aviv and Tehran. • Failed talks: The next round of US-Iran nuclear negotiations, due to take place in Oman this weekend, has been canceled, Oman's foreign minister has said. His Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, earlier said such talks were “unjustifiable” while Israel's attacks continued. • Casualties on both sides: Three people have been killed in Israel and dozens injured by Iranian strikes, Israeli authorities said. Iran reported at least 78 people killed in Israeli strikes and 320 wounded, mostly civilians. • More to come: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned in a video address Saturday that Israel will “strike every target” of Iran's regime, with the goal of eliminating Tehran's threat. Earlier, Israel's defense minister said that people in Tehran will “pay a heavy price” and the Iranian capital “will burn” if Iran continues with its missile attacks. Flames have erupted at Iran's South Pars gas field – the world's largest natural gas field – according to reports in Iranian state media. Video footage circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN shows a large blaze and plumes of smoke rising from the gas field in Iran's southern Bushehr province. Meanwhile, hospitals across Israel are scrambling to move their patients to underground wards in anticipation for any further retaliatory strikes from Tehran. The warring sides exchanged missile strikes overnight after Israel launched an unprecedented attack on Iranian nuclear and military targets Friday, which killed some of the country's most senior military leaders. Israel will “strike every target” of Iran's regime, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video address on Saturday, as tensions between the long-standing foes continue to flare. He added that Israel had already “caused a very severe blow” to Iran's main nuclear facility. We also hit the leading team of scientists who lead these projects. And this will definitely set them back, and it's possible that it will set them back for many years,” he said. It comes after Netanyahu late on Friday gave a direct address to the people of Iran, urging them to “stand up and let your voices be heard,” as he cautioned that more attacks were on the way. Israeli forces are now operating freely in Tehran's airspace, after eliminating many of Iran's air defense systems, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official has said. “We've established aerial freedom of action from western Iran to Tehran,” IDF spokesperson Brig. “This is the first time we've operated in this airspace,” Defrin said, adding that it is the deepest penetration into Iran to date. “Dozens of these aircraft now operate freely over Tehran, thanks to our opening strikes, which eliminated many Iranian air defense threats,” he added. The next round of US-Iran nuclear negotiations, scheduled to take place in Oman on Sunday, has been canceled, Oman's foreign minister has said. “The Iran US talks scheduled to be held in Muscat this Sunday will not now take place,” Badr Albusaidi wrote on X. “But diplomacy and dialogue remain the only pathway to lasting peace.” Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi earlier said such talks were “unjustifiable” while Israel's attacks continued, but stopped short of saying they were off. In a rare direct address to the people of Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday urged its citizens to “stand up and let your voices be heard,” after Israel unleashed deadly strikes on its regional foe. “The time has come for the Iranian people to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from an evil and oppressive regime,” Netanyahu said in a statement. For locals in Iran, the Israeli leader's call fell on deaf ears. Many of those CNN spoke to did not want to be quoted, even anonymously, but none expressed any support for Netanyahu's calls for a revolt. We want to live peacefully whether we like the regime or not,” a 36-year-old man who wished to remain anonymous told CNN. “Do I wish the regime wasn't in power? Do I want my city bombed by another dictator? I don't need fake news and propaganda speeches,” she added. The Iranian regime remains unpopular at home, where security forces continue to brutally crackdown on dissidents. Alongside anger, the presiding emotion among Tehran locals was one of intense fear, with rumors spreading that Israeli strikes may intensify in the capital on Saturday night. “We're hearing that tonight Israel will be hitting more densely populated parts of Tehran in retaliation for the strike that hit Tel Aviv, which is really terrifying,” said a 24-year-old woman, who CNN is also not naming for safety reasons. “Last night was worse than what had happened before. The entire house was shaking, and they kept dropping bombs that sounded super close,” she added. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Saturday the United States was not caught off guard by Israel's unprecedented wave of strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities and top military leaders this week, or by the recent escalation between the two nations. “I wouldn't say we were really surprised by any dynamic of the back and forth. That's been ongoing, but we're monitoring it closely,” Hegseth said. Hegseth mirrored President Trump, who has emphasized a preference for negotiations but warned of the consequences of continued aggression, during a Fox News appearance on Saturday. “The president continues to message that he prefers peace. He prefers a solution to this that is resolved at the table,” Hegseth said. “Iran still has an option for that, but Israel took what it believed it needed to do in self-defense strikes, and based on that first day, they were quite effective.” President Trump urged Iran to “make a deal, before there is nothing left” after Israel launched roughly 200 strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, senior military leaders and research scientists. It was the opening attack in what Israeli officials have said is part of a major operation against Iran. Israelis were not expecting the fear and anxiety they experienced Friday into Saturday, with several waves of Iranian missile attacks setting off air raid sirens across the country and causing extensive damage at several locations. Some we could tell were very close and our safe room door would shake,” Julie Levi said, describing the night as “one of the most distressing” she has experienced. When he saw images of the aftermath of a missile impact in Rishon Lezion Saturday morning, he understood it was “on a different scale” than the Hamas rocket attacks Israelis have become accustomed to. Medics have been relocating patients underground at a medical center on the outskirts of the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, as it braces for any further retaliatory Iranian strikes. Patients at the Sheba Medical Facility in the Tel Aviv area were seen in video footage being transported to fortified underground facilities. Tehran launched a wave of retaliatory strikes overnight after Israel's unprecedented attack on Iranian nuclear and military targets Friday, which killed some of the country's most senior military leaders. Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi has said negotiations with the United States are “unjustifiable” amid Israeli strikes on Iranian cities, but did not confirm that Iranian officials would no longer be attending the nuclear talks scheduled for this weekend between the US and Iran in Oman. Israel used hundreds of munitions to strike 150 targets in Iran overnight, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official said Saturday, claiming that the Israeli attacks have set back the Iranian nuclear program. Tehran responded by firing four barrages of ballistic missiles toward Israel, killing three people and wounding dozens, the IDF official said at a briefing. “I've heard some experts or people speaking on the news saying, all we can do is push back a few weeks on the nuclear plan. According to the official, Israel had “concrete intelligence” that Iran was “moving forward to a nuclear bomb” at the Isfahan facility. Despite advancing its uranium enrichment significantly, Iran has repeatedly said that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and denied that it was developing an atomic bomb. “We couldn't have said that months ago,” they added. Before Israel launched an unprecedented wave of strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities and top military leaders this week, its spies were already on the ground in enemy territory. Israeli intelligence agency Mossad had smuggled weapons into Iran ahead of the strikes, according to Israeli security officials, and would use the weapons to target Iran's defense from within. The officials said Israel established a base for launching explosive drones inside Iran, and the drones were later used to target missile launchers near Tehran. Precision weapons were also smuggled in and used to target surface-to-air missile systems, clearing the way for Israel's Air Force to carry out more than 100 strikes with upward of 200 aircraft in the early hours of Friday local time. Intelligence gathered by the Mossad in Iran also gave Israel's air force the ability to target senior Iranian commanders and scientists. In an incredibly rare move, the Mossad released video from some of its operations, showing drones attacking what appear to be unsuspecting missile launchers. Tehran has repeatedly insisted it isn't building a bomb. It's unclear how close Iran might be to actually building a nuclear bomb, but it has made significant progress in producing its key ingredient: highly enriched uranium. It could be within a few months,” Netanyahu said on Friday when announcing the audacious “Rising Lion” operation. “This is a clear and present danger to Israel's survival,” he added. Iran has significantly ramped up its uranium enrichment program since Donald Trump withdrew from a nuclear agreement in 2018. It started with about 150kg of uranium enriched to 3.6% – which is sufficient for nuclear reactors and a peaceful nuclear program – and now has 50 times its 2018 level. The IAEA has long accused Iran of violating its non-proliferation obligations, but on Thursday – for the first time in almost 20 years – its board passed a resolution officially declaring Iran in breach of those obligations. Iran promised to respond by escalating its nuclear activities. President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum this spring to Iran's Supreme Leader: Strike a nuclear deal in 60 days, by mid-June, or face consequences. But even as Trump administration figures were publicly projecting determination to pursue a diplomatic solution, Israel was privately warning the US that it had already decided to attack. Late last month, a small group of House lawmakers visited Netanyahu in Jerusalem, where he stated firmly that Israel was going to strike Iran – and they were not seeking permission from the US to do so, according to a person who attended the meeting and another person briefed on it. In response, two of the lawmakers in attendance May 26, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas and Rep. Michael Lawler of New York, urged Israel to coordinate with the US and stressed that the country must let Trump's 60-day ultimatum for Iran run its course. Iran and Israel exchanged waves of deadly missile strikes overnight as the long-running conflict between the two foes ratcheted further and showed no immediate signs of de-escalating. Iran launched retaliatory strikes after Israel's unprecedented attack on Iranian nuclear and military targets Friday, which killed some of the country's most senior military leaders. On Saturday, Israeli defense minister Israel Katz warned that “Tehran will burn” if Iranian strikes persist. Previously, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cautioned “more is on the way,” as both sides report casualties. Tehran residents have expressed anger and indignation after Israel launched deadly strikes on the Iranian capital. “Israel killed our commanders and what (do) they expect in return? Another resident, a 31-year-old teacher, voiced her support for her country for standing up to the Israeli government, particularly after its prolonged assault on Gaza. “Iran showed Israelis are wrong, though they could suppress people of (the) Gaza or Lebanon by heavy bombing.” The Israelis made (a) mistake in launching attacks on Iran, but I hope this comes to (an) end,” 61-year-old Auto mechanic Houshang Ebadi, said. Israel killed nine scientists and experts involved in Iran's nuclear program during its strikes on the country, its military said Saturday, raising the figure from a previous toll of six. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Ali Bakhouei Karimi, Mansour Asgari, and Saeed Barji — experts in mechanics, physics and materials engineers respectively — were killed by strikes on Friday. Their deaths were confirmed by Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency. Iran Taekwondo Federation said three of its members were killed in Israeli attacks on Tehran. Several Iranian outlets reported their deaths as details continue to emerge about the number of casualties from Israel's attacks on Iran. Israel targeted the provinces of East Azerbaijan, Lorestan and Kermanshah on Saturday in a new round of strikes on Iran, the state-affiliated Fars news agency said. Four areas were hit in East Azerbaijan, northwest Iran. Iranian authorities have yet to publicly announce where the strikes occurred. Iran's nuclear facilities in Fordow and Isfahan were not extensively damaged in an attack by Israel on Friday, the spokesperson of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said. The Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant is buried deep in the mountains near Qom in northern Iran and houses advanced centrifuges used to enrich uranium up to high grades of purity. On Friday, Kamalvandi played down the extent of damage inflicted on Iran's primary nuclear enrichment plant in Natanz, saying the facility “did not encounter serious damage.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maintaining peace and stability across the Strait is not only Taiwan's responsibility, but also an important priority for democracies worldwide, a Taiwanese official told a forum in Prague. Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Ming-chi (陳明祺) on Friday attended an annual forum by GLOBSEC, a think tank based in Bratislava, and gave a speech on the panel titled: “Taiwan: The Global Imperative for Stability,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement yesterday. When asked how the Ukraine experience affected Taiwan's approach to national security, self-defense and survival, Chen used a quote often attributed to Mark Twain, saying that “history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme.” Second, just as Ukraine is facing Russia, a much larger adversary, Taiwan is threatened by China, a larger nation, so Taipei should invest in asymmetric warfare, he said. Taiwan should cooperate with other countries in drone programs, he added. Third, Taiwan has learned from Ukraine and the Baltic countries that it is important to have a whole-of-society resilience program, ranging from energy resilience to reserve mobilization and civil defense, he said. The greatest lesson from Ukraine is that Western nations and their allies in Asia did not do enough to prevent the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and gave mixed signals to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Raimond Kaljulaid, a member of the Estonian parliament's National Defense Committee. During a conversation, Chen made some suggestions, such as “keep Taiwan on the agenda, not forgetting that it's an important international issue,” Kaljulaid said. Estonia should use every opportunity to express solidarity with Taiwanese, because “at the end of the day, it is about Taiwanese babies sleeping soundly, not having to go to kindergarten in a bomb shelter,” which is what China is threatening them with, he said. Regarding China's increasing push to limit Taiwan's international space, Chen said it is important that all democracies invest in the “pool of goodwill” and help each other. While China, Russia, Iran and North Korea are helping each other, democracies should stop thinking that it might be inconvenient for their relationship with Beijing if they support Taiwan's participation in international organizations, he said, adding that instead they should “let Taiwan be your partner.” Democracies should support Taiwan for its vibrant democracy and other merits, he said. The Liaoning aircraft carrier, two missile destroyers and one fast combat supply ship sailed about 300km southwest of Japan's easternmost island of Minamitori on Saturday, a ministry statement said. Nine retired generals from Taiwan, Japan and the US have been invited to participate in a tabletop exercise hosted by the Taipei School of Economics and Political Science Foundation tomorrow and Wednesday that simulates a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan in 2030, the foundation said yesterday. The two students had been tricked into going to Hong Kong for a ‘high-paying' job, which sent them to a scam center in Cambodia                                        Police warned the public not to trust job advertisements touting high pay abroad following the return of two college students over the weekend who had been trafficked and forced to work at a cyberscam center in Cambodia. The two victims, surnamed Lee (李), 18, and Lin (林), 19, were interviewed by police after landing in Taiwan on Saturday. Taichung's Chingshui Police Precinct said in a statement yesterday that the two students are good friends, and Lin had suspended her studies after seeing the ad promising good pay to work in Hong Kong. US General Dan Caine said Chinese military maneuvers are not routine exercises, but instead are ‘rehearsals for a forced unification' with Taiwan                                        China poses an increasingly aggressive threat to the US and deterring Beijing is the Pentagon's top regional priority amid its rapid military buildup and invasion drills near Taiwan, US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday. “Beijing is preparing for war in the Indo-Pacific as part of its broader strategy to dominate that region and then the world,” Hegseth said, adding that if it succeeds, it could derail</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel's unprecedented attacks on Iran had at their core an elusive and high-risk goal: eradicating the country's controversial nuclear program. An Israeli military official said at a briefing Saturday that strikes on Iran's nuclear sites in Natanz and Isfahan were able to damage the sites “significantly;” Iran said that damage to the facilities was limited but acknowledged the deaths of nine experts. “We are at a key point where, if we miss it, we will have no way to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons that will threaten our existence,” Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Friday. Iran insists its program is peaceful - here's what we know about the damage to the three sites. Initial assessments indicate that Israel's strikes on Iran's Natanz nuclear facility were extremely effective, going far beyond superficial damage to exterior structures and knocking out the electricity on the lower levels where the centrifuges used to enrich uranium are stored, two US officials told CNN. “This was a full-spectrum blitz,” said another source familiar with the assessments. The strikes destroyed the above-ground part of Natanz's Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant, a sprawling site that has been operating since 2003 and where Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). CNN obtained radar imagery from a space imaging company, Umbra, which captured damage to several areas of the Natanz facility. Other satellite imagery reviewed by CNN showed the same damage more clearly, with black plumes of smoke visibly rising from multiple locations across the site. Electrical infrastructure at Natanz – including the main power supply building, plus emergency and back-up generators – was also destroyed, the IAEA said. That assessment is supported by the two US officials, who told CNN that electricity was knocked out on the lower levels where the centrifuges used to enrich uranium are stored. Natanz has six above-ground buildings and three underground buildings, two of which can hold 50,000 centrifuges, according to the non-profit Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI). Centrifuges are machines that can enrich uranium by spinning the gas at high speeds. Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesperson of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said Saturday that damage at the site – Iran's largest nuclear research complex – was limited. A shed at the facility caught fire, he added, and there is no risk of contamination. But Israel were more bullish; an IDF official said during a Saturday briefing that the site took significant damage. It “operates three small Chinese-supplied research reactors,” as well as a “conversion facility, a fuel production plant, a zirconium cladding plant, and other facilities and laboratories,” the NTI says. At a Saturday briefing, an IDF official said Israel had “concrete intelligence” that Iran was “moving forward to a nuclear bomb” at the Isfahan facility. Despite advancing its uranium enrichment significantly, Iran has repeatedly said that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and denied that it was developing an atomic bomb. The Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant is a far more difficult site to target. The plant is buried deep in the mountains near Qom, in northern Iran, and houses advanced centrifuges used to enrich uranium up to high grades of purity. Iranian air defenses shot down an Israeli drone in the vicinity of the plant, Iranian state media Press TV reported Friday evening. Fordow's fate could be pivotal to the overall success of Israel's attacks. In 2023, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that uranium particles enriched to 83.7% purity – which is close to the 90% enrichment levels needed to make a nuclear bomb – had been found in Fordow. Acton said Israel might be able to collapse the entrance to the facility, but noted that destroying much more of the Fordow site will be a difficult task for Israel.

Both have received surgery and are expected to survive, officials say. Officers arrived at Ms Hortman's home to find an SUV police car equipped with emergency lights. Police confirmed a number of “No King's Day” flyers were found in the vehicle. The demonstrations are taking place across the US on Saturday, in protest of a military parade in Washington DC. The suspect was wearing a vest, and armed with a taser and other equipment while pretending to be a police officer, said Mark Bruley, the Brooklyn Park police chief. Officers had decided to check Ms Hortman's home as a precaution after Mr Hoffman was shot. A manhunt is under way to find the gunman. “My good friend and colleague, Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, were shot and killed early this morning in what appears to be a politically motivated assassination,” Mr Walz said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband were shot dead at their home in Minnesota An alleged former appointee of Minnesota governor Tim Walz is being sought in connection with the assassination of a Democratic politician and her husband. Police have launched a manhunt to find Vance Luther Boelter, 57, after the fatal shooting of Melissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker in Minnesota's House of Representatives, along with her husband. Mr Walz, Kamala Harris's running mate, said the killing appeared to be a “politically motivated assasination”. John Hoffman, a Democratic state senator, and his spouse were also shot multiple times. Both have undergone surgery and are expected to survive, officials say. Mr Boelter was apparently appointed by Mr Walz in 2019 to serve a four year stint on the governor's workforce development board, according to a web page that appears to have been deleted. The manifesto included a list of their politicians' names, including Mr Walz and Ilhan Omar, police said. Officers arrived at Ms Hortman's home to find an SUV police car equipped with emergency lights. Police confirmed a number of “No King's Day” flyers were found in the vehicle.

The Environmental Protection Agency has withdrawn a legal complaint filed last year against the GEO Group, a major donor to President Donald Trump that has more than $1 billion in contracts with the administration to run private prisons and ICE detention facilities. By law, users are supposed to use goggles or a face shield, chemical resistant gloves and protective clothing. The agency alleged that GEO Group's employees wore nitrile exam gloves that were labeled “extra soft” and “not intended for use as a general chemical barrier.” In a separate, pending lawsuit, people who were detained at the detention center alleged they were sickened by the company's liberal use of a different disinfectant. A hearing had yet to be scheduled before an administrative law judge. But a notice filed on Friday by Matthew Salazar, a manager in the EPA's Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Division, stated that the EPA's case against the GEO Group would be dropped. “This is a complete surrender,” said Gary Jonesi, an attorney who worked at the EPA for almost 40 years. “If this is not due to political intervention on behalf of an early and large Trump donor who stands to gain from managing ICE detention facilities and private prisons, then surely it is at least partly due to the intimidation that career staff feel in an environment when federal employees are being fired and reassigned to undesirable tasks and locations.” A spokesperson for the White House said that the GEO Group has “provided services to the Federal Bureau of Prisons for several decades” and has been a major federal contractor for many years. The EPA said in an email that, “As a matter of longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on litigation.” The GEO Group didn't respond to questions from ProPublica. In a filing in response to the EPA's complaint, the GEO Group admitted that its employees used Halt but said that the disinfectant “was applied in a manner consistent with its label at all times and locations.” The company also wrote in its court filing that the gloves its employees used are chemically resistant and offered appropriate protection. Pam Bondi, Trump's attorney general, was a lobbyist for the company in 2019. The attorney general “is in full compliance with all ethical guidance,” a spokesperson for the Department of Justice said in an email. The firm was the first corporation whose political action committee “maxed out” on contributions to Trump's presidential campaign. A subsidiary company, GEO Acquisition II, also gave $1 million to the pro-Trump PAC Make America Great Again. The GEO Group, its PAC and individuals affiliated with the company collectively contributed $3.7 million to candidates and political committees in the 2024 election cycle, compared with $2.7 million in 2020, according to OpenSecrets, an independent group that tracks money in politics. Zoley gave the maximum amount allowed for an individual per election at the time, $3,300, to Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson's primary and general election campaigns in 2024. The GEO group regularly and liberally sprayed disinfectants in the ICE facility, according to both the EPA complaint and a separate civil suit filed on behalf of Adelanto detainees. “Various Plaintiffs had nosebleeds or found blood in their mouth and saliva. Others had debilitating headaches or felt dizzy and lightheaded,” the lawsuit stated. “GEO staff sprayed when people were eating, and the chemical mist would fall on their food. GEO staff sprayed at night, on or around the bunk beds and cells where people slept. And on at least one occasion, GEO staff sprayed individuals as a disciplinary measure.” That letter cited complaints from detainees at Adelanto who suffered “difficulty breathing,” “lung pain” and skin rashes from the disinfectant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Atop a reviewing stand near the White House on Saturday evening, Donald Trump will mark a 79th birthday like no other. Overhead, helicopters and war planes will pierce the air. Mr. Trump's long-held dream of a major military parade in Washington has always been controversial, drawing comparisons with authoritarian regimes. And it has only become more so over the past week, after the President deployed the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to put down protests against his signature policy of rounding up unauthorized immigrants for deportation. And if there's any protester that wants to come out, they will be met with very big force,” he warned this week. Analysis: The great theatre of Donald Trump's U.S. military parade The event will also unfold in the shadow of air strikes by U.S. ally Israel on Iran and Tehran's retaliation, which threatens to spiral into all-out war. And it runs the risk of getting rained out, with evening thunderstorms forecast. Mr. Trump was deeply impressed by a Bastille Day military parade during a state visit to Paris in 2017 and determined to surpass it. He scrapped plans to do so the following year after taking flak over the high price tag for such an event. This time around, the President finally made his dream come true by building off an existing celebration. The U.S. Army was already planning public events to mark its 250th anniversary, which also falls on Flag Day. Here's what to expect at the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary parade Critics were swift to accuse Mr. Trump of staging a strongman spectacle. California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff branded it a “dictator-style military parade.” Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters he had “never been a big fan of goose-stepping soldiers and big tanks and missiles rolling down the street” and that it seemed a break with U.S. precedent. West Virginia Senator Jim Justice, meanwhile, defended the event. “We haven't done that in a long time.” In a survey of 50 Republican legislators, the Politico website found only seven who said they would attend. Whether protesters show up also remains to be seen. She described the deployment of troops to Los Angeles and the military parade as manifestations of “a Trump that feels threatened” and said the event in Washington is about shoring up “his fragile ego.” Either way, the event will be a rarity in U.S. history: the country has typically only staged major military parades to mark the end of a war – or the start of one, as when then-president James Madison reviewed troops on Pennsylvania Avenue in 1812 shortly before launching several failed invasions of Canada. The most recent, in 1991 after the Gulf War, left a bad taste for some in Washington when tanks made tread marks in asphalt and helicopters damaged a statue outside an art museum. Taking part will be 128 tanks, armoured personnel carriers and artillery pieces; 40 helicopters; six HIMARS rocket launchers; more than 6,000 troops; and four marching bands. For a retro touch, some solders will be dressed in uniforms from wars throughout U.S. history. There will also be historic planes, horses, mules and a dog. At its conclusion, the Golden Knights, a squad of Army parachutists, will land near Mr. Trump and present him with the flag. About 200,000 people are expected to attend, though this may be affected by the weather. Organizers chose a relatively late start time for the event – 6:30 p.m. But this means the parade may run up against a thunderstorm. The President, for his part, is setting expectations high. He said this week that the event will be “better and bigger than any parade we've ever had in this country.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Early this June, smoke from early season Canadian wildfires, which had necessitated mass evacuations in several Canadian provinces, began wafting into the United States. It was a harbinger of what will likely be another dangerous and disruptive summer of fires across the United States and Canada. In February, about 700 Forest Service employees, whose full-time work is other than firefighting but who are trained to join firefighting efforts in emergencies, were fired. Thousands of other Forest Service employees, as well as others in the parent department, the Department of Agriculture (USDA), were also placed on notice that they would be fired at some point over the coming months. Many more have disappeared from, or will soon disappear from, the government's payrolls, either through job losses or deferred resignation or early retirement, and many others have spent the past several months in limbo, as court battles play out as to whether or not they can be terminated. Absurdly, as fire season nears, many are still being paid but have been placed on administrative leave — meaning they are being paid not to work. “In February, along with many thousands of other federal workers with less than a year in their positions, I was fired via a form letter which lacked details of my supposed ‘poor performance,'” one Forest Service employee in Colorado, who worked at building partnerships with community stakeholders to develop fire prevention strategies in western forests and grasslands, told Truthout, asking to remain anonymous due to fear of reprisal. “Since then, I was provisionally brought back to work, issued a pseudo-mea culpa, and finally told that pending litigation might invalidate previous court orders … meaning that I just might be fired again.” She didn't want to share too many words. There were lots of people crying at the supervisor's office. It was very traumatic — like a bomb had just gone off.” There are now less personnel available for controlled burns — meaning that conditions will be left to deteriorate until large blazes break out; there are fewer legal staff on hand, as a result of which the Forest Service will struggle to respond to lawsuits against fire management strategies; and there are fewer crews available to proactively search for fire outbreaks before they grow to dangerous proportions, as well as to tackle large fires once they do jump the fire lines. In February, The New York Times reported that federal agencies were unable to hire thousands of firefighters as they normally do at the start of each fire season because of indiscriminate federal hiring freezes that were put in place immediately following Trump's inauguration. In April, the White House extended the hiring freeze through mid-July, sending a note out to agency heads informing them: “No Federal civilian position that is presently vacant may be filled, and no new position may be created.” Last week, the Washington Post reported that the administration plans to wind FEMA down after this coming hurricane season and leave states to largely fend for themselves when disasters strike. It is shredding basic government function across the board, hitting everything from science research to services for people with mental illness. Some states have the resources to plug many of the gaps created by the rollback of federal services: For instance, California is making huge investments in firefighting this year, in particular in clearing materials from forest floors and in hardening up its urban infrastructure to make it harder for fires to spread within cities; and Colorado has set up a new multimillion-dollar wildfire mitigation program. In February, New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, along with several colleagues, sent a letter to the acting secretary of the USDA warning that blocking payments to fire prevention efforts that were already underway was “not only unlawful but also endangers our rural communities by removing a vital component of their economies and delaying critical work to mitigate the threat of wildfire.” More recently, officials in Kansas have warned of a near-total collapse of the state's wildfire fighting abilities in the face of huge federal cuts. The cuts impact not only firefighting readiness but also the health and safety of firefighters, with programs designed to track firefighters' exposure to cancer-causing chemicals being cut back, and with workplace safety programs being either eliminated or massively reduced in scope. Ostensibly this is being done in the name of fiscal responsibility; in reality, it is anything but: A single fire that surges out of control, as did the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year, can result in tens of billions of dollars in damages. That hardly seems like a recipe for making America great again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Guardian analysis sharply contradicts president's claim that officials are targeting ‘criminals' for deportation from US But the biggest increase has been people with no charges at all. Between early January, right before the inauguration, and June, there has been an 807% increase in the arrest of immigrants with no criminal record. “The group of people arrested with only immigration violations used to be very, very small,” said Austin Kocher, an assistant research professor at Syracuse University. Ice is certainly arresting people with criminal records, but the administration has not published data on what crimes people have been convicted of. Detailed statistics on arrestees is not available for 2025, but between October 2022 and November 2024, 78% of people arrested by the agency had a misdemeanor conviction or no conviction at all. Only 21% of people over that two year time period had a felony criminal conviction, a Guardian analysis of monthly Ice enforcement and removal operations shows. It is impossible to know how many people arrested since January have a felony criminal conviction because the government has not released that data. The sharpest increase in non-criminal arrests is following a late-May meeting, in which Trump administration officials yelled at top Ice officials, ordering them to arrest more immigrants. During that meeting, DHS secretary Kristi Noem and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller ordered Ice to arrest at least 3,000 people per day, which would be 1 million per year. Trump ran on a campaign of engaging in “mass deportations” and since he took office his administration has escalated its tactics to meet that goal. The internal Ice emails reviewed by the Guardian show officers were told to interview and potentially arrest “collaterals”, meaning people coincidentally present during an arrest. In the past, Ice typically targeted immigrants with arrest warrants. Now more people without any criminal history are being swept up in the dragnet. There has also been an increase in the number of local jurisdictions deputized by Ice to carry out immigration enforcement work. Kocher has been documenting these numbers closely, and tracked that as of 1 June, there were 51,302 people detained in immigration jails – the highest number since 2019. According to Kocher, the Trump administration has increased the number of people in detention so quickly that it is challenging to provide meaningful oversight. “Practically speaking, it means people are sleeping on the floor, they may not be getting enough food, they're almost certainly not getting adequate medical care.” Kocher said, in response to the discrepancy in the numbers: “I think they're being dishonest and un-transparent because they are counting things in ways they have never been counted before to favor their political agenda and the perception they are trying to send to the base.” After government attorneys dismiss their cases, Ice officials waiting in hallways or lobbies have arrested asylum seekers. Organizations are challenging the Trump administration's increasing efforts to arrest people at immigration courts. Last week, Innovation Law Lab, a legal organization that represents immigrants in civil rights cases, filed a suit against the Trump administration in Oregon to block the practice of courthouse arrests.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This story was updated to include new details on the medical repatriation of Russian POWs, citing commentary from Ukraine's I Want to Live project.Ukraine has recovered the bodies of 1,200 fallen citizens, including military personnel, in the latest round of repatriation efforts coordinated with Russia under agreements reached during talks in Istanbul, Ukrainian officials said on June 14. This latest repatriation follows the return of 2,412 bodies earlier on June 13 and June 11, reflecting an intensification of efforts after the June 2 Istanbul talks between the two sides. The Coordination Headquarters for Prisoners of War said the bodies, which Russian authorities claim belong to Ukrainian nationals, were returned as part of an ongoing phased exchange process. "The remains will now undergo forensic examination and identification procedures conducted by law enforcement investigators in cooperation with expert institutions under the Interior Ministry," the Coordination Headquarters said in a statement. In addition to repatriating bodies, Ukraine has begun implementing what officials described as the first stage of a "permanent humanitarian medical exchange" with Russia, also agreed to in Istanbul. Under this arrangement, Ukraine has transferred wounded Russian POWs directly from the front lines, according to "I Want to Live," a government-run project that facilitates voluntary surrender by Russian and Belarusian soldiers. At the Istanbul meeting on June 2, Ukrainian and Russian delegations agreed on a new prisoner exchange but failed to secure a ceasefire agreement. Since then, exchanges have continued, focusing especially on severely wounded and ill soldiers. Ukraine has long pushed for an "all-for-all"prisoner exchange to bring home all Ukrainian captives, but Moscow has resisted such a comprehensive deal. It is not immediately clear whether Ukraine released the bodies of Russian soldiers in return during this latest exchange.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Parade – ostensibly to mark US army's 250th birthday – takes place as president turns 79 and comes amid large protests Thousands of troops accompanied by dozens of tanks and aircraft will stream through the National Mall in Washington DC for a military parade billed as celebrating the US army's 250th birthday on Saturday – which also happens to be the day Donald Trump turns 79. The president has long desired to hold a military parade in the capital, and is finally getting his wish months after returning to the White House for a second term, and days after ordering federalized California national guard and US marines to the streets of Los Angeles in response to protests against deportations. Washington DC will briefly become the second American city to see soldiers in its streets, albeit for markedly different reasons. At 6.30pm ET, 6,700 soldiers accompanied by armored vehicles such as the M1A2 Abrams tanks are scheduled to march down Constitution Avenue Northwest past the White House, as Black Hawk, Chinook and Apache helicopters fly overhead. Trump will appear to preside over an enlistment and reenlistment ceremony and accept a flag from the Golden Knights Parachute Team, before fireworks will fill the sky. “I think it's time for us to celebrate a little bit. You know, we've had a lot of victories,” Trump said earlier this week. “President Trump's longstanding wish to waste millions of taxpayer dollars for a performative military parade in the style of authoritarian leaders is finally coming true on his birthday,” said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the federal district's Democratic non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives. “Although this parade will feed President Trump's ego and perhaps his base, it will not serve any legitimate purpose,” Holmes Norton said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nippon Steel will buy a 100 per cent stake in U.S. Steel.Yuka Obayashi/Reuters U.S President Donald Trump approved Nippon Steel's US$14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel on Friday, capping a tumultuous 18-month effort by the companies that survived union opposition and two national security reviews. “We look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again,” the companies said in the statement, thanking Trump. They added the agreement includes US$11 billion in new investments to be made by 2028 as well as governance, production and trade commitments. Nippon Steel will buy a 100 per cent stake in U.S. Steel, a spokesperson for the Japanese company in Tokyo said on Saturday. Reuters has reported that Nippon Steel would invest an additional US$3 billion for a new mill after 2028. The takeover will set up the ailing U.S. firm to receive the critical investment, allowing Nippon Steel to capitalize on a host of American infrastructure projects while its foreign competitors face steel tariffs of 50 per cent. U.S. government to have control in Nippon Steel-U.S. Steel deal, Trump and state senator say Still, some Nippon Steel investors are concerned about short-term financial pressure due to the scale of the additional investment commitment. “The government of Japan welcomes the U.S. government's decision, as we believe this investment will enhance innovation capabilities in the U.S. and Japanese steel industries and further strengthen the close partnership between our two countries,” Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Yoji Muto said in a statement on Saturday. Friday's announcement was hardly guaranteed, even if many investors had seen approval as likely after Trump headlined a rally on May 30 giving his vague blessing to an “investment” by Nippon Steel, which he described as a “great partner.” Shares of U.S. Steel had dipped earlier on Friday after a Nippon Steel executive told Japan's Nikkei newspaper that the takeover required “a degree of management freedom” to go ahead after Trump said the U.S. would be in control with the golden share. The bid has faced opposition since Nippon Steel launched it in December 2023. But Trump's public comments, ranging from welcoming a simple “investment” in U.S. Steel by the Japanese firm to floating a minority stake for Nippon Steel, spurred confusion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Zheng Zhi, a former Chinese military doctor currently living in exile in Canada, traveled to Taiwan for several screenings of the award-winning documentary “State Organs” from June 4 to 15, which features Zheng's eyewitness account as a resident doctor in a Chinese military hospital. Millions of troops may be mobilized to the front line of the Taiwan Strait, including possibly 2 million to 3 million logistics personnel, he said. The Chinese military solution was to put surrendered or captured Taiwanese soldiers in detention, draw their blood, and use it for wounded Chinese soldiers, according to Zheng. So if Chinese Communist Party (CCP) attacks Taiwan and the Taiwanese military surrenders, “the first thing they might face is having their blood taken because a large blood supply is needed to sustain a war,” Zheng said. Using container trucks and airplanes, the blood could be quickly transported to the frontlines to “immediately set up a field hospital,” he added. There are “no technical barriers,” Zheng told The Epoch Times. It's hard for someone in a normal country to grasp such a level of cruelty, he said, pointing out that “the CCP has no human moral baseline.” “State Organs,” directed by Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Raymond Zhang, focuses on two families in search of their missing relatives amid a nationwide persecution of the faith in Falun Gong, which both disappeared individuals practiced. He told The Epoch Times it pained him to think that he has friends who went to China for liver and heart transplants. For all such detained Falun Gong practitioners in China, their organs are “state organs,” he said, adding that the regime is “killing on demand.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three Ukrainian nationals were killed in a bus accident in France on June 13, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed in a statement on Telegram. "Terrible news about the tragic bus accident in France," Zelensky wrote. The bus was reportedly carrying Ukrainian nationals, including adults and children, who were returning from an educational exchange. While en route to Paris, the bus lost control and flipped into a ditch. French media reported that nine people sustained serious injuries, while an additional 18 suffered minor injuries. Zelensky added that Ukraine's Foreign Ministry promptly sent a team of diplomats and consuls, led by the ambassador to France, to assist survivors and support the victims' families. The team is coordinating with French authorities and emergency services at the scene. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko are providing regular updates on the victims' conditions and emerging details regarding the accident. Zelensky thanked the French authorities, noting that "more than 50 emergency teams were deployed" in what he called "a true expression of French solidarity. "He also expressed his "condolences to all the families of the victims" and wished for a "speedy recovery of the injured children."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out airstrikes on Iran on Friday, to which Tehran responded with a barrage of drones and missiles. West Jerusalem said it aimed to prevent the Islamic Republic from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Tehran condemned the attacks as “blatant aggression” and vowed a “crushing” response. Early Friday morning, around 200 Israeli fighter jets struck targets across Iran, including a uranium enrichment facility in Natanz. Strikes were also reported at nuclear sites in Fordo and Isfahan, as well as military airfields near the cities of Hamadan and Tabriz. Iran said only “superficial damage” was done to the Natanz site. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes, dubbed Operation Rising Lion, aimed to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said the situation had “reached the point of no return” due to advancements in Iran's nuclear program. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei condemned the strikes as unjustified and accused Israel of killing civilians. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the attacks “amount to a declaration of war.” It then launched ballistic missiles, some of which broke through Israeli defenses and landed in Tel Aviv. At least one person has been killed and more than 60 injured, according to Israeli media. Israel also carried out additional strikes in Iran throughout the day. However, President Donald Trump told Fox News he had been aware of the planned operation and praised its “excellent” outcome. He criticized Iran for failing to reach a deal on its nuclear program within his “60-day ultimatum.” He condemned Israel's strikes as illegal under international law and expressed condolences for the deaths of civilians in Iran. The tensions surrounding Iran's nuclear program must be resolved through diplomacy, he added. Tehran rejected Trump's demands as unacceptable, insisting it would continue nuclear research for civilian purposes. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>
