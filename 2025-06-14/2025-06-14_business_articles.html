                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband, Mark, were shot and killed early Saturday in what appears to be a "politically motivated assassination," Gov. "Our state lost a great leader and I lost the dearest of friends," Walz, former Democratic candidate for vice president, said during a news conference. Minnesota Democratic state senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were also each shot multiple times, Walz said. They remained alive as of Saturday morning. "We are cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt," Walz said. Officials said that police responded to a call at about 2 a.m. local time that Hoffman and his wife had been shot. Police were then "proactively checking" Hortman's house at around 3:35 a.m., and upon arrival, officers encountered an individual who "immediately fired" at them, Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said during a briefing. Officials said that they identified the suspect's car, which had emergency lights and sirens resembling a police car. Upon searching the suspect's car, officials also found a "manifesto" naming other lawmakers and officials. Trump has been "briefed on the terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota," according to a statement. "Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America," Trump continued. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi also said that she is "closely monitoring developments in Minnesota after what appears to be a targeted attack against state lawmakers." Bondi said the FBI is on the ground in Minnesota and working with state and local law enforcement. "This horrific violence will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," Bondi wrote on X. Minnesota State Patrol warned the public not to attend planned demonstrations across the state on Saturday "out of an abundance of caution" due to the "targeting shootings of state lawmakers overnight." "Out of an abundance of caution my Department of Public Safety is recommending that people do not attend any political rallies today in Minnesota until the suspect is apprehended," Walz wrote on X. Thousands of demonstrations are planned nationwide as part of "No Kings Day" to protest President Donald Trump's policies. Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin said that his "heart is broken" by the "senseless murders." "This senseless violence must end," Martin said in a statement. "These heinous murders are a reflection of the extremism and political violence that have been fomented in our country," he continued.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earning a household income of $150,000 might sound like a lot, but in many of the biggest cities in the U.S. it still puts you squarely in the middle class. Middle-class households earn between two-thirds and twice the local median income, according to Pew Research Center's definition. Nationally, the middle class spans incomes from $51,813 to $155,438. That means middle-class residents in San Jose earn between $90,819 and $272,458 per year. Large cities like San Jose and New York are economic hubs with a high concentration of high-paying jobs in sectors such as tech, finance and professional services, which is part of why median incomes tend to be higher in these places. But higher earnings are often offset by steep living costs — especially for housing.And while earning $100,000 has long been seen as a milestone, in a city like San Jose it puts a household at the lower end of the local middle-class range. For residents, that might help explain why earning six figures doesn't feel like it stretches as far as it once did. Take Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course How to Buy Your First Home.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While investors may have been put off by bitcoin's volatility in its early years, a few factors are emerging that will make the flagship crypto a key part of a portfolio, according to Coatue Management's Philippe Laffont. The founder of the tech-focused hedge fund spoke Thursday at Coinbase's State of Crypto Summit in New York City. For starters, while bitcoin has managed to surge nearly 13% in 2025, Laffont said that the cryptocurrency's volatility has come down over time. Bitcoin's dramatic price swings have been a deterrent for potential investors in the crypto – and at one point, this volatility kept Coatue from getting into bitcoin, he said. "It's intriguing to me that maybe … the cost of getting into bitcoin is shrinking," Laffont said on stage Thursday at Coinbase's State of Crypto Summit in New York City. "If the beta shrinks, that would be very interesting." Institutional investors' move to embrace bitcoin was also a sign of maturity for the cryptocurrency, he said. Consider that BlackRock was one of the leaders of the charge to bring bitcoin ETFs to market. Further, Laffont pointed out bitcoin's performance in 2022 and how it has changed over time. Additionally, the number of bitcoin wallets that have held the crypto for at least a month and sell their full position has come down "a lot," Laffont said, which suggests investors are holding onto the crypto for the long term rather than trading it. Bitcoin accounts for a small amount of the world's net worth – about $2 trillion out of $500 trillion, he said. Coatue has invested in private and public crypto companies like data provider Dune Analytics, bitcoin miner Hut 8 and artificial intelligence play CoreWeave. The latter company has a partnership with bitcoin miner Core Scientific. The bitcoin opportunity wasn't immediately clear to Laffont, however. Why didn't I invest more in bitcoin?'" Laffont described his investment philosophy as one that emphasizes the importance of simple, "obvious" ideas over "complicated" ones. "That … as long as other people think it's valuable, it gets more valuable over time – and that's what we missed," he said. "Now I go back and I say, this is crazy – why wouldn't everyone have one or two or 3% or 4% of your assets in something like bitcoin that … protects you against inflation?" Laffont identified three cohorts of his client base: those who are hands off and leave the investing to him, those wondering "why did you miss one of the biggest trends in the world," and the risk-averse ones who feel comfortable "as long as you don't dabble in crypto." "Every year there's a little bit less of them. Hopefully, we see that distribution continue to change." While Laffont has become more of a bitcoin enthusiast than he used to be, he still told summit attendees not to get carried away and to approach the cryptocurrency with basic investing principles. "For those of you that think bitcoin is going to be important, my recommendation is never make it such a big portion of your portfolio that it becomes the driving factor of the portfolio," he said. "You're going to make way more money by having a smaller position that you can keep for 10 years than the big one that worries you all the time."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many American families are increasingly struggling to keep up with the cost of living in most of the 50 U.S. states. The U.S. median household income rose between 2022 and 2023 to just over $80,000 a year, according to the most recent Census Bureau data. In Massachusetts, the most expensive state in the U.S., a family of four needs more than $300,000 per year to meet that threshold. Costs of living grew by over 4% in that state from 2024, slightly more than the national average of 3.87%, SmartAsset's analysis found. Boston has the highest cost of raising a child in the country, a separate SmartAsset study recently found, and much of that total cost comes from child care. The cost of living for families in other states may not be quite as high as in Massachusetts, but three states — Vermont, New Jersey and Montana — are on track to rapidly catch up, with double-digit growth rates from 2024, found SmartAsset's report. On the flip side, overall costs of living actually shrank from 2024 in six states, the report said: Hawaii, New York, Georgia, Delaware, Michigan and Iowa. SmartAsset used the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's living wage calculator to estimate the annual cost of essentials in each state. MIT calculates family living costs for two working adults and two children and includes essentials like housing and food for all those family members as well as child care. Here's the income it takes for families of four to live comfortably in all 50 states in 2025, according to the study: Take Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course How to Buy Your First Home.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At the time, I had two part-time jobs, was getting a full-time master's degree at Harvard, and was raising three young kids. Just as I gained traction, a few years later, bringing in over $1.7M a year in sales, the economy shifted, consumer habits changed, and competition grew. The number of card games on the market surged while consumers tightened their wallets in response to economic uncertainty. Today, I have five income streams (and counting). I've learned that the real work in building wealth isn't just about starting, it's about staying in the game through ongoing reinvention. The mental game of entrepreneurship depends on your ability to stay agile, adaptive and resilient in the face of uncertainty. These five books didn't just help me get started. They've helped me evolve, recalibrate, and keep going. In this book, academic and entrepreneur Scott Galloway breaks down four key variables for financial security: discipline, stoicism, time and diversification. This playbook pushed me to ask not just what I can do, but what's truly worth doing with my limited time and energy. It helped me reevaluate how I weigh risks, spot opportunities, and make trade-offs across my income streams. Whether you're working toward your first six figures or scaling your next income stream, this book offers pragmatic action items to help you build better financial habits and make more informed decisions. One of the hardest parts of starting and running a business is making decisions without all the facts. That perspective shift gave me the clarity to take bolder risks, grounded in logic, rather than emotion. Her "thinking in bets" framework encouraged me to ask myself: What are the odds this will work? What's the downside if it doesn't? This helped me navigate uncertainty with more confidence and fewer regrets. This book is a master class in long-term thinking, rational decision-making, and investing. It compiles eleven of the late Charlie Munger's most influential talks. I learned to apply the principles of psychology, economics and engineering to make better decisions in business and in life. This mindset has helped me to work through complex dilemmas and mental roadblocks. I still revisit this book to sharpen my thinking when the path forward feels uncertain. Every business moves through phases of ascent, plateau and decline. Author Ryan Holiday shows how unchecked ego can sabotage success at every stage — whether you're turning a profit, becoming a viral sensation or facing tough setbacks. Through historical examples and personal anecdotes, Holiday explores how ego clouds our judgment, resists feedback and blinds us to our shortcomings. In my keynote speeches on emotional intelligence, I often emphasize the same idea to leaders and teams I talk to: self-awareness is your edge. Most of all, it reminded me to be clear-eyed, grounded, and vigilant about not being influenced by an undue sense of self-importance. How do we know when it's time to change course? This book explores that exact question, and reminds us to pause and listen to our inner voice over the noise around us.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel's widespread airstrikes on Iran effectively damaged the country's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, which officials said was a primary goal. The strikes hit over 100 targets, including Iran's air defense systems, missile launchers, and senior military leadership. Now, all eyes are on Tehran's response (it has launched multiple waves of missiles in retaliatory strikes on Israel), and the specter of a wider conflict. Here are some main questions stemming from the attacks. Iran initially responded to the attack by firing 100 drones at Israel on Friday, which the Israel Defense Forces said were mostly intercepted. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel "should anticipate a severe punishment" in response to the strikes, which Iran says killed at least 78 people. Hours later, the IDF said Iran had launched "dozens" of missiles at Israel in what appeared to be several waves. The military said its air defenses were actively intercepting threats, and video footage captured several impacts. "But their main weapon will be ballistic missiles," he added, "which have the best chance of inflicting damage on Israel, whereas drone and cruise missile attacks will face more extensive Israeli defences." On Saturday, Iran's IRNA state news agency reported that Iranian forces said they had "successfully destroyed targets" in Israel using Arash drones — long-range loitering munitions. Israeli emergency services said two people were killed in a rocket strike on the coastal plain Saturday morning. It is not unprecedented for Iran to launch powerful weapons at Israel; Tehran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at its foe in April and October last year. However, those strikes were mostly intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the US. Beyond direct strikes, another way that Iran could retaliate is through the so-called "Axis of Resistance," a vast network of militias it is aligned with throughout the region, including Lebanon's Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthis. Israel has been battling these forces, and Hamas in Gaza, since the October 7, 2023, attacks. The US, however, has been trying to reach a new deal with Iran (and has threatened violence if a deal isn't done). The strikes could derail those efforts and even goad Iran into racing to build a nuclear arsenal. Israel's strikes threaten to spark a wider regional conflict, analysts at London's Chatham House think tank warned Friday. "Far from being a preventive action, this strike risks triggering a broader regional escalation and may inadvertently bolster the Islamic Republic's domestic and international legitimacy," Sanam Vakil, Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa program director, said. Last year, Tehran reportedly threatened to target Gulf state oil facilities if they allowed Israel access to their airspace for strikes against Iran. Oil prices surged after Israel launched its strikes on Iran this week, Business Insider reported. Russia is also a close ally of Iran, and the two have increased their defense cooperation since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Trump has sought to broker a new nuclear deal with Iran, and in the wake of the Israeli attacks overnight, warned of "even more brutal" strikes from Israel if Iran refuses a new agreement. Last year, the US Navy helped shoot down Iranian missiles fired at Israel in two major attacks, and it has rotated multiple aircraft carriers and many warships into the region since 2023, in a show of support for Israel and to deter its enemies, including Iran. A US official told Business Insider that American forces helped shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel on Friday. A Navy spokesperson told BI that the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group — consisting of an aircraft carrier, a cruiser, and three destroyers — is in the Arabian Sea. Gen. Effie Defrin said Israel's strikes "significantly harmed" Iran's main uranium enrichment site at Natanz. Satellite imagery appeared to show significant damage at the surface level. Overnight, Israeli strikes reportedly targeted strategic Iranian sites, including the Natanz nuclear facility, Iran's primary center for uranium enrichment. High-resolution imagery from @AirbusDefence, captured on June 13, 2025, reveals significant damage to the facility. The IDF said that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps chief Hossein Salami and other senior military commanders were also killed in targeted strikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While it's a small gain at this point, you can see in the chart below that it's an extremely rare event and hasn't happened for a sustained period since 2009. Plus, it's a big turnaround from July 2022, when the gap was 8.5% vs. 5.9% in favor of job switchers. As a result, the white-collar workers who held tight to their jobs have become the sector's upper class: They're benefiting from low layoffs and robust wage growth. For those who both switched during the Great Resignation and have hung on to their new role ever since, that might be an economic double whammy — they cashed in at that higher salary and have been sitting pretty since. On the other end of the spectrum are white-collar workers who are out of work and looking, at a time when US businesses are hiring at nearly the lowest rate since 2014, excluding an early pandemic plunge. So you may be wondering: Is it a good time to switch jobs or not? Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, sums it up. "If the right job comes up, one that moves you forward in your career and gives you a healthy raise, certainly consider taking it," he said. "If not, there is at least some assurance that staying put still provides decent pay increases right now." Reach out to these reporters at mhoff@businessinsider.com and jkaplan@businessinsider.com. In May, white-collar-dominated industries had robust wage growth over the year. Average hourly earnings increased 6% from a year ago in the information sector, which includes broadcasting, telecommunications, and data processing. According to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, median wage growth for job stayers across all industries has outpaced growth for job switchers since February. Even if they're no longer enjoying their work, some see it as better than facing a long stretch of unemployment or an uncertain job market. "There's fewer people coming in, fewer people heading out," Guy Berger, the director of economic research at the Burning Glass Institute, said. "As white-collar industries reverse some of that pandemic hiring and also pull back on hiring amid economic uncertainty, it's getting tougher to find a job," Daniel Zhao, lead economist at Glassdoor, told Business Insider. Glassdoor data last year showed that a growing percentage of workers switching employers were accepting lower-paid roles, especially in tech. Zhao said that's because, "Many job switchers today were involuntarily laid off, resulting in more workers having to settle for a lower-paying or lower seniority job." Berger said that in addition to weak hiring leading to fewer opportunities, there are also more people with a college education, which means more competition for jobs. "It's also possible that in some segments AI is slowing demand for white-collar workers, though I doubt this is as big as some people think," Berger said. There's some good news in professional and business services, where the hiring rate continues to be strong and has been trending upward, although it's still below its late 2021 high, and the sector has had several monthly net employment losses over the past year. Job seekers are already lowering their expectations: The average lowest wage all workers would accept for a new job plummeted from $82,000 in November 2024 to $74,000 in March 2025. Among those with college degrees, it fell from $102,000 to $95,000 in the same period. And the share of graduates in jobs that don't require a degree ticked up for recent graduates in the first quarter of 2025, indicating that degree holders are overqualified for more roles. "White-collar industries like finance, tech, and consulting are still appealing, especially for new grads, because of their promise of rapid career growth and high pay," Zhao said.</p>

Air India Crash:

First aid responders on duty at the crash site of the doomed Air India flight in Ahmedabad, India, on June 12.

Students of the B.J. Medical College were having lunch in their hostel dining hall on Thursday when a Boeing 787 jet loaded with fuel smashed into the building and exploded.

Flight AI171 had taken off just minutes earlier from a nearby airport in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad, before making a perilous descent that ended in the death of all but one of the 242 people aboard. The number of casualties among those on the ground and the building the plane slammed into is less clear.</p>
