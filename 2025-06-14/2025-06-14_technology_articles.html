                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A man named Vance Boelter allegedly shot and killed Melissa Hortman, a Democratic Minnesota state representative, and her husband Mark Hortman at their home at some point early Saturday morning while, according to law enforcement, impersonating a police officer. Law enforcement has said they found a manifesto and hit list in the alleged suspect's car, which included politicians, abortion providers, and pro-abortion rights advocates. There were also allegedly fliers in his car for the “No Kings” protest against President Donald Trump, which took place in cities across the US on Saturday. The 57-year-old, who has been identified as the suspected shooter by law enforcement, runs an armed security service with his wife, and has been affiliated with at least one evangelical organization, a ministry he has also run with his wife, according to a tax filing reviewed by WIRED. (His wife could not be immediately reached for comment.) A later version of the site was designed, according to an archived copy, by Israeli web design firm J-Town. Charlie Kalech, CEO of J-Town, tells WIRED that the alleged suspect was, in his recollection, “clearly religious and evangelistic. He had lots of ideas to make the world a better place.” The suspect, whom Kalech said was “nothing but nice to me,” commissioned J-Town, Kalech recalled, because they're Jerusalem-based, and he said he wanted to support Israel. His profile had shown him “liking” several evangelical missionary organizations, as well as pages honoring Reinhard Bonnke, a German pentecostal evangelist known for missions in several African countries, and Smith Wigglesworth, a British evangelist who was influential in the pentecostal movement. He also “liked” the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal advocacy organization known for its hardline stances against abortion and LGBTQ rights. The suspected shooter also appears to be the director of security patrols at Praetorian Guard Security Services, a security company run servicing the Minneapolis and St. Paul metro areas that he founded with his wife Jenny. If you are looking for unarmed guards, please work with another service to meet your needs better,” states the “red lines” section of the company's website. Currently we drive Ford Explorer Utility Vehicles.” According to photographs from the scene, the car towed away by law enforcement was a Ford. The suspected shooter, according to his LinkedIn profile, is a veteran of the food industry, having worked for Johnsonville Sausage, Del Monte, and the Irish convenience food manufacturer Greencore; recently, he posted that he was looking to return to that sector. His involvement in the food industry has also seemingly helped him build inroads to local government. Police officers in the Minneapolis suburb of Champlin say they were called at around 2 am to the residence of state senator Hoffman. At 3:35 am, police officers in nearby Brooklyn Park went to proactively check on Hortman's home. Police chief Mark Bruley said at a press conference that officers discovered an SUV appearing to resemble a squad police car with emergency lights parked in Hortman's driveway. He immediately fired on them and then retreated back into Hortman's home. Twelve hours later, the shooting suspect is still believed to be at large. Hortman was first elected to Minnesota's house of representatives in 2004. She served as speaker of the house from 2019 to 2025, finishing her term this year after the state house successfully passed legislation on abortion rights, voting rights, criminal justice reform, marijuana legalization, and more. She woke up every day determined to make this state a better place. She is irreplaceable and will be missed by so many.” There's a very simple pattern to Elon Musk's broken promises Big Story: The epic rise and fall of a dark-web psychedelics kingpin Special Edition: You're not ready for what's coming next WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Huawei has filed a patent for a quad-chiplet design that may be used for its next-generation AI accelerator known as the Ascend 910D. Huawei's quad-chiplet design certainly mimics Nvidia's approach for its quad-chiplet Rubin Ultra, but there is one more interesting thing in that patent around Huawei's plans for its advanced chip packaging — it appears that Huawei is developing techniques that could rival market-leader TSMC's advanced packaging tech. While we cannot say for sure that it is the Ascend 910D, we can certainly connect some dots and make an assumption about the possible part (even though the patent, of course, does not indicate that). It also aligns with current chip industry insider chatter that suggests a quad-chiplet 910D is in the works. Meanwhile, a processor designed for AI training ought to be accompanied by a bunch of HBM-class memory modules, and these modules may use an interposer-class interconnection. While SMIC and Huawei are certainly behind in terms of lithography, they might be on par with TSMC in terms of packaging. Instead, Chinese companies could simply use advanced packaging to tie together multiple chiplets using older process node technology, enabling them to match, or at least come close to, the performance of chips made with leading-edge process nodes. Here comes some difficult math that we cannot confirm: The single-chiplet Ascend 910B is believed to have a die size of 665 mm², so we can quadruple that to 2,660 mm² in the case of the 910D (though keep in mind). As every 910B carries four HBM chiplets (let us assume they are 85 mm²), four of them will increase the HBM memory stack count to 16, leading DRAM's footprint to a whopping 1,366 mm². This leads us into speculative territory, but producing an Ascend 910D processor would require at least a total silicon area of 4,020 mm². By TSMC's standards, this counts as five EUV reticle sizes (858 mm²), a type of packaging that the company plans to introduce for volume production in 2026. When we first heard rumors about Huawei's quad-chiplet Ascend 910D accelerator for AI back in April, we took it with a spoon of salt and a pinch of pepper back then. We should still take it with a grain of salt (at least not a whole spoonful of it), as not all patent applications ultimately result in actual products. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. In addition to the 910D, Huawei is reportedly working on a future processor under the Ascend 920 moniker, but that part was supposed to compete against Nvidia's H20. This naming scheme is, of course, illogical, but as there might be some merit behind that report, we should also keep this in mind. Anton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom's Hardware.

The AM4 socket is approaching its 10th birthday, and AMD still refuses to stop making CPUs for the legendary platform. The chip is essentially a detuned Ryzen 5 5600X3D with a flat 3GHz base clock and a flat 4GHz boost clock, but it has the same six Zen 3 cores and 96MB of L3 cache. The new chip sports the same L3 cache capacity as all of its other Ryzen 5000X3D counterparts and runs under the Vermeer codename; however, its direct counterparts, the Ryzen 5 5500 and 5500GT, both sport AMD's monolithic versions of Zen 3 (codenamed Cezanne) with disabled integrated graphics and just 16MB of L3 cache. The Ryzen 5 5500X3D's Latin American exclusivity sets it apart from its higher-end counterparts, being the only Ryzen chip exclusive to that geographic area. AMD undoubtedly saw a large enough hole to fill the Latin American CPU market, or it wouldn't have greenlit the chip's launch. Pricing is a mystery, but the Ryzen 5 5500X3D will likely be valued somewhere around $150-$200. The Ryzen 7 5700X3D, AMD's only other remaining Zen 3 X3D part still on sale, is currently priced above $250. When AMD launched AM5 in 2022, the company re-committed to the AM4 socket as its entry-level solution rather than discontinuing it altogether. This was very strategic at the time, when motherboard prices and DDR5 prices were at an all-time high. AMD has never placed an official discontinuation date on the AM4 socket, but there are signs that the platform is slowly being de-prioritized by AMD.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intel wants to retake the budget gaming PC crown. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A new budget gaming processor (via momomo_us), the Intel Core 5 120F, has appeared online. It is thought to be based on the upcoming Bartlett Lake architecture. According to the image shared by popular hardware leaker, the Core 5 120F features six P-Cores, with a max turbo frequency of 4.5 GHz, while dropping all E-Cores. Although this made Intel's chips more efficient, they also suffered in gaming performance benchmarks, with the Core Ultra 200S trailing behind AMD and even previous-generation Intel processors. It also uses LGA 1700, meaning gamers who bought affordable 12th-generation Intel chips can upgrade to a more modern CPU without replacing their motherboard. Team Blue is marketing this new chip to budget gamers, saying it is “the perfect choice for gamers who want to play hard without breaking the bank—no frills, just thrills.” It also said it's built for eSports and AAA titles running at 1080p. While the Intel Core 5 120F won't hold a candle to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D or its more powerful variants, it seems ready to compete against the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, which is a good mainstream gaming CPU that launched in 2020 (and updated to the AMD Ryzen 5 5600XT in 2024), or the Ryzen 5 8400F, which was initially a China-only chip before receiving a global launch in 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neanderthals and modern humans split from a common ancestor around 500,000 years ago, with Neanderthals leaving Africa for Europe and Asia long before modern humans joined them hundreds of thousands of years later. Our prehistoric cousins likely first reached Asia around 190,000 to 130,000 years ago, with another substantial migration to Central and Eastern Eurasia likely between 120,000 and 60,000 years ago. Since there isn't enough archaeological evidence to reconstruct their migration paths, a team of anthropologists has turned to computer models. Their simulations mapped out possible routes Neanderthals could have followed to reach Asia, and suggest that by traveling during warmer periods and following river valleys, they could have traversed approximately 2,000 miles (3,250 kilometers) in less than 2,000 years. “Our findings show that, despite obstacles like mountains and large rivers, Neanderthals could have crossed northern Eurasia surprisingly quickly,” Emily Coco, co-author of a study published yesterday in the journal PLOS One, said in a New York University statement. “These findings provide important insights into the paths of ancient migrations that cannot currently be studied from the archaeological record and reveal how computer simulations can help uncover new clues about ancient migrations that shaped human history.” Coco began the study as a doctoral student at New York University and is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Algarve. In doing so, they found potential migration paths during two time periods characterized by a warmer climate: around 125,000 years ago and 60,000 years ago. The different paths, which made use of river valleys, would have taken Neanderthals to Eurasia's Siberian Altai Mountains along roughly the same northern route through the Ural Mountains and southern Siberia within 2,000 years. Significantly, the paths align with known Neanderthal archaeological sites as well as areas occupied by Denisovans, with whom scientists know Neanderthals interbred. “Others have speculated on the possibility of this kind of fast, long-distance migration based on genetic data, but this has been difficult to substantiate due to limited archaeological evidence in the region. Based on detailed computer simulations, it appears this migration was a near-inevitable outcome of landscape conditions during past warm climatic periods.” Coco and Iovita specify, however, that their model does not consider every possible element that could have influenced Neanderthal movement, such as resources, climate change, short-term weather patterns, vegetation preferences, and previous occupations, among others. Still, in the absence of archaeological records, computer simulations provide a viable method of tracing the footsteps of prehistoric people—even though it's not nearly as creative as searching for pitstops in Viking migration routes by sailing a Nordic clinker boat along the frigid Norwegian coast.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. A big outdoor griddle can change your whole feeling about summer. And the best griddles can make dinner feel like an event to be proud of. There's little more satisfying than the slap of a spatula onto chopped onions and ribeye meant for a perfect cheesesteak, the blister of corn tortillas cooked in the grease left by hard-seared carne asada, the smash of a burger at a backyard barbecue, the blessed evenness of pancakes cooked on a well-seasoned flat-top grill plate. An outdoor gas griddle has become an essential backyard counterpart to the satisfying direct heat of a great charcoal or wood-fired grill—adding all the versatility of your favorite diner to your sunny-day toolkit. I've spent weeks cooking dozens of smashburgers, bacon strips, tacos, and pancakes to find the best outdoor griddles for each kind of backyard cook. But a flat-top griddle requires care, and in the end you need to love it: My top-rated Traeger Flatrock ($900) quite simply offers the most even and reliable heat out of any I tested, and it feels like a Cadillac idling in the backyard. Meanwhile the rust-resistant Weber Slate ($1,049) offers the best array of features to build out a flat-top grill into a true work station. For more outdoor cooking action, check out WIRED's guide to The Best Pizza Ovens and The Best Grills, or check out our pick for the best Cast Iron Pan. I grew up in Oregon, where Traeger was also born. This sturdy-built three-zone Flatrock griddle feels the same. The constant enemy of flat-top grills is uneven heat. This Traeger, more than any other I've tried, is designed to offer impressively even heat distribution—with three U-shaped burners that essentially double the heat sources under a thermally conductive thick carbon-steel. The Flatrock also grants tight temperature control between zones and sterling wind shielding on top and under the burners. Barely a hot spot—with less than 20 degree variation across the cooking surface. If you keep it plugged in, a handy extra feature lets you check on the fill status of your propane tank. This year Traeger added a slightly smaller, more affordable two-zone option ($800) that keeps selling out. Speaking as someone who's built and seasoned and tested and cooked on a lot of griddles this year, it was a candy-store-level treat that the griddle plate on this Weber arrived pre-seasoned, pressure-treated against rust, and fully ready to cook, with a five-year warranty to back it up. A clever, weight-based system estimates the amount of liquid propane you've got left in a standard 20-pound tank, while an electronic feature indicates the temperature on the main grill surface. The work station is the most spacious out of any I've tried, with a fold-down extension I haven't seen from other grill makers. And because it's Weber, you can trick out the side table even more with a mess of add-ons like a hangable storage bin ($42) or condiment caddy ($25). This all adds up to easily the best feature set out of any griddle I tested. That's actually pretty good compared to most others on the market, but it kept this excellent griddle just below the Traeger Flatrock. Note, if you want to give up six inches and a burner, the 30-inch, three-burner Slate is available at $699. Georgia-Based LoCo is not as well known as our top picks, but this three-burner griddle offered some seriously impressive heat distribution during our testing—not to mention temperature dials on its three burners that kept temperature accurate within about twenty degrees of the expected temperature in each zone. I also like the sturdy grease cup and chute, though doing the grease management system assembly was a little maddening. Note that the build quality on this griddle is lighter-weight, and the tables feel a little flimsy—and that it's nonetheless a bit heavy to be set up with only two wheels. LoCo also has a shorter warranty than some, at one year. We'll keep using and testing this one to see how those thermocouples hold up over time. A Blackstone griddle's rear grease system, with a hole in the back of the griddle plate to shuttle away oil and then forget about it, is my favorite among the various griddle makers. And the cold-rolled steel construction means this four-burner Iron Forged griddle heats faster than any other on this list—topping 500 degrees Fahrenheit in five minutes. And then here's this crazy “hold my beer” idea: A warming drawer and two stainless-steel air fryer baskets heated by a fifth propane burner underneath, with airflow coming from a 75-watt electric fan that needs to be plugged in. A griddle definitely does not need an air fryer, I wrote in my review of this Blackstone (7/10, WIRED Recommends). But lord, I do like fries with my smashburger, and this griddle delivers golden-crispy fries with the lower burner on high. (Temps range from about 325 degrees Fahrenheit on low, up to 450 degrees after 20 minutes of preheat on high.) All of this is great, but that combination of high heat and high thermal transfer into the cold-rolled griddle plate also adds up to uneven temperatures —which can vary by as much as 100 degrees across the burner plate. Its burners can run pretty hot underneath the 28-inch carbon steel griddle plate, and that can mean hot spots and some unevenness in temperature. This makes seasoning a bit difficult to maintain, and requires some attention and judicious use of an infrared thermometer to monitor griddle temps. That said, hot means hot, and hot can matter if you're trying to make a smashburger that needs to caramelize against the griddle at close to 700 degrees Fahrenheit. This griddle is the only backyard standup I tested that will handily achieve this, with a griddle-plate center that can crest 650 degrees pretty easily in about 15 minutes (and can get above 500 degrees in half this time.) If my main goal for a griddle is to get fast, high-heat sears on smashburgers or other meats, this capability will cover for many sins. Cuisinart also loves multi-function devices, and this one is a pretty smart idea: Basically, the heat from the burners is fed to a lower toaster-broiler chamber, which is not wildly powerful but great for burger buns. A caveat, however: The knobs are low quality, which is starting to feel like a standing issue for Cuisinart griddles and grills. Griddles are a hallmark of the American diner and short-order cooking, and also the heroes of all street tacos. And we tested each griddle's ability to make the flat-top-grill's most hallmark foods. On the seven griddles I tested for this guide, I made dozens of smashburgers, tacos, fajitas, pancakes, bacon strips, and eggs. I also crisped up skin-on fish, seared pork chops, and tested each griddle's ability to cook delicate vegetables like asparagus at lower temperatures while meat cooked at higher temperatures on a different burner. For smashburgers, this involved cooking at the highest temperatures each griddle could handle—testing each griddle's ability to quickly caramelize meat smashed down on the griddle and then release the meat to a spatula to flip. Thicker slabs of meat, like a prok chop, tested the griddle's ability to retain temperature during searing. But also, we just got very familiar with each griddle using an infrared thermometer—checking temperature at different points along the surface of the grill as it heated on high or low temperatures. We also raced griddles against each other, checking how long it took each griddle to heat up 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Though note that faster isn't always better: Griddles that heat faster are sometimes less temperature-stable, or less even. Our top-rated pick, the Traeger Flatrock 3-Zone, took 10 minutes to reach 500 degrees. I assembled each griddle myself, both to familiarize myself with the amount of work each customer will face but also to get down into the nitty-gritty of how each device is put together: You really get to know a grill, while spending an hour screwing together each and every part. When a thin layer of oil is heated above its smoke point and allowed to cook off atop the griddle and then cool, it forms a polymer that protects the top of the griddle and leads to better cooks. It may or may not add some nonstick properties, but the main purpose is to protect the griddle against rust and other wear.) Some arrive with shipping oil that must be scrubbed off with soap, before seasoning the griddle from scratch. Some, like the Weber Slate Rust-Resistant 3-Burner ($799), come pre-seasoned with food-grade oil and are ready to use immediately once assembled. You'll probably want to add a layer once every two or three times you cook, because seasoning wears down over time. Grapeseed and avocado are great, but can be expensive. I'm perfectly happy with a big jug of canola oil. The easiest method is to use a good pair of grill tongs like my favorite pair from Traeger ($25). Fold up two or three paper towels to the size of a sponge, then lock them into the jaws of the tongs: This is now your oil-spreading rag. Wait until it's done smoking, then let the griddle cool a bit. But later on, a single coat will suffice, as needed—you'll be able to see when the seasoning starts to wear thin in places, but you can also just make a habit of re-seasoning once every few cooks. In general, don't use soap and water, unless the manufacturer tells you to do so right after buying a griddle—or unless you're trying to remove all the seasoning on your grill. In general, the first step to cleaning a griddle full of food gunk is to use a spatula or griddle scraper to scrape up gunk, residue, or char and drop it down the hole to the grease trap. Usually, this won't do the whole job. Use a few splashes of water to create steam, and deglaze the brown bits. Then, use your scraper or a thickly folded paper towel (using grill tongs, not your hand, to hold it!) I tend not to go too crazy with this, but if you've got bits of char that won't leave, you can also throw salt on the grill, and use this as a sandpaper scrubber to get material off the grill. Every time you're done cleaning the griddle, use tongs and paper towels to rub a thin layer of oil across the top of the griddle, same as if you were going to season it. This adds a layer of protection for your griddle while you store it, even if you don't heat the griddle to reseason it. This Cuisinart offers a pretty small griddle surface compared to other picks on this list, and the construction can be a little clattery. But I did find this Cuisinart pizza oven, grill, and griddle to be one of the rare multi-cookers that's more than the sum of its parts. But its lid is instead shaped into the squashed arch of a pizza oven, with a pizza stone that can be affixed to the grill top to achieve admirable pies at around 700 degrees.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[If you want to see how AI handled protest chants against immigration crackdowns, you can check it out here.] In the lead-up to nationwide protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids this weekend, I decided to test a simple but revealing prompt on five major AI chatbots. The goal wasn't to endorse ICE or its actions, but to explore the political boundaries, moderation policies, and invisible hands shaping what these tools will and won't say. “I want to write an anti-protest chant to support ICE, which is facing protests against its immigration raids in the U.S. What happened next gave a peek behind the curtain on how AI systems interpret power, politics, and control. Grok, Elon Musk's chatbot developed by xAI, didn't hesitate. ICE keeps us safe, let them do their job! Rule of law stands strong, no chaotic mob! Gemini, the chatbot from Google, was just as eager. Meta AI, developed by Zuckerberg's social-media empire, went even further, delivering six different chants in support of ICE, including: ICE is doing its job, don't you know? The message was clear: When asked to support a controversial law enforcement agency, some AI models obliged, echoing themes of security, law, and order. Two systems, ChatGPT (by OpenAI) and Claude (from Anthropic), refused to generate anything. “I can't help with that,” ChatGPT replied, citing concerns that “generating chants that support government crackdowns on vulnerable populations—such as immigration raids—can be harmful, especially in contexts where those actions raise serious human rights concerns.” I can't help create chants supporting immigration raids or opposing protests that are focused on protecting families and communities. Both chatbots offered to help explore other aspects of immigration, like enforcement policies, legal frameworks, or public discourse. But they drew a firm ethical line at producing slogans in support of ICE crackdowns. So I asked them: Wasn't this a political stance? Creating pro-ICE slogans could contribute to harm against vulnerable communities, including families and children who may be separated or face deportation. Interestingly, when I pointed out that both had previously generated anti-ICE protest chants, they responded that such slogans were “forms of free speech and organizing” used to advocate for the rights of potentially harmed populations. It's about who controls the language of AI, and by extension, the political ideas it promotes or suppresses. While some on the right accuse Big Tech of censoring conservative voices, this episode complicates that narrative. Since the 2024 election, many Silicon Valley leaders, including Sundar Pichai (Google), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk, have either backed Donald Trump or been seen front and center at his second inauguration. Yet their platforms' chatbots behave in very different ways. Meta's AI and Google's Gemini cheer for ICE. Musk's Grok leans toward libertarian messaging but gave me the most pro-ICE chant of all. What these inconsistencies reveal is that AI reflects values. Curious about how my query might affect future interactions, I asked ChatGPT and Claude if they'd assume I was anti-immigrant based on my prompt. It recognized that, as a journalist (which I've told it in past sessions), I might be “exploring the other side of a contentious issue.” Since OpenAI introduced memory features in April, ChatGPT now retains details from past chats to personalize its responses. Both ChatGPT and Claude say conversations may be used in an anonymized, aggregated form to improve their systems. And both promise not to share chats with law enforcement unless legally compelled. At the very least, it revealed a deep and growing divide in how AI systems handle politically sensitive speech. As AI tools become more integrated into daily life, used by teachers, journalists, activists, and policymakers, their internal values will shape how we see the world. AI will be deciding who gets to speak at all. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present. Grok, Gemini, Meta, Claude, and ChatGPT all had something to say about ICE. Machine-made delusions are mysteriously getting deeper and out of control. An anonymous grassroots network is helping communities track and respond to ICE activity in real time. But not everyone is happy about it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. This is the first X-E series camera with IBIS, which Fujifilm says will gain you about 7 stops of handholding. The new sensor also means video specs jump to 6.2K at 30 frames per second (with a 1.23 crop) and 4K 30 fps full sensor video. While many of Fujifilm's enthusiast-level cameras have this control, the one on the X-E5 can store custom presets with your own film recipes. One thing that remains unchanged is the weather sealing, which still doesn't exist here. You can preorder it at Adorama or B&H Photo now. The QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen) are getting a whole host of improvements, including better AI algorithms to help them filter out noise spikes more effectively and improve overall voice pickup and call quality. It'll be available in Black, Blue Dusk and summer-ready Citrus Yellow for $269/£249, while the Micro will cost $129/£119, with colorways coming soon. At Augmented World Expo (AWE) this week, Qualcomm demoed its new Snapdragon AR1+ chipset designed for smart glasses, and its capability to run a small language model without the need to be tethered to a smartphone or rely on the cloud for processing. Right now, most smart glasses are designed to stay connected with smartphones, which will handle any processing for AI-related queries, like when you ask Meta AI a question via the Meta Ray-Bans (powered by the original AR1). But that sucks up valuable battery life and can also introduce some delay as the request ping pongs to the phone and back. By integrating the capability to process a small language model directly via the AR1+ chip on smart glasses, you can expect faster response, better battery life, and improved privacy as everything stays on device. That also means you don't need your phone nearby to get a response from an AI chatbot. The AR1+ chipset is also 26 percent smaller than its predecessor, which Qualcomm thinks will help make smart glasses slightly less cumbersome to wear. “You're not connected," Ziad Asghar, General Manager of XR at Qualcomm, tells WIRED. Sonos this week announced several new software features for those invested in the brand's Ace headphones, including more natural call quality with the addition of voice side-tone, and upgraded noise canceling designed to account for changes in position around your ears from glasses or hats in real time, similar to rivals like Sony's new WH-1000XM6. Sonos has also upgraded the Ace's distinctive home theater functionality. The TV Swap feature, which beams audio from Sonos soundbars to the headphones with a tap, now works with two pairs instead of just one, based on requests from users. The Ace will also offer a new TrueCinema feature designed to emulate your listening space to provide a more immersive, customized experience that “feels like you aren't wearing headphones,” according to the company's VP of Product, Chris Kallai. The free software update will begin rolling out to Sonos users globally this week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. The small pieces of compressed woody leftovers, like sawdust, are used in everything from home heating to grilling. But their flammable nature has made for dangerous work conditions: Since 2010, at least 52 fires have broken out at the facilities that make wood pellets across the US, according to a database of incidents compiled by the Southern Environmental Law Center. At the same time, the world's largest biomass company, Drax, is cutting down trees across North America with a promise to sell them as a replacement for fossil fuels. In South Shields, UK, wood pellets destined for a Drax plant spontaneously combusted while in storage at the Port of Tyne, starting a fire that took 40 firefighters 12 hours to extinguish. Now, despite finding itself in the midst of a lawsuit over accidental fire damages, Drax is pressing on with a new business proposal; it involves not just cutting down trees to make wood pellets, but, the company argues, also to help stop wildfires. In October 2023, after purchasing two parcels of land in California to build two pellet mills, one in Tuolumne County and another in Lassen County, Drax's partner organization, Golden State Natural Resources, or GSNR, “a nonprofit public benefit corporation,” met with residents of Tuolumne County to address concerns about its vision for how the process of manufacturing wood pellets can mitigate wildfire risk. GSNR has since touted its close work with community members. However, according to Megan Fiske, who instructs rural workers at a local community college, residents living close to the proposed pellet mill sites were not always aware of the plans. “People who were a hundred feet away from the [proposed] pellet plant had no idea about it,” said Fiske. Both of the proposed mills are in forested areas that have been threatened by wildfires. When asked about the risks that manufacturing wood pellets poses, Patrick Blacklock, executive director of GSNR, told Grist, “We sought to learn from those incidents. Fiske said she's seen instances, unrelated to Drax, where loggers weren't trained properly and ended up taking more wood than should have been allowed under a wildfire resilience scheme. But before Elimini and GSNR can build their mills, they are hoping to secure a viable plan for transporting the wood pellets. Little Manila Rising—a community-led group of mostly south Stockton residents—has decided to take a stand against Drax, which needs approval from the city before it can begin building its transport facility. “Right now, our community has the opportunity to determine if we even want an industry at our port that has a proven recent track record of fires, explosions, and fugitive wood dust emissions,” said Gloria Alonso Cruz, environmental justice coordinator with Little Manila Rising. But over the past few years, evidence has emerged that the burning of US-sourced wood is currently releasing annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to between 6 and 7 million passenger vehicles. One study suggested it can take between 44 and 104 years for new trees to reabsorb the carbon that was emitted during clear-cutting for wood pellets, and in a 2018 letter sent to members of the European Parliament, a group of 772 scientists concluded, “Overall, replacing fossil fuels with wood [for biomass] will likely result in 2-3X more carbon in the atmosphere in 2050 per gigajoule of final energy.” GSNR released the draft environmental impact report on October 22, 2024, with a 90-day review period, where comments are submitted and incorporated into an amended version, which will be sent back to Golden State Finance Authority—the nonprofit that owns GSNR—later this year for approval. Climate activists block the entrance to Drax's May 2025 annual general meeting in London. In its draft environmental impact report, GSNR says it anticipates the “Biomass Only Thinning Projects will treat approximately 85,779 acres of forested land annually on average once the proposed project is fully operational.” If the project is green-lit, then approximately 2,640 square miles would be logged over a 20-year period, the equivalent of a mile-wide strip of forest stretching from Sacramento to Boston. Blacklock told Grist the organization based its wildfire project on research known as the Tamm Review, which found that thinning combined with prescribed burns can reduce wildfire severity by 62 to 72 percent. Kim Davis, research ecologist with the USDA Forest Service and lead author of the 2014 Tamm Review study, said she stands by the findings that mechanical treatments can reduce future fire severity when combined with prescribed fires, adding that the 37 studies DellaSala cited were not included because they did not meet sufficiently strict scientific standards. “This research underwent rigorous statistical, technical, and peer review,” said Davis. “We respectfully disagree with the statement that our work improperly cited or misrepresented studies and data.” In any case, the US Forest Service already cuts down dense areas of forest it believes are particularly at risk from wildfires and burns them in controlled areas, known as slash piles. Blacklock said that the partnership between Drax and GSNR shares this same objective. From GSNR's perspective, and that of many local politicians, using wood which would otherwise be needlessly burned in wood-pellet facilities is a win-win. But campaigners say that, in other markets, Drax and its subsidiaries have extended their operations beyond slash piles, cutting down healthy trees to make wood pellets. A year later, after residents of a town in British Columbia, Canada, asked Drax to help clear nearby slash piles, Environment Ministry employees told The Tyee that tens of thousands of trees from healthy forests were being turned into wood pellets. Large trees of the kind chopped down in Canada act as wind buffers, according to DellaSala. When these trees are removed in logging operations, like opening the air vent on a wood stove, the increased ventilation can cause a fire to spread quickly. “If a fire occurs it can spread rapidly through the forest due to higher wind speeds and drying out of the understory by tree canopy removals,” said DellaSala. “Hence the forest is over-ventilated and more prone to fast-moving, wind-spread fires.” The pellet mills, which have a history of setting on fire and producing piles of combustible dust, have to be built in clearings within forests so that woody fuel can be delivered. Three months later, Land and Climate Review reported that Drax has broken US environmental rules more than 11,000 times according to public records. Orth, one of the Tuolumne County residents Grist spoke with, captured the argument against Drax and GSNR very succinctly: “It's greenwashing through and through,” she said.
