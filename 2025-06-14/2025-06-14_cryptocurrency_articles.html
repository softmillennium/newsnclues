                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Algorand is seeing over a million daily transactions, with its upgraded protocol drawing renewed smart contract deployment. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is riding a surge in trading volume, amplified by external sentiment and public endorsements. With its mainnet set to go live 4 weeks before listing, dApps will actively launch 1 week prior to listing, and 40% of tokens will be circulating, offering builders a working blockchain before trading begins. Combined with a $303 million presale and strong infrastructure, BlockDAG is gaining attention not through hype, but through early adoption and ecosystem functionality ahead of listing. In the final stretch before its highly anticipated exchange debut, BlockDAG is already showing signs of long-term utility through early developer traction. Instead, builders will actively launch decentralized applications (dApps) on the BDAG network. Moreover, the infrastructure is already proving reliable, supporting early smart contract deployment and EVM compatibility. Consequently, this readiness is drawing in Web3 developers who are now testing and releasing functional applications ahead of the listing. Importantly, these early launches not only validate the stability of the mainnet but also help build a pipeline of tools and services that could drive user adoption immediately post-launch. In parallel, the presale has raised $303 million, sold over 22.4 billion tokens, and reached batch 29 at a price of $0.0276 which is now rolled back to $0.0018 until June 19th, delivering a 2,660% ROI since batch 1. By doing so, it's laying the groundwork for an ecosystem where builders can thrive from day one. This increase reflects renewed network activity and growing use of its layer-1 features. One major reason for the rise is Algorand's upgraded protocol, which supports faster block finality and higher throughput. As a consequence, these improvements have attracted greater smart contract interaction, especially across DeFi and enterprise-grade applications. Given these developments, Algorand (ALGO) price analysis suggests growing investor attention may follow the on-chain strength. Historically speaking, increased network usage has often preceded price movement, and with ALGO's recent breakout past short-term resistance, momentum may be building. Currently, analysts are closely watching whether sustained transaction growth can push ALGO toward stronger technical levels in the weeks ahead. With that in mind, solid fundamentals and improved utility metrics suggest Algorand is showing renewed potential just as market confidence begins to rebuild. This development coincided with Elon Musk's public olive branch toward Donald Trump on X, easing some of the political tension that had weighed on the meme token. Following this shift, chart patterns now suggest the start of what analysts call a Cycle 3 rally, indicating a potential upside toward the speculative but eye‑catching Dogecoin (DOGE) price target of $10. At present, it is trading near $0.20 after breaking above $0.19 resistance, and DOGE's V-shaped recovery from the $0.18 zone aligns with this outlook. If this trend continues and the profile holds above moving averages, the $10 mark, or incremental steps toward that level, could gain traction among traders focused on a bold DOGE trajectory. While Algorand's growing transaction count reflects technical engagement and Dogecoin's rally highlights sentiment-driven potential, BlockDAG is offering developers something more concrete. Its live mainnet, active dApp deployment, and early ecosystem usage suggest that it is already being put to work. For those evaluating long-term value based on functionality rather than hype, BlockDAG's current builder momentum may be the most telling signal ahead of its upcoming exchange listing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While established assets like Chainlink (LINK) are displaying strength, Nexchain is attracting significant attention as a notable crypto presale project in 2025. Currently in Stage 18, Nexchain has raised $4.2 million and offers a use case supported by artificial intelligence technology. Its combination of real-world adoption and structured tokenomics is gaining traction among investors evaluating presale opportunities. Chainlink is trading around $14.57 after bouncing off key support levels last week. Recently, Chainlink announced a cross-border initiative, facilitating secure transactions between Hong Kong's central bank digital currency (CBDC) and an Australian dollar stablecoin. This integration highlights Chainlink's position in global decentralized finance and its ongoing relevance. Derivatives market data indicates increased long positions on LINK, suggesting growing trader confidence. To approach the $50 price level, Chainlink would likely require broader market support and additional institutional adoption. Nevertheless, its role in oracle services and cross-chain data sharing keeps it among notable Layer 0 blockchain assets. While established tokens experience growth, presales such as Nexchain are generating interest through technological advancements. Currently in Stage 18, Nexchain tokens (NEX) are priced at $0.07, with a target listing price of $0.30. To purchase NEX tokens, investors should visit the official website, connect their cryptocurrency wallet, and complete transactions using USDT, ETH, or BNB. Nexchain's notable feature is its hybrid consensus model combining AI automation with Proof-of-Stake, capable of processing up to 400,000 transactions per second. Investors reviewing crypto ICO presale options may find Nexchain distinguished by its functionality and technological infrastructure. The AI-driven blockchain technology, low transaction costs, and diverse application use cases position Nexchain as a notable project among current presale offerings. Investors evaluating presale opportunities may consider Nexchain for its technology and proposed utility.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This isn't just another token launch; with Solaxy building something that Solana desperately needs: the blockchain's first Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution. Anyone who's used Solana during peak traffic knows the frustration. Network congestion turns what should be lightning-fast transactions into slow, expensive headaches. Solaxy's team recognized this critical gap and built their entire project around solving it. Solaxy's approach uses rollup technology, combined with off-chain computation, to deliver what Solana users have been waiting for: cheaper, faster, and more reliable transactions that work when you need them most. As the crypto market matures and institutional players demand enterprise-grade performance, Solana's infrastructure limitations become increasingly problematic. Solaxy works as a bridge between Solana's massive potential and practical usability. Fast, modular, permissionless.Together, we're building the first true Layer 2 bridge for Solana… pic.twitter.com/Jfk2GJUUD3 The team outlined two core objectives on their developer updates page: Building ultra-low latency validator infrastructure for instant transfers, plus designing user experience flows that feel intuitive and production-ready from day one. The infrastructure they're building has mass adoption written all over it. While many projects talk big and deliver small, Solaxy is already proving its technical capabilities. Last week's testnet launch gave users hands-on access to move funds, track transactions through the Solaxy explorer, and deploy smart contracts. Leading industry analyst Jacob Bury sees 10x potential in $SOLX, though that might be conservative. Analyst Miles G is backing the project for 100x gains once it hits major exchanges. According to Blockworks reporting, US regulators are moving toward approving the first Solana spot ETF. The SEC has requested updated S-1 forms from Solana ETF issuers this week, which industry insiders interpret as a strong signal that approval could come within months. But here's what smart money knows: when major cryptocurrencies pump, their ecosystem tokens often gain significantly more. Multiple bullish factors are aligning for Solaxy's explosive potential, including a rising M2 money supply, growing institutional crypto demand, and increasingly favorable regulatory conditions for digital assets. The current presale price is $0.001754, but once $SOLX hits exchanges, price discovery shifts to pure supply and demand dynamics – and with nearly $50 million raised, demand looks overwhelming. Smart investors are recognizing this as their last opportunity to secure $SOLX before it faces open market pricing. The project's technical progress, strategic partnerships, and perfect timing suggest that this could be one of those rare opportunities that define a portfolio.

Oops, something went wrong

SonicStrategy shared that the Sonic blockchain's native token, $S, is set to be listed on Coinbase (COIN), one of the world's most trusted and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, as announced by Coinbase yesterday June 12th. Unlike conventional token listings for assets built on Ethereum or Solana, the inclusion of $S on Coinbase represents a full-stack integration of the Sonic network, a significant technical and strategic milestone. This integration opens the door to a new level of accessibility, legitimacy, and scalability for the Sonic ecosystem and all participants within it. he upcoming listing will enable Coinbase users to directly purchase $S using fiat currencies like USD and EUR, reducing barriers to entry and enhancing global liquidity. It also introduces the Sonic ecosystem to Coinbase's robust infrastructure-used by the majority of U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs-along with the potential for future integrations across DeFi, staking, and perpetual trading products.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among the many crypto presale projects, Nexchain stands out with its steady growth and real-world use cases. Its fully AI-powered blockchain is designed to revolutionize Web3 by combining automation, scalability, and real-world functionality. Currently, in Stage 18, the token price is set at $0.07 with $4.3 million already raised from global investors. By merging AI with Proof-of-Stake, Nexchain creates a hybrid consensus mechanism that allows high transaction throughput, low fees, and seamless cross-chain interoperability. This makes Nexchain highly attractive for industries like finance, healthcare, supply chains, and enterprise blockchain solutions. For those looking to buy presale crypto with real growth potential, Nexchain offers a compelling combination of advanced technology, daily passive income, and long-term value. Solana has recently printed its first-ever death cross against Ethereum, signaling caution for some traders. On the USD pair, both Solana and Ethereum continue to show bullish setups. This could lead to sideways consolidation rather than a clear breakout for either coin in the immediate term. As market sentiment remains strong, Solana continues to attract investor attention within the broader crypto presale projects conversation. XRP has been trading in a narrow range over the past 24 hours, consolidating between $2.27 and $2.32. Despite global trade tensions and diverging central bank policies, XRP has shown resilience with strong buying interest at critical support levels. This stability suggests that XRP remains a preferred option for many investors navigating volatile markets. While XRP consolidates, many traders are watching for breakout signals as global macro conditions shift. Its AI-powered blockchain, revenue-sharing model, and growing cross-industry adoption make it one of the most promising presale crypto tokens available. For investors seeking to buy presale crypto before the next market cycle, Nexchain delivers unmatched innovation, scalability, and passive income potential. Among all crypto ico presale opportunities, Nexchain remains a standout as we move deeper into 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has all chances to join the club of global macro assets and hit an almost $100 trillion capitalization. Such an insane upsurge will be driven by ETH accruing the functions of a global reserve macro asset. For instance, the report says, Ethereum (ETH) works not unlike digital oil, being the "fuel for computations" that can be stored and traded by reserve operators. Just like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) demonstrates all features of digital gold, but with sustainable yield rates and "productivity" while deposited to DeFi mechanisms. Also, Ether would be a digital replacement for the global bonds market as it can function as non-sovereign universal collateral that can be easily integrated into each and every financial system. Last but not least, Ethereum's (ETH) volume surges step-by-step, increasing together with its activity and ecosystem growth. As such, Ethereum (ETH) has all features of a global macro asset, and, given the average capitalization of such assets at $100 trillion, can be valued over $740,000 per coin. Bitcoin (BTC) First New Macro Asset in 150 Years, Analyst Says He also admitted that Bitcoin (BTC) achieved this status faster compared to all its competitors. However, as per some experts, Ethereum's store of value (SoV) narrative is even more powerful compared to Bitcoin's (BTC).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Authorities in Russia's Republic of Buryatia have uncovered an illegal cryptocurrency mining operation hidden inside a KamAZ truck siphoning electricity meant for a nearby village. Inside the truck, inspectors found 95 mining rigs and a mobile transformer station. Authorities have warned that illegal connections are disrupting local grids, causing voltage drops, overloads, and potential blackouts.

In Dec. 2024, Russia announced a ban on mining during peak energy months in several regions, including Dagestan, Chechnya, and parts of eastern Ukraine currently under Russian control. A full ban has already been enforced in the southern Irkutsk region since April. Major Russian mining industry firms like BitRiver rely on cheap electricity in Irkutsk. According to local sources, the Irkutsk region hosts the first and largest data center by BitRiver, which was launched in 2019 in Bratsk. Kaspersky has linked the hacker group known as “Librarian Ghouls” or “Rare Werewolf” to a cryptojacking campaign that compromised hundreds of Russian devices. The group used phishing emails posing as legitimate documents to spread malware and gain control of systems for unauthorized crypto mining. Once infected, the malware disables Windows Defender and schedules the compromised devices to operate between 1 am and 5 am, a tactic designed to avoid detection. During this window, hackers establish remote access, steal login credentials, and assess system specs to configure their miners efficiently.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin hovered around $105,100 on June 14, down 0.22% over the past 24 hours as traders digested geopolitical tension. Price action remained relatively tight, with BTC moving within a $2,090 range from $104,220 to $106,135. The largest moves occurred overnight in Asia trading, where Bitcoin briefly dipped below $104,200 before rebounding on high volume. More than $1.1 billion in crypto liquidations were recorded during the initial wave of conflict headlines, though bitcoin has shown resilience in the aftermath. Market participants are watching this range closely, particularly as safe-haven demand and risk sentiment remain intertwined. While short-term headlines continue to drive volatility, the broader structure suggests BTC is consolidating rather than reversing. If support around $104,950 holds, Bitcoin may attempt another push above $106,200.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among them is ZBNC, known for its focus on real-world payments and blockchain efficiency. But even more notably, Remittix is stepping forward as a standout. With a clear use case in global crypto-to-fiat transfers and growing adoption, it is fast becoming the altcoin that not only competes but delivers. Fresh XRP news is boosting market sentiment as analysts highlight growing momentum behind the asset. That level would follow a historical pattern where XRP sees rapid gains once key resistance levels are cleared. In addition to technical signals, whale accumulation is on the rise again. Ripple's ongoing expansion in Asia and the Middle East is increasing demand through real-world cross-border payment use cases. As of May 2025, XRP saw a 10% price jump in a single week, according to Finance Magnates, after renewed optimism surrounding Ripple's legal clarity and ecosystem growth. Notably, some crypto analysts now suggest XRP could reach as high as $10 by the end of 2025, with even loftier targets like $100 floated by high-profile voices citing XRP's growing role in global financial infrastructure. As XRP fights to reclaim its highs, some investors are asking what the next breakout altcoin might be. Built to streamline blockchain-based financial transfers, ZBNC focuses on scalability, low fees and frictionless crypto-to-fiat solutions. Unlike projects that rely solely on hype, ZBNC has been quietly building out solid infrastructure geared toward real-world adoption. With growing network activity and a focus on solving real problems, ZBNC is earning its place in the payment token conversation. Analysts say its trajectory aligns with a broader market trend: utility is outperforming speculation. While both XRP and ZBNC are gaining momentum, Remittix is standing out by delivering real functionality today. The platform lets users convert over 100 cryptocurrencies into fiat and send funds directly to global bank accounts. There's no need for wallets, bridges or crypto-native complexity, just smooth, fast transfers that feel like traditional banking. With over $15.6 million raised in its presale and expanding traction via the Remittix Pay API, the project is quickly gaining interest from individuals and businesses alike. For individuals who prioritize speed and cost over hype, Remittix is emerging as the practical solution. Legal clarity, growing utility and steady accumulation trends suggest XRP may still have a major run ahead. With its ability to support seamless crypto-to-fiat payments for both individuals and businesses, Remittix stands out as the more immediate and usable solution. If you're looking for real-world impact, not just hype, Remittix may be the better bet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the past year, threat actors have significantly escalated their attacks against Web3 developers by publishing malicious packages to trusted registries including npm and PyPI, exploiting the implicit trust developers place in these repositories. These campaigns represent a calculated shift toward financially motivated attacks that leverage the unique vulnerabilities present in blockchain development environments. Socket.dev analysts identified four recurring threat classes that dominate the current landscape: credential stealers, crypto drainers, cryptojackers, and clipboard hijackers. These malicious packages exploit the unique attack surface created by blockchain developers' reliance on open source dependencies, combined with CI/CD pipelines that often lack strict dependency validation or isolation. The financial impact of these attacks has been severe, with threat actors successfully extracting millions in cryptocurrency from compromised development environments. The most sophisticated aspect of these supply chain attacks lies in their credential extraction capabilities, which have evolved far beyond simple file system scraping. Modern credential stealers employ multi-layered approaches that combine direct file system access with runtime manipulation to capture sensitive cryptographic material from developer environments. Advanced stealers implement monkey-patching techniques that intercept keypair generation at the library level without modifying source files. In documented PyPI campaigns, malware intercepted Solana keypair creation by modifying library methods at runtime, capturing private keys during generation, encrypting them with hardcoded RSA-2048 public keys, and embedding the encrypted data in blockchain memo transactions sent to Solana Devnet. This technique allows threat actors to retrieve and decrypt stolen credentials remotely while maintaining stealth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Data Point Decoding the headlines with facts, figures, and numbers FILE PHOTO: Trump reported hundreds of millions of dollars in income from crypto, golf clubs and licensing ventures in a public financial report. The annual financial disclosure form, which appeared to cover the 2024 calendar year, shows the president's push into crypto added substantially to his wealth but he also reported large fees from developments and revenues from his other businesses. While Trump has said he has put his businesses into a trust managed by his children, the disclosures show how income from them still ultimately accrue to the president - something that has opened him to conflicts of interest. Some of his businesses in areas such as crypto, for example, benefit from U.S. policy shifts under him and have become a source of criticism. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A meme coin released earlier this year by the president -$TRUMP - alone has earned an estimated $320 million in fees, though it's not publicly known how that amount has been divided between a Trump-controlled entity and its partners. In addition to the meme coin fees, the Trump family has raked in more than $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance company. The Trump family is involved, also, with a bitcoin mining operation and digital asset exchange-traded funds. In the disclosures, Trump reported $57.35 million from token sales at World Liberty. He also reported holding 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture. The wealth of the Republican businessman-turned-politician ranges from crypto to real estate, and a large part on paper is tied up in his stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, owner of social media platform Truth Social. The disclosure showed income from various assets including Trump's properties in Florida. Trump's three golf-focused resorts in the state - Jupiter, Doral and West Palm Beach - plus his nearby private members' club at Mar-a-Lago generated at least $217.7 million in income, according to the filing. Trump collected royalty money, also, from a variety of deals - $1.3 million from the Greenwood Bible (its website describes it as "the only Bible officially endorsed by Lee Greenwood and President Trump"); $2.8 million from Trump Watches, and $2.5 million from Trump Sneakers and Fragrances. Trump listed $1.16 million in income from his NFTs - digital trading cards in his likeness while First Lady Melania Trump earned around $216,700 from license fees her own NFT collection.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's sources of income range from luxury properties around the world to royalty payments and license fees for using his name and likeness on everything from sneakers to bibles, according to a financial disclosure form filed June 13. One of the biggest money-making ventures for Trump was World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency platform launched last year. It brought in $57.3 million. His meme coin $TRUMP was not part of the form as it was only released this year. Last month, Trump dined with 220 of the biggest investors in his $TRUMP meme coin as a reward for making the leaderboard in a contest to be among the top purchasers, raising ethics questions. His estate and member's only private club Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, brought in more than $50 million, meanwhile a property in Dubai generated more than $15 million in license fees. Royalty payments include $3 million for a coffee table book “Save America”; $2.5 million for Trump Sneakers and Fragrances; $1.3 million for The Greenwood Bible and more than $1 million for the “45” Guitar. The  form also listed liabilities including over $50 million in damages to E. Jean E. Carroll, the magazine columnist who sued Trump for sexual abuse and defamation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reportedly said Wednesday (June 11) that the company's XRP cryptocurrency could account for 14% of the cross-border payment volume currently handled by SWIFT within five years. Noting that SWIFT handles messaging while banks handle liquidity, Garlinghouse said, “I think less about the messaging and more about liquidity,” Seeking Alpha reported Friday (June 13). Enterprises are warming up to alternative cross-border money movement vehicles, including blockchain-based solutions that offer streamlined cross-border flows while freeing up capital previously trapped in correspondent accounts across multiple countries, PYMNTS reported in June 2024. These enterprises are doing so because cross-border payments are fraught with inefficiencies, high fees and delayed transactions, largely due to the ongoing limitations of traditional methods and legacy infrastructure. Blockchain technology offers transformative potential to address these issues by streamlining processes and reducing costs, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Can Blockchain Solve the Cross-Border Payments Puzzle?” The report found that by using distributed ledger technology to enable direct transactions without intermediaries, blockchain technology reduces costs and speeds up settlement times, with transactions potentially completed in seconds rather than days. On June 5, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the company is considering using stablecoins to transfer money among different countries because they can help reduce the cost of moving money. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.
