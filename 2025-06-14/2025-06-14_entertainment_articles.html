                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following a rare admission that his immigration policies were hurting farming and hospitality businesses, Donald Trump's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will hold off on raids on workers in those industries, The New York Times reported. “Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” Trump posted on Truth Social Thursday. He then turned to his common refrain, which is to blame Joe Biden: “In many cases the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs. The American Farm Bureau Federation, an agricultural lobbying group, praised Trump's comments in a statement, thanking him for “recognizing the contributions of farmworkers who play a vital role in growing food across America, and committing to preserve the ability of farms to provide a safe and secure food supply.” On Tuesday, Elizabeth Strater, vice president of the United Farm Workers, called immigration officials' presence in California “chaotic.” Maureen McGuire, chief executive of California's Ventura County farm bureau told The Los Angeles Times that since major raids began earlier this month, anywhere from 25 percent to 45 percent of farmworkers in the area stopped coming to work. “When our workforce is afraid, fields go unharvested, packinghouses fall behind, and market supply chains, from local grocery stores to national retailers, are affected,” she said Thursday. The aggressive ICE workplace raids in Southern California, as well as its courthouse arrests, inspired a wave of protests in Los Angeles and around the country. The Times reported that senior ICE official Tatum King sent an email to the ICE department that carries out work site operations: “Effective today, please hold on all work site enforcement investigations/operations on agriculture (including aquaculture and meat packing plants), restaurants and operating hotels,” he wrote. He added that they should continue to investigate “human trafficking, money laundering, drug smuggling” involving those industries, but not to arrest undocumented people who they do not believe have committed a crime. ICE's aggressive workplace raids this month came after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller reportedly scolded agency officials, insisting they arrest more immigrants. Nelly, Ashanti Trailer Offers a Look at the Newlywed Couple Navigating Parenthood and Their Careers According to The Wall Street Journal, Miller demanded that ICE stop trying to target violent criminals or gang members and instead “just go out there and arrest illegal aliens” at places like Home Depot or 7-Eleven. On Wednesday, Trump's border czar Tom Homan told Semafor, “Worksite enforcement operations are going to massively expand.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Thursday (June 12), 43-year-old Bo, the former guitarist for NEEDTOBREATHE, shared a statement on social media alleging that he was sexually abused by multiple people during his childhood, including his older brother Bear, 44, the rock band's lead singer. I believe in God's grace, and I believe that his mercy has shown that he is consistent, even though we don't deserve it,” Bo wrote on Instagram. I've been sexually, physically and emotionally abused by my brother. Bonnaroo 2025 Canceled Due to Severe Weather: 'We Are Beyond Gutted' He continued, “I believe that God has bigger plans for me and part of those plans are telling my story because it's so hard for anyone to tell stories like these. If you're out there and you're thinking, nothing can be done, no one can help, there's no way out… I'm with you… but I believe in a God who always finds a way. Bo, who left NEEDTOBREATHE in 2020, later shared a photo of Bear with the caption “Sexual Abuser” in a since-deleted Instagram Story, according to Relevant Magazine. On Saturday (June 14), Bear responded to his brother's allegations with a lengthy post on the Instagram account for Wilder Woods, his solo musical project outside of NEEDTOBREATHE. Since his departure from the band over five years ago, we have done everything in our power to treat him with respect and privacy. I would never choose to disparage him, especially at a time where he is clearly in pain. But as a father and husband, I must protect my family from claims that misrepresent the truth.” I have three young boys, and I wanted them to hear about my story from me directly, when the time is right and not through social media or online speculation. Bo's post has now made it impossible for me to remain private about this period of our childhood any longer. I can only hope that God has a plan for this down the road. I have always respected Bo's right to speak about his own story, but I cannot allow him to misrepresent mine.” Bear went on to claim that “my brother and I were both sexually abused at the age of 8 and 6 by a teenage counselor” at a Christian camp where they grew up in South Carolina. “While going through a two day intensive counseling session with Bo five years ago, I learned that he was hurt by things that happened in our early teen years as well. We processed those moments of shared trauma in detail and left with an understanding that we were two young boys trying to cope with the unimaginable. To now label me an abuser in such a heartless way is not only deeply painful, but is also wildly misleading and feels intentionally harmful.” Bear concluded his message by expressing hope that he and Bo can reconcile someday. “I truly do pray for this healing,” he wrote. Billboard has reached out to NEEDTOBREATHE's representatives for further comment. In a 2023 interview with People, Bo opened up about coming to terms with his experience of sexual abuse as an adult, revealing that it was perpetrated by three different individuals. You'll start to see how your life's kind of breaking down.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Glen Powell is taking on what might be his most challenging performance yet in Chad Powers: playing an “extremely ugly” person. “There's no such thing as bad press.” Getting fitted for a wig and a prosthetic nose, Powell's leading jock proclaims, “If I can't play as Russ, I'll play as someone else.” The show also stars Perry Mattfeld, Quentin Plair, Wynn Everett, Frankie A. Rodriguez and Steve Zahn. Featuring a pilot co-written by Powell and Michael Waldron, Chad Powers is based on the sketch produced by NFL Films and Omaha Productions that aired on ESPN+ as part of the Eli's Places series. Powell also serves as EP under his production co-banner Barnstorm Productions, along with Eli Manning and Omaha Productions' Peyton Manning, Jamie Horowitz, Ben Brown and ESPN, as well as J. Waldron and Adam Fasullo for Anomaly Pictures. “He's, like, extremely ugly,” says one cheerleader to a mascot. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Law, has died. Fisher lived in the Laguna Beach area and died Tuesday, family member Mark Zev Hochberg wrote on Facebook. She worked alongside writing partner Steve Brown on the iconic CBS series for three seasons through 1985, and they returned for a pair of reunion telefilms in 1994 and '95. Beans Morocco, 'Used Cars' and 'Eating Raoul' Actor, Dies at 90 Fisher and Bochco also created the ABC dramedy Hooperman, starring John Ritter as a San Francisco police inspector. That 20th Century Fox Television series lasted two seasons (1987-89). L.A. Law, revolving around the fictional law firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, ran eight seasons from 1986-94 and collected 15 Emmys, including four for outstanding drama series. Along the way, it brought fame to actors Harry Hamlin, Richard Dysart, Corbin Bernsen, Blair Underwood, Michael Tucker, Jill Eikenberry, Alan Rachins, Jimmy Smits and several others in the ensemble. “I knew I wanted to have a writing partner who was a lawyer because I didn't feel I could grasp the practice of the essence of law on my own,” he noted in a 2002 discussion for the TV Academy Foundation website The Interviews. Bochco would fire her in November 1987 during L.A. Law‘s second season “because she behaved very badly,” he said. A month later, Fisher, who had been the show's supervising producer, sued Bochco and Fox for $50 million. “At this point, I've just become terribly philosophical about it,” she told the Los Angeles Times soon after the settlement. It's kind of like a divorce; you go through a bad period, then you want to remember the good things. There were conflicts that arose, and sometimes it's just better for everyone to move on.” After about a decade as a lawyer, which included stints with Fox and MGM, she decided to pursue writing for television. In January 1983, Fisher and Brown were hired as writer-producers to complete the remaining nine second-season episodes of Cagney & Lacey. Fisher went on to sign a three-year development deal with Walt Disney Productions. She executive produced a couple telefilms and created the CBS primetime soap opera 2000 Malibu Road, starring Drew Barrymore. However, that lasted just six episodes in the summer of 1992.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were shot and killed in their home in “what appears to be a politically motivated assassination,” Minnesota Gov. “Our state lost a great leader and I lost the dearest of friends… She is irreplaceable and will be missed by so many,” Walz said. Walz said that the same person shot Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette multiple times; they were injured and have undergone surgery. “The Hoffmans are out of surgery at this time and receiving care, and we are cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt,” Walz said. The shooter, who went to both lawmakers' homes in the suburbs north of Minneapolis, was impersonating a law enforcement officer, according to authorities. Brooklyn Police Chief Mark Bruley said at a press conference police found a manifesto that identified “many lawmakers and other officials” in the suspect's car. The list included Hortman and Hoffman, according to another official. “This was an act of targeted political violence,” Walz said. We don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint.” Walz, who was Democrats' 2024 vice presidential nominee, later added in a post on X that people should not attend political rallies in Minnesota until the suspect is caught. Protests have been scheduled across the country as part of “No Kings Day,” in response to the military holding a parade Saturday in Washington, D.C., on President Donald Trump's birthday. “This is somebody that clearly had been impersonating a police officer.” “They did drive a vehicle that looked exactly like an SUV squad car,” Bruley added. “It was equipped with lights, emergency lights, that looked exactly like a police vehicle, and yes, they were wearing a vest with taser, other equipment, a badge very similar to mine, that no question, if they were in this room, you would assume that they are a police officer.” The FBI is “fully engaged on the ground in Minnesota and is working in collaboration with our local and state partners,” according to FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. “I have been briefed on the terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota, which appears to be a targeted attack against State Lawmakers,” Trump said in a statement. Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America.

It was just… We all had to go through the grieving process and, at the same time, do that particular episode,” Lane recalled. And I think, when people watch the show, they'll see that,” he explained.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Updated Saturday AM: Universal‘s How to Train Your Dragon is still on course for a similar opening to what we spotted yesterday, now at $82.7M, but the real story with this live-action movie, as Nancy pointed out in the preview, is the overseas gross. Also, at $82.7M, that's the third best opening for a Marc Platt production behind Wicked ($112.5M) and The Little Mermaid ($95.5M). Meanwhile, A24's Dakota Johnson-Chris Evans-Pedro Pascal romcom, The Materialists, is posting the distributor's third highest opening ever at $12M, behind Civil War ($25.5M) and Hereditary ($13.5M). Sources consider this result another win for rom-coms after Ticket to Paradise‘s $16.5M and Anyone But You‘s $6M (remember, that opened before Christmas and legged out to a near 15x multiple to $88M+). CinemaScore is B-, and that's likely because moviegoers are arguing over who Johnson winds up with at the end of the film. Among rom-coms of late, Materialists in regards to CinemaScore ranks behind Ticket to Paradise (A-) and Anyone But You (B+). The good news is that we're up +33% over last weekend's $113M (per Comscore). Arguably, the market is not in a funk. PostTrak positive score is 94% with general audiences and 83% definite recommend with kids under 12 giving 95% and a 64% must see right away. A big turnout by women at 74%, 69% under 35. The female audience for this movie is largely watching it with their friends at 51% (meaning anywhere from one friend to five) versus making it a date night (21%). Women overall are recommending at 50%, which is alright, not stupendous. Materialists is playing best on the coasts with AMC Century City the top grossing venue stateside with north of $40K. A third of the audience came for Johnson per PostTrak while 43% came for either Pascal or Evans. With 57% buying their tickets same day, that's an indication of walk-up business.

As we always say, these are industry estimates, so they could fluctuate by the time Universal reports in the morning. The studio didn't return request for comment on what we were spotting. While early week projections were $65M-$75M, exhibition has been pushing this one in hopes they can wrangle a $100M opening. We could use more of those this summer post Memorial Day weekend. The audience score on Rotten Tomatoes for this Dean DeBlois directed movie (he did the original animated trilogy) is an epic 99% with critics at 77% certified fresh (that's a little higher than Lilo & Stitch‘s 72% fresh; that pic's audience score settling at 93%).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly three weeks after Jamal Roberts won season 23 of “American Idol,” the R&B singer continues to be asked by media and fans about widespread speculation that judge Carrie Underwood wasn't thrilled about his rise to the top. But at the BET Awards 45th anniversary dinner on June 11, 2025, 27-year-old Roberts admitted to online journalist Nate Vinson that he knows he likely wasn't her favorite — and that he's proud of her for staying true to her “roots.” Roberts laughed, clearly unsurprised by getting another question about the supposed controversy, as Vinson continued, “People that watched the show felt like, you know, she really wasn't supportive of you like other judges, other people were of you. But, you know, I feel like the better person won.” Roberts beat out 19-year-old country crooner John Foster and 27-year-old contemporary Christian artist Breanna Nix for the top spot. Roberts' clip with Vinson drew lots of reactions on X. Some defended Underwood, others said she should have been more supportive, and a few neutral observers encouraged everyone to calm down and drop the drama. Leave her be and let people actually express their opinions without (expletive) like this. Later, after one of his top five performances, she said, “I feel like you missed such an opportunity to move around and entertain,” adding that it was time to “pull out all the stops.” On May 30, a week after Roberts' victory, “The Morning Hustle” co-host Lore'l told Roberts that some viewers thought Underwood “kind of side-eyed you” after host Ryan Seacrest announced him as the winner. Roberts diplomatically replied, “Watching all the past performances, I see that she was clapping and getting on board, so I really don't know.” Right after the finale ended, Underwood told Extra, “I do like the way it was set up, there was no way America could've gotten it wrong. “But Jamal just has a gift from God,” she continued. Every time he opens his mouth, it's flawless … I got to tell him afterwards, ‘Now, go do great things!' After she returned home to her farm near Nashville, Underwood named a baby sheep after Roberts that was born on the same day of the finale. She has since called the lamb “Baby J” in subsequent Instagram Stories.</p>

Knightley and Pike played sisters Elizabeth and Jane Bennett, with their cinematic patriarch portrayed by the legendary Donald Sutherland. “I have to say, most actors have been a disappointment since then,” said Knightley, who was just 19 when she starred in the film. “We did have dinners with him sometimes, and he told us some pretty wild stories which cannot be shared.” Related Stories Keira Knightley Says ‘I Was Seen as a Terrible Actress' Until ‘Pride & Prejudice' Inside the Other Big Box Office Draw of the Weekend: The Swoon-Worthy Anniversary of ‘Pride & Prejudice' Sutherland, Knightley noted, was vehemently anti-smoking, a quality his castmates did note share. “There was the party that Donald Sutherland came to. He had it in his contract that nobody on the set was allowed to smoke anywhere near, and you couldn't smell of smoke,” she recalled. Sutherland died at 88 in 2024, leaving behind a filmography that included acclaimed performances in “Klute,” “Ordinary People,” and “The Hunger Games.” Helen Mirren, who worked with Sutherland in 2017's “The Leisure Seeker,” told IndieWire he was “one of the smartest actors I ever worked with.” “He combined this great intelligence with a deep sensitivity and with a seriousness about his profession as an actor. This all made him into the legend of film that he became.” At the Lumière Festival in 2019, Sutherland reflected on his decision to become an actor. “I come from a small town of 5,000 inhabitants. When I was 16 years old, my father brought me into his car — as was the tradition in Nova Scotia, where I'm from — and took me for a quick drive. He then stopped on the side of the road and asked what I wanted to do with my life. Neither of us had ever been to the theatre before.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bridgerton actress Genevieve Chenneour has described how she fought off a thief attempting to snatch her mobile phone in a central London cafe. The Daily Mail newspaper has published footage of the actress – who plays Miss Clara Livingston in the hit Netflix period drama – sitting with her dog in a cafe in West London, being approached by a man who picked up her phone from next to her on the counter. Unfortunately for him, he didn't have the information that, prior to her acting career taking off, Chenneour was a former Amateur Boxing Association qualified boxer and former professional athlete who had represented Team GB in international artistic swimming events. 'Bridgerton' Renewed For Seasons 5 & 6; Season 4 2026 Premiere Confirmed, Sneak Peek Released The footage of the incident – which took place in February – shows Chenneour realising what had happened and accosting her thief with several blows before she got her phone back. “I had a bit of a sixth sense that something wasn't quite right, as woman you have that kind of intuition. “I thought that was a normal reaction and I read all the comments [online] and realised, actually, a lot of people would just let them take the phone.' “It kind of went round the corner and it turned into a full-on scrap with two people [Boulares and his accomplice]. “And I was threatened with being stabbed so it became a real matter, in my mind, of life and death. “So, I did things like, I remember kicking him back with my leg to create space in case he had a weapon on him… It was just a life-changing, crazy moment.' The thief – who has been named as Zacariah Boulares – previously attacked TV host Aled Jones for his Rolex watch in 2023, and was given a youth detention, serving 14 months. Former Chief Superintendent Parm Sandu said: “Genevieve was very brave and I commend her for that but I would not recommend anybody, anybody fights back.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Late at night on June 13, 2025, TV and podcast host Billy Bush uploaded an Instagram video with his second update of the day about the wellbeing of his dear friend, “Doc” star and Hallmark actor Scott Wolf, and his estranged wife, Kelley Wolf, who announced the couple's impending divorce on June 10. Fans had been concerned since earlier in the day, when news broke that Kelley, 48, had been detained and handcuffed by police in Utah at the Sundance Resort, per People. Audio and a brief moment of video footage of the ordeal was posted on her Instagram Live, including a shocking moment in which Kelly accused Scott, 57, of “abusing” her. In an afternoon video update, Bush, who announced in May he was leaving his anchor job at “Extra,” called Wolf “one of my best friends” and said that after talking personally with Kelley, he could confirm there was no truth behind her earlier comment. Bush told fans, “Final message here before going to bed about Scott and Kelley Wolf: no Team Scott, no Team Kelley. Bush then said there had been some commenters on his previous post who were upset with him for defending his friend Scott without knowing the facts of what unfolded earlier in the day. Bush said, “There's a few commenters down below saying, ‘Shut up, Billy Bush, you have no idea what you're talking about. You don't know what happens behind closed doors. First of all, I know it — in my family.” Bush was referring to Kelley's June 10 statement about her and Scott's split, in which she praised her husband of 21 years for being “one of the best fathers I've ever known and one of the best partners a woman could have the privilege of sharing life with.” “Anyway, I have great love for both people,” Bush concluded. After more than two decades together, Kelley — who was a cast member on MTV's “The Real World” before meeting Scott — announced her impending divorce via a lengthy Instagram post on June 10, writing, “It is with a heavy heart that Scott and I are moving forward with the dissolution of our marriage.” Later that day, Scott released a statement to People that said, “After 21 years of marriage, I have made the most difficult decision of my life, and filed for divorce from my wife Kelley. Our children have always been, and continue to be, the loves of our lives and our every priority, so I kindly ask for privacy at this time as we help guide them through this new chapter.” Scott remained quiet on social media after that, but Kelley began posting photos and videos of herself and their daughter Lucy spending time at Sundance Resort in Utah, where the family lives. After things spiraled on June 13, People reported that police took Kelley to a local hospital after being called to the resort “for a report of a female that needed some help. Upon speaking with the female, our Deputies learned that she had made concerning comments to a family member, and she also made similar comments to our Deputies.” A spokesperson for the Utah Sheriff's Department told the outlet anyone transported in their patrol vehicles is typically “placed in properly-fitted hand restraints, just for their protection and our protection as law enforcement as well.” Once she was at the hospital, Kelley posted a photo from her room in her Stories and wrote, “This is horrible. She noted that she was “compliant, calm and respectful” and expressed hope that “this is all sorted very quickly.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Country star and “American Idol” alum Lauren Alaina is a first-time mom! The singer shared an emotional post on June 13, 2025, to reveal that she and her husband, Cam Arnold, had welcomed their baby girl — Beni Doll Arnold — on the morning of June 11. “The right words are hard to find to describe how parts of my heart that I didn't even knew existed were unlocked at 8:44 am when they laid you on my belly for the first time,” Alaina wrote, captioning a phot of the three of them at the hospital. “You, to your dad and me, are absolute perfection,” Alaina continued. “We are honored God chose us to be your parents. In addition to sharing emotional details about the timing of baby Beni's birth, Alaina shared a surprise with her fans in the post: a new song she wrote for her daughter that she decided to release in her honor. Baby Beni arrived more than a week past Alaina's due date. The country singer, who was runner-up to friend Scotty McCreery on season 10 of “American Idol,” shared many posts about how she was trying to trigger labor. But in the end, she said her little girl arrived right on time. “We learned she was coming in a time of deep sadness after the loss of my daddy,” wrote Alaina, whose dad died suddenly in July 2024. “I wasn't sure when I would share Heaven Sent but watching my own husband become a father the last couple of days has made me want to share it with you now,” Alaina shared in her post. A day that will forever be hard to me, but I now have a new and perfect reason to celebrate it. Beni truly is a gift from God that my old man sitting up there in Heaven Sent.” A lyric video for the song was released ahead of her baby announcement and fans noted how touched they were by the words, including one who wrote, “As someone who lost their daddy and had a baby girl 3 months ago, this song just wrecked me!!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Motown singer says his former housekeepers' strategy is to "let the lawsuit linger publicly" until he gives in to an extortionate $100 million settlement demand. Smokey Robinson claims in a new court filing that the former housekeepers suing him for rape are trying to slow-walk the lawsuit to gain maximum leverage for an extortionate settlement payout, including by dealing a financial blow to the Motown legend's ongoing tour. Lawyers for the 85-year-old singer made this argument in a Thursday (June 12) motion to require the deposition of one of the four anonymous former housekeepers who allege he forced them to have sex at his Los Angeles-area home dozens of times over nearly two decades. Robinson's attorney, Christopher Frost, says in the new court filing that the housekeepers are refusing to participate in evidence collection. He claims that the women's lawyer, John Harris, allegedly informed him that he wants to delay all discovery until they've litigated a motion to strike Robinson's counterclaims, a lengthy process that could take months. Frost claims the housekeepers, who he says demanded $100 million from Robinson and his wife Frances before suing them both in May, are doing so as a tactic to maximize settlement leverage. According to the motion, this strategy is aimed at cutting into profits from Robinson's ongoing international tour celebrating the 50th anniversary of his album A Quiet Storm. “Plaintiffs have effectively conceded that their intention was to file a salacious lawsuit, do nothing to prosecute it, neuter the Robinsons' ability to defend themselves, and let the lawsuit linger publicly while the Robinsons have to live every day under the unfair specter of public opinion and while Mr. Robinson's tour is negatively affected,” Frost writes. Frost is asking for a court order requiring one of the four housekeepers, identified in court filings as “Jane Doe 2,” to sit for a deposition at his Los Angeles law office within two weeks of the motion being heard. “If plaintiffs and cross-defendants are not sanctioned for their abusive behavior, they will expect that they can continue this behavior during the pendency of this case, which will only create more delays and more motion practice,” writes Frost. “By singling out Jane Doe 2 for a compelled deposition at this early stage, the defendant is engaging in a broader strategy of harassment and coercion — an attempt to retraumatize a survivor of sexual violence under the guise of lawful process,” said attorneys John Harris and Herbert Hayden. It should be recognized for what it is: a transparent attempt to chill participation in this case and deter other survivors from coming forward. We remain steadfast in defending her rights and will hold the Robinsons accountable for any effort to subvert those rights through abusive and vexatious litigation tactics.” ET to add a statement from the plaintiffs' lawyers.

Back with their sixth EP, Desire : Unleash, the seven-member boy group under Hybe's Belift Lab made their Coachella debut in April and are preparing to head out on a world tour across North America and Europe. Enhypen — comprised of members Jungwon, Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo and Ni-ki — were formed through the music survival show I-Land. The show, a joint venture between Hybe and Korean entertainment giant CJ ENM, aired on the CJ ENM-owned channel Mnet in South Korea. Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival Canceled Due to Weather Kanye "Ye" West Makes Brief Appearance at Sean "Diddy" Combs Trial The otherworldly music video starts with a chilling voiceover: “Did you really think I could just stand by and watch you disappear?” Enhypen's lore — the storyline that has unraveled throughout their career — leans supernatural, specifically vampiric, in nature, and “Bad Desire” continues that through-line. Below, Enhypen shares the inspiration behind the album, what their Coachella experience was like and what they're planning for their upcoming world tour. To elaborate a little bit on our lead single (“Bad Desire”), there can be various forms of desire, right? I think one of them could be how you want to be equal to the person that you're in love with. This song revolves around the concept of that and the struggles and internal conflicts that comes with love. Does anyone have a favorite song on the album? With the weather getting very hot, I think it's a good song to listen to when you're feeling a bit too hot. It's a very nice, light and breezy song. Can you tell me a bit more about the song? I feel like it's a very hip hop style song. We've done hip hop style songs before, but I think this one is very unique and it's even more deep. Jay, what was it like getting to produce and play guitar on “Helium?” JAY This was an opportunity that I have been training for ever since our debut, so I'm really grateful for it. I'm very happy and proud of the results. What was the experience of performing at Coachella like? JAY We prepared very hard for the performance. There were some weather issues, but I believe just every moment of it was a great experience and it enabled us to grow further as artists. At a big festival like that, there can be technical difficulties or extreme weather conditions that you can't control. Other than that, being up on stage, I feel like we all felt something different because Coachella itself is a very well-known stage that a lot of artists dream about playing, and it really was more than expected. We actually got to watch Post Malone's set the day after our performance. Is there a song in particular you're excited to perform this time around? NI-KI We prepared a lot of rearrangements for this tour. The set list features a lot of rearranged songs. I'm particularly excited for “Pass the Mic” [“Future Perfect (Pass the Mic)”] because during other shows fans loved it. We had a great time performing it at Coachella as well. SUNGHOON We definitely believe this album is coming at a very important time. Of course, every single new album or new release is important to us, but this one in particular comes at a very important point in time. That's why it holds a very special place in our heart, and I believe this will mark a milestone in our career where the before and after are very different. I believe there has to be a difference as we go forward. Your trajectory as a group is really interesting. We don't consider ourselves 100 percent perfect even now. Back then, likewise, we weren't fully perfected as a new group. On the bright side, I think that gave us a great opportunity to share this growth journey with our fans. They were with us every step of the way. In the past, we used to have some what ifs about our debut. We just want to continue on communicating and connecting with our fans and sharing this growth journey with them as we go forward. I just hope that this beautiful relationship will last further into the future.
