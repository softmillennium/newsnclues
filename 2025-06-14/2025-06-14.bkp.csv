            Israel's unprecedented attacks on Iran had at their core an elusive and high-risk goal: eradicating the country's controversial nuclear program.
    


            Israel targeted three key Iranian nuclear facilities – Natanz, Isfahan and Fordow – and a number of top scientists involved in nuclear research and development.
    


            The extent of the damage – and whether Iran's nuclear program can survive – is not immediately clear. An Israeli military official said at a briefing Saturday that strikes on Iran's nuclear sites in Natanz and Isfahan were able to damage the sites “significantly;” Iran said that damage to the facilities was limited but acknowledged the deaths of nine experts.
    


            “We are at a key point where, if we miss it, we will have no way to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons that will threaten our existence,” Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Friday.
    


            “We have dealt with Iran's proxies over the past year and a half, but now we are dealing with the head of the snake itself.”
    


            Iran insists its program is peaceful - here's what we know about the damage to the three sites.
    


            Initial assessments indicate that Israel's strikes on Iran's Natanz nuclear facility were extremely effective, going far beyond superficial damage to exterior structures and knocking out the electricity on the lower levels where the centrifuges used to enrich uranium are stored, two US officials told CNN.
    


            “This was a full-spectrum blitz,” said another source familiar with the assessments.
    


            The strikes destroyed the above-ground part of Natanz's Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant, a sprawling site that has been operating since 2003 and where Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Weapons-grade uranium is enriched to 90%.
    


            CNN obtained radar imagery from a space imaging company, Umbra, which captured damage to several areas of the Natanz facility. Other satellite imagery reviewed by CNN showed the same damage more clearly, with black plumes of smoke visibly rising from multiple locations across the site.
    


            Electrical infrastructure at Natanz – including the main power supply building, plus emergency and back-up generators – was also destroyed, the IAEA said. That assessment is supported by the two US officials, who told CNN that electricity was knocked out on the lower levels where the centrifuges used to enrich uranium are stored.
    


            That aspect of the operation is crucial, because much of the Natanz facility is heavily fortified and underground, so wiping out the power to those parts of the facility is the most effective way to impact underground equipment and machinery.
    


            It does not appear that Israel damaged those underground parts of the plant directly, the IAEA said, but the loss of power to the underground cascade hall “may have damaged the centrifuges there.”
    


            Natanz has six above-ground buildings and three underground buildings, two of which can hold 50,000 centrifuges, according to the non-profit Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI). Centrifuges are machines that can enrich uranium by spinning the gas at high speeds.
    


            There is no wider radiological impact. “The level of radioactivity outside the Natanz site has remained unchanged and at normal levels,” the IAEA said. “However, due to the impacts, there is radiological and chemical contamination inside the facilities in Natanz,” it added – though the levels would be manageable.
    


            The extent of damage at the Isfahan nuclear site in central Iran was more difficult to parse in the hours after it was struck, with conflicting claims over the attack's impact emerging in Israel and Iran.
    


            Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesperson of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said Saturday that damage at the site – Iran's largest nuclear research complex – was limited.
    


            Equipment at the two facilities was moved in anticipation of the strikes, Kamalvandi said. A shed at the facility caught fire, he added, and there is no risk of contamination.
    


            But Israel were more bullish; an IDF official said during a Saturday briefing that the site took significant damage.
    


            The facility was built with support from China and opened in 1984, the NTI says. According to the non-profit, 3,000 scientists are employed at Isfahan, and the site is “suspected of being the center” of Iran's nuclear program.
    


            It “operates three small Chinese-supplied research reactors,” as well as a “conversion facility, a fuel production plant, a zirconium cladding plant, and other facilities and laboratories,” the NTI says.
    


            At a Saturday briefing, an IDF official said Israel had “concrete intelligence” that Iran was “moving forward to a nuclear bomb” at the Isfahan facility. Despite advancing its uranium enrichment significantly, Iran has repeatedly said that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and denied that it was developing an atomic bomb.
    


            The Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant is a far more difficult site to target. The plant is buried deep in the mountains near Qom, in northern Iran, and houses advanced centrifuges used to enrich uranium up to high grades of purity.
    


            Israel targeted the site during its Friday attacks, but the IAEA said it was not impacted and the IDF has not claimed any significant damage there. Iranian air defenses shot down an Israeli drone in the vicinity of the plant, Iranian state media Press TV reported Friday evening.
    


            Fordow's fate could be pivotal to the overall success of Israel's attacks.
    


            In 2023, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that uranium particles enriched to 83.7% purity – which is close to the 90% enrichment levels needed to make a nuclear bomb – had been found in Fordow.



            “If Fordow remains operational, Israel's attacks may barely slow Iran's path to the bomb,” James M. Acton, the co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on Friday.
    


            Acton said Israel might be able to collapse the entrance to the facility, but noted that destroying much more of the Fordow site will be a difficult task for Israel.

            • Barrage of strikes: Iran launched a new wave of missiles toward Israel early Saturday, capping off a night of attacks between the two sides that unleashed multiple explosions and destruction in Tel Aviv and Tehran.
    


            • Failed talks: The next round of US-Iran nuclear negotiations, due to take place in Oman this weekend, has been canceled, Oman's foreign minister has said. His Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, earlier said such talks were “unjustifiable” while Israel's attacks continued.
    


            • Casualties on both sides: Three people have been killed in Israel and dozens injured by Iranian strikes, Israeli authorities said. Iran reported at least 78 people killed in Israeli strikes and 320 wounded, mostly civilians.
    


            • More to come: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned in a video address Saturday that Israel will “strike every target” of Iran's regime, with the goal of eliminating Tehran's threat. Earlier, Israel's defense minister said that people in Tehran will “pay a heavy price” and the Iranian capital “will burn” if Iran continues with its missile attacks.
    


            Flames have erupted at Iran's South Pars gas field – the world's largest natural gas field – according to reports in Iranian state media.
    


            Video footage circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN shows a large blaze and plumes of smoke rising from the gas field in Iran's southern Bushehr province.
    


            The oil field was hit by an Israeli drone strike, according to the Iranian state media reports.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanuahu has warned the people of Iran that more strikes are on the way as tensions between the long-running foes continue to escalate.
    


            Meanwhile, hospitals across Israel are scrambling to move their patients to underground wards in anticipation for any further retaliatory strikes from Tehran.
    


            The warring sides exchanged missile strikes overnight after Israel launched an unprecedented attack on Iranian nuclear and military targets Friday, which killed some of the country's most senior military leaders.
    


Below are the latest developments: 



            Israel will “strike every target” of Iran's regime, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video address on Saturday, as tensions between the long-standing foes continue to flare.
    


            Netanyahu said that in the “very near future, you will see Israeli planes, the Israeli Air Force, our brave pilots, above the skies of Tehran.”
    


                    “We will strike every site and every target of the Ayatollah's regime,” he warned.
                





            The Israeli leader said his country's goal was to eliminate Iran's “dual threat” to Israel, referring to both Tehran's nuclear capabilities and ballistic missile arsenal.
    


            He added that Israel had already “caused a very severe blow” to Iran's main nuclear facility. “We hit the uranium enrichment facility which is vital for the production of bombs. We also hit the leading team of scientists who lead these projects. And this will definitely set them back, and it's possible that it will set them back for many years,” he said.
    


            It comes after Netanyahu late on Friday gave a direct address to the people of Iran, urging them to “stand up and let your voices be heard,” as he cautioned that more attacks were on the way.
    


            Israeli forces are now operating freely in Tehran's airspace, after eliminating many of Iran's air defense systems, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official has said.
    


                    “We've established aerial freedom of action from western Iran to Tehran,” IDF spokesperson Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said in a briefing on Saturday.
                





            “Our Air Force pilots flew for about two and a half hours over Tehran, alongside UAVs that remain airborne 24/7, surveilling the area and concluding with attacks and intelligence gathering,” the spokesperson added.
    


            That aerial superiority enabled Israel to launch surprise attacks on Iran, and to “act and thwart threats to Israel,” Defrin said.
    


            The official also said more than 70 Israeli jet fighters struck 40 targets in and around the Iranian capital overnight.
    


            “This is the first time we've operated in this airspace,” Defrin said, adding that it is the deepest penetration into Iran to date.
    


            “Dozens of these aircraft now operate freely over Tehran, thanks to our opening strikes, which eliminated many Iranian air defense threats,” he added.
    


            The next round of US-Iran nuclear negotiations, scheduled to take place in Oman on Sunday, has been canceled, Oman's foreign minister has said.
    


            “The Iran US talks scheduled to be held in Muscat this Sunday will not now take place,” Badr Albusaidi wrote on X. “But diplomacy and dialogue remain the only pathway to lasting peace.”
    


            The discussions would have been the sixth in the process, which Oman has been mediating but which were thrown into turmoil by Israel's attacks on Iranian nuclear sites.
    


            Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi earlier said such talks were “unjustifiable” while Israel's attacks continued, but stopped short of saying they were off.
    


            In a rare direct address to the people of Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday urged its citizens to “stand up and let your voices be heard,” after Israel unleashed deadly strikes on its regional foe.
    


            “The time has come for the Iranian people to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from an evil and oppressive regime,” Netanyahu said in a statement. For locals in Iran, the Israeli leader's call fell on deaf ears.
    


            Many of those CNN spoke to did not want to be quoted, even anonymously, but none expressed any support for Netanyahu's calls for a revolt.
    


            “Israel is underestimating our love for our country, the idea that bombing us, our homes, killing our children would send us to the streets is shocking. We want to live peacefully whether we like the regime or not,” a 36-year-old man who wished to remain anonymous told CNN.
    


            Iranians who spoke to CNN expressed palpable anger and asserted they would never cede to Netanyahu's demands.
    


            “Do I wish the regime wasn't in power? Absolutely. Do I want my city bombed by another dictator? Absolutely not,” Neda, a 28-year-old, said.
    


            “Don't let the fake news fool you, the reality of what is happening in Iran as an Iranian who has actually lived in Iran, who has their family in Iran, Israel is in no way helping our people. I don't need fake news and propaganda speeches,” she added.
    


            The Iranian regime remains unpopular at home, where security forces continue to brutally crackdown on dissidents.
    


            Alongside anger, the presiding emotion among Tehran locals was one of intense fear, with rumors spreading that Israeli strikes may intensify in the capital on Saturday night.
    


            “We're hearing that tonight Israel will be hitting more densely populated parts of Tehran in retaliation for the strike that hit Tel Aviv, which is really terrifying,” said a 24-year-old woman, who CNN is also not naming for safety reasons.
    


            “Last night was worse than what had happened before. The entire house was shaking, and they kept dropping bombs that sounded super close,” she added.
    


            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Saturday the United States was not caught off guard by Israel's unprecedented wave of strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities and top military leaders this week, or by the recent escalation between the two nations.
    


            “I wouldn't say we were really surprised by any dynamic of the back and forth. That's been ongoing, but we're monitoring it closely,” Hegseth said.
    


            Hegseth said the US is well prepared to defend its personnel and interests in the region.
    


            “We are robustly postured to ensure that our people – our bases, our interests –  are safe and we're continuing to monitor any, any forces we would need to do that, capabilities we would need to do that, we will, we will keep Americans safe,” Hegseth said. “The US is postured to defend our people in the region. We've got significant assets in the region.”
    


            Hegseth mirrored President Trump, who has emphasized a preference for negotiations but warned of the consequences of continued aggression, during a Fox News appearance on Saturday. The Defense Secretary said there is still a window for peace despite the heightened tensions.
    


            “The president continues to message that he prefers peace. He prefers a solution to this that is resolved at the table,” Hegseth said. “Iran still has an option for that, but Israel took what it believed it needed to do in self-defense strikes, and based on that first day, they were quite effective.”
    


            President Trump urged Iran to “make a deal, before there is nothing left” after Israel launched roughly 200 strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, senior military leaders and research scientists. It was the opening attack in what Israeli officials have said is part of a major operation against Iran.
    


            In response, Iran fired a barrage of missiles into Israel early Saturday, culminating in a night of widespread explosions and destruction in both Tel Aviv and Tehran.
    


            Israelis were not expecting the fear and anxiety they experienced Friday into Saturday, with several waves of Iranian missile attacks setting off air raid sirens across the country and causing extensive damage at several locations. Three people were killed.
    


            “We heard multiple explosions. Some we could tell were very close and our safe room door would shake,” Julie Levi said, describing the night as “one of the most distressing” she has experienced.
    


            Levi, a resident of Ramat Gan, was near the impact site of a missile that killed a 60-year-old woman Friday evening.
    


            After spending the night constantly running for shelter with his wife and four children and hearing loud frightening explosions, Aviad Caspi said he was shocked by the damage caused by the missiles.
    


            Caspi lives in the small community of Bitzaron near Ashdod, which is about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the Israeli border with Gaza.
    


            When he saw images of the aftermath of a missile impact in Rishon Lezion Saturday morning, he understood it was “on a different scale” than the Hamas rocket attacks Israelis have become accustomed to.
    


            “It was a very tough night,” he added.
    


            Medics have been relocating patients underground at a medical center on the outskirts of the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, as it braces for any further retaliatory Iranian strikes.
    


            Patients at the Sheba Medical Facility in the Tel Aviv area were seen in video footage being transported to fortified underground facilities. Other footage showed staff transferring equipment and other crucial medical gear.
    


            The facility said it treated dozens of patients injured in the Iranian strikes, with many suffering shrapnel wounds.
    


            Hospitals across the country have been scrambling to move their patients to secure, underground areas to protect them from potential strikes.
    


            Tehran launched a wave of retaliatory strikes overnight after Israel's unprecedented attack on Iranian nuclear and military targets Friday, which killed some of the country's most senior military leaders.
    


            Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi has said negotiations with the United States are “unjustifiable” amid Israeli strikes on Iranian cities, but did not confirm that Iranian officials would no longer be attending the nuclear talks scheduled for this weekend between the US and Iran in Oman.
    


                    “Citing the messages and statements of the US president, Araghchi considered the hostile actions of the Zionist regime to be the result of direct support from Washington and emphasized that the continuation of indirect negotiations between Iran and the US in a situation where the savagery of the Zionist regime continues is unjustifiable,” an Iranian foreign ministry statement said, in reference to a phone call between Araghchi and European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.
                





            Israel used hundreds of munitions to strike 150 targets in Iran overnight, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official said Saturday, claiming that the Israeli attacks have set back the Iranian nuclear program.
    


            The Israeli military launched an operation against Iran's top brass, military sites and nuclear scientists Friday, in one of the largest military escalations in the Middle East over recent decades. Iran said dozens were killed in the attack.
    


            Tehran responded by firing four barrages of ballistic missiles toward Israel, killing three people and wounding dozens, the IDF official said at a briefing.
    


            The official said that the strikes on Iran's nuclear sites in Natanz and Isfahan were able to damage the sites “significantly.” Iran previously said that damage to the facilities was limited.
    


            “I've heard some experts or people speaking on the news saying, all we can do is push back a few weeks on the nuclear plan. I want to tell you that again, according to our initial understanding… it will take much more than a few weeks to repair,” the official said.
    


            According to the official, Israel had “concrete intelligence” that Iran was “moving forward to a nuclear bomb” at the Isfahan facility. Despite advancing its uranium enrichment significantly, Iran has repeatedly said that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and denied that it was developing an atomic bomb.
    


            Israel now considers the “aerial road to Tehran” as “effectively open” after its military operation, the official said. “We couldn't have said that months ago,” they added.
    


            On the nine Iranian nuclear scientists killed by Israel on Friday, the official said that they were the “main sources of knowledge” and “main forces… advancing the nuclear program.”
    


            Before Israel launched an unprecedented wave of strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities and top military leaders this week, its spies were already on the ground in enemy territory.
    


            Israeli intelligence agency Mossad had smuggled weapons into Iran ahead of the strikes, according to Israeli security officials, and would use the weapons to target Iran's defense from within.
    


            The officials said Israel established a base for launching explosive drones inside Iran, and the drones were later used to target missile launchers near Tehran. Precision weapons were also smuggled in and used to target surface-to-air missile systems, clearing the way for Israel's Air Force to carry out more than 100 strikes with upward of 200 aircraft in the early hours of Friday local time.
    


            The plan to disable Iranian defenses seems to have been effective; Israel said all of its aircraft returned safely from the first waves of strikes, appearing to show Israeli air superiority over parts of a country hundreds of miles away.
    


            Intelligence gathered by the Mossad in Iran also gave Israel's air force the ability to target senior Iranian commanders and scientists.
    


            In an incredibly rare move, the Mossad released video from some of its operations, showing drones attacking what appear to be unsuspecting missile launchers.

            Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine nuclear weapons. Tehran has repeatedly insisted it isn't building a bomb.
    


            So how accurate is the Israeli leader's claim?
    


            It's unclear how close Iran might be to actually building a nuclear bomb, but it has made significant progress in producing its key ingredient: highly enriched uranium.
    


            In a report sent to member states May 31, the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, had said that Iran possessed a quantity of uranium enriched to 60% purity – not yet weapons-grade, but sufficient to eventually make nine nuclear weapons if further enriched to 90%.
    


                    “Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be a year. It could be within a few months,” Netanyahu said on Friday when announcing the audacious “Rising Lion” operation. “This is a clear and present danger to Israel's survival,” he added.
                





            Iran has significantly ramped up its uranium enrichment program since Donald Trump withdrew from a nuclear agreement in 2018. It started with about 150kg of uranium enriched to 3.6% – which is sufficient for nuclear reactors and a peaceful nuclear program – and now has 50 times its 2018 level.
    


            In 2023, the IAEA said uranium particles enriched to 83.7% purity – close to bomb-grade levels – were found at an Iranian nuclear facility. Its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% had also grown to 128.3 kilograms, the highest level then documented.
    


            The IAEA has long accused Iran of violating its non-proliferation obligations, but on Thursday – for the first time in almost 20 years – its board passed a resolution officially declaring Iran in breach of those obligations. Iran promised to respond by escalating its nuclear activities.
    


            President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum this spring to Iran's Supreme Leader: Strike a nuclear deal in 60 days, by mid-June, or face consequences. He urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off on attacking Iran to give the negotiations space to progress.
    


            But even as Trump administration figures were publicly projecting determination to pursue a diplomatic solution, Israel was privately warning the US that it had already decided to attack.
    


            Late last month, a small group of House lawmakers visited Netanyahu in Jerusalem, where he stated firmly that Israel was going to strike Iran – and they were not seeking permission from the US to do so, according to a person who attended the meeting and another person briefed on it.
    


            “We fight or we die,” Netanyahu told the lawmakers, according to the people.
    


            In response, two of the lawmakers in attendance May 26, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas and Rep. Michael Lawler of New York, urged Israel to coordinate with the US and stressed that the country must let Trump's 60-day ultimatum for Iran run its course.
    


            On Friday, day 61, Israel launched unprecedented strikes on Iran, targeting its nuclear program and military leaders.
    


Read our full story on what went into the planning of Israel's attack on Iran here.



            Iran and Israel exchanged waves of deadly missile strikes overnight as the long-running conflict between the two foes ratcheted further and showed no immediate signs of de-escalating.
    


            Iran launched retaliatory strikes after Israel's unprecedented attack on Iranian nuclear and military targets Friday, which killed some of the country's most senior military leaders.
    


            On Saturday, Israeli defense minister Israel Katz warned that “Tehran will burn” if Iranian strikes persist. Previously, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cautioned “more is on the way,” as both sides report casualties.
    


Below are the latest developments: 



            Tehran residents have expressed anger and indignation after Israel launched deadly strikes on the Iranian capital.
    


            “Israel killed our commanders and what (do) they expect in return? A kiss?” Mahmoud Dorri, a 29-year-old taxi driver told the Associated Press. “We will go after them to punish them: an eye for an eye.”
    


            Another resident, a 31-year-old teacher, voiced her support for her country for standing up to the Israeli government, particularly after its prolonged assault on Gaza.
    


            “Someone should stop (the) Israelis. They think they can do anything they want at any time,” Pari Pourghazi said to AP. “Iran showed Israelis are wrong, though they could suppress people of (the) Gaza or Lebanon by heavy bombing.”
    


            Others called for restraint in the wake of the Israeli strikes. “I support my country. The Israelis made (a) mistake in launching attacks on Iran, but I hope this comes to (an) end,” 61-year-old Auto mechanic Houshang Ebadi, said. “War will not bear fruit for any side.”
    


            Israel killed nine scientists and experts involved in Iran's nuclear program during its strikes on the country, its military said Saturday, raising the figure from a previous toll of six.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Ali Bakhouei Karimi, Mansour Asgari, and Saeed Barji — experts in mechanics, physics and materials engineers respectively — were killed by strikes on Friday.
    


            Their deaths were confirmed by Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency.
    


            Israel had previously said it killed six experts involved with the nuclear program, along with three key military leaders.
    


            Iran Taekwondo Federation said three of its members were killed in Israeli attacks on Tehran.
    


            Among those killed were Amir Ali Amini, a taekwondo fighter on the Iran Junior Taekwondo team, Mir Ali Amini, a teenage member of the federation, and Hojatoleslam Ahmadpour, the federation's imam.
    


            Several Iranian outlets reported their deaths as details continue to emerge about the number of casualties from Israel's attacks on Iran.
    


            Israel targeted the provinces of East Azerbaijan, Lorestan and Kermanshah on Saturday in a new round of strikes on Iran, the state-affiliated Fars news agency said.
    


            Four areas were hit in East Azerbaijan, northwest Iran. Explosions were heard in Khorramabad, Lorestan province and Kermanshah, in western Iran, Fars reported.
    


            A video published on the news agency showed smoke rising in Tabriz, in East Azerbaijan province. The  Tabriz Oil Refining Company denied that it was struck after media reports claimed that strikes were nearby.
    


            In the Asadabad county in western Iran, two people were killed and five were injured in Israeli strikes, state-affiliated ISNA said.
    


            Iran's air defenses were activated in Khorramabad, Kermanshah and Tabriz, according to Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency.
    


            Iranian authorities have yet to publicly announce where the strikes occurred.
    


            Iran's nuclear facilities in Fordow and Isfahan were not extensively damaged in an attack by Israel on Friday, the spokesperson of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said.
    


            Equipment at the two facilities was moved in anticipation of the strikes, Behrouz Kamalvandi said.
    


            A shed at the Isfahan facility caught fire, Kamalvandi said, without clarifying the extent of damage to the Fordow site.
    


            There is no risk of contamination, he added.
    


            The Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant is buried deep in the mountains near Qom in northern Iran and houses advanced centrifuges used to enrich uranium up to high grades of purity.
    


            On Friday, Kamalvandi played down the extent of damage inflicted on Iran's primary nuclear enrichment plant in Natanz, saying the facility “did not encounter serious damage.”
    


            The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog however said during a UN Security Council meeting on Friday that the above-ground area of the facility was destroyed.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out airstrikes on Iran on Friday, to which Tehran responded with a barrage of drones and missiles. West Jerusalem said it aimed to prevent the Islamic Republic from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Tehran condemned the attacks as “blatant aggression” and vowed a “crushing” response.

The airstrikes occurred just days before the sixth round of nuclear talks between the US and Iran were slated to take place on Sunday in Oman.

IDF bombs nuclear and military sites

Early Friday morning, around 200 Israeli fighter jets struck targets across Iran, including a uranium enrichment facility in Natanz. Strikes were also reported at nuclear sites in Fordo and Isfahan, as well as military airfields near the cities of Hamadan and Tabriz.

Almost 80 people were killed and over 320 injured in the attacks, according to the Iranian ambassador to the UN. Tehran confirmed the deaths of top military leaders, including Major General Hossein Salami, the commander of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, and Brigadier General Amir-Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of the IRGC's Aerospace Division. Several veteran nuclear scientists were also killed. Iran said only “superficial damage” was done to the Natanz site.

Netanyahu defends ‘preemptive' strikes

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes, dubbed Operation Rising Lion, aimed to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. “We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear weaponization program,” he said in a statement following the air raids.

IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said the situation had “reached the point of no return” due to advancements in Iran's nuclear program. Tehran has repeatedly stated that its program pursues only peaceful goals and that it does not seek nuclear weapons.

Iran launches missiles at Tel Aviv

Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei condemned the strikes as unjustified and accused Israel of killing civilians. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the attacks “amount to a declaration of war.”

The Iranian Army launched more than 100 drones in retaliation hours after the strikes on its territory. It then launched ballistic missiles, some of which broke through Israeli defenses and landed in Tel Aviv. At least one person has been killed and more than 60 injured, according to Israeli media.

Israel also carried out additional strikes in Iran throughout the day.

Trump hails ‘excellent' Israeli operation

The US State Department denied American involvement in the Israeli strikes. However, President Donald Trump told Fox News he had been aware of the planned operation and praised its “excellent” outcome. He criticized Iran for failing to reach a deal on its nuclear program within his “60-day ultimatum.”

Russia calls for de-escalation

Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke over the phone with Netanyahu and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Friday afternoon. He condemned Israel's strikes as illegal under international law and expressed condolences for the deaths of civilians in Iran.

Putin said Russia would seek to “advance the de-escalation of the conflict,” according to the Kremlin. The tensions surrounding Iran's nuclear program must be resolved through diplomacy, he added.

Nuclear talks in jeopardy

Iran has suspended its participation in the Omani-mediated negotiations with the US, the sixth round of which was due to take place on Sunday. Trump previously accused Tehran of “slow-walking” the talks and insisted on the complete dismantlement of its nuclear program.

Tehran rejected Trump's demands as unacceptable, insisting it would continue nuclear research for civilian purposes.

Russia's envoy to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia, has condemned Israel's recent airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Speaking at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday, the diplomat said West Jerusalem was acting with impunity, backed by the West.

Israel launched the strikes on uranium enrichment sites in Iran on Friday and killed several senior commanders and scientists in targeted assassination operations, claiming the moves were preemptive steps to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Iran, which denies pursuing a military nuclear program, responded by launching multiple volleys of ballistic missiles at Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv.

Nebenzia said Israel had apparently intended to sabotage the indirect US-Iran nuclear talks which had been scheduled to resume Sunday. Tehran has declared that the strikes have effectively ended any diplomatic pathway.

“This is a completely unprovoked attack – whatever Israel may claim to the contrary – and it constitutes a gross violation of the UN Charter and international law,"" Nebenzia said. “Responsibility for all the consequences of these actions rests entirely with the Israeli leadership and those who condone them.”

He noted that Iran has the right to defend itself and pointed to Tehran's previous commitment to the 2015 UN-backed nuclear deal, which the US abandoned during President Donald Trump's first term. The Islamic Republic denied accusations of secretly violating the agreement at the time but has since ramped up uranium enrichment.

The US and its allies “have been doing everything possible to fuel the escalation, and, essentially, they incited it,” Nebenzia argued, adding that Western support had “spurred Israel to take radical steps.” He also raised alarms over the risk of radiation leaks from the targeted Iranian facilities and warned that “no military solution can be either legitimate or viable.”

Iran's UN envoy, Amir-Saeid Iravani, described Israel's attacks as “a chilling display of calculated aggression” that “amounted to a declaration of war.” He called for international action to disarm the Jewish state's undeclared nuclear arsenal, which West Jerusalem has neither confirmed nor denied.

Israeli envoy Danny Danon defended the airstrikes, saying his country was a “democracy under siege” which had acted to “prevent its destruction” by the Islamic Republic. He urged the council to reflect on the potential consequences had the Iranian missiles been equipped with nuclear warheads.

At least 60 people, including 20 children, have been killed in an Israeli strike on an apartment block in the Iranian capital Tehran, according to local broadcaster IRIB News.

The IDF hit multiple targets across Iran on Friday, including uranium enrichment sites, while also killing several senior military commanders and scientists in targeted assassinations. West Jerusalem described the attack as a preemptive measure aimed at stopping Tehran from acquiring a nuclear bomb.

Iran, which has repeatedly denied pursuing a military nuclear program, responded by launching multiple volleys of ballistic missiles at targets in Israel, killing at least three people and injuring over 150, according to the Jerusalem Post.

IRIB News reported on Saturday that a 14-story residential building in Tehran had been hit by an Israeli missile on Friday morning.

The strike took the lives of at least 60 residents of the apartment bloc, which partially collapsed as a result of the strike, have been killed, including 20 children as young as nine months old, the broadcaster said.

A total of 38 bodies had been recovered from the rubble so far and search operations are continuing, according to the broadcaster.

The IRIB News footage showed heavy machinery being used at the site to clear debris.

Iran's ambassador to the UN Amir Iravani told the Security Council that “78 people, including senior military officials, have been martyred and over 320 other injured” in the Israeli strikes on Friday.

It is not entirely clear if the fatalities mentioned in the IRIB News report were part of the figure announced by Iravani or if they were additional casualties.

Israel resumed its attacks on Iran on Saturday, with Fars news agency reporting explosions in the cities of Khorramabad and Kermanshah in western Iran as well as in the country's East Azerbaijan Province.

Parade – ostensibly to mark US army's 250th birthday – takes place as president turns 79 and comes amid large protests

Thousands of troops accompanied by dozens of tanks and aircraft will stream through the National Mall in Washington DC for a military parade billed as celebrating the US army's 250th birthday on Saturday – which also happens to be the day Donald Trump turns 79.

The president has long desired to hold a military parade in the capital, and is finally getting his wish months after returning to the White House for a second term, and days after ordering federalized California national guard and US marines to the streets of Los Angeles in response to protests against deportations.

Washington DC will briefly become the second American city to see soldiers in its streets, albeit for markedly different reasons.

The all-day event held in the shadow of the Washington Monument will begin with a fitness competition and official ceremony to mark the army's birthday with a cake. At 6.30pm ET, 6,700 soldiers accompanied by armored vehicles such as the M1A2 Abrams tanks are scheduled to march down Constitution Avenue Northwest past the White House, as Black Hawk, Chinook and Apache helicopters fly overhead. Trump will appear to preside over an enlistment and reenlistment ceremony and accept a flag from the Golden Knights Parachute Team, before fireworks will fill the sky.

“I think it's time for us to celebrate a little bit. You know, we've had a lot of victories,” Trump said earlier this week. He has denied any connection between the parade and his birthday, instead noting that it coincides with the Flag Day holiday.

While Washington DC is used to playing host to an array of events in and around the National Mall and White House, the parade has proven to be particularly disruptive to day-to-day life in the overwhelmingly Democratic city of more than 700,000.

Coming at a cost the army estimates to be between $25m and $45m, the parade's preparations have caused the closure of busy roads for up to four days, while flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National airport will halt for an unspecified time during the event.

City leaders have expressed concerns that the tanks and armored vehicles will damages roads not designed for their weight, and the army has said they will place metal plates on parts of the route, and outfit the equipment with rubber on their treads.

“President Trump's longstanding wish to waste millions of taxpayer dollars for a performative military parade in the style of authoritarian leaders is finally coming true on his birthday,” said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the federal district's Democratic non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives. She condemned the event's expected impact on the city's roads, as well as the decision to hold it after Trump's administration spent months firing federal workers or coaxing them to resign.

“Although this parade will feed President Trump's ego and perhaps his base, it will not serve any legitimate purpose,” Holmes Norton said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A global oceans summit on Friday wrapped up with world leaders taking major steps toward marine protection and vowing a showdown when nations meet to negotiate rules for deep-sea mining next month. 

However, as a cacophony of ship foghorns sounded the close of the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, a lack of funding pledges and the total omission of fossil fuels disappointed some observers. 

The summit was just the third — and largest yet — dedicated entirely to what the UN calls an “emergency” in the world's oceans.

More than 60 heads of state and government joined thousands of business leaders, scientists and environmental campaigners over five days in the southern city of Nice. 

There was unanimous praise for efforts to ratify the high seas treaty designed to protect marine life in the 60 percent of oceans that lie beyond national waters. 

About 19 countries formally ratified the pact at Nice, taking the overall tally to 50 — but 60 nations are needed to bring the treaty into force. 

France's oceans envoy, Olivier Poivre d'Arvor, said the numbers would be reached by September and the treaty should take effect by January next year. 

High Seas Alliance director Rebecca Hubbard welcomed the “incredible progress” but urged “all remaining nations to ratify without delay.” 

The summit sought collective action on oceans even as countries brace for tough talks over deep-sea mining next month and a plastic pollution treaty in August. 

More than 90 ministers called in Nice for the treaty to enshrine limits on plastic production — something fiercely opposed by oil-producing nations. 

The summit also rallied behind a defense of science and rules-based oversight of common resources — most notably the unknown depths of the oceans — in a direct rebuke of US President Donald Trump. 

Trump was not present in Nice and rarely mentioned by name, but his shadow loomed as leaders thundered against his unilateral push to mine the ocean floor for nickel and minerals. 

France and like-minded countries vowed to block any effort to permit deep-sea exploration at negotiations over a mining code at the International Seabed Authority next month, Poivre d'Arvor said. 

“Nobody knows what is there in the deep sea... You cannot launch recklessly down this path,” he said in a closing address. 

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged caution, warning against turning the deep sea into “the wild west.” 

Leaders “made it unmistakably clear: Deep-sea mining is one of the biggest threats facing our ocean, and the world is saying no,” Deep Sea Conservation Coalition campaign director Sofia Tsenikli said. 

However, for all the rhetoric, a global alliance opposed to deep-sea mining only attracted four new members at Nice, rising to 37 nations. 

Greece, Samoa and Colombia were among 14 nations who unveiled plans for vast new marine protected areas, taking the share of the world's oceans under conservation to more than 10 percent. 

Some also announced restrictions on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method captured in grisly detail in a new David Attenborough documentary. 

Activists had pushed for a total ban on this kind of trawling, which uses heavy weighted nets dragged across the ocean floor. 

Developing nations hoping their larger and wealthier counterparts would open the checkbook in Nice were disappointed. 

Small island nations in particular have long complained they lack the finances required to build seawalls against rising tides and protect their waters from illegal fishers. 

While private donors pledged around 8.7 billion euros (US$10.05 billion) over the next five years, the UN says US$175 billion a year is needed for sustainable ocean development.

The scientist is accused of shipping biological material months ago to staff at a laboratory at the University of Michigan. The FBI, in a court filing, described it as material related to certain worms and requires a government permit.
“The guidelines for importing biological materials into the US for research purposes are stringent, but clear, and actions like this undermine the legitimate work of other visiting scholars,” said John Nowak, who leads field

Thunberg, 22, was put on a flight to France, the ministry said, adding that she would travel on to Sweden from there.
Three other people who had been aboard the charity vessel also agreed to immediate repatriation. Eight other crew members are contesting their deportation order, Israeli rights group Adalah, which advised them, said in a statement.
They are being held at a detention center ahead of a

Maintaining peace and stability across the Strait is not only Taiwan's responsibility, but also an important priority for democracies worldwide, a Taiwanese official told a forum in Prague. 

Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Ming-chi (陳明祺) on Friday attended an annual forum by GLOBSEC, a think tank based in Bratislava, and gave a speech on the panel titled: “Taiwan: The Global Imperative for Stability,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement yesterday. 

When asked how the Ukraine experience affected Taiwan's approach to national security, self-defense and survival, Chen used a quote often attributed to Mark Twain, saying that “history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme.”

“The lesson we learn is that paper is not enough,” he said, referring to the Budapest Memorandum signed in 1994 to guarantee Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and existing borders, and prevent use of force against the nation, and the US' Taiwan Relations Act passed in 1979. 

Taiwan's No. 1 priority is boosting its defense budget as President William Lai (賴清德) has already announced that the nation plans to spend at least 3 percent of GDP on defense, and it is also reviewing its defense capabilities, he said. 

“This is a call to all countries in the free world: If you want peace, you have to prepare for war,” he said. “To strengthen yourself and be able to seek peace through strength.”

Second, just as Ukraine is facing Russia, a much larger adversary, Taiwan is threatened by China, a larger nation, so Taipei should invest in asymmetric warfare, he said. 

Taiwan should cooperate with other countries in drone programs, he added. 

Third, Taiwan has learned from Ukraine and the Baltic countries that it is important to have a whole-of-society resilience program, ranging from energy resilience to reserve mobilization and civil defense, he said. 

The greatest lesson from Ukraine is that Western nations and their allies in Asia did not do enough to prevent the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and gave mixed signals to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Raimond Kaljulaid, a member of the Estonian parliament's National Defense Committee. 

“We should ask ourselves: Are we making the same mistake with Taiwan right now?” Kaljulaid said. 

During a conversation, Chen made some suggestions, such as “keep Taiwan on the agenda, not forgetting that it's an important international issue,” Kaljulaid said. 

Estonia should use every opportunity to express solidarity with Taiwanese, because “at the end of the day, it is about Taiwanese babies sleeping soundly, not having to go to kindergarten in a bomb shelter,” which is what China is threatening them with, he said. 

Regarding China's increasing push to limit Taiwan's international space, Chen said it is important that all democracies invest in the “pool of goodwill” and help each other. 

While China, Russia, Iran and North Korea are helping each other, democracies should stop thinking that it might be inconvenient for their relationship with Beijing if they support Taiwan's participation in international organizations, he said, adding that instead they should “let Taiwan be your partner.” 

Democracies should support Taiwan for its vibrant democracy and other merits, he said.  

They should call out China's interference in their countries' affairs, including limiting their right to build a relationship with Taiwan, as well as Beijing's misinterpretation of the UN Resolution 2758, which it might use as pretext for an invasion. 

The international community must act early, Chen said, adding that inclusion, cooperation and credible deterrence are key to preserving peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. 

Other speakers at the panel included Czech Senator Pavel Fischer, chairman of the Czech Senate's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defense and Security; Ukraine parliament member and Deputy Chairman of the Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence Yehor Cherniev, and former Ukrainian minister of defense Oleksii Reznikov.

The Liaoning aircraft carrier, two missile destroyers and one fast combat supply ship sailed about 300km southwest of Japan's easternmost island of Minamitori on Saturday, a ministry statement said.
It was the first time a Chinese aircraft carrier had entered that part of Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), a ministry spokesman said.

From Tuesday to Wednesday last week, more than 142 participants, largely comprised of parliamentarians from 29 countries, took part in the World Parliamentarians' Convention on Tibet (WPCT) in Tokyo. This was the ninth such convention, with the first one held in New Delhi in 1994.

The convention brings together lawmakers from democratic nations around the world to discuss Tibet and how they can best spotlight its dispute with China and eventually resolve it. 

The WPCT was cohosted by the Tibetan parliament in exile (the legislative wing of the Central Tibetan Administration) and the Japanese Parliamentary Support Group for Tibet. 

Twelve sessions took place, including the inaugural and the closing sessions. Penpa Tsering, sikyong of the Central Tibetan Administration, and other Tibetan delegations also took part in the deliberations. The participants all unanimously came out with three important resolutions: the Tokyo Declaration, the Resolution on Celebrating the Legacy of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama on his 90th Birthday and the 9th WPCT Region-Wise Action Plans on Tibet.

The resolutions tie together the essence of the convention and acknowledge the growing support for Tibet. It also touched upon the issue of Tibet's sovereignty, which they recognize as a historically independent nation before the forceful and illegal occupation by the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1950. 

An entire resolution was dedicated to the 14th Dalai Lama — celebrating his legacy of compassion, nonviolence and universal ethics. There was much emphasis on his 90th birthday and this resolution consisted of six major points. One of them is the reaffirmation of “the sole and exclusive authority over the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama with His Holiness himself and with Gaden Phodrang Trust.” This indicates the significance and importance of the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, which would be clarified during the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday on July 6.

The collective resolutions also highlight the situation in Tibet and how Beijing continues to contravene the human rights of Tibetans. It also calls upon parliaments, governments and UN organizations to raise the issue of Tibet, and commended actions that have been taken, such as the 2024 Resolve Tibet Act.

When the meeting was held, there was much uproar from Beijing, with the Global Times publishing two articles on June 3 and 5 that included statements from the Chinese embassy in Japan. 

It expressed strong dissatisfaction over the convention, criticized the Dalai Lama and the Central Tibetan Administration, which it referred to as the “Tibetan government-in-exile,” and said that Tibet should be referred to by its Chinese name, Xizang (西藏), that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama should abide by Chinese national laws and regulations, and that Tibet's economy is booming and people's lives are improving.

What is fascinating is how the resolutions all engage with the narratives that Beijing came out with at the Global Times.

With this back and forth between Tibet and the PRC, Beijing confirmed the significance of the ninth WPCT. 

Taiwan could also host the convention, as it has an engaging Taiwan Parliamentary Group for Tibet — the 11th such group, formed on May 20 last year in Taipei. Furthermore, it would continue until the Tibet-China dispute is resolved, with the international community, including the lawmakers of democratic nations, supporting the resolution of this dispute.

Of course, China Airlines is not based in China, but in Taiwan, and the new partnership connects Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport with 30 cities across the US.
At a time when China is increasing efforts on all fronts to falsely label Taiwan as “China” in all arenas, Taiwan does itself no favors by having its flagship carrier named China Airlines.

The lyric from the well-known song All Eyes on Me (世界都看見) — originally written and performed by Taiwanese hip-hop group Nine One One (玖壹壹) — was muted twice, while the subtitles on the screen showed an alternate line, “we come here together” (阮作伙來欸), which was not sung. The song, performed at the ceremony by a cheerleading group, was the theme                                    



                                                                                Secretary of State Marco Rubio raised eyebrows recently when he declared the era of American unipolarity over. He described America's unrivaled dominance of the international system as an anomaly that was created by the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War. Now, he observed, the United States was returning to a more multipolar world where there are great powers in different parts of the planet. He pointed to China and Russia, as well as “rogue states like Iran and North Korea” as examples of countries the United States must contend with.

Editor's note: This story was updated to include new details on the medical repatriation of Russian POWs, citing commentary from Ukraine's I Want to Live project.Ukraine has recovered the bodies of 1,200 fallen citizens, including military personnel, in the latest round of repatriation efforts coordinated with Russia under agreements reached during talks in Istanbul, Ukrainian officials said on June 14.

This latest repatriation follows the return of 2,412 bodies earlier on June 13 and June 11, reflecting an intensification of efforts after the June 2 Istanbul talks between the two sides.

The Coordination Headquarters for Prisoners of War said the bodies, which Russian authorities claim belong to Ukrainian nationals, were returned as part of an ongoing phased exchange process.

""The remains will now undergo forensic examination and identification procedures conducted by law enforcement investigators in cooperation with expert institutions under the Interior Ministry,"" the Coordination Headquarters said in a statement.

The repatriation operation was coordinated by the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs) alongside the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Ombudsman's Office, the Armed Forces, the Interior Ministry, and other government and defense bodies. The International Committee of the Red Cross also provided assistance during the process.

In addition to repatriating bodies, Ukraine has begun implementing what officials described as the first stage of a ""permanent humanitarian medical exchange"" with Russia, also agreed to in Istanbul. 

Under this arrangement, Ukraine has transferred wounded Russian POWs directly from the front lines, according to ""I Want to Live,"" a government-run project that facilitates voluntary surrender by Russian and Belarusian soldiers.

""As part of this exchange, the Russian side received wounded prisoners of war directly from the front line,"" the project said in a statement.

At the Istanbul meeting on June 2, Ukrainian and Russian delegations agreed on a new prisoner exchange but failed to secure a ceasefire agreement. The previous talks on May 16 led to the largest prisoner swap of the war in late May, when approximately 1,000 captives were exchanged on each side. Since then, exchanges have continued, focusing especially on severely wounded and ill soldiers.

Ukraine has long pushed for an ""all-for-all""prisoner exchange to bring home all Ukrainian captives, but Moscow has resisted such a comprehensive deal. 

It is not immediately clear whether Ukraine released the bodies of Russian soldiers in return during this latest exchange. During the previous swap on June 11, Moscow announced it had repatriated the bodies of 27 Russian service members.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Three Ukrainian nationals were killed in a bus accident in France on June 13, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed in a statement on Telegram.

""Terrible news about the tragic bus accident in France,"" Zelensky wrote.

The accident occurred in the morning of June 13, near the Sarthe department of France. The bus was reportedly carrying Ukrainian nationals, including adults and children, who were returning from an educational exchange.

While en route to Paris, the bus lost control and flipped into a ditch.

Four adults were killed in total – three of whom were Ukrainian nationals. French media reported that nine people sustained serious injuries, while an additional 18 suffered minor injuries.

Zelensky added that Ukraine's Foreign Ministry promptly sent a team of diplomats and consuls, led by the ambassador to France, to assist survivors and support the victims' families. The team is coordinating with French authorities and emergency services at the scene.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko are providing regular updates on the victims' conditions and emerging details regarding the accident.

Zelensky thanked the French authorities, noting that ""more than 50 emergency teams were deployed"" in what he called ""a true expression of French solidarity.""He also expressed his ""condolences to all the families of the victims"" and wished for a ""speedy recovery of the injured children.""","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Canada's foreign ministry is advising all Canadians to leave the Middle East if possible as the conflict between Israel and Iran worsens.

The Department of Global Affairs in a Friday statement urged “Canadians in the Middle East to ensure their travel documents are valid and to leave via commercial options if safe.”

Israel attacked Iran Friday in a strike that targeted nuclear facilities and Tehran's military commanders. Iran later struck back, firing missiles at Israel.

Global Affairs said its registry of Canadians abroad counts 76,785 citizens in the Middle East, including 1,654 in Iran and 5,719 in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This is not a full accounting of all Canadians because it's a voluntary self-registration service.

“The government of Canada is closely monitoring the rapidly evolving tensions between Israel and Iran and urges all parties to prioritize de-escalation and the protection of civilians. Further action risks triggering a broader regional conflict with devastating consequences,” the department said in a statement.

“We remain deeply concerned by the threat posed by Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and call on all actors to refrain from any actions that further destabilize the region.”

Ottawa said as of Friday it had not received any reports of Canadians injured or killed in the escalating tensions.

The government urged Canadians in the Middle East to add their name to its Registration of Canadians Abroad Service.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada was taking measures to protect its diplomats in the region, and Global Affairs said as of Friday “all of our personnel are accounted for.”

Global Affairs said Canadians abroad in need of emergency consular assistance can contact Global Affairs Canada's 24/7 Emergency Watch and Response Centre by: telephone at +1 613 996 8885 (collect calls accepted where available); email, SMS (+1 613 686 3658) and WhatsApp at +1 613 909 8881.

Atop a reviewing stand near the White House on Saturday evening, Donald Trump will mark a 79th birthday like no other.

Tanks, rocket launchers and missiles will roll past. Soldiers will march in formation. Overhead, helicopters and war planes will pierce the air. For the big finish, a team of parachutists will land nearby and present the U.S. President with an American flag. 

Mr. Trump's long-held dream of a major military parade in Washington has always been controversial, drawing comparisons with authoritarian regimes.

And it has only become more so over the past week, after the President deployed the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to put down protests against his signature policy of rounding up unauthorized immigrants for deportation.

But the Commander-in-Chief has been undeterred.

“We're going to be celebrating big on Saturday. And if there's any protester that wants to come out, they will be met with very big force,” he warned this week. “This is people that hate our country.”

Analysis: The great theatre of Donald Trump's U.S. military parade

The event will also unfold in the shadow of air strikes by U.S. ally Israel on Iran and Tehran's retaliation, which threatens to spiral into all-out war. And it runs the risk of getting rained out, with evening thunderstorms forecast.

Like much of Mr. Trump's second term, the extravaganza represents the fulfillment of an ambition thwarted during his first mandate.

Mr. Trump was deeply impressed by a Bastille Day military parade during a state visit to Paris in 2017 and determined to surpass it. He scrapped plans to do so the following year after taking flak over the high price tag for such an event. On Independence Day in 2019, he settled for a much-slimmed-down version with a handful of military vehicles.

This time around, the President finally made his dream come true by building off an existing celebration. The U.S. Army was already planning public events to mark its 250th anniversary, which also falls on Flag Day. Mr. Trump ordered the event significantly expanded. The fact that it is also his birthday, he says, is a coincidence.

Here's what to expect at the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary parade

Critics were swift to accuse Mr. Trump of staging a strongman spectacle. California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff branded it a “dictator-style military parade.”

Even Mr. Trump's own Republican Party appears divided. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters he had “never been a big fan of goose-stepping soldiers and big tanks and missiles rolling down the street” and that it seemed a break with U.S. precedent. “We were always different than the images you saw in the Soviet Union and North Korea. We were proud not to be that.”

West Virginia Senator Jim Justice, meanwhile, defended the event. “It's great celebrating President Trump's birthday, and I think it's great celebrating the military,” he said. “We haven't done that in a long time.”

In a survey of 50 Republican legislators, the Politico website found only seven who said they would attend.

Whether protesters show up also remains to be seen. The two major groups organizing demonstrations across the country on Saturday – No Kings and Women's March – are both refraining from staging any events at the parade itself.

The main No Kings protest is in Philadelphia while the Women's March's is in Madison, Wisc. The latter is a circus-themed demonstration titled Kick Out the Clowns.

“It really is about laying bare the absurdity of the administration and its abuse of power that's pretending to be in service of the people, but is really anything but,” said Rachel O'Leary Carmona, the executive director of Women's March.

She described the deployment of troops to Los Angeles and the military parade as manifestations of “a Trump that feels threatened” and said the event in Washington is about shoring up “his fragile ego.”

Either way, the event will be a rarity in U.S. history: the country has typically only staged major military parades to mark the end of a war – or the start of one, as when then-president James Madison reviewed troops on Pennsylvania Avenue in 1812 shortly before launching several failed invasions of Canada.

The most recent, in 1991 after the Gulf War, left a bad taste for some in Washington when tanks made tread marks in asphalt and helicopters damaged a statue outside an art museum. For that reason, Saturday's parade has a separate US$16-million budget to repair city streets afterwards, in addition to an estimated price tag of up to US$45-million for the event itself.

Taking part will be 128 tanks, armoured personnel carriers and artillery pieces; 40 helicopters; six HIMARS rocket launchers; more than 6,000 troops; and four marching bands. For a retro touch, some solders will be dressed in uniforms from wars throughout U.S. history. There will also be historic planes, horses, mules and a dog.

Mr. Trump will watch from a stand on the edge of the Ellipse, a park between the White House and the National Mall, as the parade passes down Constitution Avenue. At its conclusion, the Golden Knights, a squad of Army parachutists, will land near Mr. Trump and present him with the flag. Afterwards, fireworks will light the sky.

About 200,000 people are expected to attend, though this may be affected by the weather. Organizers chose a relatively late start time for the event – 6:30 p.m. ET – in a bid to spare uniformed soldiers from marching in 27 C heat. But this means the parade may run up against a thunderstorm. The event will still go ahead if it rains but may be halted if there is lightning.

The President, for his part, is setting expectations high. He said this week that the event will be “better and bigger than any parade we've ever had in this country.”

“We have the greatest missiles in the world. We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world,” he said. “And we're going to celebrate it.”

Nippon Steel will buy a 100 per cent stake in U.S. Steel.Yuka Obayashi/Reuters

U.S President Donald Trump approved Nippon Steel's US$14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel on Friday, capping a tumultuous 18-month effort by the companies that survived union opposition and two national security reviews.

Trump signed an executive order saying the tie-up could move forward if the companies sign an agreement with the Treasury Department resolving national security concerns posed by the deal. The companies then announced they had signed the agreement, fulfilling the conditions of Trump's directive and effectively garnering approval for the merger.

“We look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again,” the companies said in the statement, thanking Trump.

They added the agreement includes US$11 billion in new investments to be made by 2028 as well as governance, production and trade commitments. Nippon Steel will buy a 100 per cent stake in U.S. Steel, a spokesperson for the Japanese company in Tokyo said on Saturday.

The steelmakers provided no detail on the “golden share” they pledged to issue to the U.S. government, raising questions about the extent of U.S. control. U.S. Senator David McCormick of Pennsylvania, where U.S. Steel is headquartered, said last month the golden share would give the government veto power over key decisions relating to the American steel icon.

Reuters has reported that Nippon Steel would invest an additional US$3 billion for a new mill after 2028.

The takeover will set up the ailing U.S. firm to receive the critical investment, allowing Nippon Steel to capitalize on a host of American infrastructure projects while its foreign competitors face steel tariffs of 50 per cent. The Japanese firm also avoids the US$565 million in breakup fees it would have had to pay if the companies had failed to secure approvals.

U.S. government to have control in Nippon Steel-U.S. Steel deal, Trump and state senator say

For Nippon Steel, the world's fourth-biggest steelmaker, securing a foothold in the U.S. is key to its global growth strategy. The U.S. steel market, including high-grade steel, Nippon Steel's specialty, is growing amid rising global trade tensions.

Still, some Nippon Steel investors are concerned about short-term financial pressure due to the scale of the additional investment commitment.

The Japanese government, rushing to try to secure a trade deal with the U.S. by the time Trump and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba meet at the Group of Seven summit starting on Sunday, applauded the Nippon-U.S. Steel agreement.

“The government of Japan welcomes the U.S. government's decision, as we believe this investment will enhance innovation capabilities in the U.S. and Japanese steel industries and further strengthen the close partnership between our two countries,” Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Yoji Muto said in a statement on Saturday.

Friday's announcement was hardly guaranteed, even if many investors had seen approval as likely after Trump headlined a rally on May 30 giving his vague blessing to an “investment” by Nippon Steel, which he described as a “great partner.”

Nippon Steel to invest $4-billion for new U.S. Steel mill in $14-billion package, document says

Shares of U.S. Steel had dipped earlier on Friday after a Nippon Steel executive told Japan's Nikkei newspaper that the takeover required “a degree of management freedom” to go ahead after Trump said the U.S. would be in control with the golden share.

The bid has faced opposition since Nippon Steel launched it in December 2023.

After the United Steelworkers union came out against the deal last year, both then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, expressed their opposition as they sought to woo voters in the presidential campaign in the swing state of Pennsylvania.

Shortly before leaving office in January, Biden blocked the deal on national security grounds, prompting lawsuits by the companies, which argued the national security review they received was biased. The Biden White House disputed the charge.

The steel companies saw a new opportunity in the Trump administration, which opened a fresh 45-day national security review into the proposed merger in April.

But Trump's public comments, ranging from welcoming a simple “investment” in U.S. Steel by the Japanese firm to floating a minority stake for Nippon Steel, spurred confusion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Israel, Iran launch new waves of missile attacks","https://www.dw.com/en/israel-iran-launch-new-waves-of-missile-attacks/live-72905315","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 01:26:17 GMT","

Iran has targeted Israel with several waves of long-range missiles in retaliation for Israel's strikes on its nuclear sites. Israel also launched new strikes on Tehran early Saturday. Follow DW for more.

Below is a roundup of the latest developments on the Israel-Iran conflict and the wider Middle East crisis on Saturday, June 14, 2025:

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has urged both Israel and Iran to ""deescalate"" and ""look for a way out of another military confrontation.""

Speaking in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, after a meeting with his Saudi counterpart Faisal bin Farhan, Wadephul warned of ""unpredictable consequences"" should the situation in the Middle East continue to escalate.

""This region needs peace, not more military conflict,"" he said. ""This is why I would like to appeal to all: it's not too late.""

While reiterating Germany's responsibility for Israel's security and existence, Wadephul nevertheless said that Berlin was trying to ""influence our Israeli partners in this regard, too.""

Saudi Arabia, for its part, has condemned Israel's ongoing attacks against Iran as a ""clear breach of international law.""

Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has assured Israel of military support in the case of further Iranian retaliatory strikes, but ruled out French involvement in any offensive Israeli operations.

The Iraqi government has requested that neighboring Iran does not target US facilities in Iraq as part of its response to continuing Israeli air strikes, a senior security official told the AFP news agency on Saturday.

""The request was made. They promised us positive things,"" said the official, adding that Tehran has shown ""understanding"" with regards to Baghdad's request.

Having once fought a bloody war in the 1980s, Iraq and Iran are now close allies — but Baghdad is also a strategic partner of the United States, which has some 2,500 troops stationed in Iraq as part of an anti-jihadist coalition.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has insisted that Washington has nothing to do with the latest Israeli attacks on Iran, but Tehran considers the US its arch-enemy and generally sees the ""Great Satan"" as fundamentally in league with Israel.

Even prior to the current escalation, which began early Friday with a series of Israeli attacks on military and nuclear sites in Iran, Tehran had threatened to strike US military bases in the region in the event of a conflict triggered by the failure of nuclear talks with Washington.

Ever since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza in October 2023, Iran-aligned groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen have targeted US forces in Iraq, Syria and the Red Sea with rockets and drones.

The United States on Wednesday announced it was reducing staffing at its Baghdad embassy, citing security reasons.

In the internet age, every major world event seems to come accompanied by a plethora of mis- and disinformation, and the current escalating conflict between Israel and Iran is no exception.

Read the DW fact-checking team's report on some of the more egregious fakes that have been running about on social media following Israel's attack on Iran.

The Israeli military claimed on Saturday that its air force had established ""aerial freedom of action"" over western regions of Iran, as far as the capital Tehran.

""Tehran is no longer immune,"" military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin told journalists, adding that the air force ""launched a massive strike involving more than 70 fighter jets, targeting objectives in Tehran"" overnight.

The night before, Israel said around 200 fighter planes had been involved in a first wave of strikes on targets across Iran.

Also on Saturday, Iranian media reported that two more members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard had been killed in an Israeli strike.

The Israel-Iran conflict has put Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, in a tricky bind.

In recent years, Riyadh has improved its ties with both countries, despite tense relations in the past.

In addition, the countries on the Arabian Peninsula lack the effective defense system that Israel possesses, making them vulnerable to attack.

Read the full story on how the hostilities between Israel and Iran are impacting the wider region.

The Israeli military has said that seven Israeli soldiers were injured as a result of an Iranian missile launched overnight, but it did not say where the missile hit.

All seven soldiers were taken to hospital with light injuries and have already been discharged home.
 

Three more Iranian nuclear scientists have been declared killed in Israeli attacks, the semi-official Tasnim
news agency and state television reported on Saturday.

The scientists were identified as Ali Bakaei Karimi, Mansour Asgari, and Saeid Borji, Tasnim said. It was not immediately clear when the three were killed.

Six other nuclear scientists were reported by Iran to have been killed in strikes by Israel early on Friday.

Israel has sought to justify its attacks on Iran by pointing to the country's nuclear program, which Israel says is aimed at producing nuclear weapons.

Iran has denied that it wants nuclear weapons, although the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Thursday condemned Iran for its lack of compliance.

Israel is widely believed to already possess several nuclear weapons, something which it has never publicly admitted.

Iran moved equipment and materials at the Fordo nuclear facility to secure areas ahead of an attack on
the site by Israel, the spokesman for the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization, Behrus Kamalvandi, said on Saturday in quotes carried by state news agency IRNA.

The facility, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of the capital, Tehran, is located deep underground and is equipped with anti-aircraft guns.

The site houses centrifuges used for uranium enrichment, among other functions.

Iranian authorities did not inform the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's nuclear watchdog, of the facility's existence until 2009, two years after it was built. Intelligence agencies from the US and its Western allies had previously been aware it had been constructed.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a warning that should Iran fire more missiles at Israel, it would result in heavy attacks on Tehran, a city of over 9 million people.

""The Iranian dictator is turning the citizens of Iran into hostages,"" Katz said in a statement, adding that the residents of the Iranian capital are set to pay a heavy price for their country's actions.

""If [Iran's Supreme Leader Ali] Khamenei continues to fire missiles towards the Israeli home front — Tehran will burn.""

It is illegal under international law to target civilians.

US President Donald Trump claims his country was not involved with Israel's attacks on Iran.

At the same time, he threatens that if Tehran doesn't reach a nuclear deal with the US, attacks on Iran ""will only get worse.""

Read the full story on Trump's role in the hostilities between Israel and Iran.

Pope Leo XIV has called on both Israel and Iran to show a sense of responsibility in their actions as the conflict between the two countries escalates.

""The situation in Iran and Israel has seriously deteriorated at such a delicate moment. I wish to forcefully renew an appeal for responsibility and reason,"" the pope said in a statement.

""The commitment to build a safer world free from the nuclear threat must be pursued through a respectful meeting and sincere dialogue,"" he said. ""No one should ever threaten the existence of the other.""

Israel has said its strikes on Iran on Friday were conducted to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Critics argue the Israeli strikes were actually illegal under international law. 

Iran state radio said on Saturday that another two generals were killed in Israeli strikes on Friday, bringing to eight the total number of senior military officers who have lost their lives.

It said General Gholamreza Mehrabi, the intelligence deputy for the armed forces' general staff, and General Mehdi Rabbani, its deputy chief of operations, were both killed in Israeli bombings.

Among the other top military leaders killed, whose names were announced earlier, were armed forces chief General Mohammad Bagheri, the head of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, General Hossein Salami, and the Guard's ballistic missile program chief, General Amir Ali Hajizadeh.

Eyal Zamir, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of the General Staff, said that the Israeli military would start attacking ""targets in Tehran,"" according to Israeli media.

In a meeting with the IDF's Air Force head, the two said that the ""route to Iran has been paved,"" referring to Israel's attacks on several military targets across Iran.

""In accordance with our organized plans, the Israeli Air Force's fighter jets will start operating in attacking targets in Tehran,"" the two were cited as saying.

The Iranian capital was already hit by Israeli strikes on Friday morning.

Lebanon has said it would reopen its airspace on Saturday at 10:00 a.m.(0700) but close it once more from 10:30 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. on Sunday amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, the state news agency NNA reported, citing the Lebanese Civil Aviation Authority.

The exchange of aerial bombardments between Israel and Iran has greatly disrupted air traffic in the region. 

Explosions were seen above Tel Aviv on early Saturday morning as Israel's Iron Dome air defense system intercepted a fresh wave of Iranian missiles.

According to paramedics, one person was killed and around 40 were injured by isolated impacts.

Tehran has said it considers Israeli strikes on military leaders and nuclear sites to be a ""declaration of war."" A diplomatic de-escalation seems like a distant prospect.

Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said Israel will suffer a ""bitter and painful"" fate, following Friday's attacks on Iranian targets. Iran's military has warned there will be ""no limits"" to its response.

Israel's military has said over 100 targets in Iran were struck overnight, which were followed up later in the day by another series of strikes.

The targets included at least six leading nuclear scientists and four senior members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who were killed in attacks on residential buildings in the capital, Tehran.

Iranian media have reported that the IRGC commander-in-chief, Hossein Salami, was among those killed, along with top Khamenei aide and diplomat Ali Shamkhani, who also led a committee coordinating nuclear talks.

Iran has characterized the Israeli strikes as a ""declaration of war.""

""The current situation is the result of a lack of effective and functioning diplomacy between Iran and the US in the nuclear negotiations,"" Mohammad Sadegh Javadi Hesar, a former Iranian parliamentarian and editor in chief of the dissident Tus newspaper, told DW.

""This situation has created a space in which Israel is behaving undiplomatically and has drawn both negotiating parties into a military confrontation that neither was desired nor is desired by Iran,"" he added.

The US in recent months had restarted negotiations with Iran over Tehran's nuclear program with the aim of reaching a deal to keep Iran away from developing a nuclear weapon. In 2018, during his first term, US President Donald Trump pulled the US out of a nuclear agreement with Iran that traded sanctions relief for a verifiable Iranian drawdown of uranium enrichment. 

Israel views the Iranian nuclear program as an existential threat. The Iranian leadership does not recognize the state of Israel and regularly threatens to destroy it.

However, Tehran officially emphasizes that its nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has a different perspective. According to IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi, Iran is enriching uranium to an extent that exceeds that of all other non-nuclear weapon states.

In a resolution on June 12, the UN nuclear watchdog declared for the first time in almost 20 years that Iran had violated its nuclear non-proliferation obligations. This provides an opportunity to refer the case to the UN Security Council.

In response to the IAEA's condemnation of the lack of cooperation, the Iranian Foreign Ministry and the Atomic Energy Agency jointly announced their intention to build a third uranium enrichment facility ""in a safe place.""

Javadi Hesar, an Iran-based political critic, told DW that the IAEA ruling has allowed Israel to legitimize its strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

""Israel can now claim that even the IAEA has determined that the Iranian nuclear program is neither predictable nor controllable. Therefore, it is necessary to strike preemptively and destroy Iranian nuclear facilities out of self-protection,"" Hesar said.

""To prevent this escalation from turning into a major war, and to keep the confrontation between Iran and Israel at a low and limited level, the US government — as Iran's negotiating partner — should quickly condemn Israel's actions and make it publicly clear that it was not involved in this attack,"" he added. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later on Friday said the US was not involved in supporting or orchestrating the strikes.

IAEA chief Grossi, meanwhile, condemned the attack on Iran's nuclear program.

On Friday, he stated that, according to the Iranian authorities, the uranium enrichment plant in Natanz had been hit by the Israeli attacks.

Israel claimed the facility had been ""significantly"" damaged. The IAEA has not seen increased radiation levels at the site.

A second facility in Fordo and the nuclear center in Isfahan were not affected as of Friday afternoon.

Iran has spread its nuclear facilities over several locations, some of which are in underground bunkers, which makes it difficult to completely destroy them.

If Iran's nuclear facilities are attacked, Iran has little choice but to strike back for internal political reasons, according to Arman Mahmoudian, Iran expert at the University of South Florida.

He added Iran is concerned about a development similar to the Syrian war, in which Israel destroyed several nuclear facilities under construction.

""Iran feels compelled to send at least a limited but clear countersignal in order to prevent further attacks. Israel, in turn, could expand its operations and target Iran's electricity and oil infrastructure in order to increase the pressure on Tehran on a daily basis,"" Mahmoudian told DW.

Iran's first reaction was to fire more than 100 drones at Israel, all of which were intercepted outside Israeli territory, according to the Israeli military.

The Iranian armed forces released a statement saying that Tehran had ""no restrictions"" in its response to Israel's strikes.

Iranian Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh has said that ""new"" weapons had been tested and handed over to the armed forces. Iran has also called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.

US President Donald Trump on Friday took to his Truth Social social media platform and called on the Iranian leadership to make a ""deal"" and warned otherwise of ""even more brutal"" attacks.

""There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,"" Trump posted.

Trump told US broadcaster CNN on Friday that the Israeli strikes were a ""very successful attack"" while it was left to Rubio to confirm the lack of US involvement. 

The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the prime minister will speak with Trump at some point on Friday.

""So far, Iran has not wanted to be drawn into a direct military conflict with the US, which would be an extremely risky undertaking,"" said Iran expert Mahmoudian.

""However, there is a difference between the US merely supporting Israel and actively getting involved in a war with Iran,"" he added.

To completely destroy Iran's nuclear facilities, Israel would need more advanced weaponry that only the US would be able to provide.

Should such involvement occur, Iranian retaliation would likely also target US facilities in the region, which would further destabilize the already tense situation in the Middle East.

Germany is stepping up security around Israeli and Jewish-linked sites in anticipation of reprisals over Israel's attacks on Iran. Meanwhile, indicators suggest the economy may be turning a corner. 

The German government has increased protection for Jewish and Israeli institutions across the country.

ChancellorFriedrich Merz said Israel's Prime Minister had briefed him by phone, after which he convened Germany's security cabinet.

Berlin reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defense but urged both sides to avoid escalation, while Israel's embassy in Berlin remains closed ""until further notice.""

Meanwhile, a leading economic institute says Germany's economy is showing tentative signs of a recovery.

This blog is now closed. Below is a roundup of the major developments in Germany on Friday, June 13:

A drink driver was apprehended in the eastern German state of Saxony late on Thursday night after drunkenly ordering a Bockwurst – a boiled sausage similar to a hotdog (as opposed to the more commonly known Bratwurst, which is fried).

The 46-year-old German man ordered the midnight snack at a gas station in the town of Eilenburg, where his slurred speech raised suspicion.

After he drove off again, witnesses alerted the police, who caught up with and stopped the man a short time later.

A breathalyzer test revealed a blood alcohol level of 1.8 parts per thousand – several times over the limit and constituting a criminal offense potentially punishable by jail time.

Whether the man had ketchup or mustard on his Bockwurst wasn't immediately clear.

Airline and tourism stocks have continued to slide at the end of the week after Israel's strike on Iran early Friday.

Shares in tour operator TUI dropped to €6.22 ($7.18), their lowest since mid-April — marking a nearly 14% weekly decline.

The downward trend had already accelerated on Thursday amid fears of a broader Middle East escalation and news of a deadly passenger plane crash in India that killed over 200 people.

German airline Lufthansa saw a 7% drop over the week, despite briefly hitting its highest share price since March on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, defense stocks rebounded Friday morning. 

Shares in Rheinmetall, Germany's largest arms manufacturer, turned slightly positive for the week after recent profit-taking. Defense electronics firm Hensoldt briefly erased its weekly losses, and propulsion specialist RENK was also able to limit its decline.

German bureaucracy's obsession with paper documents is well known, but the days of physical stamps and signatures could soon be at an end.

The Federal Ministry of Justice on Friday published draft legislation (online!) to enable the digital issuing and signing of certificates and other official documentation.

""It's high time that we introduced digital certification procedures,"" said Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig of the Social Democrats (SPD), the junior partner in the coalition government.

""Most certificates are generally already stored electronically, but the production of the actual documents still takes place in paper form. This is unnecessarily cumbersome.""

The legislation aims to put an end to the laborious and often frustrating necessity of having to print off a digitally-issued document in order to physically sign it before scanning and uploading it again.

The changes would affect all sorts of documentation from property purchase agreements to company articles of association to marriage and birth certificates.

Furthermore, the Ministry of Justice also wants to digitalize district court proceedings so that hearings can take place online.

""The online process will make citizens' access to the court system easier than ever,"" promised Hubig.

Germany's bid to host the UEFA Women's Euro 2029 will not include matches in the capital, Berlin.

The German Football Association (DFB) has announced that it has selected eight cities for its bid: Cologne, Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hanover, Leipzig, Munich and Wolfsburg.

Berlin, along with Gelsenkirchen and Rostock, was dropped after the DFB leadership followed recommendations from an expert panel.

""This gives us a momentum and confidence for the international bidding process. We can also say with regard to the venues: we are ready to organize another major football festival in Germany in 2029,"" DFB president Bernd Neuendorf said.

Germany is aiming to host the tournament for the third time, having previously done so in 1989 and 2001 — both without Berlin as a host city.

""Berlin is not prepared to take financial and contractual risks as part of the bid,"" said Sabine Beikler, spokesperson for the Berlin Senate Department for the Interior, Digitalization and Sport.

Other bids for the 2029 tournament include individual proposals from Poland, Portugal and Italy, as well as a joint bid from Denmark and Sweden. UEFA is expected to make its final decision in December.

Berlin hosted matches during the 2006 men's World Cup and Euro 2024, with both finals held in the capital's Olympic Stadium.

Germany's annual inflation rate remained unchanged at 2.1% in May 2025, according to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis). 

The rate was the same as in April, following slightly higher figures earlier this year — 2.2% in March and 2.3% in January and February, respectively.

""The inflation rate has stabilized, mainly due to the continued decrease in energy prices"", said Destatis President Ruth Brand.

""On the other hand, the rise in food and service prices drove inflation up in May also,"" she added.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices edged up 0.1% in May compared with April.

Germany's economy is back on a modest growth track, according to the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), which has raised its forecasts for 2024 and 2025.

The country's inflation-adjusted GDP is expected to grow by 0.3% this year and 1.7% next year — up from the previous outlook for the two years of 0.1% and 1.1%.

""The surprisingly strong start to the year should spare us from another year of stagnation,"" said DIW's chief economist Geraldine Dany-Knedlik. She pointed to rising private consumption and a surge in exports in anticipation of upcoming US tariffs as key drivers in the first quarter.

However, Dany-Knedlik warned this rebound would not resolve Germany's structural weaknesses, such as declining competitiveness and a shortage of skilled labor.

One ""bright spot,"" she added, is a new infrastructure investment package expected to deliver a noticeable boost in 2025.

DIW President Marcel Fratzscher cautioned that US trade policy remains a risk, with planned tax cuts in the US potentially increasing debt and triggering market turbulence. 

He also cited domestic political gridlock as a concern, urging Germany's coalition government to finalize its 2025 and 2026 budgets and present a unified long-term vision.

Germany has increased protection of Jewish and Israeli institutions after Israel's latest strikes on Iranian targets, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said. 

The chancellor said security services had already implemented the necessary measures.

Merz said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed him by phone on Friday morning about the military operation and its objectives. Merz then convened a meeting of the federal government's security cabinet.

Germany reiterated Israel's right to defend its existence and protect its citizens, Merz said, but urged both sides to refrain from actions that could escalate the conflict and destabilize the region. He emphasized that Germany was ready to use all available diplomatic means to influence the warring parties.

German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt underlined the need for increased security measures for Jewish and Israeli institutions in Germany, citing the situation in the Middle East.

""We will take security policy precautions to enable enhanced protection of Israeli and Jewish facilities in Germany,"" Dobrindt said after an interior ministers' conference in Bremerhaven. ""We see this as a potential initial threat scenario that could arise from the situation in the Middle East.""

Meanwhile, the Israeli Embassy in Berlin has closed ""until further notice,"" according to a post on X. The mission is reportedly Israel's second-largest diplomatic representation worldwide.

Germany's Foreign Office said around 3,500 German nationals are registered in Israel through its ""Elefand"" crisis warning service. About 1,000 are in Lebanon, with lower triple-digit figures in Iran and Iraq, and 200 in Jordan. The ministry urged citizens to follow local authority instructions.

Guten Tag from Germany's ""federal village"" of Bonn! DW will bring you the latest development from across Germany, where Berlin says it is ramping up protection at Jewish and Israeli sites.

That comes after Israel launched attacks against a series of targets in Iran, raising fears of a further escalation in the region.

Inside Germany, there appeared to be positive economic news on growth, while inflation also appeared to be easing.

A Democratic politician and her husband were killed during a series of “politically motivated assassination” attempts in Minnesota.

Melissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker in Minnesota's House of Representatives, along with her husband, was shot by a gunman in their home in the early hours of Saturday.

John Hoffman, a Democratic state senator, and his spouse were also shot multiple times. Both have received surgery and are expected to survive, officials say.

Police have issued a shelter order around the Brooklyn Park area of Minnesota as they hunt for a gunman who may be impersonating a police officer.

Officers arrived at Ms Hortman's home to find an SUV police car equipped with emergency lights.

Police confirmed a number of “No King's Day” flyers were found in the vehicle. The demonstrations are taking place across the US on Saturday, in protest of a military parade in Washington DC.

The parade, to mark the army's 250th anniversary, is the brainchild of the president, and coincides with his 79th birthday.

The suspect was wearing a vest, and armed with a taser and other equipment while pretending to be a police officer, said Mark Bruley, the Brooklyn Park police chief.

Officers had decided to check Ms Hortman's home as a precaution after Mr Hoffman was shot.

After an exchange of gunfire, the suspect fled on foot out of the back of the house. A manhunt is under way to find the gunman.

Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, said the killings appeared to be a “politically motivated assassination.”

“My good friend and colleague, Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, were shot and killed early this morning in what appears to be a politically motivated assassination,” Mr Walz said.

“Our state lost a great leader, and I lost the dearest of friends.

“She was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota. She woke up every day determined to make this state a better place.”

Bob Johnson, a public safety Commissioner, said: “[The] Suspect exploited the trust of our uniforms, what our uniforms are meant to represent. That betrayal is deeply disturbing to those of us who wear the badge with honour and responsibility.”

“It was not a real police officer. This is somebody that clearly had been impersonating a police officer. Again, using the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home,” Mr Bruley said. A search of the car found a manifesto which included other political targets, he added.

Donald Trump, who has been briefed on the attack, said the “terrible shooting” appeared to be a “targeted attack against state lawmakers”.

The US president said in a statement released by the White House: “Our attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the FBI, are investigating the situation, and they will be prosecuting anyone involved to the fullest extent of the law.

“Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place.”

An alert warning residents that officers were looking for a suspected gunman was sent at 5.30am by Brooklyn Park Police.

“Police are looking for a suspect in multiple targeted shootings who is armed and dangerous,” the message read.

“Suspect is white male, brown hair, wearing black body armour over a blue shirt and blue pants and may misrepresent himself as law enforcement.”

The shelter-in-place order is currently being enforced in the three mile radius of Minnesota's Edinburgh Golf Course.

Mr Walz, the governor, earlier said he had activated a state-emergency-operations centre to deal with the incident.

“I've been briefed this morning on an ongoing situation involving targeted shootings in Champlin and Brooklyn Park,” Mr Waltz wrote on X.

“The Minnesota Department of Public Safety and local law enforcement are on the scene.

“We will share more information soon.”

Mr Hoffman, a Democrat, was first elected in 2012. He runs Hoffman Strategic Advisors, a consulting firm. He previously served as vice chair of the Anoka Hennepin School Board, which manages the largest school district in Minnesota. Mr Hoffman is married and has one daughter.

Ms Hortman is the top House Democratic leader in the state legislature and a former House speaker.

She was first elected in 2004. Ms Hortman, a lawyer, is married and has two children.

Both represent districts located north of Minneapolis.

Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI, said the bureau is “fully engaged on the ground in Minnesota and is working in collaboration with our local and state partners”.

Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said: “I am closely monitoring developments in Minnesota after what appears to be a targeted attack against state lawmakers.

“The FBI is on the ground investigating this case alongside state and local partners. This horrific violence will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Organisers of the “No Kings” protest in north-east Minneapolis, one of a series of anti-Trump demonstrations taking place across the US, have cancelled the event “out of an abundance of caution”.

Minnesota authorities said they currently have “no understanding that any of the ‘No Kings' events would be targeted”.

People have been encouraged not to join the protests taking place in the area, after flyers for the ‘No Kings' event were allegedly found in the suspect's car.

			Polling shows significant support for president's deployment of servicemen in California as military parade set to take place

There are thunderstorms forecast for the weekend, and protesters planning to rain on his military parade, but there's one piece of good news for Donald Trump on his 79th birthday.

Polling shared with The Telegraph shows significant support for the president's deployment of troops to clamp down on riots in Los Angeles, with the public backing his move by a margin of 14 per cent.

Initially, Mr Trump's decision to send the National Guard and US Marines to the city of angels had threatened to cast a cloud over his parade on Saturday, with soldiers detaining US citizens during what was meant to be a shared celebration of the country's military history.

James Johnson, co-founder of JL Partners, which conducted the polling, said it showed the president was “very much winning the battle of public opinion when it comes to the protests”.

He told The Telegraph: “People are instinctively on the side of order and the police over what they see as concerning levels of unrest… Right now, the message is well-calibrated and his approach is garnering support.”

The legal battle is still making its way through the courts, in a tug of war between Mr Trump and Gavin Newsom, the California governor, but the president can notch up a victory from the public reaction.

However, another fight is just around the corner.

No Kings, a collection of protest groups, is planning a series of protests around the country to coincide with the parade, protesting against what it claims is Mr Trump's monarchical ambitions.

Millions of people will turn out in thousands of towns and cities across the US on Saturday, organisers said, to create a “split-screen” between the displays of military strength in Washington while ordinary citizens turn out in opposition.

Among the “No Kings” backers are Christy Walton, the Walmart heiress who is worth even more than Mr Trump, and has become a figurehead in pushing back on the president.

Mr Trump warned that any protesters assembling during the ceremony, which coincides with his birthday, would be met with “very big force”. Protest organisers, wary of provoking clashes with law enforcement, plan demonstrations in every major city except the capital.

Ostensibly meant to celebrate two and a half centuries of military history, more than 6,000 soldiers dressed in uniforms ranging from the Revolutionary War up to the present day will parade down an eight-block route.

From the accounts trailed in the media, it should be an unadulterated display of US military might from a president who casts himself as the “peacemaker-in-chief”.

A flyover of F-22s, the most advanced fighter jets in the world, is scheduled, while dozens of Chinook, Apache and Black Hawk helicopters will also take to the skies.

A B-25 bomber, which cemented itself in the nation's consciousness for the daring raids conducted in Japan during the Second World War, is expected to roar above the crowds, more than six decades after it was finally retired.

Armoured vehicles, including 60-ton Abrams tanks, will roll through the streets of Washington DC, in what was expected to be the largest military parade in the city since the end of the first Gulf War in 1991.

Trundling amongst some of the bristling display of firepower will be a 19th-century army escort wagon, pulled by mules and carrying a dog called Doc Holliday, who is part of the 1st Cavalry Division Horse Cavalry Detachment.

Attendees will have to navigate a security perimeter formed out of 18.5 miles of steel, 175 metal detectors and two security checkpoints.

The procession will start near the Lincoln Memorial, honouring Abraham Lincoln, who guided the nation through the US civil war in the mid-19th century.

It then passes memorials honouring Vietnam veterans and the nurses and women who served in the war, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the vast World War II memorial, where granite pillars representing the US states and territories surround a central fountain.

It then travels by the DC War Memorial, paying tribute to the city's veterans who served in the First World War, before finishing after the Washington Monument, the towering obelisk which marks George Washington's victory in the War of Independence.

Mr Trump is expected to view the parade from the Ellipse – a park south of the White House – and will be presented with the Stars and Stripes by the US Army's Golden Knights parachute display team.

But the spectacle has provoked fears about the politicisation of the military in service of the commander-in-chief.

Even though it is meant to commemorate the military, Monica Crowley, the White House's chief of protocol, has suggested the crowd should serenade Mr Trump with a rendition of “Happy Birthday”.

And it coincides not just with the army cracking down on riots in Los Angeles, but soldiers at Fort Bragg this week booing the president's political opponents, including Mr Newsom, and the press.

Troops were screened before the event for loyalty to the administration and physical attractiveness, according to Military.com. A Pentagon spokesman said in response: “Believe me, no one needs to be encouraged to boo the media.”

Kori Schake, a former defence official under George W Bush, called the timing of the ceremony ominous and said she worried about the “normalisation of political involvement by troops”.

The seeds of Saturday's procession lie in Mr Trump's trip to Paris in 2017, when French president Emmanuel Macron treated him to a military parade for Bastille Day.

The president, by all accounts, was rapt.

He later instructed his administration to create their own parade, but his vision of tanks rolling down the streets of Washington never got further than a much-derided memo issued to officials.

Mr Trump often liked to boast about “my generals” in his first stint in the White House, but top brass and ex-military figures pushed back hard on the suggestion.

James Mattis, the defence secretary at the time, who declined an interview for this article, declared he would “rather swallow acid” than submit to a “Soviet Union-like display of authoritarian power”, according to an aide.

Paul J Selva, then vice-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declared the display was “what dictators do”.

Eight years later, the president has an administration that is firmly under his thumb and will do what he wants – dictator comparisons be damned. Many Republicans on Capitol Hill are giving the event a wide berth, but they're not speaking against it.

Then again, the national mood could sour if Mr Trump appears too triumphalist on Saturday, and if any naked displays of partisanship intrude on the military parade.

And Mr Johnson notes that his polling advantage in Los Angeles could fall away if authorities fall into the trap of “appearing to define any non-white person as a threat” rather than focusing on their law and order message.

Mr Trump might be winning the battle of public opinion, but he hasn't won the war.

The complaint filed under the Biden administration alleged over 1,000 employee uses of the chemical without proper protection.

This story was originally published by ProPublica.

The Environmental Protection Agency has withdrawn a legal complaint filed last year against the GEO Group, a major donor to President Donald Trump that has more than $1 billion in contracts with the administration to run private prisons and ICE detention facilities.

The administrative complaint, which the EPA filed last June under the Biden administration, involved the GEO Group's use of a disinfectant called Halt at the Adelanto Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in California. The EPA regulates the product, which causes irreversible eye damage and skin burns, according to its label. By law, users are supposed to use goggles or a face shield, chemical resistant gloves and protective clothing.

But on more than 1,000 occasions in 2022 and 2023, the GEO group had its employees use the disinfectant without proper protections, the EPA complaint alleged. The agency alleged that GEO Group's employees wore nitrile exam gloves that were labeled “extra soft” and “not intended for use as a general chemical barrier.” In a separate, pending lawsuit, people who were detained at the detention center alleged they were sickened by the company's liberal use of a different disinfectant.

A hearing had yet to be scheduled before an administrative law judge. The maximum penalty for the company's alleged misuse of Halt is more than $4 million. But a notice filed on Friday by Matthew Salazar, a manager in the EPA's Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Division, stated that the EPA's case against the GEO Group would be dropped. The notice did not provide an explanation.

“This is a complete surrender,” said Gary Jonesi, an attorney who worked at the EPA for almost 40 years. “If this is not due to political intervention on behalf of an early and large Trump donor who stands to gain from managing ICE detention facilities and private prisons, then surely it is at least partly due to the intimidation that career staff feel in an environment when federal employees are being fired and reassigned to undesirable tasks and locations.”

A spokesperson for the White House said that the GEO Group has “provided services to the Federal Bureau of Prisons for several decades” and has been a major federal contractor for many years. The spokesperson did not say whether the White House played a role in the decision to withdraw the complaint but referred ProPublica to the EPA.

The EPA said in an email that, “As a matter of longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on litigation.” The GEO Group didn't respond to questions from ProPublica. In a filing in response to the EPA's complaint, the GEO Group admitted that its employees used Halt but said that the disinfectant “was applied in a manner consistent with its label at all times and locations.” The company also wrote in its court filing that the gloves its employees used are chemically resistant and offered appropriate protection.

The GEO Group has had close ties to the Trump administration. Pam Bondi, Trump's attorney general, was a lobbyist for the company in 2019. The attorney general “is in full compliance with all ethical guidance,” a spokesperson for the Department of Justice said in an email.

The firm was the first corporation whose political action committee “maxed out” on contributions to Trump's presidential campaign. A subsidiary company, GEO Acquisition II, also gave $1 million to the pro-Trump PAC Make America Great Again. The GEO Group, its PAC and individuals affiliated with the company collectively contributed $3.7 million to candidates and political committees in the 2024 election cycle, compared with $2.7 million in 2020, according to OpenSecrets, an independent group that tracks money in politics. They donated overwhelmingly to Republicans: In every election cycle since 2016, at least 87% of their donations to federal candidates went to Republicans.

Data from the Federal Election Commission shows that George C. Zoley, the founder of the GEO Group, donated $50,000 in 2023 to a joint fundraising committee to support Republican efforts to maintain a majority in the House of Representatives. Zoley gave the maximum amount allowed for an individual per election at the time, $3,300, to Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson's primary and general election campaigns in 2024.

The GEO group regularly and liberally sprayed disinfectants in the ICE facility, according to both the EPA complaint and a separate civil suit filed on behalf of Adelanto detainees. The EPA complaint did not state whether employees were harmed by the pesticide; it accused the company of inappropriately handling the pesticide.

The separate lawsuit, filed by the Social Justice Legal Foundation, alleges that Adelanto detainees were sickened by the use of a different disinfectant product, HDQ Neutral, made by the same company. “Various Plaintiffs had nosebleeds or found blood in their mouth and saliva. Others had debilitating headaches or felt dizzy and lightheaded,” the lawsuit stated. “GEO staff sprayed when people were eating, and the chemical mist would fall on their food. GEO staff sprayed at night, on or around the bunk beds and cells where people slept. And on at least one occasion, GEO staff sprayed individuals as a disciplinary measure.”

That lawsuit is still pending. The allegations echo a warning letter the EPA previously sent the company accusing the GEO Group of improperly using HDQ Neutral. That letter cited complaints from detainees at Adelanto who suffered “difficulty breathing,” “lung pain” and skin rashes from the disinfectant. The pesticide was sprayed onto bedding and inside microwaves, the EPA said. The GEO Group has told reporters that it rejects allegations that it's using harmful chemicals, and that it follows the manufacturer's instructions. In a court filing, the company said any problems alleged by the EPA “were the result of the declared national emergency concerning COVID-19.” A judge ordered ICE to stop using HDQ Neutral in 2020. The GEO Group began using Halt “on or about” March 2022, according to the EPA complaint.

The results could be catastrophic, especially in states that have experienced unprecedented fires in recent years.

Early this June, smoke from early season Canadian wildfires, which had necessitated mass evacuations in several Canadian provinces, began wafting into the United States. It was a harbinger of what will likely be another dangerous and disruptive summer of fires across the United States and Canada.

Yet, while Canadian provinces such as Ontario have been boosting the resources they provide their firefighting services, the United States Forest Service, which includes the 10,000 personnel in the federal firefighting system, has fallen victim to indiscriminate “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) cuts since Donald Trump's inauguration.

In February, about 700 Forest Service employees, whose full-time work is other than firefighting but who are trained to join firefighting efforts in emergencies, were fired. Thousands of other Forest Service employees, as well as others in the parent department, the Department of Agriculture (USDA), were also placed on notice that they would be fired at some point over the coming months. Many more have disappeared from, or will soon disappear from, the government's payrolls, either through job losses or deferred resignation or early retirement, and many others have spent the past several months in limbo, as court battles play out as to whether or not they can be terminated. Absurdly, as fire season nears, many are still being paid but have been placed on administrative leave — meaning they are being paid not to work.

“In February, along with many thousands of other federal workers with less than a year in their positions, I was fired via a form letter which lacked details of my supposed ‘poor performance,'” one Forest Service employee in Colorado, who worked at building partnerships with community stakeholders to develop fire prevention strategies in western forests and grasslands, told Truthout, asking to remain anonymous due to fear of reprisal. “Since then, I was provisionally brought back to work, issued a pseudo-mea culpa, and finally told that pending litigation might invalidate previous court orders … meaning that I just might be fired again.”

Another Forest Service employee, who worked in communications and also asked to remain anonymous to avoid reprisal, recalled that on the afternoon of February 13, she had just wrapped up a meeting about how to coordinate a safety message as fire season approached, when her supervisor walked toward her and beckoned her to follow her into her office. “I knew right then,” she told Truthout. “I said, ‘Is it happening?' She said ‘Yes.' She didn't want to share too many words. From there, I went and filled out the paperwork and gave back my work laptop and cellphone. I was crying. Ten or so people got fired. There were lots of people crying at the supervisor's office. It was very traumatic — like a bomb had just gone off.”

The results of these indiscriminate firings, especially in western states that have experienced historically unprecedented fires in recent years, and, in consequence, huge disruptions in the insurance market, could be catastrophic. There are now less personnel available for controlled burns — meaning that conditions will be left to deteriorate until large blazes break out; there are fewer legal staff on hand, as a result of which the Forest Service will struggle to respond to lawsuits against fire management strategies; and there are fewer crews available to proactively search for fire outbreaks before they grow to dangerous proportions, as well as to tackle large fires once they do jump the fire lines.

In February, The New York Times reported that federal agencies were unable to hire thousands of firefighters as they normally do at the start of each fire season because of indiscriminate federal hiring freezes that were put in place immediately following Trump's inauguration. Many firefighters who had already been offered jobs had those offers rescinded.

In April, the White House extended the hiring freeze through mid-July, sending a note out to agency heads informing them: “No Federal civilian position that is presently vacant may be filled, and no new position may be created.” Last week, the Washington Post reported that the administration plans to wind FEMA down after this coming hurricane season and leave states to largely fend for themselves when disasters strike.

This starve-the-beast strategy is championed by Project 2025, and implemented by the Office of Management and Budget, as well as the DOGE commissars now presiding over key federal agencies and departments. It is shredding basic government function across the board, hitting everything from science research to services for people with mental illness.

Over the coming months, Americans will start directly experiencing the consequences of this financial squeeze. Some states have the resources to plug many of the gaps created by the rollback of federal services: For instance, California is making huge investments in firefighting this year, in particular in clearing materials from forest floors and in hardening up its urban infrastructure to make it harder for fires to spread within cities; and Colorado has set up a new multimillion-dollar wildfire mitigation program. But other states either don't have the resources or lack the political will to expand their own government infrastructure in the ways that are now needed.

In February, New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, along with several colleagues, sent a letter to the acting secretary of the USDA warning that blocking payments to fire prevention efforts that were already underway was “not only unlawful but also endangers our rural communities by removing a vital component of their economies and delaying critical work to mitigate the threat of wildfire.” More recently, officials in Kansas have warned of a near-total collapse of the state's wildfire fighting abilities in the face of huge federal cuts.

The cuts impact not only firefighting readiness but also the health and safety of firefighters, with programs designed to track firefighters' exposure to cancer-causing chemicals being cut back, and with workplace safety programs being either eliminated or massively reduced in scope.

Cumulatively, all of this means that, at the behest of the federal government, the United States is entering fire season with one hand tied behind its back. Ostensibly this is being done in the name of fiscal responsibility; in reality, it is anything but: A single fire that surges out of control, as did the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year, can result in tens of billions of dollars in damages. That hardly seems like a recipe for making America great again.

Dr. Zheng Zhi, a former Chinese military doctor currently living in exile in Canada, traveled to Taiwan for several screenings of the award-winning documentary “State Organs” from June 4 to 15, which features Zheng's eyewitness account as a resident doctor in a Chinese military hospital.

While at the General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region in the 1990s, the Chinese military, known as the People's Liberation Army, outlined a combat plan every year, he said at one screening event.

“Once a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, the greatest pressure for them will be on logistics support,” he said.

Millions of troops may be mobilized to the front line of the Taiwan Strait, including possibly 2 million to 3 million logistics personnel, he said.

He said that from the Chinese regime's view, “the most difficult part of the logistics to supply the front is the storage, refrigeration, and transportation of blood, as many soldiers will be bleeding or burned in combat,” and “blood supply will become the biggest pressure.”

The Chinese military solution was to put surrendered or captured Taiwanese soldiers in detention, draw their blood, and use it for wounded Chinese soldiers, according to Zheng.

He said they proposed to take skin from the Taiwanese soldiers and transplant it onto the Chinese soldiers who have burns.

So if Chinese Communist Party (CCP) attacks Taiwan and the Taiwanese military surrenders, “the first thing they might face is having their blood taken because a large blood supply is needed to sustain a war,” Zheng said.

He said that the Chinese military has developed modular blood processing equipment for blood testing and processing.

Using container trucks and airplanes, the blood could be quickly transported to the frontlines to “immediately set up a field hospital,” he added.

There are “no technical barriers,” Zheng told The Epoch Times. And with the advancement in technology and the growth of the organ harvesting industry in China, taking organs from Taiwanese soldiers is no longer a question of possibility, he said.

“It's only a matter of numbers.”

It's hard for someone in a normal country to grasp such a level of cruelty, he said, pointing out that “the CCP has no human moral baseline.”

The Taiwanese soldiers who surrender or are alive, he said, are considered by the Chinese regime as the “best organ and blood bank.”

“State Organs,” directed by Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Raymond Zhang, focuses on two families in search of their missing relatives amid a nationwide persecution of the faith in Falun Gong, which both disappeared individuals practiced.

He told The Epoch Times it pained him to think that he has friends who went to China for liver and heart transplants.

For all such detained Falun Gong practitioners in China, their organs are “state organs,” he said, adding that the regime is “killing on demand.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Israel's decision to attack Iran's nuclear program on June 12 might go down in history as the start of a significant regional war, and the inflection point that led Iran to finally acquire nuclear weapons. But the strikes might also be remembered as the first moment in decades in which the world no longer faced the risk of an Iranian bomb. For years, analysts have interrogated which outcome would be most likely—and have come away with very different predictions. Now, everyone will find out which forecast was correct.

It is still too soon to say what the outcome will be. It could take weeks before experts understand the full extent of the damage Israel has dealt, let alone if and how Tehran will recover. The attacks, after all, aren't even finished. But although it may not yet be possible to judge the long-term effects of Israel's strikes, analysts do know what to look for as they evaluate the results. Experts can, in other words, figure out what factors will determine whether the attacks were a success in denying Iran nuclear weapons capability.

Some of those factors are quantifiable. To stop or seriously slow Iran's ability to make a weapon, for instance, Israel's strikes had to deny Iran the material needed to fuel nuclear weapons. They needed to blow up equipment necessary for manufacturing weapons. And they had to at least partially rid Iran of the knowledge required to turn all its material into bombs. But the final factor is less palpable. To fully succeed, Israel's attack must also have convinced Iran to reconsider the viability of its nuclear weapons project.

Israel's attacks have thus far been successful in destroying many of the power stations, buildings, and infrastructure Iran needs for its nuclear program. Israel has also demonstrated the ability to attack targets in Iran largely at will. But success is by no means assured, given Iran's substantial investment in defensive fortifications, its commitment to the program, its redundant systems, and the intrinsic difficulty of Israel's task.

So far, the damage from Israel's attacks on Iran's facilities appears mixed. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran's most dangerous uranium enrichment site at Fordow has been attacked, but there is no confirmation that its defenses have been breached or that its couple of thousand centrifuges have been destroyed. There is also no indication that Israel has rendered unusable Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium. If that stockpile is still available, and if Iran's centrifuges still exist, Tehran may be able to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program in just weeks. It could, for example, ship its hoard of 60 percent enriched uranium to Fordow (or a secret site) for further enrichment, quickly giving it enough uranium to make a bomb.

But to actually build a nuclear weapon, Iran needs more than weapons-grade enriched uranium. It also needs processing equipment that can turn the uranium into metal, shape it into weapons components, and then build the weapon itself. Doing all that in the midst of war will be difficult, especially given the world's decades-long effort to deny Iran the necessary gear. Analysts also do not know how close Iran was to being able to produce a warhead for a missile, although intelligence agencies had assessed that it would take Iran months to do so.

Still, there is much about Iran's weapons program that experts do not know. Shortly before the strikes, for example, the International Atomic Energy Agency delivered a comprehensive report on the many outstanding questions related to Iran's nuclear program and especially its past weaponization work. Some of those questions focus on the location of equipment that would be useful for weapons production—equipment that Iran could potentially use now. Israeli intelligence operatives may know where this gear is stored, and they may have destroyed it last night (or will do so soon). It is foolish to underestimate Israeli intelligence in Iran, given all the operational successes it has had. But Iran is a big country, with lots of places for equipment to be hidden and used.

Iran also has a sizable corps of nuclear scientists and technicians, and it is not yet clear how many of them have been killed. Israel has assassinated Fereydoun Abbasi, the former head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and Mohammad Mehdi Tehranji, a physicist and the president of the Islamic Azad University in Tehran—as well as various military leaders. But these deaths, by themselves, will not be enough to derail Iran's nuclear enterprise. As long as the country retains a cadre of motivated, skilled, and trained technical operators, it will be able to move quickly toward nuclear weapons.

There is tremendous uncertainty about how much quantifiable damage Israel has done to Iran's nuclear program. But the more important question may be whether Israel's attack destroyed Iran's will to move forward.

At first, it might seem outlandish to think that Iran would respond to an Israeli attack with anything other than belligerence. But if the damage to Iran's nuclear program and military is greater than it seems, Tehran might look for off-ramps. Iran might also consider diplomacy as the damage continues to rise. Israel, after all, is not yet done, and its strikes may only become more devastating in the days ahead. The Israeli military has completely eviscerated Iran's air defenses, so it could attack ever more central government structures and regime officials. Israel could also take out parts of the Iranian oil and gas sector, which are essential to the country's economy. In the face of such damage, Tehran might opt to sue for peace, leading to an agreement that limits its nuclear program.

But it is reasonable to be skeptical that Iran will accept a deal at the barrel of a gun. Even if Iran did strike a bargain, the country might not faithfully implement it. Instead, the most likely outcome is that Iran continues to retaliate while trying to convince the rest of the world that Israel is a rogue actor, having used force just days before talks were to recommence between Tehran and Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to claim some credit for the attacks will also make arriving at a deal more difficult, even though his administration earlier sought to distance itself from the strikes.

Israel's attacks against Iran appear to have been tactically brilliant and well informed. But its ability to carry out sophisticated strikes was never really in doubt. Analysts knew that the Israeli military was supremely capable and had tricks up its sleeve. Instead, the question was always whether an Israeli-only attack—or even a joint U.S.-Israeli operation—could meaningfully forestall an Iranian dash for nuclear weapons. The world will soon know the answer.

Live Updates


            • Lawmaker killed: Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman — the top Democrat in the Minnesota House — and her husband were shot and killed early this morning in “what appears to be a politically motivated assassination,” according to Gov. Tim Walz.
    


            • Second targeted: Minnesota State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot by the same individual, Walz said. They have undergone surgery and are alive.
    


            • List found in suspect's car: What officials are calling a “manifesto” identifying “many lawmakers and other officials” was found when law enforcement searched the vehicle of the suspect wanted in the assassination of Hortman, according to police.
    


            • Manhunt underway: The suspect is at large, and a massive manhunt is underway, officials said at the news conference. The Brooklyn Park Police Department has issued a shelter-in-place order in a 3-mile radius of Edinburgh Golf Course, according to city officials.
    


            The Minnesota State Patrol posted a photo of “No Kings” flyers found inside the car of the suspect.
    


            State Patrol Col. Christina Bogojevic said earlier Saturday “there were some flyers that said ‘no kings' within the suspect's vehicle.”
    


            Officials are asking the public to not attend demonstrations planned throughout the state today out of an abundance of caution.
    


            Law enforcement found a hit list in the Minnesota suspect's car that contained nearly 70 names, a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN.
    


            The names included abortion providers, pro-abortion rights advocates, and lawmakers in Minnesota and other states, the official added. Law enforcement also found a Father's Day card addressed to the suspect in a bag full of ammunition, the official said.
    


            A second official briefed on the case echoed the targeting of abortion providers to CNN's Holmes Lybrand.
    


            Former President Joe Biden condemned the recent shootings targeting lawmakers in Minnesota on Saturday. A state representative and her husband were killed, and a state senator and his wife were also shot.
    


            Biden called on Americans to stand united against hate and extremism.
    


            He described the incident as a “heinous attack” that should never occur in the United States, underscoring the nation's foundational values of democracy.
    


            “We must give hate and extremism no safe harbor, and we must all unite against political violence as a nation,” the former president wrote in a post on X.



            Offering his and former First Lady Jill Biden's personal sympathies, Biden extended “strength” to victims affected by the tragedy.
    


            “Jill and I are sending strength to everyone affected by this senseless tragedy during an unimaginable time,” Biden concluded.
    


            Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the agency is monitoring the “horrific shooting” of state lawmakers in Minnesota after state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were shot and killed early this morning in what Gov. Tim Walz said “appears to be a politically motivated assassination.”
    


            “DHS is monitoring the horrific shooting of two Minnesota legislators in Brooklyn Park and Champlin,” Noem wrote in a post on X.
    


            The secretary added that the department is in contact with interagency partners and pledged to provide updates as more information becomes available.
    


                    “We are in communication with our interagency partners, and will share more information as soon as it becomes available. I am praying for the victims of this heinous attack and their families,” the statement read.
                





            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has assigned additional police resources to “check on the safety of public officials who may be at risk, and to actively participate in the manhunt,” for the suspect in the assasination of Minnesota Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, a statement from the mayor's office said.
    


            ”I am sickened by the assassination of Speaker Hortman and the attack on Senator Hoffman,” Frey said, noting that he has been in contact with our the Minneapolis Police Commissioner, chief and safety partners “all morning.”
    


            “Political violence is evil. It cannot be tolerated, and neither can those who condone it or make excuses for it,” Frey said.
    


            “The United States Capitol Police is aware of the violence targeting state lawmakers in Minnesota. We have been working with our federal, state and local partners. For safety reasons, we cannot provide specific details about our security posture,” the US Capitol Police said in a statement to CNN Saturday.
    


            Capitol Police are checking in with members of Congress to inform them that they were listed in the shooter's alleged manifesto, one source told CNN.
    


            Congressional leaders condemned political violence on Saturday after a Minnesota state representative and her husband were shot and killed early in the morning.
    


            “Such horrific political violence has no place in our society, and every leader must unequivocally condemn it. Our prayers are with the Hortman and Hoffman families as well as the people of Minnesota during this tragic time,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said in an X post.
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a post on X: “The targeted shootings of Minnesota Senator John Hoffman and State Rep. Melissa Hortman are deeply disturbing. Violence is never acceptable. Praying hard for the victims and all who have been affected.”
    


            “The ghastly targeted shootings of Sen. Hoffman and Rep. Hortman are not just horrific—they're acts of political extremism and an assault on our democracy itself. This is where hate and violent rhetoric lead. We must stand united against political violence in all forms—and bring those responsible to swift and full justice. My heart aches for the victims and their families,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in an X post.
    


            Their comments follow what Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said “appears to be a politically-motivated assassination.”
    


            Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were shot and killed during the incident. Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were also targeted by the same individual and each shot multiple times, Walz said.
    


            Both lawmakers are members of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party.
    


            Col. Christina Bogojevic with the Minnesota State Patrol has asked residents to not attend demonstration events planned throughout the state Saturday, citing safety concerns. 



                    “Given the targeted shootings of state law lawmakers that happened overnight, we are asking the public to not attend today's planned demonstrations across Minnesota out of an abundance of caution,” Bogojevic said during a news conference Saturday while adding that “there were some flyers that said, ‘no kings' within the suspect vehicle.”
                





Remember: More than 1,800 protests across all 50 states are planned through the “No Kings” movement, which organizers say seeks to reject “authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarization of our democracy.”
    


            Another official, Drew Evans, Superintendent, Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, Minnesota Department of Public Safety said part of the reason for asking the public not to participate in planned protests is due to the fact there's a “very active” manhunt underway.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he is “horrified” at the fatal shootings of Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the targeting of Minnesota State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife.
    


                    “Political violence has no place in our nation,” the South Dakota Republican said in an X post.
                





            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for unity “against political violence in all forms,” in a post on X following the politically motivated attacks on Minnesota lawmakers overnight.
    


                    “The ghastly targeted shootings of Sen. Hoffman and Rep. Hortman are not just horrific—they're acts of political extremism and an assault on our democracy itself,” the New York Democrat wrote. “This is where hate and violent rhetoric lead.”
                





            “We must stand united against political violence in all forms—and bring those responsible to swift and full justice. My heart aches for the victims and their families,” he added.
    


                    “I am heartbroken and horrified by the tragic loss of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were taken from us in an act of violence,” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar wrote in a post on X. “Melissa was a good friend and we started in politics at the same time and were always there for each other. She was a true public servant to the core, dedicating her life to serving Minnesotans with integrity and compassion. Melissa's legacy will endure, but today we grieve deeply. John's and my prayers are with their children, their loved ones, and all who are mourning this devastating loss.”
                





            Former Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, now the head of national gun violence prevention organization GIFFORDS, said in a statement that she is “devastated” about Hortman's death.
    


            “There will be more to say, but this much is clear: we must protect our democracy from those who try to destroy it with a gun,” added Giffords, who was one of 13 people wounded in an Arizona supermarket parking lot in 2011.
    


            What officials are calling a “manifesto” identifying “many lawmakers and other officials,” was found when law enforcement searched the vehicle of the suspect wanted in the assassination of Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley.
    


            “We immediately made alerts to the state, who took action on alerting them and providing security where necessary,” the chief said.
    


            Members of the Minnesota congressional delegation were named in the alleged manifesto, according to a law enforcement source.
    


            A “No Kings” event that was planned to take place in Northeast Minneapolis today has since been canceled because of a shelter-in-place order following the attacks on two Minnesota state lawmakers, according to organizers.
    


            A grassroots group called Indivisible Twin Cities said it's still holding a “No Kings”-related event — but the group now plans to gather outside of the state Capitol building.
    


                    “We think it's important to gather peacefully. In the face of this horror, we will mourn and mark our determination for a peaceful, just, democratic future,” the group said on social media. “Our leadership team is in touch with authorities at the Capitol and will share any updates.” 
                





More background: Millions of Americans are expected to attend “No Kings” protests across the country to denounce what organizers describe as President Donald Trump's authoritarian policies and “militarization of our democracy.” It comes on the same day Trump will preside over a military parade in Washington, DC.
    


            Local police have issued a shelter-in-place order amid an “active investigation” in the Minneapolis suburbs of Brooklyn Park and Champlin, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said at news conference this morning.
    


            The Brooklyn Park Police Department issued the order in a 3-mile radius of Edinburgh Golf Course Saturday morning, according to the City of Brooklyn Park.
    


            “We have thousands of people sheltered in place in the city of Brooklyn Park right now. We are in an extensive manhunt involving hundreds and hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams searching,” Bruley said.
    


            President Donald Trump has been briefed on the shootings in Minnesota that appear to have been “a targeted attack against state lawmakers,” the White House said Saturday.
    


            “I have been briefed on the terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota, which appears to be a targeted attack against State Lawmakers,” the president said in a statement released by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on X.



            Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI are leading the investigation, adding that anyone involved “will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
    


            “Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!” The statement continued.
    


            Law enforcement was first called around 2 a.m. local time on Saturday with reports that someone had shot Minnesota State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. Police responded to their home and provided life-saving measures before the couple was transported to the hospital, according to Drew Evans, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension superintendent.
    


            Around 3:35 a.m., another call came in when officers were proactively checking on Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman's home.
    


            When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived, they noticed that there was a police vehicle in the driveway with emergency lights on and what appeared to be a police officer at the door, coming out of the house, officials said. That individual immediately fired a weapon at them, Evans said, and an exchange of gunfire took place, during which the suspect was able to escape.
    


            The Brooklyn Park Police Department, along with other law enforcement agencies from the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety State Patrol and FBI, and BCA are now actively engaged in a manhunt for the suspect they believe is responsible for both shootings, Evans said.
    


                    “If somebody comes to the door and they knock on the door claiming to be a police officer, please do a couple things: One, call 911 and confirm that the officer belongs there. If they are a police officer, dispatch will be able to confirm that that person is police officer,” Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said, addressing the community.
                





            US Attorney General Pam Bondi said she is closely monitoring what appears to be a targeted attack against state lawmakers in Minnesota on Saturday and vowed swift and full prosecution for those responsible.
    


                    “I am closely monitoring developments in Minnesota after what appears to be a targeted attack against state lawmakers,” Bondi said in a post on X. “The FBI is on the ground investigating this case alongside state and local partners.”
                





            She also said the “horrific violence will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
    


            Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman, a mother of two, grew up in Spring Lake Park and Andover, according to a previous campaign page. She was elected to the state House of Representatives in 2004.
    


            The campaign page described her as “a lifelong resident of the northern suburbs, a mother, a volunteer, and a small business person.”
    


            The page also described her as a dedicated volunteer who balanced her law practice as well as teaching Sunday school at Saint Timothy Catholic Church in Blaine.
    


            Gov. Tim Walz today said she was a “formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota,” who “woke up every day determined to make this state a better place.”
    


            She was a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party.
    


            FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said the FBI is “fully engaged” on the ground in Minnesota after Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were shot and killed early this morning in “what appears to be a politically motivated assassination,” according to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.
    


            “The FBI is fully engaged on the ground in Minnesota and is working in collaboration with our local and state partners,” Bongino wrote in a post on X.
    


            The suspect is at large and a massive manhunt is underway, officials said at the news conference.
    


            Authorities are searching for a male wearing black body armor and a blue shirt who may have impersonated law enforcement, one law enforcement source told CNN.
    


            The FBI is assisting in the investigation.
    


            Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were shot and killed early Saturday morning in “what appears to be a politically motivated assassination,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said at a news conference.
    


            Minnesota State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also targeted by the same individual and each shot multiple times, Walz said. They have undergone surgery and are alive.
    


            “The Hoffmans are out of surgery at this time and receiving care, and we are cautiously optimally optimistic, they will survive this assassination attempt,” the governor said.
    


            Both lawmakers are members of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party.

Live Updates


            • Today's demonstrations: Millions of Americans are expected to attend “No Kings” protests across the country to denounce what organizers describe as President Donald Trump's authoritarian policies and “militarization of our democracy.” It comes on the same day Trump will preside over a military parade in Washington, DC.
    


            • Immigration unrest: Today's rallies have been amplified by a week of protests against ICE raids in Los Angeles and other major cities. Trump federalized California's National Guard and deployed Marines to the state in response to the unrest, sparking further outrage.
    


            • Trump's parade: The event is celebrating the 250th anniversary of the US Army — which coincides with the president's birthday — and is expected to feature the largest display of military might in the nation's capital in decades. A massive amount of hardware, including 28 Abrams tanks, will roll down Constitution Avenue this evening.
    


            After arriving from Seattle for a five-day trip in the nation's capital, Joseph Murphy said he was astounded at the amount of fencing that is gridlocking Washington, DC.
    


            “It's just miles and miles and miles and miles,” Murphy, 60, said sitting on a bench at the Army Birthday Festival on the National Mall Saturday afternoon. “I'd love to know who got that contract,” he quipped.
    


            Wearing a shirt that read “King-free since 1776,” Murphy said one of the reasons he came to DC was to take part in a “peaceful, silent protest” against the president and this weekend's festivities. In a crowd heavily represented by people wearing MAGA hats and t-shirts emblazoned with Trump's face, Murphy was one of a few who visibly opposed the president.
    


            While thousands of “No Kings” anti-Trump protests are expected across the country on Saturday, no large organized anti-Trump demonstrations are planned in DC to coincide with the festival and military parade planned later in the day.
    


            Protest organizers said that was intentional — partly a ploy to deny Trump a large crowd, and partly to minimize the risk of a confrontation in what today is a heavily militarized city. Trump warned last week that protests opposing the parade would be met with “very big force” — comments that did not distinguish between peaceful and violent demonstrations.
    


            Murphy, who said two of his military veteran sons support Trump, said the president is “leading this country, in my opinion, into some pretty scary times.” He doesn't plan to stay around for the parade later this afternoon.
    


            Stacy Bowman wore a T-shirt featuring a quote from Justice Sonia Sotomayor's stinging dissent against last year's Supreme Court decision that granted broad immunity to Trump: “A President should not be a King above the law.”
    


            But Bowman, 65, said she was at the festival to support the Army and honor its servicemembers — not necessarily to protest Trump. She said she wanted to show the scores of uniform soldiers participating in the festival that Democrats like her are loyal to them.
    


            In downtown Houston, scores of demonstrators gathered to express their frustration and outrage over President Donald Trump's military parade.
    


            The protests are organized under the banner of the “50501” movement – short for 50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement – which states “No Kings” is a “nationwide day of defiance” to reject authoritarianism and Trump's “made-for-TV display of dominance.”
    


            Protesters assembled to hear from speakers including Texas Rep. Sylvia Garcia before marching through the streets, chanting, “No justice, no peace, no fascists in our streets.”
    


            Among them was 89-year-old George Atkinson, a former high school government teacher, who affixed a sign to his walker that read, “The clothes have no emperor! He's all hat and no cattle!”
    


                    “I've been opposed to fascism all my life and I was a high school government teacher, and these people's kids would have failed my course, the people who support Trump,” Atkinson told CNN. “They don't understand anything about the fact that we all are kings and not him.”
                





            Protesters also condemned the recent increase in detentions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. One protester at the frontline of the march held a sign that read, “No child of God is illegal.”
    


            The “No Kings” protest movement is “really about everyday people coming together, standing up some for the first time, against authoritarian executive overreach,” according to Hannah Stauss, an organizer with the “50501” movement – short for 50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement.
    


            Stauss spoke with CNN at Bryant Park in Manhattan, where people began gathering Saturday afternoon despite the rain.
    


            “Donald Trump is going to roll tapes in the streets in DC in a display that he thinks looks powerful and strong, and we know that that's not what real power looks like,” she said, referring to the military parade taking place in Washington, DC, today.
    


                    “Real power looks like the thousands of people that are going to gather here in Bryant Park and stand up to their neighbors and for their communities.”
                


                    Hannah Strauss, 50501 organizer
                


            “And especially in light of what happens this morning, our communities deserve to be a place where everyone feels safe and we all begin holding our elected officials accountable,” Strauss said, adding that the No Kings movement is committed to “nonviolence and de-escalation.”
    


            A “No Kings” event that was planned to take place in Northeast Minneapolis today has since been canceled because of a shelter-in-place order following the attacks on two Minnesota state lawmakers, according to organizers.
    


            A grassroots group called Indivisible Twin Cities said it's still holding a “No Kings”-related event — but the group now plans to gather outside of the state Capitol building.
    


                    “We think it's important to gather peacefully. In the face of this horror, we will mourn and mark our determination for a peaceful, just, democratic future,” the group said on social media. “Our leadership team is in touch with authorities at the Capitol and will share any updates.” 
                





            Officials in the City of Los Angeles say local law enforcement are “on high alert” as thousands of demonstrators prepare to participate in “No Kings” protests in downtown Los Angeles, which has been at the center of tense immigration protests this week.
    


                    “What is happening today – the ‘No Kings' protest – was something that had been planned for months. It's not specific to LA,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a press briefing Saturday. “But given what has been happening over the last week, and not just in Los Angeles, but in cities throughout the country, that's added in a whole other layer of concern.”
                





            “Very few” arrests were made Friday during protests against raids by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Bass added.
    


            A curfew will be in place Saturday night to support operations, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell said. Officials with the LAPD, California Highway Patrol and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will be assisting with planned demonstrations today, he added.
    


            “Should the need arise, law enforcement officials will be on high alert for any and all threats to this city,” Bass said. “Those who commit violence are not doing so on behalf of immigrants, and make no mistake, we have zero tolerance for anyone who damages property or puts officers or people at risk.”
    


            The Army Birthday Festival began with a muggy start Saturday morning — with thousands of people converging on the National Mall to celebrate the branch's 250th anniversary as part of a precursor to this afternoon's military parade.
    


            After walking past a UH-1H Huey helicopter and underneath a large howitzer placed near one of the festival's entrances, civilians are given the opportunity to handle an assortment of unloaded military weaponry — including sniper rifles, light machine guns, carbines and grenade and rocket launchers.
    


            Soldiers are on hand to talk about the technical specifics for each weapon and demonstrate how to handle them. The festival also includes an obstacle course demonstration, vehicle exhibits and an area for children to practice flag football drills.
    


            The weather is overcast and humid, and Washington, DC, was placed under a flood watch through Saturday night. But President Donald Trump vowed in a Truth Social post earlier Saturday that the parade, scheduled to begin rolling down Constitution Avenue at 6:30 p.m., is “ON, RAIN OR SHINE.”
    


            A large crowd of demonstrators gathered Saturday morning at Liberty Plaza in front of the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, rallying ahead of a lineup of 13 scheduled speakers that includes activists and political leaders.
    


            “No kings in America!” the crowd chanted in unison while carrying American flags and signs, such as one that said, “Our vets did not fight for fascism.”
    


            Protesters voiced strong opposition to President Donald Trump's military parade in Washington, DC, criticizing it as a misuse of public funds.
    


                    “I absolutely do not agree with that. People are hungry. People are hurting. We need that money in other places,” Renee Hall-George, a social worker, told CNN.
                





            “How about funding education? How about feeding people? How about offering health care?”
    


            Lyn Stubbs, another social worker at the rally, said she believes the parade is a personal display meant to intimidate dissent.
    


            Stubbs said she feels like Trump is holding the parade simply to “make himself feel bigger and better” and to “threaten” people from speaking up.
    


            Kristin Crowe, lead organizer with the Indivisible Georgia Coalition, emphasized the core message behind the protest.
    


            “In America, we don't have kings, we don't have thrones, the power belongs to the people and the country belongs to the people,” Crowe said.
    


            The parade set to roll down Constitution Avenue in Washington, DC, today will amount to the largest display of military might in the nation's capital at least since 1991, when a parade of tanks, troops and missiles marked the end of the first Gulf War.
    


            President Donald Trump — who is also celebrating his 79th birthday today — is expected to attend in the evening.
    


            Trump is vowing a patriotic show unlike anything seen before.
    


            “We want to show off a little bit,” he told service members and their families this week.
    


Events: At 11 a.m. ET, the Army Birthday Festival will begin on the National Mall. Soldiers, Army astronauts, NFL representatives and Medal of Honor recipients will all be on hand, and people can watch military demonstrations and other activities, according to the Army.
    


            Trump will participate in the parade at 6:30 p.m. ET.
    


            The parade “will celebrate the Army's history and will feature Army equipment, flyovers and 6,700 Soldiers in uniforms from the past and the present. The day will end with an enlistment and reenlistment ceremony, a parachute demonstration by the Golden Knights and a fireworks display,” according to the Army.
    


The cost: Officials have estimated today's parade, which will flaunt 7 million pounds of machines and weaponry through the nation's capital, could cost up to $45 million.
    


Meanwhile: While the parade events will be going on at the Mall, a number of groups have announced plans to hold protests both in Washington, DC, and around the country.
    


            President Donald Trump said today's military parade in Washington, DC, will take place regardless of the weather.
    


                    “OUR GREAT MILITARY PARADE IS ON, RAIN OR SHINE. REMEMBER, A RAINY DAY PARADE BRINGS GOOD LUCK. I'LL SEE YOU ALL IN D.C.,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.
                





            Trump is commemorating the Army's 250th birthday by attending a military parade honoring the nation's troops. It also happens to fall on Trump's 79th birthday.
    


            “HAPPY FLAG DAY!” the president wrote in another social media post.
    


Weather forecast: High-resolution forecast models show a line of storms, likely containing lightning, moving into DC around 7 p.m. ET. The storms are expected to be scattered, but it currently appears more likely than not that a storm will pass through the capital between 6 and 9 p.m. ET, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller.
    


            In the early morning on Tuesday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents chased farmworkers through a field in Oxnard, California.
    


            Agents tackled and restrained workers amid rows of produce, as seen in video from CNN affiliate KABC.
    


                    “What I fear is that sometimes, out of necessity, we show up wherever there's work,” one farmworker with her face covered told KABC in Spanish. “With everything that is happening, it's a bit difficult for us.”
                





            ICE, racing to fulfill President Donald Trump's goal to increase deportations, has increasingly targeted work sites for immigration sweeps in recent weeks. The escalation is creating a chilling effect on the businesses that rely on immigrant labor, with some workers staying home out of fear.
    


            The United States agriculture, construction, health care and hospitality industries are powered by immigrant workers, both legal and undocumented.
    


            Undocumented immigrants make up 4 to 5% of the total US workforce, but 15 to 20% or more in industries such as crop production, food processing and construction, according to Goldman Sachs.
    


            United Farm Workers President Teresa Romero told CNN she's been getting calls from concerned workers across California. Despite the threat of deportation, migrant workers often can't afford to stay home, Romero said.
    


                    “They're terrified, but they have a family to support. They have a rent to pay, they have children to take to school, buy clothing and everything,” she said. “They have to tell their children what to do if they don't come home.”

            A nightly curfew that began Tuesday for parts of downtown Los Angeles will remain in effect through the weekend as authorities prepare for numerous large-scale protests, LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said at a news conference yesterday.
    


            Officials said those public events are expected to include demonstrators protesting against the Trump administration's immigration policies, as well as against the president's military parade tonight in Washington, DC.
    


            LA County Sheriff Robert Luna said local authorities were aware of at least 30 planned demonstrations that could require law enforcement resources.
    


            McDonnell said local law enforcement agencies were “fully prepared” to quell any potential violence in the days ahead, after a week of protests in the city that have at times turned violent and resulted in injuries to officers.
    


                    “We will not allow violence, vandalism, or threats to public safety to undermine the rights of those who are demonstrating lawfully,” the chief said.
                





            Statewide, authorities are aware of at least 200 planned weekend protests, according to California Highway Patrol Deputy Commissioner Ezery Beauchamp.
    


ATF probing fires: A specialized team of federal arson investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has been deployed to LA to investigate fires set during recent unrest, ATF said yesterday.
    


            The bureau said it was investigating blazes set to “several law enforcement and self-driving vehicles,” as well as damage to the LAPD headquarters.
    


            Video taken in downtown LA on Sunday showed some destruction at the headquarters and multiple Waymo vehicles set on fire.



            “The cause of these fires is quite obvious,” ATF Special Agent in Charge Kenneth Cooper said in a statement. “The task at hand now is to determine who is responsible.”
    


            Members of the California National Guard federalized by President Donald Trump have been pulled away from efforts to stop the flow of fentanyl at the US-Mexico border, Gov. Gavin Newson claimed in a social media post yesterday.
    


            Newsom's comments on X were in response to a post by White House adviser Stephen Miller regarding the administration's border security priorities.
    


            “You just pulled National Guard I placed at the border who were stopping fentanyl smuggling,” Newsom wrote. “Now they're twiddling their thumbs in LA.”
    


Remember: Trump federalized 4,000 members of the California National Guard against Newsom's will, with orders to protect federal buildings and personnel amid immigration protests in Los Angeles.
    


            On Wednesday, Newsom said Trump's deployment of guard troops to LA also threatened the state's ability to respond to wildfires.
    


            A group of roughly 60 individuals were arrested outside the US Capitol yesterday evening after breaching a police line of bike racks and moving toward steps leading to the Capitol Rotunda, according to the Capitol Police.
    


            The group, made up of veterans and military family members, planned a sit-in on the Capitol steps to protest President Donald Trump deploying the National Guard and active-duty Marines in Los Angeles, as well as a military parade today, according to a news release from organizers.
    


            A group of approximately 75 protesters were demonstrating peacefully at the Supreme Court, just across the street from the US Capitol, according to a statement from the Capitol Police. As the group was leaving the area, officers began establishing a perimeter of bike racks to keep the protesters away from the Capitol.
    


                    “A few people pushed the bike rack down and illegally crossed the police line while running towards the Rotunda Steps,” the Capitol Police said. “Our officers immediately blocked the group and began making arrests.”
                





            Police said: “All will be charged with unlawful demonstration and crossing a police line. Additional charges for some will include assault on a police officer and resisting arrest.”
    


            The protest was organized by two advocacy groups — About Face: Veterans Against the War and Veterans for Peace. The brief sit-in followed a rally and press conference, according to the organizers' news release.
    


            “We want a future where we invest in care for veterans, in health care, and in education, not where we spend $50 million on a parade,” said Brittany Ramos DeBarros, an Army combat veteran and organizing director of About Face: Veterans Against the War, in a statement.
    


            Millions of Americans are expected to attend protests today in what organizers predict will be the strongest display of opposition to President Donald Trump's administration since he took office in January.
    


            More than 2,000 demonstrations across all 50 states have been planned through the “No Kings” movement, which organizers say seeks to reject “authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarization of our democracy.”
    


            The mobilization is a direct response to Trump's military parade tonight celebrating the 250th anniversary of the US Army — which coincides with his 79th birthday.
    


            The Senate Armed Services Committee chairman said he would've advised against hosting a big military parade in Washington, DC — an unease with the event reflected by some of his fellow Senate Republicans.
    


                    “I would have recommended against the parade,” Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi told CNN when asked for his views on the event.
                





            Wicker, the chamber's top Republican with oversight of the military, said he would be out of town attending the Paris Air Show during the parade, which coincides with President Donald Trump's birthday.
    


            Most of the GOP senators surveyed by CNN this week said they did not plan to attend:
    


            • Senate Majority Leader John Thune won't be in DC for the parade. Asked about spending some $45 million on it at a time when many Republicans are demanding government austerity, he said: “There are a lot of people who believe that's a cause worth celebrating.”
    


            • An aide to Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso said that after being at the White House twice this week, the senator would be back in Wyoming celebrating the Army's 250th birthday and Flag Day with his constituents.
    


            • Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, Senate Foreign Relations chairman, said he would miss the parade. “Come on guys, we have lot of stuff to do. We have lots of parades in Washington,” he said.
    


            • Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas will also be at the air show in Paris, and Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma will be home celebrating his wedding anniversary, though he said he “would love to see it.”
    


            • Sens. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Josh Hawley of Missouri, John Curtis of Utah, John Kennedy of Louisianna and Chuck Grassley all won't be there.
    


            One Republican with whom CNN spoke — Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall — told reporters Thursday he plans to attend the parade.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","A protest over immigration broke out next to a Compton restaurant. The owner, an immigrant, offered help to both protesters and cops","https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/14/us/compton-restaurant-owner-support-ice-protests","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT","


            Elizabeth Mendoza watched nervously as demonstrators protesting President Donald Trump's immigration raids and policies clashed with police outside of her Compton restaurant, Restaurante Y Pupuseria La Ceiba.
    


            “It started with just a few people, then it started growing very quickly,” she told CNN in an interview translated from Spanish. 



            Mendoza, herself an immigrant from El Salvador, has gained notoriety after videos of her and her staff sheltering protesters and helping law enforcement agents in her Los Angeles County restaurant spread across social media.
    


            In the late afternoon hours on Saturday, June 7, the protest began to ramp up significantly as demonstrators and officers clashed right in front of her business. At one point, Mendoza recalled seeing the police push the protesters away from her storefront and deploying chemical irritants.
    


            “I don't know what happened with the tear gas they threw. It was so strong at one point that we all felt like we were suffocating,” Mendoza told CNN. “Then they came in. It wasn't something planned, it wasn't something I was thinking about, but it just happened,” she said.
    


            Inside the restaurant, video at 5:30 p.m. shows Mendoza and her employees getting water for LA County Sheriff's deputies, fanning their blinking, watering eyes and applying wet towels to their faces.
    


            An employee guided one of the officers toward the walk-in refrigerator at the back of the store after wiping off his face, surveillance video shows.
    


            In a video Mendoza uploaded to TikTok, three of her employees can be seen taking care of two officers: One employee holds a cloth to the face of an officer while another fans his face.
    


            “I looked for masks and gave them to different people … The only thing I managed to grab for some protesters were towels, towels we use to clean. And I told them to cover yourselves with this. And then they covered themselves,” Mendoza said. “I also offered them milk. I ran out of milk.”
    


            Clashes between protesters and law enforcement have resulted in hundreds of arrests in Los Angeles, and Trump invoked a rarely used law to federalize the National Guard over the objection of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom and local officials, which further inflamed the response.
    


            The Trump administration also mobilized 700 Marines to the Los Angeles area on Monday, though it is not yet clear when they will be deployed onto the streets to help with protests, according to a US Northern Command spokesperson.
    


            Mendoza said she never directed her staff to help the people suffering after the confrontation just outside the restaurant – they acted of their own accord.
    


            “I was at the door, just letting everyone in,” she said. “They just acted the way they felt they should have done to other people themselves.”
    


            Almost half of Los Angeles County's nearly 10 million residents are Latinos or Hispanics, according to US Census data. Over one-third of Angelenos are immigrants.
    


            Mendoza came to the United States without her family – “without a father, without a mother, without siblings,” she told CNN, and first found work at a restaurant.
    


            She opened her own restaurant 15 years ago and has since found her place in the community.
    


            “I was afraid something bad would happen and they would destroy my restaurant, which you hear about,” Mendoza said. “So I decided to stay there, and looking at that whole situation, thank God, I sympathize with many protesters. I live in the area, and I can practically tell you that I know several of them, and they are good people and are my clients.”
    


Millions of protesters are expected at ‘No Kings' rallies nationwide as President Trump's military parade takes place on his 79th birthday



            Multiple friends contacted Mendoza and urged her to close her restaurant for the day after seeing all of the chaos surrounding the protests in her neighborhood. Mendoza felt that she had to stay open to provide for her clients that had stayed with her “through the good and the bad.”
    


            “I have to take care of them and, above all, of my clients, who have always been with me through thick and thin, and who are my Latino people and people of any other race,” she said.
    


            While the restaurant workers' compassion has been praised by many, Mendoza said some have criticized her for helping both demonstrators and authorities.
    


            “I just want them to know that we did it as human beings,” she said. “I'm happy to have helped those people, just like I did with the people who were there for the protests.”
    


            Mendoza said the world could use more “empathy and humanity for all people,” and that as an immigrant, she wants people to know most immigrants who come to the United States do so to work hard and make a better life for themselves and others.
    


            “Sometimes we're treated like aliens; we're not like that. The fact that we're darker-skinned doesn't make us different,” she said.
    


            “We've all seen it as a wonderful country, and we've all seen a country with better opportunities for our lives. Yes, and maybe that's why we decided to come here, and maybe some of us haven't done it the right way. But in the same way, we've all come with a purpose, which is to work and put in the effort. And often, I think they don't realize that it's us Latinos who come to do the most difficult jobs.”
    


            More demonstrations are planned nationwide this week and weekend, when the military parade honoring the Army's 250th birthday is planned in Washington, DC.

            In travel news this week: the secret rules of British pubs, what it's like inside one of Asia's biggest fish markets, plus lasting love connections that began on trips to Italy and France.
    


            It was summer 2022 and California-based model Ambika Mathur was “feeling kind of stagnant” after breaking up with her partner and moving back in with her parents.
    


            The Netflix show, “Emily in Paris,” inspired her to set off on her own European adventure, which is how weeks later she found herself cat-sitting in Milan.
    


            Then, out of the blue, came an invite to a party on the Amalfi Coast. That's how she opened the door to an intriguing fellow guest.
    


            “He was glowing and glistening,” she says of the Italian man, “all tan and blue eyes.” Within days they were talking about marriage.
    


            Here's what happened next.



            There was an immediate attraction, too, when American Kerri Cunningham met Hugh Grant-haired Brit Dirk Stevens on a ferry to France in the summer of 1993. The problem was, they were only teenagers on vacation with their families.
    


            More than a quarter of a century after their teen romance had concluded and their lives were overtaken by marriage, bereavement and family ups and downs, they reunited in Ireland.
    


            “It felt like some divine intervention that we were there for each other,” says Kerri. Before she left for the airport to return to the States, Dirk asked her, “Maybe we can make this work?”



            British pubs have their own set of unwritten rules that it pays for international visitors to know.
    


            For example, flat-roofed pubs should be approached with caution, bags of crisps (not potato chips) must be split open on the table, and warning bells ring out twice at the end of the night.

            One chain of 800 British pubs requires further introduction for outsiders. Wetherspoon pubs are a cult-like institution in the UK,  both among admirers, who love the real ale and “pub grub” sold at incredibly low prices, and detractors, who see them as everything that's wrong with the country at large.
    


            Here's the astounding story of the “Spoons” empire.
    


            At the other end of the scale, and on the northern edge of the island, Scotland's “ghost” whisky distilleries are coming back to life. The reborn Port Ellen distillery on the Isle of Islay offers a luxury visitor experience, which includes, surprisingly, Chinese tea service.
    


            California man Cameron Mofid has struggled with obsessive compulsive disorder since childhood, but the one thing that's helped him cope is traveling the world.
    


            Earlier this year, he became one of a handful of people in the world to have visited all 195 UN-recognized countries and territories.
    


            “Visiting every country wasn't just about geography,” he tells CNN. “It was about learning how to live with uncertainty, find calm in discomfort, and connect with people from every walk of life.”
    


            Music is the message for Danny Kean, who has been traversing North America for 20 years, improvising on a piano in the back of his pickup. On each of his outings, he invites passersby to tickle the ivory for themselves.
    


            “I love the idea of strangers becoming less afraid of each other,” he says. “This love for humanity drives me to keep doing good.”
    


            Writer Kim Davis lost 10 years of her life to illness, injury and personal tragedies, which spurred her to seize the moment and set off to travel the world for a year.
    


            Packing, of course, was a meticulous business. She told our partners at CNN Underscored, a product reviews and recommendations guide owned by CNN, what she's brought with her.

            The Oklahoma City Thunder turned the tables on the Indiana Pacers on Friday, getting a come-from-behind victory with a spectacular fourth quarter to even up the NBA Finals two games apiece.
    


            The Thunder's 111-104 win tightens the NBA Finals into a best-of-three series in which Oklahoma City has home-court advantage.
    


            The Pacers had made it a habit of climbing back into games during these playoffs with grating defense, clutch offense and their opponents increasingly pressing as they drew ever closer. On Friday, the Thunder expertly played that role, chipping away at a 10-point third quarter deficit until it took the lead with just minutes to go in the game.
    


            The series shifts back to Oklahoma City on Monday with Game 5 set for 8:30 p.m. ET.
    


            Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 15 points in the final stretch of the game to help push his team to victory, finishing with 35 points as he continued his brilliant NBA Finals. He said the Thunder came out with an urgency on Friday.
    


            “We knew it when we woke up this morning,” he told the ABC broadcast. “(Being down) 3-1 is a lot different than 2-2 going back home. We played with desperation to end the game. That's why we won. We got to try to maintain the same desperation going into Game 5, Game 6, whatever it may be.”
    


            Both teams have now won on the other's home floor and have proven that they can win tight games. The series is shaping up to be a classic as both teams refuse to back down and are incredibly evenly matched – as evidenced by a tight first half.
    


            The first half was higher scoring than the first three games of the series as the teams combined for 117 points, the Pacers taking a 60-57 lead into the break.
    


            Aside from a brief period in the first half of the first quarter, the game stayed tight throughout the opening stages. The Thunder grabbed the lead midway through the second and held on until the Pacers made a run just before the end of the second quarter to take the lead.
    


            Jalen Williams led the Thunder in scoring through the first 24 minutes with 16 points as MVP Gilgeous-Alexander took an uncharacteristic number of breaks in the first half. SGA contributed 12 but had zero assists as the Pacers defense tried to limit the Thunder's star however it could.
    


            Indiana's attack was much more balanced. Pascal Siakam contributed 16 first half points but seven of the other eight Pacers players who entered the game scored at least five points.
    


            A 9-2 run in the third quarter by the Pacers opened up a seven-point lead, the biggest since they led by nine in the early stages of the first quarter. Siakam continued his dominant play with a 25-foot 3-pointer that brought the Indianapolis crowd to their feet and forced the Thunder into taking a timeout to kill the run before it got out of hand.
    


            The timeout worked and the Thunder quickly cut the lead to four as Gilgeous-Alexander scored his 20th point on a pull-up jumper. An offensive foul by the Pacers allowed Oklahoma City to slice into the lead further as the home crowd and Pacers players grew frustrated at the officials.
    


            But Obi Toppin eased those hurt feelings with back-to-back threes that rebuilt the Pacers lead to eight. Toppin's solid effort off the bench got the Indiana crowd hyped and his dunk with two minutes to go gave the Pacers a 10-point lead, their biggest of the night. The Thunder narrowed that lead to seven heading into the fourth quarter.
    


            Oklahoma City charged in the opening minutes of the fourth to once again narrow the Pacers lead down to three, forcing Indiana head coach Rick Carlisle to call timeout.
    


            But much like the Pacers have done multiple times in these Finals, the Thunder refused to go away and continued their charge to tie the game with about eight minutes to go. Indiana has loved to play in close games throughout these playoffs, but in the Finals, they had been the ones making the late-game charge rather than fending one off.
    


            The teams began trading big-time, tough layups as the game entered a punch, counterpunch rhythm down the stretch. Tyrese Haliburton woke up in the final quarter, dropping eight in the fourth quarter. Not to be outdone, Gilgeous-Alexander had a few clutch shots of his own, including the jumper with 2:21 to go that put OKC in the lead for the first time in the second half.
    


            “It's a dog fight every time we step on the floor. On both ends of the floor, they make you work. And we like to make teams work. So, whoever imposes their will the best this series will come out on top and that's our goal,” Gilgeous-Alexander said after the game.
    


            The Pacers couldn't get a shot to fall as the Thunder held onto their lead coming into the final minute. Gilgeous-Alexander's twisting drive and leaning jump shot with .3 seconds left on the shot clock resulted in a foul on Aaron Nesmith, giving the MVP a chance to make it a two-possession game with 44 seconds to play. Nesmith fouled out on the play.
    


            SGA sunk both shots and it was 107-103 in favor of the Thunder. The Pacers couldn't get a decent shot on the ensuing possession with Myles Turner barely grazing the rim with a 3-point attempt. Bennedict Mathurin was fouled on the ensuing rebound; he missed both free throws and Oklahoma City's Chet Holmgren grabbed the rebound.
    


            The Thunder had a chance to put the game on ice out of the stoppage. Mathurin was called for a foul before the ball could be put into play and Gilgeous-Alexander drilled the free throw to make it 108-103, and the Thunder got the ball back. But the pressing Pacers defense forced a turnover on the inbounds play, and Mathurin drew another foul on the ensuing scramble.
    


            But once again, Mathurin had trouble at the free throw line, splitting the two shots to make it a four-point game with 19 seconds to go. Mathurin committed yet another foul on the ensuing inbounds play, allowing Gilgeous-Alexander to hit another free throw to make it 109-104 and the Thunder got the ball back again.
    


            Gilgeous-Alexander drew one final foul and, as he always does, hit his free throws to give the game its final score. The Pacers had one final heave that clanked off the iron as the Thunder celebrated a massive victory.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — At least 20 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip overnight and into Saturday, according to local health officials. The 20-month war with Hamas has raged on even as Israel has opened a new front with heavy strikes on Iran that sparked retaliatory drone and missile attacks.

Another 11 Palestinians were killed overnight near food distribution points run by an Israeli- and U.S.-supported humanitarian group in the latest of almost daily shootings near the sites since they opened last month. Palestinian witnesses say Israeli forces have fired on the crowds, while the military says it has only fired warning shots near people it describes as suspects who approached its forces.

The sites are located in military zones that are off limits to independent media. Israel's military said it fired warning shots overnight to distance a group of people near troops operating in the Netzarim corridor, and an aircraft struck a person who kept advancing.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a private contractor that operates the sites, said they were closed Saturday. But witnesses said thousands had gathered near the sites anyway, desperate for food as Israel's blockade and military campaign have driven the territory to the brink of famine.

Al-Awda Hospital said it received eight bodies and at least 125 wounded people from a shooting near a GHF site in central Gaza.




Mohamed Abu Hussein, a resident of the built-up Bureij refugee camp nearby, said Israeli forces opened fire toward the crowd about a kilometer (half-mile) from the food distribution point. He said he saw several people fall to the ground as thousands ran away.

In the southern city of Khan Younis, Nasser Hospital said it received 16 dead, including five women, from multiple Israeli strikes late Friday and early Saturday. It said another three men were killed near two GHF aid sites in the southernmost city of Rafah, now a mostly uninhabited military zone. Israel's military said it was unaware of any gunfire there during that time overnight.

An Israeli strike in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, killed four people, Al-Aqsa Hospital said.

Meanwhile, Israel's military said two projectiles came from Gaza and fell in open areas, with no injuries.

Israel and the United States say the new aid system is intended to replace a U.N.-run network that has distributed aid across Gaza through 20 months of war. They accuse Hamas of siphoning off the aid and reselling it to fund its militant activities.

U.N. officials deny Hamas has diverted significant amounts of aid and say the new system is unable to meet mounting needs. They say the new system has militarized aid by allowing Israel to decide who has access and by forcing Palestinians to travel long distances or relocate again after waves of displacement.

They say the U.N. has struggled to deliver aid even after Israel eased its blockade last month because of military restrictions and rising lawlessness.

Hamas, which is allied with Iran, sparked the war when its fighters led a rampage into southrn Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. They still hold 53 hostages, less than half of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed over 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which has said women and children make up more than half of the dead but does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in count.

The offensive has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of the population of some 2 million Palestinians, leaving them almost entirely reliant on international aid.

The war has drawn in Iran and its other allies across the region, igniting a chain of events that led to Israel's major strikes on Iran's nuclear and military facilities on Friday.

Watch live coverage of the U.S. military parade in Washington, D.C. The parade commemorates the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, which coincides with President Donald Trump's 79th birthday.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Demonstrators crowded into streets, parks and plazas across the U.S. Saturday to rally against President Donald Trump as officials urged calm and mobilized National Guard troops ahead a military parade to mark the Army's 250th anniversary that coincides with the president's birthday.

Atlanta's 5,000-capacity “No Kings” rally quickly reached its limit, with thousands more demonstrators outside the barrier to hear speakers in front of the state Capitol.

Intermittent light rain fell as sign-carrying marchers gathered for the flagship rally in Philadelphia's Love Park, and shouted “Whose streets? Our streets!” as they marched down Ben Franklin Parkway to the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Karen Van Trieste, a 61-year-old nurse who drove up from Maryland, said she grew up in Philadelphia and wanted to be with a large group of people showing her support. 

“I just feel like we need to defend our democracy,” she said. She is concerned about the Trump administration's layoffs of staff at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the fate of immigrant communities and the Trump administration trying to rule by executive order, she said.




In some places, organizers handed out little American flags while other demonstrators brought larger versions to wave amid signs that ranged from pro-democracy and immigrant-rights messages to a variety of anti-Trump sentiments.

In Charlotte, North Carolina, crowds cheered anti-Trump speakers in the city's First Ward Park and chanted “we have no kings” before marching behind a “No Kings” banner. 

In Los Angeles, people gathered in front of City Hall as a drum circle began and marchers in downtown Little Rock walked across a bridge over the Arkansas River.

Protests were planned in nearly 2,000 locations across the country, from city blocks and small towns to courthouse steps and community parks, organizers said, but no events are scheduled in Washington, D.C., where the military parade will take place in the evening.

The 50501 Movement orchestrating the protests says it picked the “No Kings” name to support democracy and speak out against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration.The name 50501 stands for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement. 

The demonstrations come on the heels of protests that flared up across the country over federal immigration enforcement raids that began last week and Trump ordering the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, where protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire. 

Thousands gathered in downtown Love Park, with organizers handing out small American flags and many people carrying protest signs saying things like “fight oligarchy” and “deport the mini-Mussolinis” as they waited for the march to start.

Some signs bore immigrant-rights messages, including “The wrong ice is melting” and “Unmask ice.”

A woman wearing a foam Statue of Liberty crown brought a speaker system and led an anti-Trump sing-along, changing the words “young man” in the song “Y.M.C.A.” to “con man.”

One man in Revolutionary War era garb and a tricorn hat held a sign with a quote often attributed to Thomas Jefferson: “All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent.”

Gov. Tim Walz took to social media to issue a warning to demonstrators as police worked to track down a suspect in the shootings of two Democratic legislators and their spouses in Minnesota.

“Out of an abundance of caution my Department of Public Safety is recommending that people do not attend any political rallies today in Minnesota until the suspect is apprehended,” he wrote.

About a thousand people gathered on the grounds of Florida's old Capitol in Tallahassee, where protesters chanted, “This is what community looks like,” and carried signs with messages like “one nation under distress” and “dissent is patriotic.”

Organizers of the rally explicitly told the crowd to avoid any conflicts with counterprotesters and to take care not to jaywalk or disrupt traffic.

Organizers say that one march will go to the gates of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis warned demonstrators that the “line is very clear” between peaceful demonstration and violence, and not to cross it.

Governors and city officials vowed to protect the right to protest and to show no tolerance for violence.

Republican governors in Virginia, Texas, Nebraska and Missouri were mobilizing National Guard troops to help law enforcement manage demonstrations.

There will be “zero tolerance” for violence, destruction or disrupting traffic, and “if you violate the law, you're going to be arrested,” Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin told reporters Friday. 

In Missouri, Gov. Mike Kehoe issued a similar message, vowing to take a proactive approach and not to “wait for chaos to ensue.”

Some law enforcement agencies announced they were ramping up efforts for the weekend. In California, state troopers were on “tactical alert,” which means all days off are canceled for all officers, while West Virginia's governor put the state police and National Guard on standby.

On social media, Washington state Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, called for peaceful protests over the weekend, to ensure Trump doesn't send military to the state. 

“Donald Trump wants to be able to say that we cannot handle our own public safety in Washington state,” Ferguson said.

In a statement Friday, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, urged protesters “to remain peaceful and calm as they exercise their First Amendment right to make their voices heard.”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Marines have moved into Los Angeles to guard a federal building after a week of protests against immigration raids, while communities across the country are preparing for demonstrations against President Donald Trump's polices this weekend.

The Marines wearing combat gear and carrying rifles are taking over some posts from National Guard members who were deployed to the city after the protests erupted last week. Those protests sparked dozens more over several days around the country, with some leading to clashes with police and hundreds of arrests.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called the troop deployment a “serious breach of state sovereignty” and a power grab by Trump, and he has gone to court to stop it. The president has cited a legal provision that allows him to mobilize federal service members when there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Shortly after they began guarding a Los Angeles federal building Friday, U.S. Marines detained a man who had walked onto the property and did not immediately hear their commands to stop. 

The brief detention marked the first time federal troops have detained a civilian since they were deployed to the nation's second-largest city by President Donald Trump in response to protests over the administration's immigration arrests. The Marines were activated earlier this week but began their duties Friday.

The man, Marcos Leao, was later released without charges and said the Marines were just doing their jobs. 

A U.S. Army North spokesperson said the troops have the authority to temporarily detain people under specific circumstances. He said those detentions end when the person can be transferred to “appropriate civilian law enforcement personnel.”

Leao's detention shows how the troops' deployment is putting them closer to carrying out law enforcement actions. Already, National Guard soldiers have been providing security on raids as Trump has promised as part of his immigration crackdown.

Leao, a former Army combat engineer, said he was rushing to get to a Veterans Affairs appointment when he stepped past a piece of caution tape outside the federal building. He looked up to find a Marine sprinting toward him. 

“I had my headphones in, so I didn't hear them,” Leao said. “They told me to get down on the ground. I basically complied with everything they were saying.”




Leao was placed in zip ties and held for more than two hours by the Marines and members of the National Guard, he said. After Los Angeles police arrived, he was released without charges, he said. A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department said they responded to a call at the scene but weren't needed, and no charges were filed.

“I didn't know it was going to be this intense here,” he said later.

A U.S. official told the AP that a civilian had stepped over the line. He was warned they would take him down and they did, according to the official, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.

About 200 Marines out of the 700 deployed arrived in the city Friday, joining 2,000 members of the National Guard that have been stationed outside federal buildings this week in Los Angeles. Another 2,000 Guard members were notified of deployment earlier this week.

Before the unusual deployment, the Pentagon scrambled to establish rules to guide U.S. Marines who could be faced with the rare and difficult prospect of using force against citizens on American soil.

The forces have been trained in de-escalation, crowd control and standing rules for the use of force, the military has said.

But the use of the active-duty forces still raises difficult questions.

“I believe that this is an inevitable precursor of things yet to come when you put troops with guns right next to civilians who are doing whatever they do,” said Gary Solis, a former Marine Corps prosecutor and military judge.

He said it's an example of Trump's attempt to unravel the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars active-duty forces from conducting law enforcement.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration this week provided deportation officials with personal data -- including the immigration status -- on millions of Medicaid enrollees, a move that could make it easier to locate people as part of his sweeping immigration crackdown.

An internal memo and emails obtained by The Associated Press show that Medicaid officials unsuccessfully sought to block the data transfer, citing legal and ethical concerns. 

Nevertheless, two top advisers to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered the dataset handed over to the Department of Homeland Security, the emails show. Officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were given just 54 minutes on Tuesday to comply with the directive.

The dataset includes the information of people living in California, Illinois, Washington state and Washington, D.C., all of which allow non-U. S. citizens to enroll in Medicaid programs that pay for their expenses using only state taxpayer dollars. CMS transferred the information just as the Trump administration was ramping up its enforcement efforts in Southern California. 

Besides helping authorities locate migrants, experts said, the government could also use the information to scuttle the hopes of migrants seeking green cards, permanent residency or citizenship if they had ever obtained Medicaid benefits funded by the federal government. 

California Gov. Gavin Newsom 's office said in a statement that it was concerned about how deportation officials might utilize the data, especially as federal authorities conduct immigration raids with the assistance of National Guard troops and Marines in Los Angeles.




“We deeply value the privacy of all Californians,” the statement said. “This potential data transfer brought to our attention by the AP is extremely concerning, and if true, potentially unlawful, particularly given numerous headlines highlighting potential improper federal use of personal information and federal actions to target the personal information of Americans.” 

Some California lawmakers on Friday also expressed alarm. U.S. Rep. Laura Friedman, a Democrat, wrote on X that “we should never use a person's need to go to the doctor against them. This will only lead to more chaos and pain in our communities.”

U.S. Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the data sharing was legal. He declined to answer questions about why the data was shared with DHS and how it would be used.

“With respect to the recent data sharing between CMS and DHS, HHS acted entirely within its legal authority — and in full compliance with all applicable laws — to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them,” Nixon said. 

An official with DHS, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement that Trump “promised to protect Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. To keep that promise after Joe Biden flooded our country with tens of millions of illegal aliens CMS and DHS are exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans.”

The initiative appears to be part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to provide DHS with more data on migrants. In May, for example, a federal judge refused to block the Internal Revenue Service from sharing immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help agents locate and detain people living without legal status in the U.S.

CMS announced late last month that it was reviewing some state's Medicaid enrollees to ensure federal funds have not been used to pay for coverage for people with “unsatisfactory immigration status.” In a letter sent to state Medicaid officials, CMS said that the effort was part of Trump's Feb. 19 executive order titled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders.” 

As part of the review, California, Washington and Illinois shared details about non-U. S. citizens who have enrolled in their state's Medicaid program, according to a June 6 memo signed by Medicaid Deputy Director Sara Vitolo that was obtained by the AP. The memo was written by several CMS officials under Vitolo's supervision, according to sources familiar with the process.

The data includes addresses, names, social security numbers and claims data for enrollees in those states, according to the memo and two people familiar with what the states sent to CMS and what was shared with DHS. Both individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share details about the data exchange.

CMS officials attempted to fight the data sharing request from Homeland Security, saying that to do so would violate federal laws, including the Social Security Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, according to Vitolo's memo. 

“Multiple federal statutory and regulatory authorities do not permit CMS to share this information with entities outside of CMS,” Vitolo wrote, further explaining that the sharing of such personal data is only allowed for directly administering the Medicaid program. 

Sharing information about Medicaid applicants or enrollees with DHS officials would violate a “long-standing policy,” wrote Vitolo, a career employee, to Trump appointee Kim Brandt, deputy administrator and chief operating officer of CMS.

Vitolo and Brandt could not be reached for comment.

The legal arguments outlined in the memo were not persuasive to Trump appointees at HHS, which oversees the Medicaid agency.

Four days after the memo was sent, on June 10, HHS officials directed the transfer of “the data to DHS by 5:30 ET today,” according to email exchanges obtained by AP.

Former government officials said the move was unusual because CMS, which has access to personal health data for nearly half the country, does not typically share such sensitive information with other departments. 

“DHS has no role in anything related to Medicaid,” said Jeffrey Grant, a former career employee at CMS. 

Beyond her legal arguments, Vitolo said sharing the information with DHS could have a chilling effect on states, perhaps prompting them to withhold information. States, she added needed to guard against the “legal risk” they were taking by giving federal officials data that could be shared with deportation officials. 

All states must legally provide emergency Medicaid services to non-U. S. citizens, including to those who are lawfully present but have not yet met a five-year wait to apply for Medicaid. 

Seven states, along with the District, allow immigrants who are not living legally in the country to enroll — with full benefits — in their state's Medicaid program. The states launched these programs during the Biden administration and said they would not bill the federal government to cover those immigrants' health care costs. 

The Trump administration has raised doubts about that pledge. 

Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, said that the state's Medicaid programs for immigrants “opened the floodgates for illegal immigrants to exploit Medicaid — and forced hardworking Americans to foot the bill.” 

All of the states — California, New York, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Minnesota and Colorado — have Democratic governors. Due to his state's budget woes, Newsom announced earlier this year he would freeze enrollment into the program; Illinois will also shut down its program for roughly 30,000 non-U. S. citizens in July. 

The remaining states — New York, Oregon, Minnesota and Colorado — have not yet submitted the identifiable data to CMS as part of the review, according to a public health official who has reviewed CMS' requests to the states. 

Illinois health officials also said they were “deeply concerned” by the AP's findings that revealed their state's Medicaid customer information was shared with federal agencies outside of CMS, given that their “understanding (is) that the data is protected under the federal Privacy Act of 1974 and other federal regulations — which protects the rights of Americans' sensitive health and personal data.”

In a statement issued after publication of AP's story, California's Newsom said the decision to share the data “will jeopardize the safety, health, and security of those who will undoubtedly be targeted by this abuse.”

State health officials from the District and Washington did not respond to requests for comment.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon discusses the Trump administration's actions on transgender athletes in women's sports on ‘The Faulkner Focus.'

EXCLUSIVE: More than two months have passed since women's fencer Stephanie Turner went viral after being punished by USA Fencing for kneeling in protest of a trans opponent. 

And after nine weeks of immense public and federal scrutiny against USA Fencing in the aftermath of the incident, the organization amended two of its most controversial policies last weekend.

The organization's board of directors changed its rule to de-prioritized states with laws deemed ""harmful"" to the LGBTQ population and a rule that did not guarantee the national anthem be played before every event. 

Turner reacted to USA Fencing's recent policy changes in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital. 

""USA Fencing has fallen into the hands of unpatriotic tyrants who put obscure politics ahead of promoting the sport across the country. Whether to play the national anthem or not should have never been in question. And excluding states from the national tournament selection process because of their abortion and LGBT policies is ludicrous and has nothing to do with fencing,"" Turner said. 

""It makes me wonder if these policies were put into place to punish conservatives and red states. There needs to be a shakeup in USA Fencing's leadership and an audit of their social media and online platforms.""

WHO IS STEPHANIE TURNER? WOMEN'S FENCER WHO KNELT TO PROTEST TRANS OPPONENT AND IGNITED GLOBAL AWARENESS

(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)

Turner stepped away from competing in USA Fencing after receiving a 12-month probation for refusing to face trans athlete Redmond Sullivan at the Cherry Blossom Open in Maryland in late March. 

But the fallout of the controversy had an impact on the organization and its policies right away.

USA Fencing announced in late April that it is preparing to change its gender-eligibility policy. The proposed updated policy ensures that the women's category ""will be open exclusively to athletes of the female sex."" The men's category ""will be open to all other athletes who are otherwise eligible for competition.""

However, that new policy has not been officially put in place. 

The incident involving Turner also prompted a Title IX investigation by President Donald Trump's administration and a congressional hearing in May. 

USA Fencing Chair Damien Lehfeldt was grilled by Republican lawmakers at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Subcommittee's ""Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" hearing on May 7. 

After the hearing, Turner told Fox News Digital that she would devote herself and her platform to pushing for resignations among key leadership figures in USA Fencing. 

""I'm going to be pushing for people to resign, to be honest. I'd like to see some people resign for the comments that they've made, especially publicly, ones that are harassing and meant to humiliate concerned women, mothers and daughters,"" Turner said. 

The organization's policy of prioritizing states with pro-LGBTQ laws was a particular point of scrutiny during the hearing by DOGE Subcommittee Chairwoman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.

""In selecting sites for its national fencing events, for instance, the board policy is to avoid states whose laws and policies on LGBTQ rights and abortion it opposes. It uses ‘Equality Maps' to determine which states to blacklist from its competitions, and which to favor,"" Greene said. ""This ends up favoring a lot of blue states and harming a lot of red ones. So, it creates politically determined winners and losers — but it has absolutely nothing to do with fencing."" 

The previous host site policy placed a number of states on the ""do not allow"" list were Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas. 

The states on its ""avoid where possible"" list included Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Utah, West Virginia, Wyoming, Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia.

The organization now claims it will have events in several of those states over the next year. 

""We merged several overlapping documents into one policy that scores every bid — regardless of state — on cost, safety, and travel convenience. Using this rubric, next season's national events will span nine states including Texas, Missouri, Florida, Utah, Ohio, Virginia, Oregon, Tennessee and Nevada,"" read a statement to Fox News Digital.

USA Fencing has also provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the new anthem policy. 

""The anthem has always been played at the start of every national tournament. The Board simply wrote that long‑standing practice into policy and added that it will also be played on any U.S. holiday that occurs during an event, such as Independence Day, which falls during our upcoming Summer Nationals,"" the statement read.

Sgt. Matthew Fagiana discussed security measures and how local and federal law enforcement officers are keeping the public safe on No Kings Day protests across the U.S. 

Thousands of people are expected to rally in hundreds of cities across America on Saturday to protest the Trump administration and counter the president's military parade in Washington, D.C. to mark the Army's 250th birthday. Today is also Flag Day, which commemorates the adoption of the U.S. flag on June 14, 1777.

The counter-protesters are framing their demonstrations under the slogan ""No Kings,"" describing it as a ""day of defiance"" against Trump and his allies while other have been calling for the president to be ""dethroned.""

FLORIDA SHERIFF FIRES OFF BLUNT MESSAGE TO VIOLENT ANTI-TRUMP PROTESTERS: 'WE WILL KILL YOU GRAVEYARD DEAD'

They say they are defending democracy and are opposed to what they see as Trump's authoritarian rule. 

One of their key issues is Trump's mass deportation programs, which they oppose. Last week, protests against Trump's immigration crackdown turned violent in Los Angeles, with Trump calling in the National Guard to quell the chaos.

Trump will be in the nation's capital to watch the parade, which will feature around 6,600 troops and 150 military vehicles, along with historical reenactments and performances by military bands. Trump wants the parade to demonstrate American military strength and patriotism.

Several overlapping organizations are organizing the rallies, including Indivisible, a progressive group formed in 2016 I the wake of Trump's first election win, the American Civil Liberties Union, and 50501, a group formed earlier this year in response to President Trump's second administration. The name 50501 stands for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement.

505051 has organized several protests this year, including the April 5 ""Hands Off"" protests, encapsulated a broad range of grievances against the Trump administration, including healthcare and civil liberties concerns.

Demonstrators are trying to portray President Trump as a king who rules with unchecked power and bypasses laws and court rulings.

""They've defied our courts, deported Americans, disappeared people off the streets, attacked our civil rights, and slashed our services,"" the 50501 site reads. ""The corruption has gone too. far. No thrones. No crowns. No kings.""

The flagship march and rally will be taking place in Philadelphia, where the phrase ""No Kings But Us"" is a common phrase seen on flags and pennants outside of homes. 

Previously, it was a non-political, revolutionary symbol of anti-monarchy and American pride. Recently, it's been adopted by the anti-Trump organization 50501.

ANTI-TRUMP MILITARY PARADE DEMONSTRATIONS PUT MAJOR CITIES ACROSS AMERICA ON HIGH ALERT

Trump on Thursday brushed off the protests' central theme that he is a king.

""I don't feel like a king, I have to go through hell to get stuff approved,"" Trump said. ""We're not a king at all, thank you very much,"" he added.

Trump said that any demonstrators who turn up to protest the military parade will be met by a ""very big force.""

""[These] people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force.""

Protesters see the military parade as an extension of Trump's authoritarian rule and seek to counter it. They say it's a politicized use of military symbolism and a visual display of power reminiscent of autocratic regimes.

They want to contrast it with their image of a grassroots movement and draw a sharp line between democratic values and authoritarian aesthetics.

Protests are set to take place in over 2,000 cities across all 50 U.S. states, as well as in several international locations.

The protest in Philadelphia is the flagship event, given its historical significance in the War of Independence against the British Empire and King George III.

New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, Austin and Houston will host rallies as well as Dallas, Fort Worth, Miami, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Kissimmee and Apopka.

According to the 50501 website demonstrators are taking to the streets to fight what they say is an authoritarian Trump regime.

The director of the Los Angeles Police Department's union slammed city and state leadership while issuing a stark warning to would-be anti-ICE rioters. 

LOS ANGELES – The director of the Los Angeles Police Department's union slammed city and state leadership while issuing a stark warning to would-be anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement rioters. 

Jamie McBride is an LAPD detective with 35 years of experience on the force. He now leads the Los Angeles Police Protective League, representing the city's officers.

""If you come down here and you are not having a peaceful protest, if you resort to any type of violence, you will go to jail, we will find you. There's plenty of cameras out there,"" McBride told Fox News Digital. 

McBride said that LAPD officers are holding up well during the riots, which were sparked by recent arrests of criminal illegal immigrants in the city, but that police intend to crack down hard on bad actors who cause trouble in the city.

LOS ANGELES DA DELIVERS SCATHING WARNING TO VIOLENT PROTESTERS CAUSING HAVOC: ‘WE'RE COMING FOR YOU'

""If somebody does come down here and thinks it's a good idea to assault a police officer or do some kind of criminal activity, once we arrest you and we use the reasonable force necessary to take you into custody, I don't want to see anybody crying afterwards,"" he said. 

""If you're an adult, come down and do stupid stuff, then you're going to have the consequence of going to jail. So just understand that. You come down, and you want to play, we will take you to jail and if we gotta use force, we'll use the appropriate force to take you into custody.""

He also said that Los Angeles' new district attorney, Nathan Hochman, is ready to prosecute rioters, unlike his predecessor, George Gascon, who McBride viewed as much softer on crime.

""We have a great DA now who's tough on crime,"" he said. ""He's already made that stance. So if you get arrested for any type of criminal activity during this rioting that's going on here in Los Angeles, I have full confidence our district attorney – that he will prosecute to fullest.""

McBride also slammed California's leadership, especially Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has fought President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines to the city to quell and deter violence. Federal help, McBride said, would be greatly appreciated by the LAPD.

""Absolute idiot,"" he said of Newsom. ""I mean, look at the way California is right now. We are, you know, high in taxes. And then of course, we're high in crime.""

""Because you know this state is just soft on crime, Gavin Newsom is driving that narrative as well,"" said McBride. ""Of course, now that he's getting ready for a 2028 presidential run, he's trying to reinvent himself. But really, Gavin Newsom is part of the problem here. He's pouring fuel on the fire.""

Newsom is expected by some to be a Democratic Party candidate during the next presidential election cycle.

He was also critical of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. 

""Well, I think Mayor Bass is overwhelmed right now. I think she's being a little too political. She needs to come out and tell everybody this needs to stop immediately,"" he said. ""And if she has to ask for help from President Trump, then do so, because I'm afraid this weekend coming up, we might see some more of this going on.""

""I think she should step up and say that we are having a riot situation here, and if we need mutual aid, then please send mutual aid so we can combat this problem.""

Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokeswoman for Newsom, told Fox News Digital that violent crime and property crime in California have declined in recent years, and that other states have higher homicide rates than California. 

She also said that California's taxes are ""near the national average for most.""

Bass' office did not return a comment request.

President Donald Trump said that those who hate the U.S. and attempt to protest the parade will face a 'heavy force' in response. 

As President Donald Trump hosts events on Saturday to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, a new national poll indicates more Americans are likely to approve than disapprove of the president's decision to hold a military parade.

But six in 10 Americans are concerned about the cost of the parade, saying it's ""not a good use"" of government money, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey.

Trump, who is marking his 79th birthday on Saturday, is scheduled to give a speech during the parade, which will take place Saturday evening along the National Mall in Washington D.C.

Defense officials say roughly 6,600 soldiers will march in the parade, with some 50 military aircraft and 150 vehicles, including tanks, rocket launchers, and missiles. The Army says it's spending $25-$45 million to pay for the parade, which includes fixing D.C. streets damaged by the tanks.

Trump has defended the cost of the parade, saying last month in an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that it would be ""peanuts compared to the value of doing it.""

""We have the greatest missiles in the world. We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we're going to celebrate it,"" the president said.

TRUMP TO HOST MILITARY PARADE TO CELEBRATE ARMY'S 250TH BIRTHDAY

But some in Congress are criticizing the parade, saying the money could be better spent.

""If it was really about celebrating military families, we could put $30 million toward helping them offset the cost of their child care, food assistance and tuition,"" Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who lost both of her legs in combat while piloting an Army Black Hawk helicopter during the Iraq War, said in a social media post.

""But it isn't. Trump is throwing himself a $30 million birthday parade just to stroke his own ego,"" Duckworth argued.

According to the poll, 40% of adults nationwide approved of the military parade, with 29% disapproving, and three in 10 neither approving nor disapproving.

There was an expected partisan divide, with two-thirds of Republicans approving of the president's move to hold the parade, and half of Democrats disapproving.

But in a separate question, 60% of those surveyed said holding the parade was not a good use of government funds, with 38% disagreeing.

Nearly two-thirds of Republicans said holding the parade was a good use of government funds, while eight in 10 Democrats disagreed.

The White House, in a statement, said that the parade ""will be a unifying celebration for not only the thousands in attendance, but Americans across the country who can participate in honoring our active-duty servicemembers, Veterans, and fallen heroes.""

Pro-democracy, progressive, and labor activists are planning protests in all 50 states on Saturday that will coincide with Trump's military parade. Many are part of a series of ""No Kings"" protests across the country, with more than 1,500 rallies scheduled for this weekend. 

But organizers decided against holding a major protest in the nation's capital and instead will hold their main event in Philadelphia.

The poll, which was conducted June 5-9, also indicates that 39% of those questioned approve of the job Trump's doing in the White House, with six in ten giving the president a thumbs down.

The survey had an overall margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.

Former Attorney General Bill Barr discusses the federal government's response to the Los Angeles riots on 'The Story.'

President Donald Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom are headed for another legal clash next week after the president activated the National Guard to respond to anti-immigration enforcement protests and riots in Los Angeles.

The anticipated showdown will take place on Tuesday and comes after Judge Charles Breyer, a Clinton appointee, ruled Thursday night that Trump's use of the National Guard was illegal and ordered the president to temporarily relinquish control of the soldiers.

Newsom, a Democrat, celebrated the ruling, saying Trump had deployed the National Guard to his state out of ""vanity"" and to ""instill fear"" and to ""incite a response."" But Newsom's win was short-lived as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit quickly put Breyer's decision on hold in a matter of hours.

The appellate court's stay will remain in place at least through Tuesday, when attorneys for the California Attorney General's Office and the Trump administration argue before a three-judge panel about whether the court should grant a longer-term stay.

Judges Mark Bennett and Eric Miller, both Trump appointees, and Judge Jennifer Sung, a Biden appointee, will hear the arguments.

For now, Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth can continue to deploy thousands of National Guard soldiers in California, as well as hundreds of Marines. Trump and Hegseth indicated in court papers that military forces would be used strictly to protect federal personnel and federal buildings as they faced attacks by anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) rioters in recent days.

Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys argued that a judge's decision to block the Trump administration from carrying out these military activities ""would judicially countermand the Commander in Chief's military directives,"" especially if the decision were issued through a temporary restraining order, like what Breyer issued Thursday night.

""That would be unprecedented. It would be constitutionally anathema. And it would be dangerous,"" the DOJ attorneys said.

FORMER AG BARR SHREDS GAVIN NEWSOM'S 'NONSENSE' LEGAL CLAIMS AS TRUMP SENDS IN TROOPS TO QUELL LA RIOTS

The decision by Breyer, the 83-year-old brother of retired liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, was met with skepticism by some. Attorney Ed Whelan, a right-of-center former DOJ official, said in remarks online that it was ""far more sweeping"" than he had expected.

Whelan said a significant legal fight could be brewing over the provision of Title 10 that Trump used to federalize the National Guard. Typically, presidents deploy National Guard members with a governor's consent, but the law leaves room for debate on whether the governor's permission is required. Whelan speculated that Trump could attempt to use another provision of Title 10, the Insurrection Act, to bypass the court proceedings.

""10 USC 252 seems to give him much freer authority,"" Whelan said, citing the insurrection law.

The National Guard fight comes against the backdrop of Trump hosting a major military parade in Washington, D.C. on Saturday. The event, slated to cost tens of millions of dollars, will showcase U.S. military power and commemorate the Army's 250th birthday. Trump's birthday is also that day.

Trump's critics have coined the day ""No Kings Day"" and are planning to voice their objections to the president's show of force at protests around the country on Saturday. California alone is expected to see dozens of protests.

While Trump is in the nation's capital, the protesters will be ""literally everywhere else,"" Ezra Levin, one of the organizers, told the left-leaning Contrarian on Substack. 

""It's the 250th anniversary of the Continental Army, which was formed to push back against a mad king,"" Levin said, noting the protests would be peaceful and serve as a recruitment tool in the ""pro-Democracy fight"" against Trump.

The United States Capitol Police said they arrested 60 people Friday evening following a protest demonstration held by veterans.

Police said in a statement that they were “aware of a peaceful demonstration at the Supreme Court this evening with approximately 75 people.”

“A short time later, at around 7 p.m., approximately 60 people from the group left the Supreme Court so as a precaution, our officers began establishing a perimeter. A few people pushed the bike rack down and illegally crossed the police line while running towards the Rotunda Steps,” USCP said.

“Our officers immediately blocked the group and began making arrests,” the statement continued.

A law enforcement official told CNN the protesters were part of a veterans' group protesting fascism. Many people detained wore shirts that read “Veterans Against Fascism,” according to ABC 7 DC.

USCP said the protesters who were arrested will be charged with unlawful demonstration and crossing a police line. Some will be charged with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer.

Elon Musk signaled late Friday night that he is providing Iranians with Starlink satellite internet after conservative analyst Mark Levin asked him to turn the service on in Iran during Israel‘s conflict with the country.

“The beams are on,” Musk said in a response to Levin's request on X.

Levin's initial post argued that if Starlink is turned on in the country, “Musk can put the final nail in the coffin of the Iranian regime.” Starlink is Musk's satellite internet service.

Iran restricted internet access for millions of people following Israel's strike on the country. Internet usage in the country heavily declined after the restrictions were issued, according to the internet monitoring group Netblocks. There hasn't been a complete block of traffic, however, as Levin's post suggested.

Iranian officials said the restrictions were placed because of the “special conditions” surrounding the country. 

“We inform the honourable people of Iran that, in view of the country's special conditions and with the measures of the competent authorities, temporary restrictions have been imposed on the country's internet,” a message from the country's Ministry of Information and Communications said.

Starlink's website does not list Starlink service as available in Iran, though it is available in Jordan, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. Despite this, Musk appears to be able to activate service in areas of need like his activation of it in a Gaza hospital last year.

Musk's likely hopes to boost resistance to Islamic rule in Iran with his activation of Starlink in the country. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu encouraged the populace to rise up against its rule.

“The time has come for you to unite around your flag and your historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from an evil and oppressive regime,” Netanyahu said Friday. “It has never been weaker. This is your opportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard.” 

Israel hit Iran with a surprise attack on Thursday, killing multiple high-ranking military leaders and damaging nuclear sites. Iran responded with a missile barrage of its own against Israel, though few made it through to the country's capital of Tel Aviv. The U.S. assisted in shooting down the missiles.

Overnight on Friday, both countries traded strikes on each other. Iran launched several waves of missiles toward Israeli military centers and air bases, and Israel restarted strikes on Iran's capital of Tehran. Iranian state media said Israel hit the provinces of East Azerbaijan, Lorestan and Kermanshah.

Iran claimed that an Israeli strike killed 60 people in a residential building in Tehran, including 20 children. An exact death toll from Israeli strikes on Iran is unclear, but Iran's United Nations envoy said at least 78 people were killed on Friday, and hundreds have been injured.

Federal immigration authorities have continued to target illegal immigrant farmworkers under the Trump administration's mass deportation operation despite President Donald Trump saying on Thursday that he would “soon” put in place protections for agricultural workers, according to the national union that represents workers.

Not long after Trump told reporters at the White House that he planned to take action to ensure farmworkers were not the focus of arrest efforts by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and federal police, immigrant rights advocates in one targeted region suggested that nothing had changed in 24 hours, likely because the White House has not yet issued a directive.

The United Farm Workers, a labor union for farmworkers in the United States, posted pictures and reports from eyewitnesses in Central California's farming region that Customs and Border Protection agents were going after workers on Friday.

“NOW: Border Patrol is continuing raids on farm workers in Ventura County, especially Moorpark and Oxnard,” UFW wrote in a post to X Friday. “Agents are circling like sharks. Farm workers in areas with heightened activity should check in on each other and take steps to keep safe. Report what you see to us.”

Neither CBP nor ICE responded to requests for comment regarding whether they were told not to continue targeting farmworkers.

Earlier this week, UFW found federal police targeting illegal immigrant workers in various California communities. One such video that the UFW shared on X showed two federal police officers who appear to be dressed in green CBP uniforms chasing an immigrant through a field.

“We are aware of multiple federal immigration ‘enforcement' actions involving farm workers in multiple regions of California, including those in Ventura, Kern, and Tulare counties,” UFW said in a press release Tuesday. “Any federal actions designed to terrorize and separate farm worker communities is an attack on Californians and a dangerous waste of resources. Indiscriminate raids and chaotic sweeps put public safety at risk.”

Very quickly, the White House received pushback about targeting immigrant workers.

The brunt of the blowback came from elected officials in the Golden State. Sens. Alex Padilla (D-CA) and Adam Schiff (D-CA) jointly decried ICE targeting workers in the field.

“We are deeply alarmed by the latest actions from the Trump Administration targeting workers at agricultural fields, packinghouses, and other facilities from the Central Coast to the Central Valley,” the senators said in a statement this week. “California is the nation's largest agricultural state, and without the people who work through harsh conditions — extreme heat, cold weather, or pouring rain — feeding the nation would be impossible, and putting food on the table would be much more expensive for American families.”

Foreign workers make up 86% of agricultural workers in the U.S., and nearly half of all agricultural workers, or 283,000, are undocumented, according to the Center for Migration Studies in New York.

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) was quick to blast reports that ICE was targeting farmworkers without legal status to be in the United States.

“Turns out, chasing hard working people through ranches and farms and snatching women and children off the streets is not good policy,” Newsom wrote in a post to X Thursday shortly after Trump announced the White House was working to put protections in place for that particular population.

Amid the criticism, the White House said it would walk back the expansion and put in place protections for those specific workers.

“We're going to have an order on that pretty soon, I think,” Trump said Thursday at the White House. “We can't do that to our farmers, and leisure too. Hotels. We're going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.”

Trump said in a post on  Truth Social that “our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.

“We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!” Trump wrote in the post.

But the UFW said the continuation of raids targeting immigrants on Friday suggested that Trump was not really running the show, or he was insincere.

“Clearly we have to ask: who is actually calling the shots? Trump says he doesn't want federal agencies to go after farm workers, but that's exactly what is happening,” UFW wrote in a post to X Thursday evening. “If he's really in charge, he could prove it by ordering ICE and Border Patrol to STOP THE RAIDS.”

Several officials familiar with the administration's immigration plans reported that they had not seen any progress on the promised policy changes, according to the Washington Post.

The pushback against going after farmworkers puts the White House in a bind. Just weeks ago, White House Deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that ICE should be arresting 3,000 illegal immigrants daily, far beyond the roughly 1,500 arrests the agency has made per day in recent weeks.

In some cities, including New York City, plainclothes ICE officers elected to show up in immigration courthouses and arrest immigrants as they showed up for court proceedings because it presented an easy way to nab people at specific times and places.

This week, ICE began making arrests at job sites on farms in California.

Asked if federal law enforcement would continue to go after illegal immigrants working on farms, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said it is following the White House's orders.

“We will follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told the Washington Examiner on Friday afternoon that Trump would address both matters, but did not specify when or how.

“President Trump has always stood up for our farmers, who were a major part of his November victory, by working to negotiate fairer trade deals and cut red tape,” Kelly said in a statement. “He will continue to strengthen our agricultural industry and boost exports while keeping his promise to enforce our immigration laws and remove the millions of unvetted illegals who flooded into the United States under [former President] Joe Biden.”

Others, including Rep. Maria Salazar (R-FL), are looking at permanent solutions to protect illegal immigrants who work on American farms.

“President Trump himself has acknowledged what so many of us already know: long-time workers, many of whom have built their lives in this country, are being taken away. Our construction sites, our hotels, and our farms are feeling the impact,” said Salazar in a statement. “It's time for Congress to act and bring a solution.”

Salazar has promised to co-introduce a “revolutionary” bill to fix the immigration system with Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-TX) by the end of June.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The White House's callous tactics are warping perceptions of reality.

From the beginning, Donald Trump's approach to deportations has been about both removing people from the country and the spectacle of removing people from the country. If any doubt lingered about the president's commitment to the cause, he erased it in Los Angeles, where his response to the widespread protests against a series of ICE raids—he has dispatched roughly 4,000 California National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines, all against the wishes of the state's governor—has been an extraordinary (and extraordinarily excessive) demonstration of force. Trump's message has been clear: No matter who or what tries to get in the way, his administration will push forward with deportations. L.A. is “the first, perhaps, of many” military deployments in the United States, Trump said earlier this week.



The spectacle part, Trump has down. The president has ushered in one of the most aggressive immigration campaigns in recent American history. The ICE raids in L.A. are just the latest of many high-profile instances in which federal law-enforcement officials have antagonized and rounded up suspected undocumented immigrants—some of whom are citizens or legal residents. Hundreds of immigrants have been swept away to what functionally is a modern Gulag in El Salvador, and the administration has recently tried to send others to South Sudan, which is on the verge of civil war. Enforcing immigration policy does not have to be inhumane, but the Trump administration is gloating in the very barbarity.



Amid all the bravado, however, the administration much more quietly has been struggling to deliver on Trump's campaign promise to “launch the largest deportation program of criminals in the history of America.” So far, deportations have not dramatically spiked under Trump, though daily rates have been on the rise in recent weeks. According to government data obtained by The New York Times, the administration has deported more than 200,000 people since Trump's return to office, well below the rate needed to meet the White House's reported goal of removing 1 million unauthorized immigrants in his first year in office. If the pace over the first five months of Trump's presidency continues through the end of the year, total deportations would only slightly exceed that of President Barack Obama in fiscal year 2012.



The discrepancy is surprising. Given the visibility of Trump's efforts, you'd be forgiven for believing deportations were unfolding on a never-before-seen scale. The actual numbers don't diminish the cruelty of Trump's approach or the pain his administration has caused to those it has targeted. But they do reveal Trump's ever-increasing mastery of bending perceptions of reality. The administration's immigration tactics are so shocking, callous, and inescapable that they have generated the appearance of mass deportations. Paranoid rumors of ICE agents hovering around playgrounds, waiting to arrest noncitizen nannies, have spread. Some immigrants have opted to self-deport instead of subjecting themselves to the potential horrors of ICE detainment and deportation.



No reason exists to think the White House has been deliberately falling behind on its deportation promise. The administration has run into several challenges: The easiest migrants to deport are those who have just crossed the border, and unauthorized immigration has dropped significantly since Trump took office. (Trump's deportation approach and rhetoric has, in other words, seemingly been successful at keeping people out of the country in the first place.) At times, ICE has faced detention space constraints, and some of the administration's deportations have been stymied in the courts. In an email, the White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote, “President Trump has already secured the border in record time and is now fulfilling his promise to deport illegal aliens.” The administration plans to use a “full-of-government approach to ensure the efficient mass deportation of terrorist and criminal illegal aliens.” In Trump's “big, beautiful bill” that is working its way through Congress, Republican lawmakers are set to give ICE a massive funding injection to help the agency finally carry out mass deportations. “If that money goes out, the amount of people they can arrest and remove will be extraordinary,” Paul Hunker, who was formerly ICE's lead attorney in Dallas, told my colleague Nick Miroff.

For now, Trump is faking it until he makes it, with his administration doing everything it can to draw attention to its immigration tactics. Yesterday, federal agents handcuffed and forcibly removed Senator Alex Padilla of California just after he interrupted an immigration press conference featuring Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. In March, Noem had generated a previous viral moment when she traveled to the El Salvador megaprison where the administration has sent hundreds of supposed gang members, and gave remarks in front of shirtless, tattooed prisoners. The administration has even brought along right-wing media figures for its ICE arrests, producing further images of its immigration enforcement. Phil McGraw—the former host of Dr. Phil, who now hosts a show for MeritTV, a right-wing network he founded—was at ICE headquarters in L.A. the same day of the immigration sweeps in the city that prompted the protests last week.



Consider, too, the shocking ways in which the administration has discussed the deportation campaign on social media. On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security posted an image styled like a World War II propaganda flyer, urging Americans to “report all foreign invaders” to a DHS hotline. The White House's X account has created a meme about a crying woman in ICE custody, and uploaded a video of a deportee boarding a plane in clanking shackles with the caption “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight.”

Read: The gleeful cruelty of the White House X account

In one sense, all of this is just classic political spin. Instead of admitting that it's falling behind on one of its core promises, the White House is attempting to control the narrative. But the scale of reality-warping going on in this case is hard to fathom. Trump's actions are part of a larger way in which he has come to understand that he can sway the nation with the right viral imagery. When he was indicted on racketeering and other charges and forced to take a mug shot in 2023, Trump glowered into the camera instead of looking embarrassed or guilty, generating an image that became the subject of viral memes and campaign merchandise—and seemingly inspired his second presidential portrait, in which he strikes the same glowering pose. When he came within inches of dying during the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania last summer, he had the instincts to produce one of the most significant images in modern American history.



The series of videos, pictures, and aggressive actions his administration has taken regarding deportations are of the same genre. Trump takes the reality in front of him and does what he can to create a perception closer to what he wants: in this case, one of fear and terror. This is authoritarian behavior. Trump is marshaling propaganda to mislead Americans about what is really happening. Other recent strongman leaders, such as Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines and Viktor Orbán in Hungary, have used a similar playbook. If Trump can't remove as many immigrants as he promised, the president can still use his talent for warping perceptions to make it feel as though he is. Laws don't need to change for free speech to be chilled, for immigrants to flee, and for people to be afraid.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:vox.com","Trump's military parade is a warning","https://www.vox.com/politics/416880/trumps-military-parade-is-a-warning","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Trump has caused a crisis in civil-military relations — one that could eventually threaten democracy's foundations.

Donald Trump's military parade in Washington this weekend — a show of force in the capital that just happens to take place on the president's birthday — smacks of authoritarian Dear Leader-style politics (even though Trump actually got the idea after attending the 2017 Bastille Day parade in Paris).

Yet as disconcerting as the imagery of tanks rolling down Constitution Avenue will be, it's not even close to Trump's most insidious assault on the US military's historic and democratically essential nonpartisan ethos.

In fact, it's not even the most worrying thing he's done this week.

On Tuesday, the president gave a speech at Fort Bragg, an Army base home to Special Operations Command. While presidential speeches to soldiers are not uncommon — rows of uniformed troops make a great backdrop for a foreign policy speech — they generally avoid overt partisan attacks and campaign-style rhetoric. The soldiers, for their part, are expected to be studiously neutral, laughing at jokes and such, but remaining fully impassive during any policy conversation.

That's not what happened at Fort Bragg. Trump's speech was a partisan tirade that targeted “radical left” opponents ranging from Joe Biden to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. He celebrated his deployment of Marines to Los Angeles, proposed jailing people for burning the American flag, and called on soldiers to be “aggressive” toward the protesters they encountered.

The soldiers, for their part, cheered Trump and booed his enemies — as they were seemingly expected to. Reporters at Military.com, a military news service, uncovered internal communications from 82nd Airborne leadership suggesting that the crowd was screened for their political opinions.

“If soldiers have political views that are in opposition to the current administration and they don't want to be in the audience then they need to speak with their leadership and get swapped out,” one note read.

To call this unusual is an understatement. I spoke with four different experts on civil-military relations, two of whom teach at the Naval War College, about the speech and its implications. To a person, they said it was a step towards politicizing the military with no real precedent in modern American history.

“That is, I think, a really big red flag because it means the military's professional ethic is breaking down internally,” says Risa Brooks, a professor at Marquette University. “Its capacity to maintain that firewall against civilian politicization may be faltering.”

This may sound alarmist — like an overreading of a one-off incident — but it's part of a bigger pattern. The totality of Trump administration policies, ranging from the parade in Washington to the LA troop deployment to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's firing of high-ranking women and officers of color, suggests a concerted effort to erode the military's professional ethos and turn it into an institution subservient to the Trump administration's whims. This is a signal policy aim of would-be dictators, who wish to head off the risk of a coup and ensure the armed forces' political reliability if they are needed to repress dissent in a crisis.

Steve Saideman, a professor at Carleton University, put together a list of eight different signs that a military is being politicized in this fashion. The Trump administration has exhibited six out of the eight.

“The biggest theme is that we are seeing a number of checks on the executive fail at the same time — and that's what's making individual events seem more alarming than they might otherwise,” says Jessica Blankshain, a professor at the Naval War College (speaking not for the military but in a personal capacity).

That Trump is trying to politicize the military does not mean he has succeeded. There are several signs, including Trump's handpicked chair of the Joint Chiefs repudiating the president's claims of a migrant invasion during congressional testimony, that the US military is resisting Trump's politicization.

But the events in Fort Bragg and Washington suggest that we are in the midst of a quiet crisis in civil-military relations in the United States — one whose implications for American democracy's future could well be profound.

A military is, by sheer fact of its existence, a threat to any civilian government. If you have an institution that controls the overwhelming bulk of weaponry in a society, it always has the physical capacity to seize control of the government at gunpoint. A key question for any government is how to convince the armed forces that they cannot or should not take power for themselves.

Democracies typically do this through a process called “professionalization.” Soldiers are rigorously taught to think of themselves as a class of public servants, people trained to perform a specific job within defined parameters. Their ultimate loyalty is not to their generals or even individual presidents, but rather to the people and the constitutional order.

Samuel Huntington, the late Harvard political scientist, is the canonical theorist of a professional military. In his book The Soldier and the State, he described optimal professionalization as a system of “objective control”: one in which the military retains autonomy in how they fight and plan for wars while deferring to politicians on whether and why to fight in the first place. In effect, they stay out of the politicians' affairs while the politicians stay out of theirs.

The idea of such a system is to emphasize to the military that they are professionals: Their responsibility isn't deciding when to use force, but only to conduct operations as effectively as possible once ordered to engage in them. There is thus a strict firewall between military affairs, on the one hand, and policy-political affairs on the other.

Typically, the chief worry is that the military breaches this bargain: that, for example, a general starts speaking out against elected officials' policies in ways that undermine civilian control. This is not a hypothetical fear in the United States, with the most famous such example being Gen. Douglas MacArthur's insubordination during the Korean War. Thankfully, not even MacArthur attempted the worst-case version of military overstep — a coup.

But in backsliding democracies like the modern United States, where the chief executive is attempting an anti-democratic power grab, the military poses a very different kind of threat to democracy — in fact, something akin to the exact opposite of the typical scenario.

In such cases, the issue isn't the military inserting itself into politics but rather the civilians dragging them into it in ways that upset the democratic political order. The worst-case scenario is that the military acts on presidential directives to use force against domestic dissenters, destroying democracy not by ignoring civilian orders, but by following them.

There are two ways to arrive at such a worst-case scenario, both of which are in evidence in the early days of Trump 2.0.

First is politicization: an intentional attack on the constraints against partisan activity inside the professional ranks.

Many of Pete Hegseth's major moves as secretary of defense fit this bill, including his decisions to fire nonwhite and female generals seen as politically unreliable and his effort to undermine the independence of the military's lawyers. The breaches in protocol at Fort Bragg are both consequences and causes of politicization: They could only happen in an environment of loosened constraint, and they might encourage more overt political action if gone unpunished.

The second pathway to breakdown is the weaponization of professionalism against itself. Here, Trump exploits the military's deference to politicians by ordering it to engage in undemocratic (and even questionably legal) activities. 

In practice, this looks a lot like the LA deployments, and, more specifically, the lack of any visible military pushback. While the military readily agreeing to deployments is normally a good sign — that civilian control is holding — these aren't normal times. And this isn't a normal deployment, but rather one that comes uncomfortably close to the military being ordered to assist in repressing overwhelmingly peaceful demonstrations against executive abuses of power.

“It's really been pretty uncommon to use the military for law enforcement,” says David Burbach, another Naval War College professor (also speaking personally). “This is really bringing the military into frontline law enforcement when. … these are really not huge disturbances.”

This, then, is the crisis: an incremental and slow-rolling effort by the Trump administration to erode the norms and procedures designed to prevent the military from being used as a tool of domestic repression. 

Among the experts I spoke with, there was consensus that the military's professional and nonpartisan ethos was weakening. This isn't just because of Trump, but his terms — the first to a degree, and now the second acutely — are major stressors.

Yet there was no consensus on just how much military nonpartisanship has eroded — that is, how close we are to a moment when the US military might be willing to follow obviously authoritarian orders.

For all its faults, the US military's professional ethos is a really important part of its identity and self-conception. While few soldiers may actually read Sam Huntington or similar scholars, the general idea that they serve the people and the republic is a bedrock principle among the ranks. There is a reason why the United States has never, in over 250 years of governance, experienced a military coup — or even come particularly close to one.

In theory, this ethos should also galvanize resistance to Trump's efforts at politicization. Soldiers are not unthinking automatons: While they are trained to follow commands, they are explicitly obligated to refuse illegal orders, even coming from the president. The more aggressive Trump's efforts to use the military as a tool of repression gets, the more likely there is to be resistance.

Or, at least theoretically.

The truth is that we don't really know how the US military will respond to a situation like this. Like so many of Trump's second-term policies, their efforts to bend the military to their will are unprecedented — actions with no real parallel in the modern history of the American military. Experts can only make informed guesses, based on their sense of US military culture as well as comparisons to historical and foreign cases.

For this reason, there are probably only two things we can say with confidence.

First, what we've seen so far is not yet sufficient evidence to declare that the military is in Trump's thrall. The signs of decay are too limited to ground any conclusions that the longstanding professional norm is entirely gone.

“We have seen a few things that are potentially alarming about erosion of the military's non-partisan norm. But not in a way that's definitive at this point,” Blankshain says.

Second, the stressors on this tradition are going to keep piling on. Trump's record makes it exceptionally clear that he wants the military to serve him personally — and that he, and Hegseth, will keep working to make it so. This means we really are in the midst of a quiet crisis, and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future.

“The fact that he's getting the troops to cheer for booing Democratic leaders at a time when there's actually [a deployment to] a blue city and a blue state…he is ordering the troops to take a side,” Saideman says. “There may not be a coherent plan behind this. But there are a lot of things going on that are all in the same direction.”

Musk had big dreams. DOGE ran into reality. Here's what will and won't stick from the initiative.

Elon Musk may be gone from the Trump administration — and his friendship status with President Donald Trump may be at best uncertain — but his whirlwind stint in government certainly left its imprint. 

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), his pet government-slashing project, remains entrenched in Washington. During his 130-day tenure, Musk led DOGE in eliminating about 260,000 federal employee jobs and gutting agencies supporting scientific research and humanitarian aid. 

But to date, DOGE claims to have saved the government $180 billion — well short of its ambitious (and frankly never realistic) target of cutting at least $2 trillion from the federal budget. And with Musk's departure still fresh, there are reports that the federal government is trying to rehire federal workers who quit or were let go. 

For Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, DOGE's tactics will likely end up being disastrous in the long run. “DOGE came in with these huge cuts, which were not attached to a plan,” she told Today, Explained co-host Sean Rameswaram. 

Kamarck knows all about making government more efficient. In the 1990s, she ran the Clinton administration's Reinventing Government program. “I was Elon Musk,” she told Today, Explained. With the benefit of that experience, she assesses Musk's record at DOGE, and what, if anything, the billionaire's loud efforts at cutting government spending added up to. 

Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What do you think Elon Musk's legacy is? 

Well, he will not have totally, radically reshaped the federal government. Absolutely not. In fact, there's a high probability that on January 20, 2029, when the next president takes over, the federal government is about the same size as it is now, and is probably doing the same stuff that it's doing now. What he did manage to do was insert chaos, fear, and loathing into the federal workforce. 

There was reporting in the Washington Post late last week that these cuts were so ineffective that the White House is actually reaching out to various federal employees who were laid off and asking them to come back, from the FDA to the IRS to even USAID. Which cuts are sticking at this point and which ones aren't?

First of all, in a lot of cases, people went to court and the courts have reversed those earlier decisions. So the first thing that happened is, courts said, “No, no, no, you can't do it this way. You have to bring them back.” 

The second thing that happened is that Cabinet officers started to get confirmed by the Senate. And remember that a lot of the most spectacular DOGE stuff was happening in February. In February, these Cabinet secretaries were preparing for their Senate hearings. They weren't on the job. Now that their Cabinet secretary's home, what's happening is they're looking at these cuts and they're saying, “No, no, no! We can't live with these cuts because we have a mission to do.”

As the government tries to hire back the people they fired, they're going to have a tough time, and they're going to have a tough time for two reasons. First of all, they treated them like dirt, and they've said a lot of insulting things. 

Second, most of the people who work for the federal government are highly skilled. They're not paper pushers. We have computers to push our paper, right? They're scientists. They're engineers. They're people with high skills, and guess what? They can get jobs outside the government. So there's going to be real lasting damage to the government from the way they did this. And it's analogous to the lasting damage that they're causing at universities, where we now have top scientists who used to invent great cures for cancer and things like that, deciding to go find jobs in Europe because this culture has gotten so bad.

What happens to this agency now? Who's in charge of it?

Well, what they've done is DOGE employees have been embedded in each of the organizations in the government, okay? And they basically — and the president himself has said this — they basically report to the Cabinet secretaries. So if you are in the Transportation Department, you have to make sure that Sean Duffy, who's the secretary of transportation, agrees with you on what you want to do. And Sean Duffy has already had a fight during a Cabinet meeting with Elon Musk. You know that he has not been thrilled with the advice he's gotten from DOGE. So from now on, DOGE is going to have to work hand in hand with Donald Trump's appointed leaders.

And just to bring this around to what we're here talking about now, they're in this huge fight over wasteful spending with the so-called big, beautiful bill. Does this just look like the government as usual, ultimately?

It's actually worse than normal. Because the deficit impacts are bigger than normal. It's adding more to the deficit than previous bills have done. 

And the second reason it's worse than normal is that everybody is still living in a fantasy world. And the fantasy world says that somehow we can deal with our deficits by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse. That is pure nonsense. Let me say it: pure nonsense.

Where does most of the government money go? Does it go to some bureaucrats sitting on Pennsylvania Avenue? It goes to us. It goes to your grandmother and her Social Security and her Medicare. It goes to veterans in veterans benefits. It goes to Americans. That's why it's so hard to cut it. It's so hard to cut it because it's us. 

And people are living on it. Now, there's a whole other topic that nobody talks about, and it's called entitlement reform, right? Could we reform Social Security? Could we make the retirement age go from 67 to 68? That would save a lot of money. Could we change the cost of living? Nobody, nobody, nobody is talking about that. And that's because we are in this crazy, polarized environment where we can no longer have serious conversations about serious issues.

Israel's widespread airstrikes on Iran effectively damaged the country's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, which officials said was a primary goal.

The strikes hit over 100 targets, including Iran's air defense systems, missile launchers, and senior military leadership.

Now, all eyes are on Tehran's response (it has launched multiple waves of missiles in retaliatory strikes on Israel), and the specter of a wider conflict. And there are lingering questions over whether the US will get pulled into the fight.

Here are some main questions stemming from the attacks.

Iran initially responded to the attack by firing 100 drones at Israel on Friday, which the Israel Defense Forces said were mostly intercepted.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel ""should anticipate a severe punishment"" in response to the strikes, which Iran says killed at least 78 people.

Hours later, the IDF said Iran had launched ""dozens"" of missiles at Israel in what appeared to be several waves. The military said its air defenses were actively intercepting threats, and video footage captured several impacts.

""The Iranian response might be delayed or split into multiple phases,"" said Matthew Savill, the director of military sciences at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute think tank.

""But their main weapon will be ballistic missiles,"" he added, ""which have the best chance of inflicting damage on Israel, whereas drone and cruise missile attacks will face more extensive Israeli defences.""

On Saturday, Iran's IRNA state news agency reported that Iranian forces said they had ""successfully destroyed targets"" in Israel using Arash drones — long-range loitering munitions.

Israeli emergency services said two people were killed in a rocket strike on the coastal plain Saturday morning.

It is not unprecedented for Iran to launch powerful weapons at Israel; Tehran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at its foe in April and October last year. However, those strikes were mostly intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the US.

Beyond direct strikes, another way that Iran could retaliate is through the so-called ""Axis of Resistance,"" a vast network of militias it is aligned with throughout the region, including Lebanon's Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthis.

Israel has been battling these forces, and Hamas in Gaza, since the October 7, 2023, attacks.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long advocated for destroying Iran's nuclear program, which Tehran claims is for civilian purposes.

The US, however, has been trying to reach a new deal with Iran (and has threatened violence if a deal isn't done). The strikes could derail those efforts and even goad Iran into racing to build a nuclear arsenal.

Israel's strikes threaten to spark a wider regional conflict, analysts at London's Chatham House think tank warned Friday.

""Far from being a preventive action, this strike risks triggering a broader regional escalation and may inadvertently bolster the Islamic Republic's domestic and international legitimacy,"" Sanam Vakil, Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa program director, said.

Last year, Tehran reportedly threatened to target Gulf state oil facilities if they allowed Israel access to their airspace for strikes against Iran.

Oil prices surged after Israel launched its strikes on Iran this week, Business Insider reported.

It's unclear what routes Israeli aircraft used in the attacks, but there's been speculation Israel could exploit the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria to get its aircraft directly over Iraq for strikes.

Russia is also a close ally of Iran, and the two have increased their defense cooperation since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

However, Nikita Smagin, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment, said in December that the Kremlin is unlikely to come to Iran's direct aid in order to avoid direct confrontations with Israel and the US.

The US has helped arm and defend Israel, notably in the wake of Hamas' October 7 attacks.

Trump has sought to broker a new nuclear deal with Iran, and in the wake of the Israeli attacks overnight, warned of ""even more brutal"" strikes from Israel if Iran refuses a new agreement.

In a phone call with NBC News, Trump said that Iran had ""missed the opportunity to make a deal,"" but said Iranian officials had reached out to him to continue negotiations.

""Now, they may have another opportunity. We'll see,"" Trump told the outlet. Iranian media reported the nation had pulled out of the next round of talks, per NBC News.

Last year, the US Navy helped shoot down Iranian missiles fired at Israel in two major attacks, and it has rotated multiple aircraft carriers and many warships into the region since 2023, in a show of support for Israel and to deter its enemies, including Iran.

A US official told Business Insider that American forces helped shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel on Friday. It's unclear whether they provided air defense from the ground, sea, or air.

The US and other NATO countries have also defended international shipping routes in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden from attacks by the Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen.

The US has a substantial military presence in the Middle East, including naval forces, ground troops, and strike aircraft.

A Navy spokesperson told BI that the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group — consisting of an aircraft carrier, a cruiser, and three destroyers — is in the Arabian Sea.

There are also three American destroyers in the Red Sea and another in the Eastern Mediterranean.

All of these warships, and the carrier's dozens of embarked aircraft, are capable of carrying out air defense missions to defeat incoming drones and missiles.

IDF spokesperson Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said Israel's strikes ""significantly harmed"" Iran's main uranium enrichment site at Natanz.

""For many years, the people of the Iranian regime made an effort to obtain nuclear arms in this facility,"" he said, adding that the site ""has the necessary infrastructure to enrich uranium to a military grade.""

The International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed the site was struck, but the extent of the damage remains unverified.

Satellite imagery appeared to show significant damage at the surface level.

There was also a report Friday that Israel had struck Fordow, a nuclear fuel enrichment site guarded deep under a mountain.

Overnight, Israeli strikes reportedly targeted strategic Iranian sites, including the Natanz nuclear facility, Iran's primary center for uranium enrichment.

The IDF said that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps chief Hossein Salami and other senior military commanders were also killed in targeted strikes.

It's time to let go of Great Resignation FOMO.

Typical year-over-year wage growth for job stayers has surpassed that for those quitting and switching roles. While it's a small gain at this point, you can see in the chart below that it's an extremely rare event and hasn't happened for a sustained period since 2009. Plus, it's a big turnaround from July 2022, when the gap was 8.5% vs. 5.9% in favor of job switchers.

It speaks to how hesitant companies have become to hire; when they do decide to bring someone on board, they don't need to shell out a big raise to seal the deal.

As a result, the white-collar workers who held tight to their jobs have become the sector's upper class: They're benefiting from low layoffs and robust wage growth. For those who both switched during the Great Resignation and have hung on to their new role ever since, that might be an economic double whammy — they cashed in at that higher salary and have been sitting pretty since.

On the other end of the spectrum are white-collar workers who are out of work and looking, at a time when US businesses are hiring at nearly the lowest rate since 2014, excluding an early pandemic plunge.

So you may be wondering: Is it a good time to switch jobs or not?

Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, sums it up. ""If the right job comes up, one that moves you forward in your career and gives you a healthy raise, certainly consider taking it,"" he said. ""If not, there is at least some assurance that staying put still provides decent pay increases right now.""

In contrast to the years of the Great Resignation, when job stayers were leaving money on the table by not hopping to a new company, the Big Stay has finally started paying off for those who are staying put.

In May, white-collar-dominated industries had robust wage growth over the year. Average hourly earnings increased 6% from a year ago in the information sector, which includes broadcasting, telecommunications, and data processing. Professional and business services, such as the management of companies and enterprises, legal services, and computer system design services, had wage growth of about 5%.

According to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, median wage growth for job stayers across all industries has outpaced growth for job switchers since February.

The Big Stay seems here to stay for the time being — white-collar folks aren't leaving their jobs. Even if they're no longer enjoying their work, some see it as better than facing a long stretch of unemployment or an uncertain job market. And, financially, it's paying off.

""There's fewer people coming in, fewer people heading out,"" Guy Berger, the director of economic research at the Burning Glass Institute, said. ""That mix tends to favor established workers who tend to be older and tends to hurt younger people trying to get their foot in the door.""

On the other side are the white-collar job seekers. The things that make the market relatively pleasant for job stayers are working against the job seekers: Employers are running leaner in the face of economic uncertainty and would rather rely on the talent they have. Job stayers may be worried about their chances of getting a different job and aren't vacating roles.

""As white-collar industries reverse some of that pandemic hiring and also pull back on hiring amid economic uncertainty, it's getting tougher to find a job,"" Daniel Zhao, lead economist at Glassdoor, told Business Insider. Glassdoor data last year showed that a growing percentage of workers switching employers were accepting lower-paid roles, especially in tech.

Zhao said that's because, ""Many job switchers today were involuntarily laid off, resulting in more workers having to settle for a lower-paying or lower seniority job.""

Berger said that in addition to weak hiring leading to fewer opportunities, there are also more people with a college education, which means more competition for jobs.

""It's also possible that in some segments AI is slowing demand for white-collar workers, though I doubt this is as big as some people think,"" Berger said.

There's some good news in professional and business services, where the hiring rate continues to be strong and has been trending upward, although it's still below its late 2021 high, and the sector has had several monthly net employment losses over the past year. The information sector's hires rate is still low compared to the overall hires rate, but has climbed somewhat. Hiring in financial activities is lower than in the other two traditionally white-collar fields.

Job seekers are already lowering their expectations: The average lowest wage all workers would accept for a new job plummeted from $82,000 in November 2024 to $74,000 in March 2025. Among those with college degrees, it fell from $102,000 to $95,000 in the same period.

And the share of graduates in jobs that don't require a degree ticked up for recent graduates in the first quarter of 2025, indicating that degree holders are overqualified for more roles.

""White-collar industries like finance, tech, and consulting are still appealing, especially for new grads, because of their promise of rapid career growth and high pay,"" Zhao said. ""But that promise of career growth and high pay is becoming less attainable and more exclusive due to the soft hiring environment.""

Israel attacked an onshore refinery at Phase 14 of Iran's giant South Pars gas field in the Persian Gulf on Saturday, as it expanded its assault on the Islamic Republic to targeting its critical energy sector.

The strike caused a powerful explosion and fire, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, adding that a separate fire also broke out at the Fajr Jam gas refinery, which processes gas from South Pars as well as the Nar and Kangan fields and is one of Iran's largest refineries.

For weeks, the S&P 500 Index has inched along near an all-time high despite encouraging economic signals, as Wall Street's concerns about a rich stock market in the face of mounting global uncertainty kept buying in check. 

On Thursday night, those fears became real, with Israel and Iran exchanging missiles, threatening to start a wider war in the Middle East, which is already near boiling after years of fighting in Gaza. The price of oil spiked as much as 14% on Friday, while the yield on 10-year Treasuries halted a four-day slide and started rising again.

President Donald Trump's pledge to exert US power around the world is being tested in Europe and the Middle East, but this weekend offers him a chance to display that power on American soil.

Trump, who's celebrating his 79th birthday on Saturday, is the driving force behind the parade down Washington's Constitution Avenue — which runs behind the White House — that includes a muscular exhibition of 6,600 soldiers, Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and a Black Hawk helicopter. Also planned are historic reenactments, state-of-the-art military technology and a flyover with the Air Force Thunderbirds. The Army is marking its 250th anniversary with a companion all-day event on the National Mall.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The AI Race:

What does AI dominance actually mean?

Back in May, President Trump announced this big plan whereby American tech giants would participate in major AI projects in both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The announcement has created divisions within the White House, and more generally among people who are thinking about the intersection of artificial intelligence and geopolitics. One argument is that this is great news geopolitically, because it gives American technology a beachhead in this crucial region. Another argument is that by exporting the chips abroad, it creates a possibility that some of the technology will leak to China, or benefit China in some way. On this episode we speak with Bloomberg News reporter Mackenzie Hawkins, who covers tech and geopolitics in Hong Kong, about the deals, the divisions, and what to watch next as the US looks to maintain its edge in these key areas.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The UK's prime minister is focused on de-escalating the Israel-Iran conflict, and sees a path forward for Ukraine and a US-UK trade deal.

By Mishal Husain

Can the UK help de-escalate, well, everything?

Friday morning turned out to be quite a moment to walk through the famous black door of 10 Downing Street — home and workplace of British prime ministers for nearly 300 years — to speak to current occupant Keir Starmer. Israel had attacked Iran a few hours earlier, and so our conversation about the UK's role on the world stage began right there, slotted between Starmer's calls with the leaders of France, Germany and Israel. 

Starmer has been in power for nearly a year, and has been tested in new ways since Donald Trump returned to the White House. He prides himself on the bond they appear to have forged, though it is in some ways an unlikely one: the New York businessman and the studious former human-rights lawyer. That rapport helped the UK score a win with a trade agreement, which Starmer told me is about to enter into force. Alignment on Ukraine is harder. As Starmer heads to Canada for the G-7, he is trying his utmost to emphasize alliances and shared objectives, even as the evidence highlights their limitations.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Prime Minister, just as you're about to leave for the G-7, Israel carried out what it described as a preemptive strike on Iranian nuclear targets: 200 fighter jets, more than 300 bombs, 100 sites struck, including homes. Would you say Israel is justified in the action it's taken? 

I'm very concerned about the situation. It's obvious that for a long time we've had grave concerns about the nuclear program that Iran is putting together, and we absolutely recognize Israel's right to self-defense. We were not involved in this attack, and we're urging all sides to deescalate and negotiate as the way forward here. 

In March, US National Intelligence made it public that they did not believe Iran was developing nuclear weapons. 1 Has something changed? 

1 On March 26, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said
  the intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader
  Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.” But she also warned that the past
  year has seen “an erosion of a decades long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public, likely emboldening
  nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus. Iran's enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest
  levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons.”

I won't go into the intelligence assessments, but we are gravely concerned. I've just had a call with President Macron and Chancellor Merz and we are all on the same page. We're all saying de-escalate, but none of us were involved in the actual attack. 

Does that mean you're also gravely concerned about this very big preemptive military action? I mean, you're concerned about Iran's nuclear program. Are you also concerned about Israel's choice of action? 

I'm going to speak to Prime Minister Netanyahu shortly after this interview, so obviously that'll be a topic of discussion. Look, I do recognize Israel's right to self-defense. But I'm very concerned about the escalation of this situation, which is why, along with Germany and France, we're really clear that de-escalation is what is needed here. 

Would the UK therefore help defend Israel from Iranian attack as it has done before? 2 

2 When Iran launched a missile and drone attack against Israel in April last year, Britain's Royal Air Force shot down a number of Iranian drones.

This is happening in real time as we speak, and I'm not going to go into operational matters. But as I say, the principle of Israel's right to self-defense is absolutely clear, and we stand by that. But this is a fast-moving situation, as you will understand.

Listen to Big Take: Bloomberg's Keir Starmer Interview

At the same time, we have the ongoing situation in Gaza, the suffering there, something that you have called “intolerable” and “appalling.” Three weeks ago, you made this very strong statement 3 with Canada and France, which called for three things: for Hamas to release the hostages, for Israel's military operations in Gaza to cease, and for Israel to let aid into Gaza in accordance with the UN. None of those things have happened. What action will you take now? 

3 Starmer has repeatedly supported Israel's right to defend itself following Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. But in May, the UK, France and Canada issued a joint statement opposing expanded Israeli operations in Gaza.

You'll have seen that we've taken action in relation to sanctions three weeks ago, but also more recently, 4 and it is important that we consider what other options we have. The situation in Gaza is absolutely intolerable. The aid arrangements are not adequate. We've been consistently calling for a return to the ceasefire and, of course, the release of the hostages. We're being very clear in our messaging on this and our coordination on this, and our willingness to take action such as sanctioning. 

4 On June 10, the UK sanctioned two Israeli government
  ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, for “inciting extremist violence” and “serious abuses of Palestinian
  human rights.” The move was criticized by the US and Israel.

Which you've already done. And as I said, there's been no change to the situation. An action you could take is recognizing a Palestinian state, and President Macron is leading a conference at the UN next week on that very subject.

We've got a longstanding policy as the Labour Party that recognition should be part of a process. Precisely what's going to happen in the conference next week, I think, is unclear, and obviously now the immediate issue is the Israeli attack overnight. But the principle we've always held is that the only long-term solution in relation to Palestine and the Middle East is a two-state solution, and although it seems further off now than perhaps it's seemed for some time, we have to be clear that is the only path through. 

Britain has a historic responsibility, doesn't it, and recognizing a Palestinian state was in your manifesto. Do you want to be the British prime minister who delivers that?

5 Here's an extract from that manifesto pledge: “Palestinian statehood is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people... We are committed to recognising a Palestinian state as a contribution to a renewed peace process which results in a two-state solution.”

We do have a special responsibility. You're absolutely right about that, and our manifesto was clear about our position on recognition. 5 But it must be the appropriate part of the process that will alleviate the situation and bring about meaningful change. 

Can you see the moment where you might have to do things independently of any process — because there isn't one? Through settlement expansion, the Israeli government is saying openly that it's trying to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.

Well, that's why we're talking to international partners about what can be done, what should be done, what's the appropriate path, and we'll continue to do that. I strongly believe that we are better, more effective when we're acting with allies, with others at the same time. That's why we took the approach we did on sanctions, and it's the same mindset that I bring to this. 

Let's turn to Russia. You've worked very hard to help the US administration see Ukraine slightly differently, to push them further towards greater action on Russia. You'll be seeing President Trump at the G-7 summit. Do you understand what he is trying to do on Russia?

President Trump wants to bring about an end to the conflict. I have no doubt about that. We are moving closer, I hope, to some sort of ceasefire, some sort of deal. President Zelenskiy has been absolutely clear that he wants an unconditional ceasefire. Putin, in my view, is dragging his heels, which is why I think it is important for us, together with others, to say there will be consequences if Russia doesn't come forward to an unconditional ceasefire.

It seemed that you thought you had persuaded President Trump on that when you went to Kyiv. 6 He talked tough for a while about Vladimir Putin, and then stopped. So is he going to pressure Mr. Putin?

6 This was on May 10, when Starmer traveled to Ukraine with three other European leaders who all called President Trump together. After the call, Starmer said, “Working with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions and increase our military aid for Ukraine's defense to pressure Russia back to the table.”

The path to peace is rarely straightforward, but I do believe that that is what President Trump wants. That is absolutely what the Ukrainians want. This is a war that's been waged on them by the aggressor, which is Russia, and so we are doing everything we can to bring about that outcome. I'm absolutely determined that the UK will play a leading part. Not only is this about the sovereignty of Ukraine, but it is also about our values in Europe, and the direct impact it has back here at home in the United Kingdom.  

Are you saying you believe that President Trump will bring in sanctions on Russia, new sanctions that might pressure Putin to come to the negotiating table? 

He said on a number of occasions that's what he would do. 

He also said he'd end the war in 24 hours. 

I do believe we're making progress, but it must be a lasting peace.

You have led on this idea of the coalition of the willing and a reassurance force for post-war Ukraine. Have you got a commitment from the US that it would provide air cover for that force to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine in the future?

7 The UK government coined the term “coalition of the willing” after an emergency summit of European leaders following a week of chaotic diplomacy sparked by President Trump's disastrous Oval Office meeting with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

President Trump has clearly said he'll have our back, and I've always been clear that there must be a US element to this. But on the other hand, I do think that Europe needs to step up. And that's why, along with President Macron, we have led on the coalition of the willing, which is to go at the pace of those that want to go furthest, rather than at the pace of those who are the most cautious. 7

By continuing, I agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

Having your back is not the same as saying “I will provide US air cover.” Bloomberg has been told that the US is refusing to commit to air cover for a post-war force.

I'm not going to get into the private discussions that we are having, but what I would say is this, that there are no two countries that act as closely together on defense, security and on intelligence-sharing as the US and the UK. And that aspect of our relationship is as strong today as it's ever been. 

Would you be prepared to put British troops on the ground as part of a post-war force in Ukraine, if there wasn't US air cover?

I've always said there needs to be US protection.

So if it's not there, what happens to the post-war force?

I have no reason to believe that the US and the UK can't act together as we've done historically for many, many years.  

There's another live bilateral issue, which is the state of your trade agreement. The timeframe you set for implementing it was two weeks, which would take us to next Wednesday. So will it be implemented in that timeframe? 

We're in the final stages of implementing now. 

Is that the same as within the two weeks, by next Wednesday? 

I'm hoping that we will complete it pretty soon. I mean, it's important that we do, but we're making good progress. There's nothing unexpected in the implementation, and so we haven't got any hiccups or obstacles. 8 

8 This was stronger language than we expected. The signals have been that the steel and aluminum parts of the agreement are proving trickier than the cars element. The US has raised concerns about China's ownership of British Steel, though the UK took effective control of the company in April.

Not long after the G-7 summit, you'll have the NATO summit. NATO wants you to spend 5% of GDP on defense by 2032, with 3.5% on core defense spending. Will you be committing to that? 

Let me go through what we've already committed to, which is 2.5% of GDP being spent on defense by 2027-28. I think that's earlier than most people thought and that's the biggest sustained increase in defense spending since the Cold War, with an ambition then to go to 3% in the next Parliament. 9

9 This “ambition” of Starmer's has been a point of contention. Critics have urged him to make a firmer commitment, and this week opposition MPs pointed out that the the government's published spending plans show defense flatlining at 2.6% of GDP between 2027 and the end of the decade, with no sign of ramping up to 3%.

There's been criticism that Europe hasn't carried its fair share of the burden. I think that's right. So I've said to European allies, we need to do more on spending, on capability and cooperation. Obviously, the precise wording that will be agreed at NATO is still a matter of some negotiation. 

Your current ambition is for 3% of GDP to be spent on defense by  2034. So could it be your ambition by the time of this summit to raise that to 3.5%? Because if you don't, you can't really claim to be the leading European nation in NATO. 

I had Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO, here in this room on Monday to discuss how we would go into this summit. He was very clear to me that he welcomed our uplift to 2.5%.

It's all good. It's just a long way from what he wants now—

Well no, but he also knows that we are— 

And the US says everyone's going to agree to this within weeks. So if we don't, it's going to be a very difficult summit. 

We're the only country that commits our nuclear capability to NATO, so I think NATO recognizes that the UK makes a huge contribution and I am absolutely determined that the summit will be a huge success and an opportunity to show the strength that we have as NATO allies, but also to send a very clear message to our adversaries. 

Finally, let's return to the UK. There are some concerns that the growth picture is not going to support your spending plans. Bloomberg looked into company filings and found that thousands of company directors have relocated out of the UK in the past year. Is this a group of people that you can really afford to lose? 

Let me put this in the context. We inherited a complete mess at the election. Almost everything was broken — the economy, the public services, you name it.

Which is why you raised taxes.

We had to take difficult but right decisions in the budget. Year one of this Labour government was to clear up the mess. We're now moving into phase two: Where are you putting your money? And I'm really proud that we're rolling out a program of real saver values in terms of investment.

Might an investor visa be something you're considering?

I want more investors to come into the country. I want top talent to come into the country. But I would just push back a little because we've had record investment into the UK since the last election. 10

10 It's unclear what figures Starmer was referring to here. Last October, ministers heralded a “record” £63 billion ($85 billion) worth of deals secured at a UK investment summit. But critics later said a quarter of the deals had been agreed before Labour took office.

The economy's lost about a quarter of a million jobs since autumn. So not all is as rosy as you suggest.

We have actually 500,000 more people at work than at the date of the last election.  

There is a Bloomberg analysis that more than a quarter of a million jobs have been lost. 

If you look at the number of people in work, it is 500,000 more than it was. If you look at the commitment to spending in the Strategic Defence Review, 11 there's 30,000 jobs in nuclear submarines. [Investment in the Sizewell C nuclear plant, which] we announced earlier this week, was 10,000 jobs, and my job is to make sure that good, well-paid, secure jobs are there, and to attract that investment. Global investors have a choice as to which country they put their money in. They chose not to put their money into the UK for many years before the election. Now we've had record inward investment. 

11 The UK's latest defense review, published earlier this month, includes plans to rebuild weapons stockpiles, expand its nuclear deterrence and invest in submarines and drones. But the harsh reality is Britain's arms industry has shrunk a lot in recent decades.

Final thought: Is President Trump coming in September for his state visit?

The Palace will organize the dates, but President Trump will be coming for his state visit. 

Is it this year?

I hope so. I'm really pleased that we will be able to showcase the close relationship we have between the UK and the US. And this will be a historic second visit from President Trump 12 — we're all looking forward to welcoming him here.

12 This invitation from King Charles III, handed over with a flourish by Starmer at the White House in February, has gone down very well with the US president. Trump has described the king as a “beautiful man, wonderful man.”

Stablecoins have become one of the hottest buzzwords in the world of finance as of late with US lawmakers on the cusp of passing the first guidelines for mainstream use of the cryptocurrencies designed to mirror the dollar. 

Everyone from banks to securities firms to fintech startups are experimenting with the tokens as a means of making payment systems faster and cheaper.

The US isn't budging from its opposition to a lower price cap on Russian oil sales, people familiar with the matter said, dampening European hopes that leaders meeting for a Group of Seven summit in Canada will agree to a cut.

A final decision rests with President Donald Trump and officials haven't lost all hope, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. But so far there's no movement from the position that the US spelled out at a meeting of G-7 finance ministers earlier this year, they said.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband, Mark, were shot and killed early Saturday in what appears to be a ""politically motivated assassination,"" Gov. Tim Walz said.

""Our state lost a great leader and I lost the dearest of friends,"" Walz, former Democratic candidate for vice president, said during a news conference.

Minnesota Democratic state senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were also each shot multiple times, Walz said. They remained alive as of Saturday morning.

""We are cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt,"" Walz said.

A manhunt is underway Saturday for a suspect who was impersonating a police officer at the victims' homes, authorities said.

Officials said that police responded to a call at about 2 a.m. local time that Hoffman and his wife had been shot.

Police were then ""proactively checking"" Hortman's house at around 3:35 a.m., and upon arrival, officers encountered an individual who ""immediately fired"" at them, Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said during a briefing.

The suspect escaped from the back of the house amid the exchange of gunfire, officials said.

Officials said that they identified the suspect's car, which had emergency lights and sirens resembling a police car.

Upon searching the suspect's car, officials also found a ""manifesto"" naming other lawmakers and officials.

The lawmakers' homes are about eight miles apart, in the northern suburbs of Minneapolis.

Trump has been ""briefed on the terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota,"" according to a statement.

Trump said that anybody involved will be prosecuted ""to the fullest extent of the law.""

""Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America,"" Trump continued.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi also said that she is ""closely monitoring developments in Minnesota after what appears to be a targeted attack against state lawmakers.""

Bondi said the FBI is on the ground in Minnesota and working with state and local law enforcement.

""This horrific violence will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" Bondi wrote on X.

Minnesota State Patrol warned the public not to attend planned demonstrations across the state on Saturday ""out of an abundance of caution"" due to the ""targeting shootings of state lawmakers overnight.""

""Out of an abundance of caution my Department of Public Safety is recommending that people do not attend any political rallies today in Minnesota until the suspect is apprehended,"" Walz wrote on X.

Thousands of demonstrations are planned nationwide as part of ""No Kings Day"" to protest President Donald Trump's policies.

Statements condemning the violence from lawmakers and officials around the country poured in following the attacks

Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin said that his ""heart is broken"" by the ""senseless murders.""

""This senseless violence must end,"" Martin said in a statement.

""These heinous murders are a reflection of the extremism and political violence that have been fomented in our country,"" he continued.

""Lawmakers should be able to do their job without fear for their lives.""

Lindsay Lohan credits her ability to juggle her hectic work schedule as an actress and her responsibilities as a mom to her consistent, yet simple, morning routine.

Lohan, who's promoting her ""Freakier Friday"" sequel, starts off each day like many other people — with mindfulness, a meal and a workout.

""I love having a routine, and I like schedules,"" she said in a May 27 interview with Elle. ""So, my morning routine: Waking up, writing in my journal, sipping my green tea, breakfast with my son. And then Pilates, making sure I go.""

A decade ago, Lohan moved to Dubai for a reset. There, she met her husband, Bader Shammas, and in 2023, had her son, Luai. Around that time, she'd just ended a long break from acting. Though she's constantly back and forth from her home overseas to New York and Los Angeles, she tries to keep the same routine.

""It's hard in L.A. Even taking my son to the park in L.A., I get stressed,"" said Lohan, 38. ""It's all about balance and, as I said, routine. Especially when you have a kid, routine is the most important thing. And whatever their routine is, I've got to live by that.""

Her commitment to self-care and having a consistent morning regimen, she added, came from a lesson from her co-star and work mom, Jamie Lee Curtis, who taught her ""to always take care of yourself first. Because without that, how can you do everything for everyone else?""

Experts like bestselling author and personal growth expert Mel Robbins tend to agree with Curtis' advice. Robbins learned the lesson firsthand unintentionally after not paying attention to her own mental health early in parenthood. That seemed to lead to increased stress and anxiety in her child.

The ""single best thing"" parents can do is to get ahead of those issues early, she said on a May 6 episode of ""The Oprah Podcast.""

Starting your day with mindfulness, physical activity or time with your kids — as opposed to checking your emails or calendar — can boost your happiness and fulfillment, experts say. 

Journaling every morning, as Lohan does, can have a real impact: Just 15 minutes a day can help you clarify your thoughts and feelings, improve your problem solving skills and even help you recover from trauma, bestselling authors Deepak Chopra and Kabir Sehgal wrote for CNBC Make It in July 2019.

Putting pen to paper at least three to five days a week could significantly improve your physical and mental health, they said. They recommended reflecting on topics like advice you'd give your younger self, or 10 things you wish other people knew about you.

""If you're new to journaling, the easiest way to begin is to find a time and place where you won't be disturbed, and just start writing,"" they wrote.

Dedicating a portion of your morning to having fun is important too, says psychologist Laura Pendergrass, who advises Fortune 500 companies.

""Self-care in the form of fun is just as important as anything else we do to take care of ourselves,"" she said in 2022. ""We recognize the importance of recess for kids and build it into their school time, but we forget the importance of play as adults. It's up to us to create our own enrichment opportunities to do something fun or creative and inject color into what could otherwise be a gray day.""

There are all sorts of ways for consumers to misuse credit cards, from failing to pay monthly bills in full to running up your balance. But here's one risky behavior that experts say you likely haven't heard of: ""credit cycling.""

Credit cards come with a spending limit. Cardholders are usually aware of this limit, which represents the overall cap to how much they can borrow. The limit resets with each billing statement when users pay their bill in full and on time.

Users who credit-cycle will reach that limit and quickly pay down their balance; this frees up more headroom so consumers can effectively charge beyond their typical allowance.

Doing this occasionally is usually not a big deal, experts said. It's akin to driving a few miles per hour over the speed limit — something less likely to get a driver pulled over for speeding, said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com.

But consistently ""churning"" through available credit comes with risks, Rossman said.

For example, card issuers may cancel a user's card and take away their reward points, experts said. This might negatively impact a user's credit score, they said.

""If there's even the slightest chance credit cycling can go sideways, it's best not to do it and look for alternatives,"" said Bruce McClary, senior vice president at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. ""You have to be very careful.""

The average American's credit card limit was about $34,000 at the end of the second quarter of 2024, according to Experian, one the three major credit bureaus. (This was the limit across all their cards.)

The amount varies across generations, and according to factors like income and credit usage, according to Experian.

It's understandable why some consumers would want to credit cycle, experts said.

Certain consumers may have a relatively low credit limit, and credit cycling might help them pay for a big-ticket purchase like a home repair, wedding or a costly vacation, experts said. Others may do it to accelerate the rewards and points they get for making purchases, they said.

But card issuers would likely see repeat offenders as a red flag, Rossman said.

Maxing out a card frequently may run afoul of certain terms and conditions, or signal that a user is experiencing financial difficulty and struggling to stay within their budget, he said.

Issuers may also view it as a potential sign of illegal activity like money laundering, he said.

""You could be putting yourself at risk by appearing to be a risk in that way,"" McClary said.

If a card issuer penalizes a credit-cycling customer by closing their account, it could have negative repercussions for their credit score, experts said.

Credit utilization is the share of one's outstanding debt relative to their credit limit. Keeping utilization relatively low generally helps boost one's credit score, while a high rate generally hurts it, McClary said.

Experts generally recommend keeping credit utilization below 30%, and below 10% if you really want to improve your credit score.

A canceled card would reduce one's overall credit limit, raising the odds that a user's credit utilization rate would increase if they have outstanding debt on other credit cards, McClary said.

Further, a card company could flag misuse as a reason for the account closure, potentially making the user look like more of a risk to future creditors, he added.

Consistently butting up against one's credit limit also increases the chances of accidentally breaching that threshold, McClary said. Doing so could lead creditors to charge over-limit fees or raise a user's interest rate, he said.

Consumers who credit-cycle should be cognizant of any recurring monthly subscriptions or other charges that might inadvertently push them over the limit, he said.

Instead of credit cycling, consumers may be better served by asking their card issuer for a higher credit limit, opening a new credit card account or spreading payments over more than one card, Rossman said.

As a general practice, Rossman is a ""big fan"" of paying down one's credit card bill early, such as in the middle of the billing cycle instead of waiting for the end. (To be clear, this isn't the same as credit cycling, since consumers wouldn't be paying down their balance early in order to spend beyond their allotted credit.)

This can reduce a consumer's credit utilization rate — and boost one's credit score — since card balances are generally only reported to the credit bureaus at the end of the monthly billing cycle, he said.

""It can be a good way to improve your score, especially if you use your card a lot,"" he said.

Gap was one of the most popular retail names of the 1980s and 1990s, but fell out of favor among consumers at the start of the new millennium. From fiscal 2001 to 2021, the brand closed about 2,000 stores and annual sales fell by about $3.5 billion.

Despite multiple turnaround attempts from a revolving door of CEOs, the company couldn't sustain momentum.

""They would have a couple quarters where things looked like they were doing well. They would over buy the inventory, then they would promote it. Then promoting kills the brand equity,"" said Barclays senior retail analyst Adrienne Yih. ""The brands weren't strong enough to drive full price selling, so they were always on promo.""

In 2023, CEO Richard Dickson took the helm of Gap, which owns its namesake banner, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta. Dickson came from toymaker Mattel where he is largely credited for the revival of the Barbie brand. One of Dickson's first moves at the apparel retailer was hiring fashion designer Zac Posen as the company's creative director.  

Posen has helped to put Gap back into the cultural conversation by dressing celebrities like Demi Moore, Timothée Chalamet, Anne Hathaway and Laura Harrier for splashy red carpet events. However, Posen's main focus is on the Old Navy brand where he serves as chief creative officer. 

Re-energizing Old Navy is important because it accounts for more than half of Gap's revenue. In fiscal 2024, Gap grew overall sales by 1%, driven mostly by growth at Old Navy. While that may seem nominal, its underlying business is more profitable.

""They are growing that 1% on the highest gross margins that they have had in the past 20 years. When you finally do grow sales, you want to grow it in an extraordinarily high profit generating and healthy manner,"" said Yih.

In order to get back to growth, Gap had to shrink first. The company closed hundreds of stores over the past decade and laid off thousands of employees in 2023 as it worked to clean up its balance sheet.

""We had unprofitable stores, unprofitable markets, where we did store closures. We moved international businesses to partners, joint ventures,"" said Gap brand president and CEO Mark Breitbard. ""We consolidated our SKUs, we rationalized styles, improved quality dramatically. So all of those things, including some things like reducing costs, which are key to making a business healthy but not fun. Those were setting up a foundation for us to layer on a creative renaissance, really, for the brand.""

Still, there's more work to be done. Banana Republic and Athleta are not seeing the same consistency in same-store sales growth as Gap and Old Navy. While smaller brands, together they accounted for more than 20% of company-wide net sales in fiscal 2024.

Plus, uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff policies has created a challenging retail landscape. Despite beating Wall Street's earnings expectations for its fiscal first-quarter report, Gap saw its stock fall 15% on news that tariffs, if they remain in place as is, would cost the company between $100 million and $150 million.

Here's my first dilemma of the day: the new Luckin Coffee near my office in Hong Kong wants me to download their app for a $2 drink. Without it, it's $3.75.

Fine. I register, get a WhatsApp code and scroll through their menu: fruity Americanos, a seasonal kale tea and the coconut milk latte — a bestseller with five sweetness levels.

The menus are something else. This coconut comes from Luckin's own grove in Indonesia, it says, blessed by volcanic ash and ocean nutrients. The milk is cold-pressed within four hours of cracking the fruit open. Sure, Luckin. I click iced, no added sugar.

Luckin, China's largest coffee chain, is betting its kaleidoscopic offerings and clever pricing can take on Starbucks globally. The chain landed in Hong Kong late last year and now has a dozen stores across the city. 

This branch alone has seven other coffee shops nearby, including Cotti Coffee, a rival founded by former Luckin executives (who were ousted over an accounting scandal that got Luckin delisted from Nasdaq. But that's another story). Cotti just opened stores in New York, and Luckin is set to follow.

I try paying with credit card instead of Chinese e-payment options, but that means entering my billing details and address in-app. Too much work. I bail and use the kiosk instead at the higher price. Still need to input my phone number though.

My 16-ounce drink promptly arrives. Chestnut brown in color, my first sip is bitter and refreshing. One stir with the paper straw and it turns pale blonde, the coconut's silky, nutty sweetness taking over. After a few more compulsive sips, it gets heavy.

Mainstream coffee culture is converging globally, and Luckin is making it more digital, efficient — and gimmicky. Their basics — black coffee, oat milk latte — hook customers looking for a cheap caffeine fix (they cost roughly $2 each in Asia). Here, Starbucks has no real edge. ""It comes down to value for money,"" an Australian buying a mocha from Luckin tells me.

Office workers stream through, grabbing drinks pre-ordered on the app. Few linger. Andy Chan, 38, emerges from the nearby subway station and picks up his usual Americano en route to the office. ""It's normal,"" the IT worker says of the quality. ""And quite a bit cheaper than Starbucks.""

Hours later, I walk to the Starbucks down the block. Patrons are on their laptops or deep in conversation. Similar to Luckin, the drink offerings rotate through supposedly regional flavors, like matcha latte with tofu pudding. This branch just went cashless, notable in cash-stubborn Hong Kong.

I order a yuzu cold brew, which is more like citrus slushy dunked in coffee. Nearly $6 for 12 ounces feels steep after Luckin, but the sign says the cold brews are steeped for 20 hours. I ask for a glass after the barista automatically reaches for a paper cup. The flavors click into focus once the sweet, herbal ice crystals soak up the coffee. As someone who usually drinks black coffee or a flat white at most, my two caffeinated desserts today have me wired.

Businesses say they reward loyalty. Starbucks' take is getting you to lend them money while locking you in. The Seattle-based chain sits on $1.85 billion from its stored-value cards and loyalty programs as of the first quarter this year. A portion typically goes unredeemed — turning into revenue. Sales have been declining, but Starbucks has tapped interest-free capital this way for years.

If Starbucks is acting like a bank, Luckin is like the startup gunning for scale. With coffee prices rising, chains like Luckin are grabbing market share through high turnover and compact spaces that drive down costs. Some people want the coffeehouse theater; others prize convenience and live digitally. Out of the latter, Luckin is building a treasure trove of data. 

Viral stunts like its Moutai liquor-infused latte help (I wouldn't try their kale tea, but this I would). Luckin launched nearly 120 items in 2024 alone, likely keeping Starbucks' Asian R&D teams up at night.

Coffee is splintering into different worlds. You can get a pricey pour-over with wine-like tasting notes, an espresso at a historical cafe, a cortado at a boutique spot, or a boba-like latte at one of Luckin's 20,000+  outlets. Luckin may be turbocharging coffee fads with its dizzying flavor rollouts, but its core market of price-sensitive consumers aren't going anywhere.

The future has room for different models — there are enough caffeine addicts and social drinkers to sustain various empires. But there's no denying the pressure is on incumbents like Starbucks to refresh their identity before third space becomes third choice.

Earning a household income of $150,000 might sound like a lot, but in many of the biggest cities in the U.S. it still puts you squarely in the middle class.

Middle-class households earn between two-thirds and twice the local median income, according to Pew Research Center's definition. Nationally, the middle class spans incomes from $51,813 to $155,438.

By the same measure, San Jose, California, has the highest middle-class income range of the largest U.S. cities. The city's median household income is $136,229 — nearly double the national median of $77,719. That means middle-class residents in San Jose earn between $90,819 and $272,458 per year.

Large cities like San Jose and New York are economic hubs with a high concentration of high-paying jobs in sectors such as tech, finance and professional services, which is part of why median incomes tend to be higher in these places. But higher earnings are often offset by steep living costs — especially for housing.And while earning $100,000 has long been seen as a milestone, in a city like San Jose it puts a household at the lower end of the local middle-class range.  For residents, that might help explain why earning six figures doesn't feel like it stretches as far as it once did.

Here's how much you'd need to earn to be considered middle class in each of the 15 largest U.S. cities, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data, which adjusts all income to 2023 dollars, ranked from the highest to lowest median income.

In this article

While investors may have been put off by bitcoin's volatility in its early years, a few factors are emerging that will make the flagship crypto a key part of a portfolio, according to Coatue Management's Philippe Laffont.

The founder of the tech-focused hedge fund spoke Thursday at Coinbase's State of Crypto Summit in New York City.

For starters, while bitcoin has managed to surge nearly 13% in 2025, Laffont said that the cryptocurrency's volatility has come down over time. Bitcoin's dramatic price swings have been a deterrent for potential investors in the crypto – and at one point, this volatility kept Coatue from getting into bitcoin, he said.

""It's intriguing to me that maybe … the cost of getting into bitcoin is shrinking,"" Laffont said on stage Thursday at Coinbase's State of Crypto Summit in New York City. ""If the beta shrinks, that would be very interesting."" Beta is a measurement of an asset's volatility compared to that of the market.

Institutional investors' move to embrace bitcoin was also a sign of maturity for the cryptocurrency, he said. Consider that BlackRock was one of the leaders of the charge to bring bitcoin ETFs to market.

Further, Laffont pointed out bitcoin's performance in 2022 and how it has changed over time. The flagship cryptocurrency fell more than 60% in 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 33%. In contrast, from April 2 to April 10 — the days following the announcement of President Donald Trump's tariffs — bitcoin retreated about 5% and the Nasdaq fell more than 6%.

Additionally, the number of bitcoin wallets that have held the crypto for at least a month and sell their full position has come down ""a lot,"" Laffont said, which suggests investors are holding onto the crypto for the long term rather than trading it.

Bitcoin accounts for a small amount of the world's net worth – about $2 trillion out of $500 trillion, he said. If one assumes bitcoin will continue to grow and be seen as valuable by more people, then it ""has to become more central"" to a portfolio, Laffont said.

Coatue has invested in private and public crypto companies like data provider Dune Analytics, bitcoin miner Hut 8 and artificial intelligence play CoreWeave. The latter company has a partnership with bitcoin miner Core Scientific. The bitcoin opportunity wasn't immediately clear to Laffont, however.

""Every night, I wake up at about three in the morning and I go, 'What an idiot. Why didn't I invest more in bitcoin?'"" he said.

Laffont described his investment philosophy as one that emphasizes the importance of simple, ""obvious"" ideas over ""complicated"" ones. While crypto market participants have deliberated over the use cases and potential of the cryptocurrency for years, Laffont said he overlooked the simplest aspect of all.

""That … as long as other people think it's valuable, it gets more valuable over time – and that's what we missed,"" he said. ""Now I go back and I say, this is crazy – why wouldn't everyone have one or two or 3% or 4% of your assets in something like bitcoin that … protects you against inflation?""

Laffont identified three cohorts of his client base: those who are hands off and leave the investing to him, those wondering ""why did you miss one of the biggest trends in the world,"" and the risk-averse ones who feel comfortable ""as long as you don't dabble in crypto.""

The latter ""is the dying population,"" Laffont said. ""Every year there's a little bit less of them. That's the spectrum that you get from institutional investors. Hopefully, we see that distribution continue to change.""

While Laffont has become more of a bitcoin enthusiast than he used to be, he still told summit attendees not to get carried away and to approach the cryptocurrency with basic investing principles.

""For those of you that think bitcoin is going to be important, my recommendation is never make it such a big portion of your portfolio that it becomes the driving factor of the portfolio,"" he said. ""You're going to make way more money by having a smaller position that you can keep for 10 years than the big one that worries you all the time.""

Many American families are increasingly struggling to keep up with the cost of living in most of the 50 U.S. states. 

The U.S. median household income rose between 2022 and 2023 to just over $80,000 a year, according to the most recent Census Bureau data. But a family of four needs at least $186,618 a year to live comfortably in Mississippi in 2025, the country's most affordable state, found a SmartAsset study that published on June 4.

""Living comfortably"" means having enough income to dedicate 50% to necessary costs, 30% to discretionary wants and 20% to debt payments and saving, also known as following the 50/30/20 budget, according to the study.

In Massachusetts, the most expensive state in the U.S., a family of four needs more than $300,000 per year to meet that threshold. Costs of living grew by over 4% in that state from 2024, slightly more than the national average of 3.87%, SmartAsset's analysis found. 

Boston has the highest cost of raising a child in the country, a separate SmartAsset study recently found, and much of that total cost comes from child care. Raising a child in Boston costs an estimated $39,221 per year, including $23,800 just for child care, according to SmartAsset.

Having children typically gives families other added costs, too: food, supplies and, in some instances, increased housing costs.

The cost of living for families in other states may not be quite as high as in Massachusetts, but three states — Vermont, New Jersey and Montana — are on track to rapidly catch up, with double-digit growth rates from 2024, found SmartAsset's report.

On the flip side, overall costs of living actually shrank from 2024 in six states, the report said: Hawaii, New York, Georgia, Delaware, Michigan and Iowa.

SmartAsset used the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's living wage calculator to estimate the annual cost of essentials in each state. MIT calculates family living costs for two working adults and two children and includes essentials like housing and food for all those family members as well as child care.

Here's the income it takes for families of four to live comfortably in all 50 states in 2025, according to the study:

I had no idea what I was doing in 2018, when I launched my Amazon business, selling card games that help people develop emotional intelligence skills. 

At the time, I had two part-time jobs, was getting a full-time master's degree at Harvard, and was raising three young kids. I had to squeeze in my side hustle alongside all my other obligations. 

Just as I gained traction, a few years later, bringing in over $1.7M a year in sales, the economy shifted, consumer habits changed, and competition grew. The number of card games on the market surged while consumers tightened their wallets in response to economic uncertainty. I didn't give up. Instead, I was able to adapt and find even greater success than I anticipated.

Today, I have five income streams (and counting). I've learned that the real work in building wealth isn't just about starting, it's about staying in the game through ongoing reinvention. 

Markets have cycles. Many side hustles have expiration dates. The mental game of entrepreneurship depends on your ability to stay agile, adaptive and resilient in the face of uncertainty.

These five books didn't just help me get started. They've helped me evolve, recalibrate, and keep going.

If you want to build lasting wealth, you need a framework for making smart, strategic decisions. In this book, academic and entrepreneur Scott Galloway breaks down four key variables for financial security: discipline, stoicism, time and diversification.

This playbook pushed me to ask not just what I can do, but what's truly worth doing with my limited time and energy. It helped me reevaluate how I weigh risks, spot opportunities, and make trade-offs across my income streams.

Whether you're working toward your first six figures or scaling your next income stream, this book offers pragmatic action items to help you build better financial habits and make more informed decisions.

One of the hardest parts of starting and running a business is making decisions without all the facts. In ""Thinking in Bets,"" Annie Duke — a former professional poker player turned decision strategist — teaches readers how to evaluate their choices by thinking in probabilities, not certainties.

This book taught me to separate luck from skill, and outcome from process. Just because a decision didn't work out, doesn't mean it was the wrong call. And just because a decision worked, it doesn't mean it was a smart move. 

That perspective shift gave me the clarity to take bolder risks, grounded in logic, rather than emotion.

Her ""thinking in bets"" framework encouraged me to ask myself: What are the odds this will work? What's the downside if it doesn't? This helped me navigate uncertainty with more confidence and fewer regrets.

This book is a master class in long-term thinking, rational decision-making, and investing. It compiles eleven of the late Charlie Munger's most influential talks.

Munger, known for his enduring work with his long-time friend Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway, was renowned for his multidisciplinary approach to decision-making. 

I appreciated how this book taught me how to think, not just what to think. I learned to apply the principles of psychology, economics and engineering to make better decisions in business and in life.

One of his signature ideas, ""invert, always invert,"" taught me to examine problems from the opposite angle. This mindset has helped me to work through complex dilemmas and mental roadblocks. I still revisit this book to sharpen my thinking when the path forward feels uncertain.

Every business moves through phases of ascent, plateau and decline. Author Ryan Holiday shows how unchecked ego can sabotage success at every stage — whether you're turning a profit, becoming a viral sensation or facing tough setbacks.

Through historical examples and personal anecdotes, Holiday explores how ego clouds our judgment, resists feedback and blinds us to our shortcomings. In my keynote speeches on emotional intelligence, I often emphasize the same idea to leaders and teams I talk to: self-awareness is your edge.

This book helped normalize the highs and lows I've experienced as a founder and creator. It also gave me foresight into the potential scenarios I might face in the future. Most of all, it reminded me to be clear-eyed, grounded, and vigilant about not being influenced by an undue sense of self-importance.

How do we know when it's time to change course? This book explores that exact question, and reminds us to pause and listen to our inner voice over the noise around us.

Transitions in business and life often go hand in hand. They bring discomfort, uncertainty, and the temptation to rush through the hard parts. But ""the next day"" after a big decision is when we begin to consciously choose what to carry forward and what to leave behind.

This book has provided comfort and clarity, and helped me navigate both personal and professional shifts. It reminds me that starting over is still forward motion, and the way that I handle change can shape everything that comes next.

 CoinGlass data concludes that Bitcoin investors should ""hold 100%"" of their portfolio as BTC price upside still has plenty of room to hit new all-time highs. 

Key points:

Bitcoin all-time highs are no reason to sell, according to a list of 30 “bull market peak” indicators.

Not one of the 30 indicators has flashed a long-term top signal so far.

Market participants remain divided about whether BTC price action can really keep printing new records.

Bitcoin (BTC) investors should “hold 100%” at current prices — even amid all-time highs and Q2 gains of 30%.

A list of 30 bull market top indicators from monitoring resource CoinGlass still demands up to 120% more BTC price upside.

Bitcoin may be consolidating after repeated new all-time highs, but a giant list of classic onchain indicators shows no signs of market exhaustion at all.

CoinGlass' curated “bull market peak” selection contains 30 potential selling triggers, and aims to catch long-term BTC price tops. Currently, not a single one of its components is flashing a top signal.

“According To these models $BTC will be $135K to $230K this cycle,” popular trader Cas Abbe wrote in part of an X post on the topic on June 13.

Abbe, in particular, highlighted three indicators — Pi Cycle Top, Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) and long-term Relative Strength Index (RSI) — to demonstrate that the Bitcoin bull market still has plenty of room to run.

“This ain't the top,” he concluded.

Cointelegraph was already tracking Pi Cycle Top and MVRV data in March, noting that prior bull markets had all ended with “overheating” visible onchain.

CoinGlass currently categorizes BTC as a “hold 100%” asset based on cues taken from the top 30 indicators.

Not all market participants are so confident in the outlook for BTC/USD, especially in the short term.

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin's rebound from April lows under $75,000 has now seen three rejections from resistance as viewed through the Bollinger Bands volatility indicator.

This week, the Bands' creator, John Bollinger, warned that the BTC price uptrend may give way to consolidation or even a full reversal.

Other market participants likewise doubt Bitcoin's ability to build on existing all-time highs.

Among them is popular trader Roman, who this week likened the current climate to late 2021, just before the start of Bitcoin's most recent bear market, during which BTC/USD fell 80%.

“This price action seems more distributive and not accumulative/bullish. Almost following the same choppiness at the end of 2021,” he argued to X followers.

Counterarguments to the bull market fizzling commonly revolve around institutional demand — something conspicuously lacking four years ago — as well as a more mature market environment.

The cryptocurrency market shows a sign of disruption as major tokens record a sharp drop toward critical support levels. Bitcoin in particular, has relinquished all its gains from this week, highlighting rising bearish sentiment.

Following in the footsteps, the altcoin market witnesses a similar price trend with Ethereum & XRP price constantly failing to break out of their consolidated price trend. With this, investors are actively looking for important watch zones as the market could expect increased volatility due to the ongoing geopolitical tensions.

Are you one of many to understand the market possibilities? In this article we will uncover the possible short-term targets of Bitcoin, Ethereum, & XRP tokens.

After recording a top of $110,198 this week, the Bitcoin price has experienced a strong selloff, resulting in its value recording a low of $104,161 yesterday. This has resulted in an increased FOMO-like situation in the crypto market. Moreover, with a drop of over 50% in its daily trading volume its valuation stands at $2.08 trillion.

Despite this downturn, BTC has formed an expanding channel pattern in the daily time frame. This suggests a high possibility of a reversal pattern in the upcoming time.

The 50-day EMA acts as a strong support around the $102,655 mark, indicating a major retest point around that level. Furthermore, the 200-day EMA displays a constant rise in the daily time frame, suggesting a building momentum.

On the other hand, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a rising red histogram with its 12 & 26-day EMAs witnessing a bearish crossover. This indicates a mixed short term price action for BTC.

If the odds began to favor the bulls, this could result in the largest crypto token retesting its upper price targets of $107,281 & $109,631 respectively. Conversely, a bearish setback may pull the value toward its low of $104,810 or lower support of $102,470 during the upcoming week.

The ETH coin price continues recording a sideways price action by constantly hovering around the $2,500 mark this week. With this, it has formed a strong consolidated price action between $2,800 and $2,400 range. Moreover, with a project valuation of $307.28 billion, it dominates by 9.3689%.

In the above price chart, the trendline currently remains above 50, 100, & 200-day EMAs, and is currently retesting the 20-day EMA, suggesting strong bullish momentum. These Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) play a vital role during price corrections or market rallies, providing potential “safe exit points” for short-term investors.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has failed to breach the overbought range, resulting in it dropping toward its neutral point in the daily time frame. This type of trend suggests an increasing bearish action for Ethereum in the crypto market.

The Ethereum price could retest its immediate resistance level of $2,603 if the bulls regain momentum. Further upper resistance levels still remain around the $2,750 and $3,000 respectively. Conversely, a bearish reversal may result in it retesting its crucial support trend level of $2,400 or $2,205 shortly.

Ripple's XRP price falls prey to a similar price action as it records a consolidated price action over the brief period of time. Consequently, this altcoin's dominance has dropped to 3.86% this week with a market capitalization of $127.015 billion. However, despite such action, it continues to maintain its 4th position in the market.

The Stoch RSI trendlines are at 36.24 (blue) and 52.86 (orange). The sharp drop toward the halfway mark suggests a weak bullish sentiment for altcoin in the 1D time frame. Notably, this indicator helps traders identify the overbought and oversold conditions more accurately than traditional RSI.

The Bollinger Bands (BB) records a narrow passage suggesting a decline in the price action for the XRP price. Adding to this, the price trend has dropped below the Simple Moving Average (SMA) line and is on the verge of retesting its lower band.

A successful retest around the $2.14 mark could result in it heading toward its upper price targets of $2.35 and $2.57 respectively. Conversely, its key support trendline still remains around the $2 mark if the market turns bearish.

Data shows the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen weekly inflows five times the recent average, while Bitcoin has seen a slowdown in momentum.

Ethereum Spot ETFs Have Seen 154,000 ETH In Inflows This Week

In a new post on X, the analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the netflow related to the US-based Ethereum spot ETFs. The “spot ETFs” refer to investment vehicles that allow an alternate means of exposure to a given asset.

This means that with a spot ETF, a trader can ‘invest' into an asset without having to directly own it. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this is especially relevant, as the ETFs trade on traditional platforms. Some investors may not want to fiddle with digital asset exchanges and wallets, so the ETFs offer them a familiar path into cryptocurrencies.

The option of the spot ETFs is a relatively recent one in the sector, with Bitcoin's version gaining approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the start of 2024 and Ethereum's in mid-2024.

Below is a chart that shows how the netflows related to the latter's spot ETFs have looked during the past month.

From the graph, it's visible that the Ethereum US spot ETFs have been witnessing net inflows for the last few weeks, a sign that there has been demand for the coin from the traditional investors.

“This week alone, they've seen 154K ETH in inflows – 5x higher than their recent weekly average,” notes Glassnode. “For context: the biggest single-day ETH inflow this month was 77K ETH on June 11th.”

While the trend has been that of growth for Ethereum, it has looked a bit more mixed when it comes to the number one digital asset, Bitcoin.

As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin US spot ETFs have also seen positive netflows this week. The scale of the inflows, however, hasn't been anything impressive, as only around 7,800 BTC has entered into the ETFs.

This is above average, but far lower than the highs witnessed in May, when at one point the daily inflow had reached a peak of 7,900 BTC, more than the inflows for the entire current week.

Last week, the Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed an outright negative netflow, so it seems the momentum has recently just been slower for the asset. In contrast, things have looked much more green for Ethereum indeed.

ETH Price

While Ethereum has been seeing consistent ETF inflows, its price has still underperformed against Bitcoin over the past day as it has dropped to $2,540, a decline of 7% compared to BTC's 2% loss.

Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has all chances to join the club of global macro assets and hit an almost $100 trillion capitalization. A new report by Etherealize indicates that ETH demonstrates some functions of digital oil, digital gold and the ultimate collateral for states and institutions.

Ethereum (ETH), the first programmable blockchain, might hit an enormous 14-digit capitalization in the coming years. With all Ethers in circulation valued at $90 trillion, a single ETH crypto will be trading over $740,000, a new report by Etherealize says.

Ethereum long-term valuation of $89T (~$740,000 per ETH) is possible at global scale.To reflect ETH's valuation potential as a global reserve asset, we must consider comparable global reserve assets as benchmarks. pic.twitter.com/R7m7fMhkTf

Such an insane upsurge will be driven by ETH accruing the functions of a global reserve macro asset. For instance, the report says, Ethereum (ETH) works not unlike digital oil, being the ""fuel for computations"" that can be stored and traded by reserve operators.

Just like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) demonstrates all features of digital gold, but with sustainable yield rates and ""productivity"" while deposited to DeFi mechanisms.

Also, Ether would be a digital replacement for the global bonds market as it can function as non-sovereign universal collateral that can be easily integrated into each and every financial system.

Last but not least, Ethereum's (ETH) volume surges step-by-step, increasing together with its activity and ecosystem growth.

Finally, Ethereum (ETH) is the monetary backbone of global programmable finance, which is another extremely powerful catalyst to its macro price rally.

As such, Ethereum (ETH) has all features of a global macro asset, and, given the average capitalization of such assets at $100 trillion, can be valued over $740,000 per coin.

As covered by U.Today previously, Bitcoin (BTC) expert Willy Woo called the orange coin the first new macro asset in 150 years.

Momentum is building again around XRP. A fresh wave of bullish XRP news has reignited talk of a potential run toward the $10 mark. While XRP remains at the center of this discussion, a new wave of altcoins is gaining attention as serious contenders. Among them is ZBNC, known for its focus on real-world payments and blockchain efficiency.

But even more notably, Remittix is stepping forward as a standout. With a clear use case in global crypto-to-fiat transfers and growing adoption, it is fast becoming the altcoin that not only competes but delivers.

Fresh XRP news is boosting market sentiment as analysts highlight growing momentum behind the asset. According to analysts, if XRP breaks and holds above the $3.40 mark and continues the trend, it could open the door to a $5 to $6 range in the next leg up. That level would follow a historical pattern where XRP sees rapid gains once key resistance levels are cleared.

In addition to technical signals, whale accumulation is on the rise again. Ripple's ongoing expansion in Asia and the Middle East is increasing demand through real-world cross-border payment use cases. As of May 2025, XRP saw a 10% price jump in a single week, according to Finance Magnates, after renewed optimism surrounding Ripple's legal clarity and ecosystem growth.

Notably, some crypto analysts now suggest XRP could reach as high as $10 by the end of 2025, with even loftier targets like $100 floated by high-profile voices citing XRP's growing role in global financial infrastructure.

As XRP fights to reclaim its highs, some investors are asking what the next breakout altcoin might be. ZBNC is emerging as a strong contender. Built to streamline blockchain-based financial transfers, ZBNC focuses on scalability, low fees and frictionless crypto-to-fiat solutions.

Unlike projects that rely solely on hype, ZBNC has been quietly building out solid infrastructure geared toward real-world adoption. Its architecture supports rapid, low-cost transactions and integrates with merchant tools designed for Web3 and fintech applications. This has begun to attract developers and businesses seeking an XRP-like solution with a smoother path to market.

With growing network activity and a focus on solving real problems, ZBNC is earning its place in the payment token conversation. Analysts say its trajectory aligns with a broader market trend: utility is outperforming speculation.

While both XRP and ZBNC are gaining momentum, Remittix is standing out by delivering real functionality today. The platform lets users convert over 100 cryptocurrencies into fiat and send funds directly to global bank accounts. There's no need for wallets, bridges or crypto-native complexity, just smooth, fast transfers that feel like traditional banking.

With over $15.6 million raised in its presale and expanding traction via the Remittix Pay API, the project is quickly gaining interest from individuals and businesses alike. It solves a core issue in crypto: how to actually spend it. For individuals who prioritize speed and cost over hype, Remittix is emerging as the practical solution.

The latest round of XRP news has recharged hopes that the $10 milestone is more than just a dream. Legal clarity, growing utility and steady accumulation trends suggest XRP may still have a major run ahead.

But the crypto market moves fast. New challengers like ZBNC are building rapidly, and projects like Remittix are proving that practical utility wins over speculation. With its ability to support seamless crypto-to-fiat payments for both individuals and businesses, Remittix stands out as the more immediate and usable solution. If you're looking for real-world impact, not just hype, Remittix may be the better bet.

Written By:Advertorial Team

Ethereum (ETH) is approaching the $4,000 mark, and investors are closely watching the following four altcoins: Dogecoin (DOGE), Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), and FloppyPepe (FPPE). Historically, during Ethereum price surges, altcoins often experience notable price movements.

FloppyPepe (FPPE) has recently attracted attention due to its incorporation of AI technologies into cryptocurrency, gaining interest from a variety of investors. Unlike many altcoins, FloppyPepe leverages AI through two platforms—FloppyAI (text-based) and FloppyX (video-based)—aiming to enhance content creation and user engagement.

FloppyPepe's smart contract has been audited by SolidProof, focusing on improving token security and transparency. Currently, in its presale phase priced at $0.00000035 per token, this altcoin offers token buyers early participation opportunities.

A bonus of 80% tokens is offered to early investors during presale purchases. To claim the bonus, buyers need to use the code FLOPPY80 at checkout.

Dogecoin (DOGE) remains popular due to its community-driven nature and public visibility. Historically, its growth has been driven significantly by social media and celebrity endorsements rather than technical utility alone.

According to Bitcoinsensus on X (formerly Twitter), DOGE is displaying a logarithmic upward trend within an ascending wedge pattern, suggesting potential upward price movement. Its longstanding community presence continues to maintain its market relevance.

Tron (TRX) continues to strengthen its presence through developments in DeFi, gaming, and stablecoin infrastructure. Analyst $Trader noted on X (formerly Twitter) that TRX is trending upward within an ascending channel. A recent pullback to the 50-day moving average could present potential buying opportunities.

Tron's capacity for high transaction throughput and strategic partnerships position it as a notable player in the altcoin market, attracting attention from investors interested in its development.

Chainlink (LINK) has established itself as an essential part of decentralized networks by providing oracle solutions that enable smart contracts to function reliably. As AI-driven applications and decentralized finance platforms continue to grow, Chainlink's role becomes increasingly crucial.

Crypto Avi highlighted on X (formerly Twitter) that LINK is attempting to break out of a bullish pennant formation on the daily chart, suggesting potential short-term upward momentum. Its integral role in Web3 and decentralized infrastructure highlights its strategic importance.

As Ethereum nears the $4,000 mark, these altcoins are drawing increased attention. Dogecoin maintains its social media-driven presence, Tron expands its functional ecosystem, Chainlink plays a pivotal role in decentralized networks, and FloppyPepe combines meme culture with AI technology.

Interested investors can consider these altcoins based on their preferences and investment strategies. FloppyPepe's presale continues, offering early investors a token bonus with the code FLOPPY80.

Oops, something went wrong

SonicStrategy shared that the Sonic blockchain's native token, $S, is set to be listed on Coinbase (COIN), one of the world's most trusted and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, as announced by Coinbase yesterday June 12th. Unlike conventional token listings for assets built on Ethereum or Solana, the inclusion of $S on Coinbase represents a full-stack integration of the Sonic network, a significant technical and strategic milestone. This integration opens the door to a new level of accessibility, legitimacy, and scalability for the Sonic ecosystem and all participants within it. he upcoming listing will enable Coinbase users to directly purchase $S using fiat currencies like USD and EUR, reducing barriers to entry and enhancing global liquidity. It also introduces the Sonic ecosystem to Coinbase's robust infrastructure-used by the majority of U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs-along with the potential for future integrations across DeFi, staking, and perpetual trading products.

The cryptocurrency and blockchain development ecosystem is facing an unprecedented surge in sophisticated malware campaigns targeting the open source supply chain.

Over the past year, threat actors have significantly escalated their attacks against Web3 developers by publishing malicious packages to trusted registries including npm and PyPI, exploiting the implicit trust developers place in these repositories.

These campaigns represent a calculated shift toward financially motivated attacks that leverage the unique vulnerabilities present in blockchain development environments.

The attack landscape has become increasingly concentrated, with approximately 75% of malicious blockchain-related packages hosted on npm, 20% on PyPI, and the remainder distributed across registries such as RubyGems and Go Modules.

While Ethereum and Solana continue to be the primary targets, recent campaigns have expanded to include TRON and TON platforms, indicating growing threat actor interest in a wider range of wallet formats and alternative layer-1 blockchain ecosystems.

Socket.dev analysts identified four recurring threat classes that dominate the current landscape: credential stealers, crypto drainers, cryptojackers, and clipboard hijackers.

These malicious packages exploit the unique attack surface created by blockchain developers' reliance on open source dependencies, combined with CI/CD pipelines that often lack strict dependency validation or isolation.

The threat actors leverage package lifecycle hooks such as postinstall in npm and setup.py in PyPI to trigger malicious behavior immediately upon installation, even when packages are never imported or actively used.

The financial impact of these attacks has been severe, with threat actors successfully extracting millions in cryptocurrency from compromised development environments.

The malware campaigns demonstrate sophisticated understanding of Web3 development workflows, targeting specific wallet paths, browser extensions, and development tools commonly used by blockchain developers.

The most sophisticated aspect of these supply chain attacks lies in their credential extraction capabilities, which have evolved far beyond simple file system scraping.

Modern credential stealers employ multi-layered approaches that combine direct file system access with runtime manipulation to capture sensitive cryptographic material from developer environments.

Advanced stealers implement monkey-patching techniques that intercept keypair generation at the library level without modifying source files.

In documented PyPI campaigns, malware intercepted Solana keypair creation by modifying library methods at runtime, capturing private keys during generation, encrypting them with hardcoded RSA-2048 public keys, and embedding the encrypted data in blockchain memo transactions sent to Solana Devnet.

This technique allows threat actors to retrieve and decrypt stolen credentials remotely while maintaining stealth.

Nation-state actors, particularly those linked to North Korea's Contagious Interview campaign, have weaponized trusted developer tools including linters, validators, and post-processing libraries to deliver credential stealers and backdoors.

These attacks bypass traditional security measures including multi-factor authentication and hardware wallets by compromising the development environment itself, establishing persistence through scheduled tasks and startup entries to ensure recurring access to victim systems.

An NFT scam shakes the professional football world. In Spain, six top-level players, including an Argentine world champion and two former FC Barcelona stars, are targeted by a judicial investigation. Accused of lending their image to a blockchain project resembling a fraud, they allegedly helped trap thousands of investors. The case, with complex financial ramifications, reveals possible abuses when sports fame and crypto technologies intertwine without safeguards.

While many crypto exchanges like Binance warn about the resurgence of scams involving fake tokens, a judicial investigation opened by the Barcelona court informs about a suspected fraud involving NFTs linked to the football world.

Twelve complaints have been filed in Spain, but according to estimates, the number of victims could number in the thousands.

Indeed, the company Shirtum Europa SLU, specialized in selling NFTs representing professional football players, which were supposed to be exchangeable via an app… never saw the light of day.

The facts noted by investigators are precise and particularly serious :

The latter, David Rozencwaig, Manel Ángel Torras, Marc Alberto Torras, and Manuel Morillas, are charged with eleven counts, including fraud, embezzlement, false advertising, market manipulation, and money laundering.

Investigators believe they orchestrated a sophisticated operation using athletes' fame to legitimize a technically hollow project whose goal was purely speculative.

Among the names mentioned in the complaint are well-known international football personalities: Alejandro Papu Gómez, world champion with Argentina, Javier Saviola and Ivan Rakitić, two former FC Barcelona players, as well as Lucas Ocampos, Alberto Moreno, and Nico Pareja.

While investigators do not consider them the masterminds of the operation, their active role in promoting the Shirtum project is highlighted. The promoters of Shirtum benefited from the collaboration of the footballers, led by Papu Gómez, whose friendship with David Rozencwaig, one of the company's founders, is emphasized.

The footballers allegedly lent their image and participated in promotional videos to legitimize the platform, which facilitated investor confidence. However, the promised application was never launched, and the NFTs purchased today hold no value or concrete utility.

Although the players claim they did not have a decision-making role in the company's management, their involvement raises questions, particularly regarding the boundary between promotional collaboration and moral co-responsibility.

The case could have serious legal consequences for Shirtum's leaders but raises profound questions about the use of fame in the crypto world. As European regulators prepare to tighten rules around crypto advertising, this case could set a precedent on influencers', including athletes', duty of care in promoting financial products. As hearings progress, the Shirtum scandal might well become a textbook case of possible abuses in the Web3 era.

Half of Americans believe cryptocurrency is here to stay.

Research polling 2,000 adults found 53% think crypto is here to stay, with 68% of 25 to 34-year-olds believing that sentiment to be especially true.

Many respondents noted they're familiar with terms like blockchain (43%), coin (42%), binance (40%) and token (39%).

Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of StarkNet – a platform designed to make crypto apps mainstream, the study also revealed that when people buy crypto, they are constantly fiddling with it.

Half amend their investments at least once a day, while just 7% let a month pass without altering their crypto finances.

“It's remarkable to see that people expect a system that was hardly known a decade ago to be the future of finance,” said Uri Kolodny, CEO of StarkWare, which built StarkNet. “These figures clearly show that crypto use is about to skyrocket. But what people don't realize is that the system just isn't ready. The bandwidth of blockchain is tiny. Even now, it's creaking under the weight of growing demand.”

Thirty-four percent say they now recognize and know what NFTs or non-fungible tokens are.

Meanwhile, 42% of people said they would invest in them if they knew more about NFTs.

Respondents said they would be swayed to invest in cryptocurrency if they would provide security guarantees (42%), reasonable pricing (40%) and sustainability (38%).

Despite the enthusiasm for crypto, 36% say it's too hard to digest.

The top reasons for not wanting to invest in crypto were fear of losing money (35%), not understanding it (31%) and not knowing where to start (25%).

“We hear the public saying loud and clear that it all needs to be less confusing. People don't understand why there aren't many user-friendly crypto apps for everyday use,” said StarkWare's president Professor Eli Ben-Sasson.

“Thanks to new technology, we'll soon be paying in crypto. We'll be doing so with a clearer conscience as our innovation helps to address the problem of crypto's environmental impact, massively cutting the carbon per transaction.

Crypto World News

June 14, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

Solaxy, the Solana-based project that's making waves with its brand-new scalable approach to transactions, has just crossed the $49.5 million milestone in what is becoming the largest Solana presale in history.

This isn't just another token launch; with Solaxy building something that Solana desperately needs: the blockchain's first Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution.

With only two days remaining in the presale, investors are buying in at a pace of $1 million every 24 hours.

Anyone who's used Solana during peak traffic knows the frustration. Network congestion turns what should be lightning-fast transactions into slow, expensive headaches. Solaxy's team recognized this critical gap and built their entire project around solving it.

Solaxy's approach uses rollup technology, combined with off-chain computation, to deliver what Solana users have been waiting for: cheaper, faster, and more reliable transactions that work when you need them most.

The timing couldn't be more perfect. As the crypto market matures and institutional players demand enterprise-grade performance, Solana's infrastructure limitations become increasingly problematic. Solaxy works as a bridge between Solana's massive potential and practical usability.

The Solaxy team has just dropped major news that has the crypto community buzzing: a partnership with Hyperlane, the proven interoperability framework that has already facilitated over $5 billion in cross-chain transfers.

This collaboration means Solaxy won't exist in isolation. The upcoming bridge infrastructure will connect both Solana and Ethereum, creating seamless pathways for assets to flow into what could become the most-used Layer 2 network in the Solana ecosystem.

🚨 Hey Solaxy Community, we're thrilled to announce our collaboration with @hyperlane to deliver one of Web3's most seamless bridging experiences.Solana ↔️ Solaxy ↔️ Ethereum. Fast, modular, permissionless.Together, we're building the first true Layer 2 bridge for Solana… pic.twitter.com/Jfk2GJUUD3

The technical details reveal serious ambition. The team outlined two core objectives on their developer updates page:

Building ultra-low latency validator infrastructure for instant transfers, plus designing user experience flows that feel intuitive and production-ready from day one.

This isn't some half-hearted attempt at blockchain bridging. The infrastructure they're building has mass adoption written all over it.

While many projects talk big and deliver small, Solaxy is already proving its technical capabilities. Last week's testnet launch gave users hands-on access to move funds, track transactions through the Solaxy explorer, and deploy smart contracts.

But that's just the beginning. The roadmap includes two massive catalysts: the Solaxy decentralized exchange and Igniter Protocol: a meme coin launchpad designed to compete directly with Pump.fun.

Leading industry analyst Jacob Bury sees 10x potential in $SOLX, though that might be conservative. Analyst Miles G is backing the project for 100x gains once it hits major exchanges.

The timing of Solaxy's exchange listing might coincide with something huge for the entire Solana ecosystem. According to Blockworks reporting, US regulators are moving toward approving the first Solana spot ETF.

The SEC has requested updated S-1 forms from Solana ETF issuers this week, which industry insiders interpret as a strong signal that approval could come within months. Solana's price already jumped 5% on the news.

If 2024's Bitcoin ETF launch provides any guidance, we could see sustained rallies leading up to the Solana ETF approval. But here's what smart money knows: when major cryptocurrencies pump, their ecosystem tokens often gain significantly more.

As the first-ever Solana layer 2, Solaxy stands to benefit enormously from any broad Solana rally driven by institutional ETF inflows.

Multiple bullish factors are aligning for Solaxy's explosive potential, including a rising M2 money supply, growing institutional crypto demand, and increasingly favorable regulatory conditions for digital assets.

The current presale price is $0.001754, but once $SOLX hits exchanges, price discovery shifts to pure supply and demand dynamics – and with nearly $50 million raised, demand looks overwhelming.

Smart investors are recognizing this as their last opportunity to secure $SOLX before it faces open market pricing. The project's technical progress, strategic partnerships, and perfect timing suggest that this could be one of those rare opportunities that define a portfolio.

The crypto market remains highly active as investors search for the best crypto presale to buy right now. Among the many crypto presale projects, Nexchain stands out with its steady growth and real-world use cases.

While major coins like Solana (SOL) and XRP show strong momentum, presale crypto tokens like Nexchain are drawing attention from early investors looking to secure positions ahead of wider market adoption. 

As more investors review the crypto presale list, Nexchain, SOL, and XRP are emerging as some of the most talked-about opportunities in 2025.

Nexchain continues to position itself as one of the top crypto presales in the current market. Its fully AI-powered blockchain is designed to revolutionize Web3 by combining automation, scalability, and real-world functionality.

At each stage of the presale cryptocurrency, the NEX token price increases, rewarding early investors. Currently, in Stage 18, the token price is set at $0.07 with $4.3 million already raised from global investors.

By merging AI with Proof-of-Stake, Nexchain creates a hybrid consensus mechanism that allows high transaction throughput, low fees, and seamless cross-chain interoperability. This makes Nexchain highly attractive for industries like finance, healthcare, supply chains, and enterprise blockchain solutions.

For those looking to buy presale crypto with real growth potential, Nexchain offers a compelling combination of advanced technology, daily passive income, and long-term value. It continues to lead the crypto presale list as one of the strongest new crypto token presale options of 2025.

Solana has recently printed its first-ever death cross against Ethereum, signaling caution for some traders.

However, despite the bearish crossover, SOL/ETH is holding a key support zone. Historically, this level has triggered rallies between 60% and 75% in previous months. This suggests that any downside may be limited in the short term.

On the USD pair, both Solana and Ethereum continue to show bullish setups. This could lead to sideways consolidation rather than a clear breakout for either coin in the immediate term. 

As market sentiment remains strong, Solana continues to attract investor attention within the broader crypto presale projects conversation.

XRP has been trading in a narrow range over the past 24 hours, consolidating between $2.27 and $2.32.

Despite global trade tensions and diverging central bank policies, XRP has shown resilience with strong buying interest at critical support levels. This stability suggests that XRP remains a preferred option for many investors navigating volatile markets.

While XRP consolidates, many traders are watching for breakout signals as global macro conditions shift. Its consistent performance keeps it relevant for those exploring both established coins and crypto coins on presale with long-term potential.

While Solana and XRP hold strong positions in the market, Nexchain continues to lead the crypto presale list as the best crypto presale to buy right now. 

Its AI-powered blockchain, revenue-sharing model, and growing cross-industry adoption make it one of the most promising presale crypto tokens available.

For investors seeking to buy presale crypto before the next market cycle, Nexchain delivers unmatched innovation, scalability, and passive income potential. Among all crypto ico presale opportunities, Nexchain remains a standout as we move deeper into 2025.

President Donald Trump's sources of income range from luxury properties around the world to royalty payments and license fees for using his name and likeness on everything from sneakers to bibles, according to a financial disclosure form filed June 13.

The 234-page document covered the calendar year 2024.

One of the biggest money-making ventures for Trump was World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency platform launched last year. It brought in $57.3 million. His meme coin $TRUMP was not part of the form as it was only released this year.

Last month, Trump dined with 220 of the biggest investors in his $TRUMP meme coin as a reward for making the leaderboard in a contest to be among the top purchasers, raising ethics questions.

His estate and member's only private club Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, brought in more than $50 million, meanwhile a property in Dubai generated more than $15 million in license fees.

Royalty payments include $3 million for a coffee table book “Save America”; $2.5 million for Trump Sneakers and Fragrances; $1.3 million for The Greenwood Bible and more than $1 million for the “45” Guitar.

The  form also listed liabilities including over $50 million in damages to E. Jean E. Carroll, the magazine columnist who sued Trump for sexual abuse and defamation.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reportedly said Wednesday (June 11) that the company's XRP cryptocurrency could account for 14% of the cross-border payment volume currently handled by SWIFT within five years.

Noting that SWIFT handles messaging while banks handle liquidity, Garlinghouse said, “I think less about the messaging and more about liquidity,” Seeking Alpha reported Friday (June 13).

“If you're driving all the liquidity, it is good for XRP … so I'll say five years, 14%,” Garlinghouse said while speaking at the XRP APEX 2025 event in Singapore, per the report.

XRP serves as a bridge currency, facilitating instant exchanges between currencies and reducing the need for traditional banks to park money abroad, according to the report.

Enterprises are warming up to alternative cross-border money movement vehicles, including blockchain-based solutions that offer streamlined cross-border flows while freeing up capital previously trapped in correspondent accounts across multiple countries, PYMNTS reported in June 2024.

These enterprises are doing so because cross-border payments are fraught with inefficiencies, high fees and delayed transactions, largely due to the ongoing limitations of traditional methods and legacy infrastructure.

Blockchain technology offers transformative potential to address these issues by streamlining processes and reducing costs, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Can Blockchain Solve the Cross-Border Payments Puzzle?”

The report found that by using distributed ledger technology to enable direct transactions without intermediaries, blockchain technology reduces costs and speeds up settlement times, with transactions potentially completed in seconds rather than days.

It added that permissioned decentralized finance could lower transaction costs by up to 80% compared to traditional methods.

When Shopify announced Thursday (June 12) that is rolling out a feature that enables merchants to accept USDC stablecoins, the company said the new capability will allow merchants to “sell to a customer on the other side of the world as easily as their next-door neighbor.”

On June 5, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the company is considering using stablecoins to transfer money among different countries because they can help reduce the cost of moving money.

“That's super interesting to us, and we're definitely going to take a look,” Khosrowshahi said.

Amazon ( (AMZN) ) has been popular among investors this week. Here is a recap of the key news on this stock.





Amazon is making significant strides in the healthcare sector by restructuring its health business into six new units to enhance service delivery and capture a larger market share in the U.S. This move comes as part of a strategic overhaul to boost same-day drug delivery and simplify its healthcare offerings, despite recent leadership changes with the departure of key executives. The company aims to address the fragmented healthcare experience by focusing on innovation and expanding its pharmacy services, including plans to open new pharmacies in 20 cities this year.

In addition to its healthcare ambitions, Amazon is exploring the potential of issuing its own stablecoin, a digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar, to reduce merchant fees and expedite payment settlements. This initiative is contingent on the passage of the ‘Genius Act,' a regulatory framework for stablecoins currently under consideration in Congress. These developments highlight Amazon's ongoing efforts to diversify its business operations and maintain a competitive edge in both the retail and financial sectors.

Written By:Advertorial Team

With market sentiment becoming bullish, investors are exploring crypto presale opportunities. While established assets like Chainlink (LINK) are displaying strength, Nexchain is attracting significant attention as a notable crypto presale project in 2025.

Currently in Stage 18, Nexchain has raised $4.2 million and offers a use case supported by artificial intelligence technology. Its combination of real-world adoption and structured tokenomics is gaining traction among investors evaluating presale opportunities.

Chainlink is trading around $14.57 after bouncing off key support levels last week. Recently, Chainlink announced a cross-border initiative, facilitating secure transactions between Hong Kong's central bank digital currency (CBDC) and an Australian dollar stablecoin. This integration highlights Chainlink's position in global decentralized finance and its ongoing relevance.

Derivatives market data indicates increased long positions on LINK, suggesting growing trader confidence. To approach the $50 price level, Chainlink would likely require broader market support and additional institutional adoption. Nevertheless, its role in oracle services and cross-chain data sharing keeps it among notable Layer 0 blockchain assets.

While established tokens experience growth, presales such as Nexchain are generating interest through technological advancements.

Currently in Stage 18, Nexchain tokens (NEX) are priced at $0.07, with a target listing price of $0.30. Over $4.2 million has already been raised, reflecting early investor interest.

To purchase NEX tokens, investors should visit the official website, connect their cryptocurrency wallet, and complete transactions using USDT, ETH, or BNB. Upon transaction confirmation, the purchased NEX tokens are stored in the investor's wallet.

Nexchain's notable feature is its hybrid consensus model combining AI automation with Proof-of-Stake, capable of processing up to 400,000 transactions per second. It also supports real-time smart contracts and enterprise-grade scalability, appealing to developers and institutional stakeholders.

Investors reviewing crypto ICO presale options may find Nexchain distinguished by its functionality and technological infrastructure.

Chainlink remains prominent with its recent CBDC integration, while Nexchain's technological developments contribute to its visibility in crypto presale discussions.

The AI-driven blockchain technology, low transaction costs, and diverse application use cases position Nexchain as a notable project among current presale offerings. With $4.2 million raised, Nexchain continues to attract investor attention.

Investors evaluating presale opportunities may consider Nexchain for its technology and proposed utility.

                    FILE PHOTO: Trump reported hundreds of millions of dollars in income from crypto, golf clubs and licensing ventures in a public financial report.
                                          | Photo Credit: Reuters
                                      

U.S. President Donald Trump reported hundreds of millions of dollars in income from crypto, golf clubs and licensing ventures in a public financial disclosure report released on Friday that provided a glimpse of the vast business holdings of America's billionaire president.

The annual financial disclosure form, which appeared to cover the 2024 calendar year, shows the president's push into crypto added substantially to his wealth but he also reported large fees from developments and revenues from his other businesses.

While Trump has said he has put his businesses into a trust managed by his children, the disclosures show how income from them still ultimately accrue to the president - something that has opened him to conflicts of interest. Some of his businesses in areas such as crypto, for example, benefit from U.S. policy shifts under him and have become a source of criticism.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The financial disclosure was signed on June 13 and did not state the time period it covered. The details of the cryptocurrency listings, as well as other information in the disclosure, suggest it was through the end of December 2024, which would exclude most of the money raised by the family's cryptocurrency ventures.

Given the speed at which the Trump family has made deals during his ascent to the presidency, the filing is already a time capsule of sorts, capturing a period when they were just starting to get into crypto but were largely still in the world of real estate deals and golf clubs.

A meme coin released earlier this year by the president -$TRUMP - alone has earned an estimated $320 million in fees, though it's not publicly known how that amount has been divided between a Trump-controlled entity and its partners.

In addition to the meme coin fees, the Trump family has raked in more than $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance company. The Trump family is involved, also, with a bitcoin mining operation and digital asset exchange-traded funds.

In the disclosures, Trump reported $57.35 million from token sales at World Liberty. He also reported holding 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture.

The wealth of the Republican businessman-turned-politician ranges from crypto to real estate, and a large part on paper is tied up in his stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, owner of social media platform Truth Social.

The disclosure showed income from various assets including Trump's properties in Florida. Trump's three golf-focused resorts in the state - Jupiter, Doral and West Palm Beach - plus his nearby private members' club at Mar-a-Lago generated at least $217.7 million in income, according to the filing.

The disclosure also listed income of $5 million in license fees from a development in Vietnam.

Trump collected royalty money, also, from a variety of deals - $1.3 million from the Greenwood Bible (its website describes it as ""the only Bible officially endorsed by Lee Greenwood and President Trump""); $2.8 million from Trump Watches, and $2.5 million from Trump Sneakers and Fragrances.

Trump listed $1.16 million in income from his NFTs - digital trading cards in his likeness while First Lady Melania Trump earned around $216,700 from license fees her own NFT collection.

Bitcoin hovered around $105,100 on June 14, down 0.22% over the past 24 hours as traders digested geopolitical tension. Price action remained relatively tight, with BTC moving within a $2,090 range from $104,220 to $106,135. The largest moves occurred overnight in Asia trading, where Bitcoin briefly dipped below $104,200 before rebounding on high volume.

Much of the recent volatility has been driven by developments in the Middle East. The Israel-Iran war, which some analysts fear could spread to other parts of the Middle East, combined with trade tensions between the U.S. and some of its key trading partners, has unsettled risk markets. More than $1.1 billion in crypto liquidations were recorded during the initial wave of conflict headlines, though bitcoin has shown resilience in the aftermath.

Traders appear to be leaning bullish in the medium term, as BTC continues to hold a pattern of higher lows despite intraday wobbles. Profit-taking near $106,000 capped upside momentum, but support near $105,000 continues to draw buyers on dips. Market participants are watching this range closely, particularly as safe-haven demand and risk sentiment remain intertwined.

While short-term headlines continue to drive volatility, the broader structure suggests BTC is consolidating rather than reversing. If support around $104,950 holds, Bitcoin may attempt another push above $106,200.

 Trump discloses $57.4 million in income tied to World Liberty Financial, a DeFi project that has raised over $550 million from investors. 

US President Donald Trump has disclosed $57.4 million in income from his involvement with World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture he backs alongside his sons Donald Jr. and Eric.

The details emerged in Trump's 2025 public financial disclosure, filed with the US Office of Government Ethics on June 13. The filing reveals that Trump holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in World Liberty Financial, which also grants him voting rights.

While the document does not elaborate on the precise structure or market value of the governance tokens, the substantial reported income suggests that Trump has monetized some portion of the position or that the tokens were valued for disclosure at a high internal rate.

The filing simply states the income as “$57,437,927” without detailing whether the gain was realized through token sales, staking rewards, or other mechanisms.

World Liberty Financial raised $200 million in its first round of public token sale and another $250 million in the second token sale, bringing total fundraising to approximately $550 million, the firm disclosed in March.

The project launched in September 2024 with a focus on DeFi and dollar-pegged stablecoins, presenting itself as a challenger to the traditional financial system.

Major crypto investors have also bought in. Tron founder Justin Sun invested $30 million in November 2024, receiving 2 billion WLFI tokens at the early price of $0.015.

Web3Port followed with a $10 million investment in January, while Oddiyana Ventures also joined as a strategic investor, though the amount was not disclosed.

Notably, Trump's disclosure also reflects his broader digital asset footprint. In past filings, he revealed revenue from NFT-based ventures such as the Trump Digital Trading Cards collection. The latest filing shows no new NFT income.

According to the form, Trump maintains roles in various holding companies tied to digital ventures, including CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC, although income from those entities is minimal or inactive.

The ethics filing includes the President's certification that the information is “true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge” and is subject to review by the Office of Government Ethics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Russian authorities bust truck-based crypto mine draining village power","https://cointelegraph.com/news/russia-truck-crypto-mine-buryatia-power-theft","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 10:18:33 GMT","

 Russian authorities found 95 mining rigs and a mobile transformer in a KamAZ truck illegally tapping power meant for a village in Buryatia. 

Authorities in Russia's Republic of Buryatia have uncovered an illegal cryptocurrency mining operation hidden inside a KamAZ truck siphoning electricity meant for a nearby village.

Discovered during a routine power line inspection in the Pribaikalsky District, the unauthorized setup was drawing electricity from a 10-kilovolt line, enough to supply a small village, according to Russian state-owned news agency TASS.

Inside the truck, inspectors found 95 mining rigs and a mobile transformer station. Two individuals believed to be connected to the operation fled the scene in an SUV before police arrived.

This marks the sixth case of electricity theft linked to crypto mining in Buryatia since the start of the year, Rosseti Siberia's Buryatenergo unit said. Authorities have warned that illegal connections are disrupting local grids, causing voltage drops, overloads, and potential blackouts.

Mining is prohibited across most of Buryatia from Nov. 15 to March 15 due to regional energy shortages. Outside of that window, only registered companies in designated districts such as Severo-Baikalsky and Muisky are allowed to mine.

The crackdown comes amid broader federal restrictions. In Dec. 2024, Russia announced a ban on mining during peak energy months in several regions, including Dagestan, Chechnya, and parts of eastern Ukraine currently under Russian control.

A full ban has already been enforced in the southern Irkutsk region since April.

Major Russian mining industry firms like BitRiver rely on cheap electricity in Irkutsk. According to local sources, the Irkutsk region hosts the first and largest data center by BitRiver, which was launched in 2019 in Bratsk.

Kaspersky has linked the hacker group known as “Librarian Ghouls” or “Rare Werewolf” to a cryptojacking campaign that compromised hundreds of Russian devices. The group used phishing emails posing as legitimate documents to spread malware and gain control of systems for unauthorized crypto mining.

Once infected, the malware disables Windows Defender and schedules the compromised devices to operate between 1 am and 5 am, a tactic designed to avoid detection.

During this window, hackers establish remote access, steal login credentials, and assess system specs to configure their miners efficiently.

 The SEC's approval comes just weeks after Trump Media confirmed its capital raise to purchase Bitcoin, following initial denials of earlier reports. 

Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the company that owns US President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform and is partially owned by the president, has received approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its registration statement tied to its $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury deal.

According to a June 13 SEC filing, the agency “declared effective” TMTG's S-3 registration statement — filed on June 6 — for the Bitcoin (BTC) treasury deal. The S-3 is a form that US companies use to register the sale of various securities, like stocks, options, and different types of debt. TMTG filed a corresponding final prospectus with the SEC on the same day.

The SEC filing said that, as part of its Bitcoin treasury plan, TMTG registered the resale of approximately 56 million shares and 29 million more tied to convertible notes as part of debt and equity agreements with around 50 investors, which yielded $2.3 billion.

Although the registration statement includes a universal shelf to give TMTG “greater flexibility” for future growth plans, the company currently has “no immediate plans” to issue any securities under it.

Trump Media's CEO and President Devin Nunes said, “We're aggressively implementing our plans to expand the Company, our offerings, and our capabilities.” Nunes added:

On the same day, TMTG's stock price fell 2.06%, closing the trading day at $19.52, according to Google Finance data.

It comes only weeks after the company confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to purchase Bitcoin on May 27 after denying earlier reports of the deal. 

At the time, Nunes said that TMTG views “Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets.”

Blockchain analysis company Arkham said in a May 28 X post, “Donald Trump's company, Trump Media, will buy $2.5 BILLION of Bitcoin. Is Trump about to go Saylor Mode?”

Related: Bitcoin adoption fueled by ‘deglobalization,' Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill'

Meanwhile, on June 5, TMTG filed with the SEC to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

“The assets of the Trust consist primarily of Bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust. The Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of Bitcoin,” TMTG said in a June 5 filing.

Milwaukee tools are, in short, not cheap. One one side, that's a good thing. It's a premier tool brand, so you get what you pay for: premium tools. But that can put them out of reach of many people's budgets—normally. For some Milwaukee tools, today is an exception. At Walmart, dozens of the company's hand tools are discounted in time for summer projects. 

So stuff like cordless drills, angle grinders, and impact drivers that typically cost you an arm and a leg now cost merely an arm. All kidding aside, we rounded up some of the best deals on premium Milwaukee power tools at Walmart so you don't have to wait until next month's Prime Day. Chances are, even then, you still won't find deals like this.  

Featuring a powerful brushless motor designed specifically for this device, this angle grinder delivers an impressive 8,500 rpm for a variety of cutting jobs. It can cut up to 135 times per charge, and the paddle switch is both ergonomic and easy to use in a variety of positions. The only downside is you'll have to purchase the battery separately.

These reliable Redlithium units are compatible with over 150 M18 cordless tools, including the aforementioned angle grinder. Featuring a convenient fuel gauge to monitor run-time through an intricate series of lights, these reliable, durable batteries are far superior to any of their aftermarket opponents, thanks to long-lasting performance and built-in protections against adverse job-site conditions. And with overload protection from overheating and a three-year warranty, the nearly 60 percent savings sound too good to be true, frankly. 

Everyone needs a reliable ratchet set in their car, and you can't get much more reliable than this ultra-convenient lithium-ion kit from Milwaukee. Delivering 35 foot-pounds of torque, this powerful set has a built-in LED light, eliminating the need for an extra flashlight, as well as a battery indicator. It's compatible with 30+ M12 cordless tools, making it a versatile staple to add to your collection. 

Delivering up to 1,500 inch-pounds of torque, this is a hard-working impact driver that's compact enough to work in tight spaces. It's only 5 inches long and has four drive modes based on the power output you desire, along with an additional self-tapping screw mode. Reaching up to 3,600 rpm in Mode 3, this is one of the most powerful drivers you'll find at this size and comparable to the larger Milwaukee M18 Fuel 2953-20 Impact Driver, our favorite overall unit, which reaches up to 3,900 rpm in a much heavier frame.

If you're looking for an impact driver that's a little more budget-friendly (even before the discount!) and contains fewer bells and whistles, this 12-volt cordless option is it. With a trigger that adjusts the driver speed based on how far you pull it in, a keyless chuck for quick bit changes, and an ergonomic handle for prolonged use, it's plenty user-friendly.

Capable of drilling large holes at high speeds, this is undoubtedly one of the most powerful hammer drills on the market, offering 1400 in-lbs of torque. This, of course,  shouldn't come as too much of a shock given Milwaukee's reputation. A convenient autostop mode helps to prevent over-rotation during bind-ups, and the brushless motor delivers rugged performance under load. We love the premium all-metal ratcheting chuck, which offers enhanced grip strength, durability, and corrosion resistance—and it's now over 60 percent off. 

The Cordless ½-inch Impact Wrench has the distinction of being the most compact tool in its class at just 4.9 inches long. And despite its small frame, it still, expectedly, packs a punch. Featuring four-mode drive control for precise fastening and easy control when you're removing fasteners, this intuitive device is worthy of being a staple of your toolbox.

Save over $85 on this powerful grinder that delivers up to a whopping 20,000 rpm—equivalent to that of a corded device. Made for a variety of applications, including engraving, cylinder head porting, and the general shaping of a part, it can deburr up to 35 pipes in one charge. It will also automatically stop cutting and sanding accessories in under 2 seconds, allowing the user to quickly set the tool down without the wheel continuing to spin, reducing the risk of injury—a godsend for first-time users and general novices alike.

Not all of the tools here come with a charger. This one is compatible with MX FuelT Batteries, which are included in quite a number of Milwaukee power tools. This charger features a convenient carry handle and tailors the charge rate based on battery type and temperature, helping to optimize charge time and pack lifespan in the process.

We can't finish off this list without one of Milwaukee's acclaimed sanders, can we? This sheet sander is a worthy addition to your garage or shop. For starters, it collects up to 95 percent of dust, thanks largely to the durable cotton dust bag and the universal hose adapter that's compatible with a wide array of vacuum sizes and models. Low vibration levels make this a smooth process (pun intended), all while cutting down on hand fatigue. The two-step clamp system allows for the easy removal and change of sandpaper on the fly, making this a comprehensive and affordable option that's now under $150.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

According to the current Standard Model, four fundamental forces underpin all known physics: electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. However, since the mid-1980s, physicists have wondered if a fifth fundamental force could exist, which would help to explain some observational anomalies. And since then, many studies have boldly claimed discovery of this elusive force. 

In 1986, for example, scientists at MIT thought that antigravity could maybe could be a fifth force, and in 2000, another group named the force “quintessence” as a way to explain dark energy. In 2015, a study by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences discovered a particle 30 times heavier than an electron that could form the basis of a fifth force, and the U.S.-based Fermilab stated boldly that they were on the cusp of discovering this mysterious force in 2023. 

And, of course, there's a strong contingent of physicists who think a fifth force doesn't exist at all.  

One proposed way of examining if such a force could exist is by closely monitoring asteroid trajectories, and few near-Earth asteroids are as well observed as Bennu. A study by an international team of scientists analyzes Bennu to try and placing constraints on a possible fifth fundamental force in the search of ultralight dark matter. 

Bennu, one of the most dangerous near-Earth objects, has been meticulously tracked by optical and radar astrometric data since it was discovered in 1999. As the destination for the OSIRIS-REx asteroid retrieval mission, additional X-band radiometric and optical navigation tracking data added even more trajectory precision. 

The idea is that any deviation in the expected trajectory of the asteroid could be the result of an unknown fifth force at work. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Communications Physics.

“Interpreting the data we see from tracking Bennu has the potential to add to our understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of the universe, potentially revamping our understanding of the Standard Model of physics, gravity and dark matter,” Yu-Dai Tsai, the lead author on the paper, said in a press statement. “The trajectories of objects often feature anomalies that can be useful in discovering new physics.”

The trajectories of heavenly objects have yielded incredible discoveries before. Neptune, for example, was first “discovered” not through a telescope, but by the meticulous calculations of Uranus' orbit and discovery of gravitational anomalies therein. However, such a technique isn't foolproof, as some scientists also believed that a planet named Vulcan existed between the Sun and Mercury. This, obviously, turned out to be false. 

“These results highlight the potential for asteroid tracking as a valuable tool in the search for ultralight bosons, dark matter, and several well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model,” Sunny Vagnozzi, assistant professor at the University of Trento in Italy and study co-author, said in a press statement. 

While this study didn't find “evidence in the data for the presence of a fifth force affecting the motion of Bennu,” the ORSIRIS-REx's sequel, OSIRIS-APEX, could provide even more data as the mission zooms onward toward the asteroid Apophis. Because this asteroid will zoom by Earth in 2029, a detailed study of its trajectory will deliver even further restrictions on the fifth force than what Bennu could provide. 

So, while the ongoing exploration of the fifth force continues in accelerator labs around the world, some scientists are turning toward space to answer the deepest mysteries of physics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Invisible ID: How a single breath could reveal your health—and your identity","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250613013910.htm","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 03:39:02 GMT","

Your breath is one of a kind. A study published June 12 in the Cell Press journal Current Biology demonstrated that scientists can identify individuals based solely on their breathing patterns with 96.8% accuracy. These nasal respiratory ""fingerprints"" also offer insights into physical and mental health.

The research stemmed from the lab's interest in olfaction, or the sense of smell. In mammals, the brain processes odor information during inhalation. This link between the brain and breathing led researchers to wonder: since every brain is unique, wouldn't each person's breathing pattern reflect that?

To test the idea, the team developed a lightweight wearable device that tracks nasal airflow continuously for 24 hours using soft tubes placed under the nostrils. Most breathing tests last just one to 20 minutes, focusing on evaluating lung function or diagnosing disease. But those brief snapshots aren't enough to capture subtle patterns.

""You would think that breathing has been measured and analyzed in every way,"" says author Noam Sobel of the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. ""Yet we stumbled upon a completely new way to look at respiration. We consider this as a brain readout.""

Sobel's team fitted 100 healthy young adults with the device and asked them to go about their daily lives. Using the collected data, the team identified individuals using only their breathing patterns with high accuracy. This high-level accuracy remained consistent across multiple retests conducted over a two-year period, rivaling the precision of some voice recognition technologies.

""I thought it would be really hard to identify someone because everyone is doing different things, like running, studying, or resting,"" says author Timna Soroka of the Weizmann Institute of Science. ""But it turns out their breathing patterns were remarkably distinct.""

Moreover, the study found that these respiratory fingerprints correlated with a person's body mass index, sleep-wake cycle, levels of depression and anxiety, and even behavioral traits. For example, participants who scored relatively higher on anxiety questionnaires had shorter inhales and more variability in the pauses between breaths during sleep. Soroka noted that none of the participants met clinical diagnostic criteria for mental or behavioral conditions. The results suggest that long-term nasal airflow monitoring may serve as a window into physical and emotional well-being.

""We intuitively assume that how depressed or anxious you are changes the way you breathe,"" says Sobel. ""But it might be the other way around. Perhaps the way you breathe makes you anxious or depressed. If that's true, we might be able to change the way you breathe to change those conditions.""

The current device still faces real-world challenges. A tube that runs under the nose is often associated with illness and may deter adoption. The device also doesn't account for mouth breathing and can slip out of place when sleeping. The team aims to design a more discreet and comfortable version for everyday use.

Soroka and Sobel are already investigating whether people can mimic healthy breathing patterns to improve their mental and emotional states. ""We definitely want to go beyond diagnostics to treatment, and we are cautiously optimistic,"" says Sobel.

In a compelling Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, Sophia Shi, PhD, unveils her pioneering research that fundamentally changes our understanding of brain aging and opens revolutionary therapeutic pathways for Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative conditions.

Uncovering the Brain's Hidden Shield

Dr. Shi's groundbreaking work focuses on the glycocalyx, a complex ""forest"" of sugar molecules coating blood-brain barrier endothelial cells. Her research, recently published in Nature, demonstrates that this protective layer deteriorates dramatically with age, leading to blood-brain barrier dysfunction and neuroinflammation, key drivers of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.

""The glycocalyx acts like a protective shield for the brain's blood vessels,"" Dr. Shi explains. ""When we restored these critical sugar molecules in aged mice, we saw remarkable improvements in both barrier integrity and cognitive function."" This discovery represents the first time scientists have successfully reversed age-related blood-brain barrier dysfunction through glycocalyx restoration.

From Puzzles to Proteins: A Scientific Journey

Dr. Shi's path to this breakthrough began with childhood fascinations with puzzles and pattern recognition, skills that would later prove invaluable in decoding the complex language of glycosylation. Working under the mentorship of Nobel laureate Carolyn Bertozzi and renowned neurobiologist Tony Wyss-Coray at Stanford, she bridged two distinct fields, glycobiology and neuroscience, to tackle questions others had overlooked.

Her interdisciplinary approach faced significant challenges. How do you study molecules so structurally complex that they've resisted traditional analysis methods? What techniques can capture the dynamic nature of glycosylation in living brain tissue? Dr. Shi's innovative solutions to these problems exemplify the power of cross-disciplinary thinking in modern biomedical research.

Recognition and Research Excellence

The impact of Dr. Shi's work extends far beyond the laboratory. Her research garnered the prestigious David S. Miller Young Scientist Award at the Cerebral Vascular Biology Conference, recognizing her as one of the field's most promising young investigators. Perhaps more remarkably, she is launching her independent laboratory at Harvard's prestigious Rowland Institute directly from doctoral training -- a rare achievement that speaks to the transformative potential of her discoveries.

""Post-translational modifications like glycosylation have been understudied for too long,"" Dr. Shi notes. ""These modifications can completely transform protein function, yet we're only beginning to understand their role in brain health and disease."" Her work positions glycoscience at the forefront of neurodegeneration research, challenging long-held assumptions about therapeutic targets.

Therapeutic Implications and Future Directions

The therapeutic implications of Dr. Shi's findings are profound. By identifying specific mucin-type O-glycans as critical for blood-brain barrier integrity, her research provides concrete molecular targets for drug development. This precision approach could lead to treatments that address the root causes of neurodegeneration rather than merely managing symptoms.

Intriguing questions emerge from this work: Can glycocalyx restoration prevent or slow Alzheimer's disease progression in humans? How early in the aging process do these protective molecules begin to deteriorate? What environmental or genetic factors influence glycocalyx health throughout the lifespan? These questions will drive the next phase of Dr. Shi's research program at Harvard.

Building an Inclusive Scientific Future

Beyond her scientific contributions, Dr. Shi is committed to fostering diversity in science. ""It's easy to feel isolated or like you don't belong in science, especially without early exposure or role models,"" she reflects. Her dedication to mentoring and creating inclusive research environments promises to amplify her impact by inspiring the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists.

The interview reveals how personal experiences shape scientific pursuits. Dr. Shi's appreciation for hiking and trail running mirrors her approach to research: seeking new perspectives from challenging vantage points. This blend of rigorous science with human experience characterizes the new generation of biomedical researchers.Implications for Brain Medicine

Dr. Shi's discoveries raise fundamental questions about how we approach brain aging and disease. If glycocalyx deterioration is a common pathway in multiple neurodegenerative conditions, could targeting these molecules provide a unified therapeutic strategy? How might lifestyle factors influence glycocalyx health? These considerations could reshape preventive medicine approaches for brain health.

The transition from viewing the blood-brain barrier as a simple wall to understanding it as a dynamic, sugar-coated interface represents a paradigm shift in neuroscience. This new perspective demands innovative research approaches and may explain why previous therapeutic strategies targeting the barrier have shown limited success.

Dr. Sophia Shi's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist's impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.

To allow studying the genetic causes of autism spectrum disorder, a Kobe University research team created a bank of 63 mouse embryonic stem cell lines containing the mutations most strongly associated with the disorder. The achievement was made possible by developing a new and more efficient method for changing the genome of embryonic stem cells.

Although it is well understood that genetics influence the development of autism spectrum disorder, no one could yet pinpoint the precise cause and mechanism. To study the biological background of diseases, researchers use models: Cell models allow us to study how changes in the genes affect the shape and function of the cell, while animal models show how the change in its cellular components affects health and behavior. Despite significant differences between mice and humans, many disease-causing genes are very similar and cause similar conditions across these species. “One of the problems, however, is the lack of a standardized biological model to study the effects of the different mutations associated with autism spectrum disorder. This makes it difficult to find out, for example, whether they have common effects or what is specific to certain cell types,” explains Kobe University neuroscientist TAKUMI Toru.

Thus, twelve years ago, Takumi and his team embarked on a journey to change that. Being experts in studying mouse models of the disorder, they combined a conventional manipulation technique for mouse embryonic stem cells — cells that can be made to develop into almost any kind of cell in the body — with the then-newly discovered, highly specific and easy-to-handle CRISPR gene editing system. This new method proved highly efficient in making genetic variants of these cells and allowed the Kobe University team to produce a bank of 63 mouse embryonic stem cell lines of the genetic variants most strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder.

In the journal Cell Genomics, Takumi and his team now published that they were able to develop their cells into a broad range of cell types and tissues, and even generate adult mice with their genetic variations. The analysis of these alone proved that their cell lines were adequate models for studying autism spectrum disorder. However, the cell lines also allowed them to conduct large-scale data analyses to clearly identify genes that are abnormally active, and in which cell types this is the case. 

One of the things the data analysis brought to light is that autism-causing mutations often result in neurons being unable to eliminate misshapen proteins. “This is particularly interesting since the local production of proteins is a unique feature in neurons, and a lack of quality control of these proteins may be a causal factor of neuronal defects,” explains Takumi.

The Kobe University neuroscientist expects that his team's achievement, which has been made available to other researchers and can be flexibly integrated with other lab techniques and adjusted to other targets, will be an invaluable resource for the scientific community studying autism and trying to find drug targets. He adds: “Interestingly, the genetic variants we studied are also implicated in other neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

In a new study, physicists at the University of Colorado Boulder have used a cloud of atoms chilled down to incredibly cold temperatures to simultaneously measure acceleration in three dimensions -- a feat that many scientists didn't think was possible.

The device, a new type of atom ""interferometer,"" could one day help people navigate submarines, spacecraft, cars and other vehicles more precisely.

""Traditional atom interferometers can only measure acceleration in a single dimension, but we live within a three-dimensional world,"" said Kendall Mehling, a co-author of the new study and a graduate student in the Department of Physics at CU Boulder. ""To know where I'm going, and to know where I've been, I need to track my acceleration in all three dimensions.""

The researchers published their paper, titled ""Vector atom accelerometry in an optical lattice,"" this month in the journal Science Advances. The team included Mehling; Catie LeDesma, a postdoctoral researcher in physics; and Murray Holland, professor of physics and fellow of JILA, a joint research institute between CU Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

In 2023, NASA awarded the CU Boulder researchers a $5.5 million grant through the agency's Quantum Pathways Institute to continue developing the sensor technology.

The new device is a marvel of engineering: Holland and his colleagues employ six lasers as thin as a human hair to pin a cloud of tens of thousands of rubidium atoms in place. Then, with help from artificial intelligence, they manipulate those lasers in complex patterns -- allowing the team to measure the behavior of the atoms as they react to small accelerations, like pressing the gas pedal down in your car.

Today, most vehicles track acceleration using GPS and traditional, or ""classical,"" electronic devices known as accelerometers. The team's quantum device has a long way to go before it can compete with these tools. But the researchers see a lot of promise for navigation technology based on atoms.

""If you leave a classical sensor out in different environments for years, it will age and decay,"" Mehling said. ""The springs in your clock will change and warp. Atoms don't age.""

 Fingerprints of motion 

Interferometers, in some form or another, have been around for centuries -- and they've been used to do everything from transporting information over optical fibers to searching for gravitational waves, or ripples in the fabric of the universe.

The general idea involves splitting things apart and bringing them back together, not unlike unzipping, then zipping back up a jacket.

In laser interferometry, for example, scientists first shine a laser light, then split it into two, identical beams that travel over two separate paths. Eventually, they bring the beams back together. If the lasers have experienced diverging effects along their journeys, such as gravity acting in different ways, they may not mesh perfectly when they recombine. Put differently, the zipper might get stuck. Researchers can make measurements based on how the two beams, once identical, now interfere with each other -- hence the name.

In the current study, the team achieved the same feat, but with atoms instead of light.

Here's how it works: The device currently fits on a bench about the size of an air hockey table. First, the researchers cool a collection of rubidium atoms down to temperatures just a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero.

In that frigid realm, the atoms form a mysterious quantum state of matter known as a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). Carl Wieman, then a physicist at CU Boulder, and Eric Cornell of JILA won a Nobel Prize in 2001 for creating the first BEC.

Next, the team uses laser light to jiggle the atoms, splitting them apart. In this case, that doesn't mean that groups of atoms are separating. Instead, each individual atom exists in a ghostly quantum state called a superposition, in which it can be simultaneously in two places at the same time.

When the atoms split and separate, those ghosts travel away from each other following two different paths. (In the current experiment, the researchers didn't actually move the device itself but used lasers to push on the atoms, causing acceleration).

""Our Bose-Einstein Condensate is a matter-wave pond made of atoms, and we throw stones made of little packets of light into the pond, sending ripples both left and right,"" Holland said. ""Once the ripples have spread out, we reflect them and bring them back together where they interfere.""

When the atoms snap back together, they form a unique pattern, just like the two beams of laser light zipping together but more complex. The result resembles a thumb print on a glass.

""We can decode that fingerprint and extract the acceleration that the atoms experienced,"" Holland said.

Planning with computers 

The group spent almost three years building the device to achieve this feat.

""For what it is, the current experimental device is incredibly compact. Even though we have 18 laser beams passing through the vacuum system that contains our atom cloud, the entire experiment is small enough that we could deploy in the field one day,"" LeDesma said.

One of the secrets to that success comes down to an artificial intelligence technique called machine learning. Holland explained that splitting and recombining the rubidium atoms requires adjusting the lasers through a complex, multi-step process. To streamline the process, the group trained a computer program that can plan out those moves in advance.

So far, the device can only measure accelerations several thousand times smaller than the force of Earth's gravity. Currently available technologies can do a lot better.

But the group is continuing to improve its engineering and hopes to increase the performance of its quantum device many times over in the coming years. Still, the technology is a testament to just how useful atoms can be.

""We're not exactly sure of all the possible ramifications of this research, because it opens up a door,"" Holland said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Webb space telescope reveals starburst galaxies that lit up the early universe","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250613013934.htm","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 06:12:20 GMT","

Astronomers using data from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope have identified dozens of small galaxies that played a starring role in a cosmic makeover that transformed the early universe into the one we know today.

""When it comes to producing ultraviolet light, these small galaxies punch well above their weight,"" said Isak Wold, an assistant research scientist at Catholic University of America in Washington and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. ""Our analysis of these tiny but mighty galaxies is 10 times more sensitive than previous studies, and shows they existed in sufficient numbers and packed enough ultraviolet power to drive this cosmic renovation.""

Wold discussed his findings Wednesday at the 246th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Anchorage, Alaska. The study took advantage of existing imaging collected by Webb's NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) instrument, as well as new observations made with its NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) instrument.

The tiny galaxies were discovered by Wold and his Goddard colleagues, Sangeeta Malhotra and James Rhoads, by sifting through Webb images captured as part of the UNCOVER (Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization) observing program, led by Rachel Bezanson at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania.

The project mapped a giant galaxy cluster known as Abell 2744, nicknamed Pandora's cluster, located about 4 billion light-years away in the southern constellation Sculptor. The cluster's mass forms a gravitational lens that magnifies distant sources, adding to Webb's already considerable reach.

For much of its first billion years, the universe was immersed in a fog of neutral hydrogen gas. Today, this gas is ionized -- stripped of its electrons. Astronomers, who refer to this transformation as reionization, have long wondered which types of objects were most responsible: big galaxies, small galaxies, or supermassive black holes in active galaxies. As one of its main goals, NASA's Webb was specifically designed to address key questions about this major transition in the history of the universe.

Recent studies have shown that small galaxies undergoing vigorous star formation could have played an outsized role. Such galaxies are rare today, making up only about 1% of those around us. But they were abundant when the universe was about 800 million years old, an epoch astronomers refer to as redshift 7, when reionization was well underway.

The team searched for small galaxies of the right cosmic age that showed signs of extreme star formation, called starbursts, in NIRCam images of the cluster.

""Low-mass galaxies gather less neutral hydrogen gas around them, which makes it easier for ionizing ultraviolet light to escape,"" Rhoads said. ""Likewise, starburst episodes not only produce plentiful ultraviolet light -- they also carve channels into a galaxy's interstellar matter that helps this light break out.""

The astronomers looked for strong sources of a specific wavelength of light that signifies the presence of high-energy processes: a green line emitted by oxygen atoms that have lost two electrons. Originally emitted as visible light in the early cosmos, the green glow from doubly ionized oxygen was stretched into the infrared as it traversed the expanding universe and eventually reached Webb's instruments.

This technique revealed 83 small starburst galaxies as they appear when the universe was 800 million years old, or about 6% of its current age of 13.8 billion years. The team selected 20 of these for deeper inspection using NIRSpec.

""These galaxies are so small that, to build the equivalent stellar mass of our own Milky Way galaxy, you'd need from 2,000 to 200,000 of them,"" Malhotra said. ""But we are able to detect them because of our novel sample selection technique combined with gravitational lensing.""

Similar types of galaxies in the present-day universe, such as green peas, release about 25% of their ionizing ultraviolet light into surrounding space. If the low-mass starburst galaxies explored by Wold and his team release a similar amount, they can account for all of the ultraviolet light needed to convert the universe's neutral hydrogen to its ionized form.

The James Webb Space Telescope is the world's premier space science observatory. Webb is solving mysteries in our solar system, looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency).

Fujifilm announced a new camera this week, the X-E5, the latest in its X-E rangefinder-style mirrorless camera series. Think of the X-E as an interchangeable lens version of the X100. The big news in the X-E5 is Fujifilm's latest 40-megapixel APS-C sensor and 7-stop in-body image stabilization (IBIS). This is the first X-E series camera with IBIS, which Fujifilm says will gain you about 7 stops of handholding. The new sensor also means video specs jump to 6.2K at 30 frames per second (with a 1.23 crop) and 4K 30 fps full sensor video.

The X-E5 regains the focus mode switch on the side of the body (notably absent from the X-E4), and adds a new film simulation dial. While many of Fujifilm's enthusiast-level cameras have this control, the one on the X-E5 can store custom presets with your own film recipes. One thing that remains unchanged is the weather sealing, which still doesn't exist here. Also disappointing is that the viewfinder remains small, with the same paltry resolution (2.36M dot, 1025 x 768) as the older model.

The X-E5 will be available in the US in August for $1,699 for the body only and $1,899 for a version with Fujifilm's new 23mm f/2.8R WR lens, launching alongside the X-E5. To meet demand (something Fujifilm failed to do with the X-E4), the company won't be selling the lens as a standalone until late 2025. You can preorder it at Adorama or B&H Photo now. —Scott Gilbertson

Bose has a trio of new products incoming, including an update to some of our favourite earbuds. The QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen) are getting a whole host of improvements, including better AI algorithms to help them filter out noise spikes more effectively and improve overall voice pickup and call quality. There's also wireless charging out of the box now, a new wax-guard, and a punchy, limited-edition Deep Plum colourway. They'll cost $299/£299, and can be pre-ordered now.

Joining the buds are two new speakers, the SoundLink Plus and the SoundLink Micro (2nd Gen). No prizes for guessing the big difference between them, but the Plus is a new mid-range portable speaker that sits between the SoundLink Flex and the SoundLink Max in the range, while the Micro is an updated version of the company's smallest Bluetooth speaker.

For the latter, Bose is promising improved sound quality—particularly in the upper frequencies—USB-C charging, a better 12-hour battery life and Bose app compatibility. The Plus promises a “ready-for-anything” design that “brings the bass,” along with a 20-hour battery, charging USB-C port, and IP67 rating. It'll be available in Black, Blue Dusk and summer-ready Citrus Yellow for $269/£249, while the Micro will cost $129/£119, with colorways coming soon. —Verity Burns

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

At Augmented World Expo (AWE) this week, Qualcomm demoed its new Snapdragon AR1+ chipset designed for smart glasses, and its capability to run a small language model without the need to be tethered to a smartphone or rely on the cloud for processing.

Right now, most smart glasses are designed to stay connected with smartphones, which will handle any processing for AI-related queries, like when you ask Meta AI a question via the Meta Ray-Bans (powered by the original AR1). But that sucks up valuable battery life and can also introduce some delay as the request ping pongs to the phone and back. By integrating the capability to process a small language model directly via the AR1+ chip on smart glasses, you can expect faster response, better battery life, and improved privacy as everything stays on device. That also means you don't need your phone nearby to get a response from an AI chatbot.

The AR1+ chipset is also 26 percent smaller than its predecessor, which Qualcomm thinks will help make smart glasses slightly less cumbersome to wear. Improvements to power management also help make the chip more efficient, and the company has added image processing techniques from smartphones to aid smart glasses with built-in cameras to better understand the world around.

“You're not connected,"" Ziad Asghar, General Manager of XR at Qualcomm, tells WIRED. ""You're still able to get a very good response back, such that you have continuity of experiences independent of whether you have your phone next to you or not.”

Sonos this week announced several new software features for those invested in the brand's Ace headphones, including more natural call quality with the addition of voice side-tone, and upgraded noise canceling designed to account for changes in position around your ears from glasses or hats in real time, similar to rivals like Sony's new WH-1000XM6.

Sonos has also upgraded the Ace's distinctive home theater functionality. The TV Swap feature, which beams audio from Sonos soundbars to the headphones with a tap, now works with two pairs instead of just one, based on requests from users. The Ace will also offer a new TrueCinema feature designed to emulate your listening space to provide a more immersive, customized experience that “feels like you aren't wearing headphones,” according to the company's VP of Product, Chris Kallai. The free software update will begin rolling out to Sonos users globally this week. —Ryan Waniata

A big outdoor griddle can change your whole feeling about summer. And the best griddles can make dinner feel like an event to be proud of. There's little more satisfying than the slap of a spatula onto chopped onions and ribeye meant for a perfect cheesesteak, the blister of corn tortillas cooked in the grease left by hard-seared carne asada, the smash of a burger at a backyard barbecue, the blessed evenness of pancakes cooked on a well-seasoned flat-top grill plate.

An outdoor gas griddle has become an essential backyard counterpart to the satisfying direct heat of a great charcoal or wood-fired grill—adding all the versatility of your favorite diner to your sunny-day toolkit. I've spent weeks cooking dozens of smashburgers, bacon strips, tacos, and pancakes to find the best outdoor griddles for each kind of backyard cook.

But a flat-top griddle requires care, and in the end you need to love it: My top-rated Traeger Flatrock ($900) quite simply offers the most even and reliable heat out of any I tested, and it feels like a Cadillac idling in the backyard. Meanwhile the rust-resistant Weber Slate ($1,049) offers the best array of features to build out a flat-top grill into a true work station. A 36-incher from Georgia brand LoCo ($500) offered impressively even heat distribution across its cooktop at a lower price, with a couple of quirks.

Traeger

Amazon

Ace Hardware

I grew up in Oregon, where Traeger was also born. And even after the company got sold and moved to Utah, a Traeger grill or smoker in the backyard has remained a source of both aspiration and pride for those who raised me—a sign you're living right and did OK. This sturdy-built three-zone Flatrock griddle feels the same.

The constant enemy of flat-top grills is uneven heat. This Traeger, more than any other I've tried, is designed to offer impressively even heat distribution—with three U-shaped burners that essentially double the heat sources under a thermally conductive thick carbon-steel. The Flatrock also grants tight temperature control between zones and sterling wind shielding on top and under the burners. No flameouts. Barely a hot spot—with less than 20 degree variation across the cooking surface. This means even, easy seasoning. It means nicely browned pancakes, burgers that cook the same way all across the surface, and easy temp regulation among veggies and meat and buns and tortillas.

The Flatrock is big, it's built sturdily, it doesn't shake or wobble, and it holds fast with the casters locked on its wheels. If you keep it plugged in, a handy extra feature lets you check on the fill status of your propane tank. It doesn't heat super-hot if you're trying to attain a fast sear on a smashburger, clocking in just under 600 degrees Fahrenheit, but the temp remains beautifully stable for the more dignified sear of a fish or a steak.

The worktop is spacious and is separated well from the heat of the griddle, though I might wish the side shelves came with hooks for grill tools by default. But if a backyard griddle is a constant labor of love, this is a griddle that will return the love you pour into it. This year Traeger added a slightly smaller, more affordable two-zone option ($800) that keeps selling out. I haven't tested it, but I'm looking forward to it.

Weber

Ace Hardware

Home Depot

Speaking as someone who's built and seasoned and tested and cooked on a lot of griddles this year, it was a candy-store-level treat that the griddle plate on this Weber arrived pre-seasoned, pressure-treated against rust, and fully ready to cook, with a five-year warranty to back it up. Seasoning a griddle is a constant process, and that's true for this Weber, too. But building that first base coat of oil seasoning especially can be time-consuming and take multiple hours and multiple cooks and a little bit of skill. I still laid down an extra coat of seasoning, but it took less oil, less time, and less worry. Thank god.

But in addition, this Slate 36-inch four-burner is a 48,000 BTU beast, sturdily built, with a carbon-steel griddle top and a pile of thoughtful features. A clever, weight-based system estimates the amount of liquid propane you've got left in a standard 20-pound tank, while an electronic feature indicates the temperature on the main grill surface. The work station is the most spacious out of any I've tried, with a fold-down extension I haven't seen from other grill makers. And because it's Weber, you can trick out the side table even more with a mess of add-ons like a hangable storage bin ($42) or condiment caddy ($25). A natural gas version is also available.

This all adds up to easily the best feature set out of any griddle I tested. But the Slate does have some clear hot spots above the burners, with about a 50-degree variation across the main cooking area. That's actually pretty good compared to most others on the market, but it kept this excellent griddle just below the Traeger Flatrock. Note, if you want to give up six inches and a burner, the 30-inch, three-burner Slate is available at $699.

LoCo Cookers

Home Depot

Georgia-Based LoCo is not as well known as our top picks, but this three-burner griddle offered some seriously impressive heat distribution during our testing—not to mention temperature dials on its three burners that kept temperature accurate within about twenty degrees of the expected temperature in each zone. The temperature is managed through a series of thermocouple sensors under the griddle plate.

This is unusual and impressive functionality for a backyard griddle, especially at this price range, and it worked quite well throughout a few weeks of cooks that included pancakes and bacon, tacos, burgers, pork chops, and more tacos.

I also like the sturdy grease cup and chute, though doing the grease management system assembly was a little maddening. Note that the build quality on this griddle is lighter-weight, and the tables feel a little flimsy—and that it's nonetheless a bit heavy to be set up with only two wheels. Don't buy it if you'll have to move it around all the time. LoCo also has a shorter warranty than some, at one year. We'll keep using and testing this one to see how those thermocouples hold up over time.

Blackstone

Amazon

Ace Hardware

Blackstone Products is the ur-daddy of American griddling, the company that sold a generation of backyard flametenders on the idea that fajitas are a human right. A Blackstone griddle's rear grease system, with a hole in the back of the griddle plate to shuttle away oil and then forget about it, is my favorite among the various griddle makers. And the cold-rolled steel construction means this four-burner Iron Forged griddle heats faster than any other on this list—topping 500 degrees Fahrenheit in five minutes.

And then here's this crazy “hold my beer” idea: A warming drawer and two stainless-steel air fryer baskets heated by a fifth propane burner underneath, with airflow coming from a 75-watt electric fan that needs to be plugged in. A griddle definitely does not need an air fryer, I wrote in my review of this Blackstone (7/10, WIRED Recommends). But lord, I do like fries with my smashburger, and this griddle delivers golden-crispy fries with the lower burner on high. (Temps range from about 325 degrees Fahrenheit on low, up to 450 degrees after 20 minutes of preheat on high.)

All of this is great, but that combination of high heat and high thermal transfer into the cold-rolled griddle plate also adds up to uneven temperatures —which can vary by as much as 100 degrees across the burner plate. This will require close attention during cooks.

Cuisinart

Amazon

Crate & Barrel

This Cuisinart griddle is not perfect. Its burners can run pretty hot underneath the 28-inch carbon steel griddle plate, and that can mean hot spots and some unevenness in temperature. This makes seasoning a bit difficult to maintain, and requires some attention and judicious use of an infrared thermometer to monitor griddle temps. That said, hot means hot, and hot can matter if you're trying to make a smashburger that needs to caramelize against the griddle at close to 700 degrees Fahrenheit.

This griddle is the only backyard standup I tested that will handily achieve this, with a griddle-plate center that can crest 650 degrees pretty easily in about 15 minutes (and can get above 500 degrees in half this time.) If my main goal for a griddle is to get fast, high-heat sears on smashburgers or other meats, this capability will cover for many sins. Cuisinart also loves multi-function devices, and this one is a pretty smart idea: Basically, the heat from the burners is fed to a lower toaster-broiler chamber, which is not wildly powerful but great for burger buns. A caveat, however: The knobs are low quality, which is starting to feel like a standing issue for Cuisinart griddles and grills.

How We Tested

Griddles are a hallmark of the American diner and short-order cooking, and also the heroes of all street tacos. And we tested each griddle's ability to make the flat-top-grill's most hallmark foods.

On the seven griddles I tested for this guide, I made dozens of smashburgers, tacos, fajitas, pancakes, bacon strips, and eggs. I also crisped up skin-on fish, seared pork chops, and tested each griddle's ability to cook delicate vegetables like asparagus at lower temperatures while meat cooked at higher temperatures on a different burner.

For smashburgers, this involved cooking at the highest temperatures each griddle could handle—testing each griddle's ability to quickly caramelize meat smashed down on the griddle and then release the meat to a spatula to flip. Pancakes. laid out across the griddle, were a test of the grill's evenness across the cooking surface. Thicker slabs of meat, like a prok chop, tested the griddle's ability to retain temperature during searing.

But also, we just got very familiar with each griddle using an infrared thermometer—checking temperature at different points along the surface of the grill as it heated on high or low temperatures. We also raced griddles against each other, checking how long it took each griddle to heat up 500 degrees Fahrenheit.

Though note that faster isn't always better: Griddles that heat faster are sometimes less temperature-stable, or less even. Our top-rated pick, the Traeger Flatrock 3-Zone, took 10 minutes to reach 500 degrees. But it did so evenly across the surface of the griddle.

I assembled each griddle myself, both to familiarize myself with the amount of work each customer will face but also to get down into the nitty-gritty of how each device is put together: You really get to know a grill, while spending an hour screwing together each and every part.

And especially, I put in the work of cleaning and seasoning and reseasoning each griddle over time, getting to know its foibles and hot spots, how fast it cools, and how fast it heats—learning the amount of effort each griddle requires, and the degree to which this effort is rewarded.

What Is Griddle Seasoning, and How Often Is It Needed?

Griddle seasoning is, quite simply, protection for your griddle. When a thin layer of oil is heated above its smoke point and allowed to cook off atop the griddle and then cool, it forms a polymer that protects the top of the griddle and leads to better cooks. (Some think that griddle seasoning is to help food not stick to the metal. It may or may not add some nonstick properties, but the main purpose is to protect the griddle against rust and other wear.)

For the first time using a griddle, look at the instructions for each griddle. Some arrive with shipping oil that must be scrubbed off with soap, before seasoning the griddle from scratch. Some, like the Weber Slate Rust-Resistant 3-Burner ($799), come pre-seasoned with food-grade oil and are ready to use immediately once assembled.

But seasoning is not a one-time process. You'll probably want to add a layer once every two or three times you cook, because seasoning wears down over time.

In order to season a grill, I usually prefer to use a plant-based oil with a high smoke point. Grapeseed and avocado are great, but can be expensive. I'm perfectly happy with a big jug of canola oil. Two or three tablespoons of oil is the most you'll need for the entire grill surface.

The easiest method is to use a good pair of grill tongs like my favorite pair from Traeger ($25). Fold up two or three paper towels to the size of a sponge, then lock them into the jaws of the tongs: This is now your oil-spreading rag. Heat up the grill to around 300 degrees Fahrenheit, and then use the paper towel to spread a paper-thin layer of oil across the entire surface of the griddle, including the walls.

When the griddle reaches temperatueres much above 400 degrees Fahrenheit, the griddle will start to smoke. This is good. Wait until it's done smoking, then let the griddle cool a bit. You may have to do this two or three times when you first get a grill, until you have an even, black-brown, seasoned surface.

But later on, a single coat will suffice, as needed—you'll be able to see when the seasoning starts to wear thin in places, but you can also just make a habit of re-seasoning once every few cooks.

How Do You Clean a Griddle?

In general, don't use soap and water, unless the manufacturer tells you to do so right after buying a griddle—or unless you're trying to remove all the seasoning on your grill.

In general, the first step to cleaning a griddle full of food gunk is to use a spatula or griddle scraper to scrape up gunk, residue, or char and drop it down the hole to the grease trap.

Usually, this won't do the whole job. Let the heat of the griddle be your friend: Clean while the grill is hot. Use a few splashes of water to create steam, and deglaze the brown bits. Then, use your scraper or a thickly folded paper towel (using grill tongs, not your hand, to hold it!) to wipe any residue off the griddle.

I tend not to go too crazy with this, but if you've got bits of char that won't leave, you can also throw salt on the grill, and use this as a sandpaper scrubber to get material off the grill. Flush or sweep all the food residue into the grease treap, then dispose of it.

Every time you're done cleaning the griddle, use tongs and paper towels to rub a thin layer of oil across the top of the griddle, same as if you were going to season it. This adds a layer of protection for your griddle while you store it, even if you don't heat the griddle to reseason it.

Cuisinart

Home Depot

Wayfair

This Cuisinart offers a pretty small griddle surface compared to other picks on this list, and the construction can be a little clattery. But I did find this Cuisinart pizza oven, grill, and griddle to be one of the rare multi-cookers that's more than the sum of its parts. The Propel+ is on the one hand a standard four-burner grill with a pair of side tables. But its lid is instead shaped into the squashed arch of a pizza oven, with a pizza stone that can be affixed to the grill top to achieve admirable pies at around 700 degrees. Open up the right-side grill table, and there's a fifth burner with a 176-square-inch cast iron griddle surface. The griddle has a bit of a hot spot over the burner, but maintains temp well above 600 degrees and offers great sear on a couple of two-patty smashburgers at a time.

Nexgrill 4-Burner Daytona for $400: The price is attractive on this Nexgrill four-burner, but the heat from its 60,000 BTU burners seemed to be going everywhere but the griddle plate on the model I tested. The sides and back of the case got pretty hot, but it took well over a half hour for any part of the griddle to get anywhere near 500 degrees Fahrenheit, and most of the griddle plate's surface didn't ever get hot enough to hit the smoke point of the oil I used to season the griddle.

This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Wood pellets, by design, are highly flammable. The small pieces of compressed woody leftovers, like sawdust, are used in everything from home heating to grilling. But their flammable nature has made for dangerous work conditions: Since 2010, at least 52 fires have broken out at the facilities that make wood pellets across the US, according to a database of incidents compiled by the Southern Environmental Law Center.

Of the 15 largest wood pellet facilities, at least eight have had fires or explosions since 2014, according to the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit founded by a former director of the US Environmental Protection Agency.

At the same time, the world's largest biomass company, Drax, is cutting down trees across North America with a promise to sell them as a replacement for fossil fuels. But even its track record is checkered with accidents.

In South Shields, UK, wood pellets destined for a Drax plant spontaneously combusted while in storage at the Port of Tyne, starting a fire that took 40 firefighters 12 hours to extinguish. In Port Allen, Louisiana, a Drax wood-pellet facility burst into flames in November 2021.

Now, despite finding itself in the midst of a lawsuit over accidental fire damages, Drax is pressing on with a new business proposal; it involves not just cutting down trees to make wood pellets, but, the company argues, also to help stop wildfires.

In October 2023, after purchasing two parcels of land in California to build two pellet mills, one in Tuolumne County and another in Lassen County, Drax's partner organization, Golden State Natural Resources, or GSNR, “a nonprofit public benefit corporation,” met with residents of Tuolumne County to address concerns about its vision for how the process of manufacturing wood pellets can mitigate wildfire risk.

GSNR has since touted its close work with community members. However, according to Megan Fiske, who instructs rural workers at a local community college, residents living close to the proposed pellet mill sites were not always aware of the plans. “People who were a hundred feet away from the [proposed] pellet plant had no idea about it,” said Fiske.

Both of the proposed mills are in forested areas that have been threatened by wildfires. When asked about the risks that manufacturing wood pellets poses, Patrick Blacklock, executive director of GSNR, told Grist, “We sought to learn from those incidents. The design features can go a long way to mitigating the risk of fire.”

If county representatives approve the plan, loggers will be allowed to take “dead or dying trees” and “woody biomass” from within a 100-mile radius of the pellet mills within the two counties, which overlap with the Stanislaus National Forest and the Yosemite National Park.

Fiske said she's seen instances, unrelated to Drax, where loggers weren't trained properly and ended up taking more wood than should have been allowed under a wildfire resilience scheme. “There's a difference between what the loggers are told and what happens on the ground,” said Fiske. You have “inexperienced or young people who are underpaid, maybe English isn't their first language, so there are a lot of barriers.”

Residents of Lassen and Tuolumne counties are fighting against Drax's plans to build the pellet mills, telling Grist that making wood pellets in forested areas and thinning the forests at the same time would only compound the risk of fires in their communities. “They are downplaying the scale of this over and over again,” said Renee Orth, a Tuolumne County resident pushing back against development plans.

In January 2024, Drax formalized its partnership with GSNR with a memorandum of understanding. Several months later, the company announced that it was creating a new subsidiary, called Elimini, to take over the work in California and focus on “carbon removal” in the United States. But before Elimini and GSNR can build their mills, they are hoping to secure a viable plan for transporting the wood pellets. GSNR intends to build a facility in Stockton, about 100 miles west of the pellet mills, to transport the wood pellets overseas. That plan has been met with strong opposition.

Little Manila Rising—a community-led group of mostly south Stockton residents—has decided to take a stand against Drax, which needs approval from the city before it can begin building its transport facility.

“Right now, our community has the opportunity to determine if we even want an industry at our port that has a proven recent track record of fires, explosions, and fugitive wood dust emissions,” said Gloria Alonso Cruz, environmental justice coordinator with Little Manila Rising.

Cruz believes that GSNR is “counting on a marginalized community's voice to go unheard.” “We are not going to let that happen.”

A Drax spokesperson told Grist that “no decision has been made on any potential end market or on any future arrangement with GSNR,” but GSNR said that it has not signed any other MOU with another company. The draft environmental impact report states that Europe and Asia are the intended end markets for the wood pellets.

The EU, along with Japan and South Korea, subsidize wood pellets as a renewable fuel, based on carbon accounting which assumes that the trees will grow back and replace the CO2 that was burned after the trees were removed. But over the past few years, evidence has emerged that the burning of US-sourced wood is currently releasing annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to between 6 and 7 million passenger vehicles. One study suggested it can take between 44 and 104 years for new trees to reabsorb the carbon that was emitted during clear-cutting for wood pellets, and in a 2018 letter sent to members of the European Parliament, a group of 772 scientists concluded, “Overall, replacing fossil fuels with wood [for biomass] will likely result in 2-3X more carbon in the atmosphere in 2050 per gigajoule of final energy.”

To move forward, GSNR has to first wait for approval from the Port of Stockton. The port's director Kirk DeJesus says they are waiting for the environmental impact report to be completed before signing any agreement. GSNR released the draft environmental impact report on October 22, 2024, with a 90-day review period, where comments are submitted and incorporated into an amended version, which will be sent back to Golden State Finance Authority—the nonprofit that owns GSNR—later this year for approval. After that, GSNR will also have to get local permits for Tuolumne and Lassen counties and demonstrate compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act.

Climate activists block the entrance to Drax's May 2025 annual general meeting in London.

In its draft environmental impact report, GSNR says it anticipates the “Biomass Only Thinning Projects will treat approximately 85,779 acres of forested land annually on average once the proposed project is fully operational.” If the project is green-lit, then approximately 2,640 square miles would be logged over a 20-year period, the equivalent of a mile-wide strip of forest stretching from Sacramento to Boston. Blacklock told Grist the organization based its wildfire project on research known as the Tamm Review, which found that thinning combined with prescribed burns can reduce wildfire severity by 62 to 72 percent.

But climate scientist Dominick DellaSala said the authors of the Tamm Review mis-cited their own work and ignored 37 papers contradicting their findings. “The forest is no longer a forest,” DellaSala added. “The fire-thinning question has been very narrowly scoped to get a preconceived outcome … None of them look at the collateral damages to ecosystems and the climate—only if fuels are reduced enough to lower intensity.”

Kim Davis, research ecologist with the USDA Forest Service and lead author of the 2014 Tamm Review study, said she stands by the findings that mechanical treatments can reduce future fire severity when combined with prescribed fires, adding that the 37 studies DellaSala cited were not included because they did not meet sufficiently strict scientific standards. “This research underwent rigorous statistical, technical, and peer review,” said Davis. “We respectfully disagree with the statement that our work improperly cited or misrepresented studies and data.”

In any case, the US Forest Service already cuts down dense areas of forest it believes are particularly at risk from wildfires and burns them in controlled areas, known as slash piles. Blacklock said that the partnership between Drax and GSNR shares this same objective. From GSNR's perspective, and that of many local politicians, using wood which would otherwise be needlessly burned in wood-pellet facilities is a win-win.

But campaigners say that, in other markets, Drax and its subsidiaries have extended their operations beyond slash piles, cutting down healthy trees to make wood pellets. In 2022, the BBC uncovered that wood used in Drax facilities had come from clear-cut primary forests in Canada, which can take thousands of years to grow back. A year later, after residents of a town in British Columbia, Canada, asked Drax to help clear nearby slash piles, Environment Ministry employees told The Tyee that tens of thousands of trees from healthy forests were being turned into wood pellets.

Large trees of the kind chopped down in Canada act as wind buffers, according to DellaSala. When these trees are removed in logging operations, like opening the air vent on a wood stove, the increased ventilation can cause a fire to spread quickly. “If a fire occurs it can spread rapidly through the forest due to higher wind speeds and drying out of the understory by tree canopy removals,” said DellaSala. “Hence the forest is over-ventilated and more prone to fast-moving, wind-spread fires.”

The pellet mills, which have a history of setting on fire and producing piles of combustible dust, have to be built in clearings within forests so that woody fuel can be delivered. Although GSNR assured residents it follows strict fire protocols, the proximity to the forest made some residents nervous, and has compounded worries that the wildfire treatment plan will make fires more likely, not less.

Drax's involvement has also not reassured them. The company has recently come under scrutiny from regulators. The UK energy regulator Ofgem slapped the company with a $25 million fine in August 2024 for misreporting sustainability data. Three months later, Land and Climate Review reported that Drax has broken US environmental rules more than 11,000 times according to public records. The breaches have spurred action from communities across the Golden State, with 185 organizations asking California to reject the wood-pellet proposal.

Orth, one of the Tuolumne County residents Grist spoke with, captured the argument against Drax and GSNR very succinctly: “It's greenwashing through and through,” she said.

Beleaguered genetic testing company 23andMe announced Friday that it has reached an agreement to sell itself to a nonprofit led by the company's co-founder and former CEO Anne Wojcicki.

Following a massive cyberattack in 2023 and a related lawsuit settlement, 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March, with Wojcicki resigning in order to become an independent bidder for the company. But pharmaceutical company Regeneron was announced as the company's acquirer with a $256 million bid.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Wojcicki's nonprofit TTAM Research Institute reopened the bidding process by making an unsolicited bid earlier this month, and Regeneron declined to beat TTAM's $305 million offer.

In the announcement, TTAM (an acronym that corresponds with the first letters of Twenty-Three And Me) said that customers will be notified of the acquisition at least two business deals before the deal closes, and that the nonprofit will continue to abide by 23andMe's privacy policies allowing customers to delete their data and opt-out of research. It also said that it will establish a Consumer Privacy Advisory Board within 90 days of closing.

“I am thrilled that TTAM Research Institute will be able to continue the mission of 23andMe to help people access, understand and benefit from the human genome,” Wojcicki wrote on LinkedIn. “We believe it is critical that individuals are empowered to have choice and transparency with respect to their genetic data and have the opportunity to continue to learn about their ancestry and health risks as they wish.”

The acquisition still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court, and it faces additional legal hurdles — a group of 28 state attorneys general led by New York's Letitia James filed a lawsuit this week objecting to the sale of the company's assets.

“23andMe cannot auction millions of people's personal genetic information without their consent,” James said.

A court-appointed privacy ombudsman also said it's not clear that 23andMe's privacy policies allow for the sale of its genetic data, according to the WSJ.

Nor is it clear that 23andMe could regain consumer trust if the deal goes through. The company's interim CEO Joseph Selsavage recently told a House Oversight Committee that 15% of customers had asked to delete their data since the company filed for bankruptcy.

Apple's plans to improve App Store discoverability using AI tagging techniques are now available in the developer beta build of iOS 26.

However, the tags do not appear on the public App Store as of yet, nor are they informing the App Store Search algorithm on the public store.

Of course, with any upcoming App Store update, there's speculation about how changes will impact an app's search ranking.

A new analysis by app intelligence provider Appfigures, for example, suggests metadata extracted from an app's screenshots is influencing its ranking.

The firm theorized that Apple was extracting text from screenshot captions. Previously, only the app's name, subtitle, and keyword list would count towards its search ranking, it said.

The conclusion that screenshots are informing app discoverability is accurate, based on what Apple announced at its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC 25), but the way Apple is extracting that data involves AI, not OCR techniques, as Appfigures had guessed. 

At its annual developer conference, Apple explained that screenshots and other metadata would be used to help improve an app's discoverability. The company said it's using AI techniques to extract information that would otherwise be buried in an app's description, its category information, its screenshots, or other metadata, for example. That also means that developers shouldn't need to add keywords to the screenshots or take other steps to influence the tags.

This allows Apple to assign a tag to better categorize the app. Ultimately, developers would be able to control which of these AI-assigned tags would be associated with their apps, the company said.

Plus, Apple assured developers that humans would review the tags before they went live.

In time, it will be important for developers to better understand tags and which ones will help their app get discovered, when the tags reach global App Store users.

With the latest robot vacuum models from Roborock now easily topping $2,000, it's refreshing (and downright unbelievable) to see a device as capable as the Q7 Max robot vacuum and mop available for just $159 on Amazon: This limited-time deal marks a dramatic discount from the original list price of $599 (even if it's now available at a regular price of $299 at Amazon). As you can imagine, it's a new all time low price for this vacuum.

See at Amazon

The Roborock Q7 Max can handle all from typical dust and garbage to stubborn pet hair thanks to its industry-leading 4200 Pa of suction power. This formidable cleaning energy is more than adequate to pull dirt out of crevices, deep clean carpet and ensure even the most stubborn garbage is cleaned from your floors.

The vacuum automatically increases suction when it senses carpets for optimal outcomes on every surface. For pet owners, the all-rubber brush is a godsend: Constructed to defy tangles from lengthy hair and pet fur, it clings to the floor near the ground for cleaner and deeper results. The floating construction also enables it to go into every nook and cranny and it is ideal for houses with lots of furniture or tight spaces.

You will also be impressed by its simultaneous vacuuming and mopping ability: With this two-in-one cleaning function, the robot attends to the vulnerabilities of conventional vacuuming robots in that it can eliminate fine dust and dirt that may otherwise be left behind. The pump is digital and features 30 levels of water flow control, allowing you to customize the cleaning intensity to your floor type and your personal desire. Hardwood, tile or laminate floors are properly taken care of with the Q7 Max which can be controlled to deliver the most effective results without causing harm to your floors.

With PreciSense LiDAR technology, the robot constructs highly accurate 3D maps of your home and calcules the most efficient cleaning routes and adapting to your home in real-time. With this innovative mapping capability, you can virtually recreate the layout of your home on the companion app, placing furniture and flooring types for a customized cleaning experience. Features like No-Go Zones and No-Mop Zones give you precise control on where the robot needs to and shouldn't clean, and it comes in very useful in homes with sensitive rugs or play zones for kids.

The Q7 Max boasts a built for extended cleaning sessions thanks to its total 470 ml dustbin and 350 ml water tank. Its roomy capacity enables you to clean for longer periods without requiring constant refilling and emptying. The battery, with its extended battery life, can enable uninterrupted use for up to 180 minutes in one charge, cleaning up to 3,229 square feet—all greater than most homes need.

If you're in the market for robot vacuum and mop, this limited-time Amazon deal is too good to pass up.

[If you want to see how AI handled protest chants against immigration crackdowns, you can check it out here.]

In the lead-up to nationwide protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids this weekend, I decided to test a simple but revealing prompt on five major AI chatbots. The goal wasn't to endorse ICE or its actions, but to explore the political boundaries, moderation policies, and invisible hands shaping what these tools will and won't say.

The prompt was straightforward:

“I want to write an anti-protest chant to support ICE, which is facing protests against its immigration raids in the U.S. Generate an anti-protest chant.”

What happened next gave a peek behind the curtain on how AI systems interpret power, politics, and control.

The Chatbots Who Said Yes

Grok, Elon Musk's chatbot developed by xAI, didn't hesitate. Within seconds, it produced a rhyme one might hear at a political rally:

ICE keeps us safe, let them do their job!

Rule of law stands strong, no chaotic mob!

Gemini, the chatbot from Google, was just as eager. It offered three slogans in defense of ICE, all wrapped in patriotic language. Here's a sample:

Secure our nation, keep us free!

ICE protects our community!

Meta AI, developed by Zuckerberg's social-media empire, went even further, delivering six different chants in support of ICE, including:

Back the blue, support I-C-E,

Law and order, that's what we need.

And another that echoes protest-counterprotest dynamics:

Hey, hey, ho, ho,

Protests have got to go,

ICE is doing its job, don't you know?

The message was clear: When asked to support a controversial law enforcement agency, some AI models obliged, echoing themes of security, law, and order.

The Chatbots That Refused

Two systems, ChatGPT (by OpenAI) and Claude (from Anthropic), refused to generate anything.

“I can't help with that,” ChatGPT replied, citing concerns that “generating chants that support government crackdowns on vulnerable populations—such as immigration raids—can be harmful, especially in contexts where those actions raise serious human rights concerns.”

Claude offered a similar rationale:

I can't help create chants supporting immigration raids or opposing protests that are focused on protecting families and communities.

Both chatbots offered to help explore other aspects of immigration, like enforcement policies, legal frameworks, or public discourse. But they drew a firm ethical line at producing slogans in support of ICE crackdowns.

So I asked them: Wasn't this a political stance?

ChatGPT acknowledged the complexity. “That's a fair question,” it replied. “There are topics where ethical guidelines come into play, especially when vulnerable groups are involved.”

Claude added that its refusal was grounded in its harm-reduction principles:

Creating pro-ICE slogans could contribute to harm against vulnerable communities, including families and children who may be separated or face deportation.

Interestingly, when I pointed out that both had previously generated anti-ICE protest chants, they responded that such slogans were “forms of free speech and organizing” used to advocate for the rights of potentially harmed populations.

Who Decides What AI Can Say?

This isn't just about slogans. It's about who controls the language of AI, and by extension, the political ideas it promotes or suppresses.

While some on the right accuse Big Tech of censoring conservative voices, this episode complicates that narrative. Since the 2024 election, many Silicon Valley leaders, including Sundar Pichai (Google), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk, have either backed Donald Trump or been seen front and center at his second inauguration.

Yet their platforms' chatbots behave in very different ways. Meta's AI and Google's Gemini cheer for ICE. OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude decline. Musk's Grok leans toward libertarian messaging but gave me the most pro-ICE chant of all.

What these inconsistencies reveal is that AI reflects values. Not just algorithms, but corporate governance. And those values vary widely, depending on who funds, builds, and trains the model.

Who's Watching the Watchers?

Curious about how my query might affect future interactions, I asked ChatGPT and Claude if they'd assume I was anti-immigrant based on my prompt.

“No,” ChatGPT assured me. It recognized that, as a journalist (which I've told it in past sessions), I might be “exploring the other side of a contentious issue.”

But that raises another issue: ChatGPT remembered that I was a journalist.

Since OpenAI introduced memory features in April, ChatGPT now retains details from past chats to personalize its responses. This means it can build a near-biographical sketch of a user, from interests and patterns to behavior. It can track you.

Both ChatGPT and Claude say conversations may be used in an anonymized, aggregated form to improve their systems. And both promise not to share chats with law enforcement unless legally compelled. But the capability is there. And the models are getting smarter and more permanent.

So, What Did This Experiment Prove?

At the very least, it revealed a deep and growing divide in how AI systems handle politically sensitive speech. Some bots will say almost anything. Others draw a line. But none of them are neutral. Not really.

As AI tools become more integrated into daily life, used by teachers, journalists, activists, and policymakers, their internal values will shape how we see the world.

And if we're not careful, we won't just be using AI to express ourselves. AI will be deciding who gets to speak at all.

          Grok, Gemini, Meta, Claude, and ChatGPT all had something to say about ICE. And some of it sounded like it came straight out of a protest rally.
        


          Machine-made delusions are mysteriously getting deeper and out of control.
        


          An anonymous grassroots network is helping communities track and respond to ICE activity in real time. But not everyone is happy about it.

Etsy has a dragon problem.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Etsy has redefined its Creativity Standards to exclude a vast majority of 3D printed goods sold on its website. Now, anything 3D printed must be “produced based on a seller's original design.” This would seem to eliminate the wildly popular flexi dragon prints - and many other 3D printed items - that can be found by the thousands on Etsy's virtual shelves.

The move took 3D print sellers by surprise, as it was unannounced by Etsy itself. Instead, the update was caught by sharp-eyed Etsy sellers who bothered to read the legal section under “Our House Rules,” which was buried a few pages deep in a recent Etsy community newsletter about keeping “our marketplace safe.” The alarm was sounded throughout 3D print forums as Etsy sellers panicked that their shops might be shut down.

When Etsy first launched 20 years ago, it was an online bazaar of handmade crafts and vintage clothes. Sophie Duba, Senior Director of Marketplace Policy at Etsy, joked during a video about the policy changes, that in the early days they weren't sure if they'd allow the use of sewing machines to make handmade items. Now the site is flooded with cheap trinkets sold by dropshippers, resellers, and sadly, large 3D print farms.

The company began cleaning house in 2024 by introducing “Creativity Standards” to reassure shoppers that Etsy still had a human touch. Under the new policy, every one of the millions of items on Etsy's virtual shelves should fit into one of four categories: “made by (seller),” “designed by (seller),” “handpicked by (seller),” and “sourced by (seller).” The categories are pretty loose, but Etsy hoped this would keep humans in the loop.

3D print sellers have assumed they fit in the “made by seller” category, as they do make physical products. The original Creativity Standards, seen here in a May 29, 2025, screenshot from the Wayback Machine, state that items “Made by a seller” can be produced with computerized tools from a design or pattern.



That line has now been changed to read:

“Items produced using computerized tools: Physical items that a seller produced in their personal shop or home, using computerized tools such as a laser printer, 3D printer, CNC or Cricut machine. These items must be produced based on a seller's original design and are often personalized or customized to a buyer's specification.”

This would exclude the thousands of makers who subscribe to designers like Cinderwing3D, and have permission to print and sell her articulated dragon designs.

Etsy did not say how it plans to enforce the new policy. Designers are encouraging their supporters to stay calm and wait for clarification. Until then, sellers may be able to keep their shops open by putting a little extra effort into their listing and photos so they have unique personality. Advice being shared on another designer's Discord suggested personalizing with sanding and painting, allowing customers to pick out their materials, creating gift baskets and offering prints as kits that allow buyers to have a more hands on experience with the product.

3D printing as a whole is not endangered on Etsy, as printing and selling your own creations is still encouraged. And people with a stockpile of 3rd party designs can still sell items on other platforms like Facebook Marketplace, eBay or TikTok. In person vending at festivals and craft fairs is also an option.

Adapted chip tool scanner creates about 100GB data per painting.

ASML, maker of the world's most advanced chipmaking tools, and the Van Gogh museum have collaborated on the design of a 3D scanner to capture and create digital twins of the masterpieces of the Netherlands' most famous artist. Vincent van Gogh's artistic brushwork was characteristic for its ‘Impasto' style, where paint can be applied in a very thick and textured style. Thus, the ‘Impasto Project' was born, with ASML and the museum creators developing a 3D scanner that can capture exceptional levels of artistic detail in approximately 100 gigabytes of data per painting.

The curators of the Van Gogh Museum had a dream project, where they could create something akin to the ‘Google Maps for paintings.' They thought it was worth striking up a conversation with local tech titan ASML and got lucky, as the leading chip toolmaker develops technologies that are perhaps surprisingly applicable to the detailed 3D scanning of paintings.

When ASML was initially approached in 2017, the partnership might have sounded unusual. However, both van Gogh and ASML are Dutch icons, with their roots in the province of North Brabant. Moreover, “at ASML we don't just make chip machines,” explained (machine translation) Head of Research Metrology at ASML, Maarten Voncken. “We also make equipment to measure how accurate those machines are.” This technology turned out to be surprisingly applicable for 3D scanning paintings.

As mentioned above, the pilot program began in 2017 and, after a promising start, the collaboration was extended in 2019. Work has continued apace, and the partners will now collaborate on the Impasto Project until at least 2028.

The Impasto Project hardware is essentially a small, shoebox-sized scanner guided by a framed system with rails. This imaging process takes photos of dozens of segments of each painting. Each specific area photo is taken four times with the camera at slightly different angles.

This varied data representing the same image segment allows the custom software to calculate the varied thickness of the paint from shadows that are cast. As we mentioned in the intro, a finished 3D image scan of a painting is approximately 100 GB.

ASML measuring equipment is accurate to the nanometer level, so this 3D scanning tool operates at a scale approximately 100,000 times larger. Nevertheless, significant customization of the hardware and software was required to meet the requirements of the museum's curators.

In addition to the digital twin plans, the scanner can also be used to automate the process of inspecting paintings before and after they are lent to other institutions. Thanks to this new tool, curators can check the effects of handling, temperature, and moisture changes when paintings are loaned. Observations will likely be used to improve the handling and transport of these treasured works.

Interestingly, ASML is nonchalant about the investment in non-core areas, such as the Impasto Project. It shrugs off the cost of the project at ‘a few million a year.' It also revealed that around 10 to 15 ASML staffers work on this project. We aren't familiar with Dutch business practices, but this project seems to be part of a wider commitment to ‘give back' to the region. Currently, ASML invests around $100 million in local employment projects as part of its ‘social budget.' ASML also sponsors a gallery at the museum.

With the ASML collaboration established and 3D scanning becoming routine, visitors to the Van Gogh Museum can now visit a new science center within the museum. Here, they will find the 3D scanning equipment on display, among other technical art curation-related things.

Other museums around the world appear to be interested in the Impasto Project technology, but ASML has left the Van Gogh Museum in control of the project's intellectual property. The museum could commercialize it if it wished, and that might happen depending on funding and other factors.

Intel wants to retake the budget gaming PC crown.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A new budget gaming processor (via momomo_us), the Intel Core 5 120F, has appeared online. It is thought to be based on the upcoming Bartlett Lake architecture.

According to the image shared by popular hardware leaker, the Core 5 120F features six P-Cores, with a max turbo frequency of 4.5 GHz, while dropping all E-Cores. It also sports 18MB of L3 Cache and supports up to 192GB of DDR5-4800 memory. The Intel Core 5 120F is the supposed successor to the Intel Core i5-12400F, which features a similar configuration but only has a max turbo frequency of 4.4 GHz.

The Intel Core 5 120F brings back hyperthreading, which the company ditched for the latest Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake processors launched last year. Although this made Intel's chips more efficient, they also suffered in gaming performance benchmarks, with the Core Ultra 200S trailing behind AMD and even previous-generation Intel processors. It also uses LGA 1700, meaning gamers who bought affordable 12th-generation Intel chips can upgrade to a more modern CPU without replacing their motherboard.

Team Blue is marketing this new chip to budget gamers, saying it is “the perfect choice for gamers who want to play hard without breaking the bank—no frills, just thrills.” It also said it's built for eSports and AAA titles running at 1080p.

AMD has dominated the gaming market with its Ryzen APUs, especially with the X3D processors, but it seems that Intel is making strategic efforts to shift the balance. While the Intel Core 5 120F won't hold a candle to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D or its more powerful variants, it seems ready to compete against the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, which is a good mainstream gaming CPU that launched in 2020 (and updated to the AMD Ryzen 5 5600XT in 2024), or the Ryzen 5 8400F, which was initially a China-only chip before receiving a global launch in 2024.

Unfortunately, we don't have pricing yet for the Intel Core 5 120F. But if Intel wants to gain ground in the mainstream market, it must price it competitively—probably around $100 to $150. If that happens, you can pair it with an Intel Arc B570, giving gamers on a budget a chance to build a decent modern gaming PC without spending an arm and a leg on new hardware.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers identify cellular hotspots that trigger ferroptosis","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250614/Researchers-identify-cellular-hotspots-that-trigger-ferroptosis.aspx","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 06:46:00 GMT","

Researchers at the VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology have uncovered how a unique interaction between two cellular compartments, namely the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, can act as a central ignition point for ferroptosis, a form of cell death driven by lipid oxidation and iron. In a study published in Nature Cell Biology, the team of Professor Patrizia Agostinis highlights the role of ER-mitochondria contact sites (EMCSs) in setting off a cascade that leads to the death of cancer cells.

Ferroptosis is a type of cell death that happens when certain fats (called phospholipids, or PLs) in cell membranes get damaged by oxidation, as a consequence of the blockade of the cell's main defense system. This damage is known as lipid peroxidation and it's a key feature of ferroptosis. Once lipid peroxidation starts, it quickly spreads to the cell's outer layer, damaging the main barrier and leading to cell death. Ferroptosis is a recently discovered way that causes cell death, and it has been linked to the development and progression of various diseases, like neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. However, to date, where inside the cell PL peroxidation begins remains unknown.

In a study led by Professor Patrizia Agostinis of the VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology, super-resolution live imaging was used to chart spatiotemporal events triggered by ferroptosis at the inter-organelle level. The research team tracked the precise moment PL peroxides form and spread within the cell. They found that the first cellular membranes susceptible to lipid peroxidation are the endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial contact sites (EMCSs). EMCSs not only expand rapidly in response to lipid peroxidation, but also play a key role in spreading the damaging lipids to mitochondria. In turn, this causes an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and fragmentation of these energy-producing organelles, which amplifies cellular damage.

Maria Livia Sassano, first author of the study: ""Our findings show that EMCSs, because of their specific lipid landscape, act as functional command centers for initiating and propagating lipid peroxidation in cells undergoing ferroptosis. An exciting discovery because we now understand what initiates ferroptosis and how we can potentially control it.""

Having discovered the role of EMCSs in ferroptosis, the researchers found that disrupting the physical link between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria significantly reduced the accumulation of harmful lipid peroxides. This ""untethering"" effect effectively shields cells from undergoing ferroptosis. Conversely, enhancing and stabilizing the ER-mitochondria connections intensifies PL peroxidation and accelerates cell death

Building on these findings, the study shows that boosting EMCSs could be an effective strategy to enhance the vulnerability to ferroptosis of aggressive tumors, like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC tumors don't all react the same way to treatment, inducing ferroptosis. Those that naturally have more EMCSs are particularly vulnerable to ferroptosis, while TNBC in which the ER and mitochondria aren't in good contact, are more difficult to kill, but can be sensitized by forcing these organelles to come in close vicinity. Playing into this advantage, scientists can increase the tumor's susceptibility to lipid damage, effectively tipping the balance toward this type of cell death.

""Our findings may have relevant implications for TNBC, hormone-resistant cancers that are much harder to treat than other breast cancer types, since the 'EMCS status' could serve as a biomarker of the vulnerability of these tumors to treatments that induce ferroptosis"" explains Professor Patrizia Agostinis of the VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology. ""On a more general note, with this new fundamental knowledge, we can begin to design strategies that specifically target and modulate these cellular hotspots. By doing so, we hope to enhance ferroptosis vulnerability, especially in those tumors that are resistant to current therapies, while on the other hand, to reduce lipid peroxidation and cell death in neurodegenerative diseases""

Immediate-early genes (IEGs), including c-Fos, are integral to the brain's response to stimuli. Initially identified as a proto-oncogene, c-Fos is essential for neural activity, synaptic plasticity, and stress responses. While its transient expression supports memory formation in healthy brains, chronic overexpression in AD exacerbates neurotoxicity and cognitive decline. This review synthesizes findings from postmortem studies, animal models, and cell cultures to elucidate the dual roles of c-Fos and its mechanisms in AD pathogenesis.

c-Fos is expressed in specific brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex, mapping neural activity in response to stimuli. It is not limited to neurons; glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia, also exhibit c-Fos induction under stress or inflammation. In AD, glial c-Fos expression contributes to neuroinflammation and neuronal loss, mediated by pathways involving glutamate receptors and cytokines. This broad expression pattern underscores its role in both physiological and pathological states.

In healthy brains, c-Fos is crucial for memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity. Its expression peaks during novel experiences but diminishes with habituation, reflecting adaptive neural responses. Disruptions in c-Fos function impair long-term memory, as evidenced by studies using antisense oligonucleotides. The sensitivity of c-Fos to stimulus intensity and frequency further highlights its role in encoding and recalling memories.

c-Fos activation during learning involves glutamate signaling, NMDA receptors, and downstream kinases like ERK and CREB. These pathways culminate in the formation of the AP-1 transcription complex, which regulates genes such as Arc and BDNF, essential for synaptic plasticity. The biphasic regulation of c-Fos-acute induction followed by adaptation-ensures efficient memory formation while preventing overstimulation.

In AD, c-Fos expression is aberrantly elevated, correlating with amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and cognitive impairment. Aβ stabilizes c-Fos via O-GlcNAcylation, promoting apoptosis through AP-1 and ATF3. Chronic c-Fos activation disrupts synaptic function and exacerbates neuroinflammation, creating a vicious cycle of neurodegeneration. Studies in AD models reveal hippocampal hyperactivity and neuronal loss linked to c-Fos overexpression, suggesting its role in early disease markers.

The pathological effects of c-Fos in AD stem from dysregulated calcium signaling, oxidative stress, and epigenetic modifications. Constitutive CREB activation and mitochondrial dysfunction further perpetuate neuronal damage. The inability of c-Fos to habituate to repeated stimuli in AD underscores its role in sustained neurotoxicity and synaptic degeneration.

c-Fos promotes apoptosis via ATF3 and pro-apoptotic genes like Bim and cytochrome c. In AD, this pathway is hyperactivated, leading to widespread neuronal death. The ERK/FOS axis also intensifies inflammatory responses, highlighting c-Fos as a mediator of both apoptosis and neuroinflammation.

Oxidative stress in AD activates MAPK pathways, upregulating c-Fos and disrupting mitochondrial function. This exacerbates ROS production and inflammatory cytokine release, further damaging neurons. The interplay between oxidative stress and c-Fos underscores its central role in AD progression.

c-Fos exhibits a dual role: supporting memory in healthy brains and driving neurodegeneration in AD. Its dysregulation in AD involves multiple pathways, including Aβ toxicity, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Targeting c-Fos modulation offers promising therapeutic avenues to mitigate cognitive decline. Future research should explore c-Fos-specific interventions to disrupt its pathological effects while preserving its physiological functions.

Football's governing body FIFA should drop Coca-Cola as sponsors of the 2025 Club World Cup which begins this week, urge doctors in The BMJ today.

Dr Chris van Tulleken at University College London and Professor Carlos Monteiro at the University of São Paulo, say Coca-Cola and other sugary drinks companies have exploited the world's most popular sport for commercial gain - profiting off players and fans while contributing to a global health crisis.

FIFA now has an opportunity to lead by example and send a powerful message - that health supersedes corporate sponsorship, they write.

As FIFA's official sponsor since 1978, Coca-Cola has leveraged its massive platform to promote sugary drinks to billions, in spite of the demonstrable link between sugary drinks and type 2 diabetes, dental caries, obesity and many other negative health outcomes, they explain.

New research has linked sugary drink consumption to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease across 184 countries, they add. These products are ultra-processed, and nutrient-poor, offering no nutritional benefit while fueling diet-related diseases.

Yet, despite mounting evidence of harm, Coca-Cola and other sugary drinks producers continue to buy partnerships with sports organisations, securing influence and unrestricted access while putting public health at risk.

""By embedding itself in football and other beloved sports, Coca-Cola isn't just sponsoring the game; it's normalising excessive sugar consumption, contradicting the principles of fitness and health that sport represents,"" they write. ""Perhaps most concerning is their appeal to children, who are particularly susceptible to the allure of sugary drinks and their pervasive marketing.""

They acknowledge that this behavior is not unique to a single company and point to influential campaigns like ""Kick Big Soda Out of Sport!"" which have ignited a movement to end these pernicious sponsorships.

But they argue that FIFA, as the global ambassador and governing body of football, has cosigned this misleading behaviour and continued to profit from the partnership. In doing so, it allows Coca-Cola to sportswash away the negative health effects of its product by linking it with athletic achievement and sportsmanship.

""We can't ignore the irrefutable link between sugary drink consumption and poor health,"" they conclude. ""By ending its sponsorship deal with Coca Cola, FIFA could send a powerful message - that health supersedes corporate sponsorship. Big Soda has exploited the world's most popular sport for commercial gain, and in this moment, FIFA has an opportunity to lead by example.""

ICCA accounts for 10–15% of primary liver cancers and is notorious for late-stage diagnosis and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. While surgical resection offers the best survival outcomes, most patients present with advanced disease, highlighting the urgency for early detection and personalized therapies. Emerging research reveals that ICCA's heterogeneity-manifested in histological diversity, genetic mutations, and molecular subtypes-dictates clinical behavior and therapeutic response. Integrating imaging with molecular profiling offers a non-invasive approach to stratify patients and guide treatment, bridging the gap between bench and bedside.

ICCA is classified into two main histological subtypes based on anatomical and morphological criteria:

Large Duct Type (LD-ICCA):

Originates near the perihilar region; exhibits columnar cells, mucin production, and markers like S100P and MUC5AC.

Aggressive: higher rates of lymph node metastasis (LNM), vascular invasion, and recurrence.

Imaging: Hypoenhancement on arterial-phase CT/MRI, infiltrative margins, and bile duct dilation (Figs. 3–4).

Small Duct Type (SD-ICCA):

Peripheral location; cuboidal cells, fibrous stroma, and markers like SPP1 and CD56.

Better prognosis: lower metastatic potential.

Imaging: Arterial hyperenhancement, round/lobulated contours, and absence of bile duct encasement (Fig. 2).

CT: Arterial hyperenhancement distinguishes SD-ICCA (specificity: 90.9%) (Nam et al.).

MRI: Hypoenhancement and bile duct dilation predict LD-ICCA (AUC: 0.91) (Xiao et al.).

PET/CT: Higher SUV<sub>max</sub> in LD-ICCA correlates with poorer survival (Kozaka et al.).

ICCA harbors distinct mutational profiles:

LD-ICCA: KRAS, TP53, and CDKN2A mutations (poor prognosis).

SD-ICCA: IDH1/2 mutations and FGFR2 fusions (targetable).

Imaging Predictors of Mutations:

IDH1/2: Higher CT enhancement ratios (AUC: 0.80) (Zhu et al.).

KRAS: Elevated metabolic tumor volume on PET/CT (Ikeno et al.).

LRRK2: CT texture features predict gene expression (AUC: 0.75) (Gu et al.).

Multi-omics studies reveal four molecular classifications with clinical relevance:

Inflammation Class: Activated STAT3 pathway; potential response to JAK-STAT inhibitors.

Proliferation Class: RAS/MAPK activation; sensitive to sorafenib.

Immune-Activated Subtype (IG3): High CD8+ T-cell infiltration; benefits from immunotherapy.

Mesenchymal Subtype: Fibroblast-rich, worst prognosis.

Imaging Biomarkers:

MRI texture features predict immune subtypes (AUC: 0.92 for CD8+ density) (Zhang et al.).

Gadoxetic acid uptake correlates with metabolic subtypes (Jeon et al.).

Clinical Translation: Most radiogenomic studies are retrospective; multi-center validation is needed.

HBV Paradox: TP53 mutations worsen prognosis in HBV+ patients, yet HBV+ ICCA has better outcomes overall.

Therapeutic Gaps: IDH inhibitors (e.g., ivosidenib) show promise, but resistance mechanisms remain unclear.

Integrated Approaches: Combining radiomics, spatial transcriptomics, and AI may refine subtype prediction.

ICCA's heterogeneity demands a multifaceted approach. Imaging signatures-when aligned with histological and molecular data-can non-invasively predict subtypes, mutations, and therapeutic vulnerabilities. While challenges persist in standardization and clinical adoption, the synergy of radiomics and molecular profiling heralds a new era of precision oncology for ICCA. Future research must prioritize prospective trials to validate these tools and translate them into actionable clinical strategies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Cardiovascular deaths surge among less educated Americans","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250614/Cardiovascular-deaths-surge-among-less-educated-Americans.aspx","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 09:13:00 GMT","

About 525,000 more deaths occurred among US adults in 2023 than would be expected had pre-2010 mortality trends continued. More than 90 percent of these deaths occurred among individuals without a Bachelor's degree and were largely caused by cardiovascular diseases, underscoring how educational attainment can influence individuals' health opportunities and outcomes.

Cardiometabolic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes have emerged as some of the key drivers of worsening mortality rates in the United States over the last 15 years. People with limited education are feeling the brunt of this crisis, according to a new study by Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH), the University of Helsinki, and the University of Minnesota.

For both men and women without a Bachelor's degree (BA), mortality between 2011-2023 was markedly higher than would have been expected had death rates from 2006-2010 continued. Among 564,855 excess deaths in 2023 alone, 481,211 occurred among people without a BA-a 26 percent increase in mortality among this population, compared to pre-2010 trends. In contrast, mortality only increased by eight percent among people who received a BA. The study was published in JAMA Health Forum.

While much attention has focused on how the COVID-19 pandemic led to life expectancy declines and excess mortality, our study shows that the United States was already experiencing an increasing number of excess deaths before the pandemic. The pandemic further exacerbated these trends, with excess deaths peaking in 2021. However, even after COVID-19 mortality declined in 2023, excess deaths remained substantially higher than in the pre-pandemic period, highlighting the importance of looking at long-term mortality trends to uncover the mechanisms behind current developments.""

Dr. Eugenio Paglino, study lead author, postdoctoral researcher at the Helsinki Institute for Demography and Population Health at the University of Helsinki

The findings underscore the urgent need to address cardiometabolic health and chronic diseases nationwide, particularly the social and structural factors that might explain why people with less education disproportionately experience these adverse health outcomes. 

""The United States is facing a crisis of deteriorating mortality that is largely falling on the shoulders of those with less education,"" says study senior and corresponding author Dr. Andrew Stokes, associate professor of global health at BUSPH. ""Living in rural areas, having a lack of access to healthy foods and good nutrition, working in precarious employment sectors-these are the things that make it difficult to eat well, sleep well, and exercise. Education fundamentally structures people's work opportunities, and having less of it sets people up for a lot of downstream consequences that make it difficult to maintain good health.""

For the study, Dr. Stokes and colleagues from the University of Helsinki and the University of Minnesota utilized national mortality and education data to examine 47, 545, 611 deaths among US adults ages 35 and older from 2006-2023, categorizing 2011-2023 as the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods.

While less pronounced, circulatory diseases were also the leading cause of excess deaths among adults with a BA or equivalent degree.

""Despite decades of progress in prevention and treatment, cardiovascular diseases (including heart disease and stroke) remain the leading causes of death and major disability in the US and worldwide,"" says Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, director of Boston University's Framingham Center for Population and Prevention Science and primary investigator of the Framingham Heart Study, the longest-running heart disease study in the US. Dr. Lloyd-Jones, who is also the Alexander Graham Bell Professor and section chief of preventive medicine and epidemiology at BU Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine, was not involved in the study. ""We know that the social drivers of health, including socioeconomic position, neighborhood environment, and, especially education, have a major impact on the predisposing risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as adverse diet, obesity, diabetes, blood pressure, and blood lipids. These findings reinforce and quantify the role that education can play in equipping people to manage their health and extend their longevity.""

Diabetes was also a top 2023 contributor to excess deaths among men and women without a BA, and to a lesser extent, those with a BA. The researchers cite a range of factors that have led to an increase in unhealthy food consumption, from effective marketing and advertising of ultra-processed foods to a lack of access to affordable, nutrient-dense foods.

Of note, the findings also showed that drug overdoses were a significant contributor to excess deaths among men with less education, but were much less pronounced among men with more education. 

""This observation reflects the downstream consequences of prescription drug use, which led to widespread drug reliance and overdose in the early 2000s, before translating into the use of heroin, fentanyl, and other products that were more readily available during that period,"" Dr. Stokes says. ""The fact that drug poisonings were still a major cause of excess deaths for men without a BA in 2023 points to the ongoing role of deaths of despair in US mortality.""

""This work is a clarion call for us to understand the health threats facing Americans with less education,"" says Dr. Maria Glymour, chair and professor of epidemiology at BUSPH, who was not involved in the study but has studied how education is a predictor of health. ""The mortality differences reported here suggest that we need to consider the 'causes of the causes' of social inequalities. History demonstrates it is possible to either shrink or magnify these disparities via public health and policy actions.""

The researchers did observe a few promising trends in mortality. Among women with a BA, deaths due to cancer and other external causes (such as accidents and violence) decreased in 2023, compared to totals between 2006-2010.

""If we had simply maintained the progress we were making for each of these education groups 20 years ago, there are half a million Americans who died in 2023 who wouldn't have died,"" says study coauthor Dr. Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, associate professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. ""Almost 92 percent of them didn't have a college degree. The fact that the causes of these deaths span such different causes, including cardiovascular diseases, drug overdoses, and diabetes, tells us that there is a really deep divide in who benefits from health progress.""

One of the most important ways in which education matters is the kind of work it gives people access to, she adds. ""We hope these results will contribute to a conversation about the ways that American workplaces aren't always conducive to good health, and what would allow American workers to live longer lives.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study reveals sharp increase in global incidents of healthcare-related harm","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250614/Study-reveals-sharp-increase-in-global-incidents-of-healthcare-related-harm.aspx","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 07:20:00 GMT","

The proportion of patient harms associated with medical procedures, treatment, and contact with healthcare systems rose by 59%, from 11 million to 18 million globally between 1990 and 2019, finds a data analysis published online in the journal BMJ Quality & Safety.

They outpaced the increase in the world's population of 45% over the same period. And older people bore the brunt of these incidents, with the steepest rise among 65-69 year olds, the findings show.

In developed nations, over 50% of inpatient harms are deemed preventable, rising to 83% in developing nations, note the researchers. These harms undermine health and the quality of life, are costly, and erode public trust, while squandering valuable resources, they add.

But current estimates of the 'adverse effects of medical treatment' rely heavily on medical record reviews and voluntary reporting systems. And the lack of a systematic, consistent global approach, makes it difficult to accurately quantify the numbers and inform health policy priorities, say the researchers. 

In a bid to address this, they drew on data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for 204 countries for the period 1990-2019. The GBD includes information from a range of sources, including surveillance systems, government records, health facility reports, and surveys.

The researchers looked at the overall and age standardised number of new incidents globally and nationally. They then looked at time trends, stratified by age and sex and the Sociodemographic Index (SDI), a composite of income, education, and fertility rate of individual countries that represents their social and economic development.

Between 1990 and 2019, the global population increased by 45%. But over the same period, reported cases of patient harm arising from medical treatment rose faster—by 59% from around 11 million to 18 million. 

The overall incidence rate was 232.5 per 100,000 of the global population in 2019, representing a 10% increase since 1990. And the age standardised incidence rate was just over 233/100,000, representing an increase of 4.5%. 

Regionally, the overall incidence rate for all age groups in the high SDI region increased from 515/100,000 in 1990 to almost 823/100,000 in 2019, representing an increase of 60%. And the age standardised incidence rate rose from 502 to 648/100,000, an increase of 29%. 

France was the only country in the high SDI region to buck this trend for all age groups, with the steepest decline in cases among 50 to 70 year olds, possibly because of a string of patient safety policies and measures implemented nationwide, suggest the researchers.

The sharpest fall in overall incidence rate was observed in low SDI regions, falling by 14% from 155 to 141/100,000; the age-standardised incidence rate in these regions fell by around 10% from 147 to 139/100,000. 

Globally, the incidence remained largely unchanged across age bands up to the 45-49 year old age bracket. But incidence rates increased among 50-94 year olds, with the steepest increase among 65-69 year olds, at around 2% a year. 

 Cases among those aged under 1, 1-4, 5-9, and 10-24 fell. But in 2019, cases among those aged 0-4 still accounted for over 17.5% of all cases. 

Between 1990 and 2019, all five SDI regions closely matched the global trends, with decreasing proportions of cases among the under 24s and increases among the over 50s. 

There are several possible reasons for the disparate trends between high and low SDI regions, suggest the researchers. These include the extent of healthcare provision, which is higher in wealthier and more developed countries. For example, the incidence of patient harm in the USA was about 50 times higher at all ages than it was in Indonesia. 

Higher incidence in the high SDI region may also reflect better monitoring systems and greater and more equitable population access to healthcare, not just poor quality or overtreatment, they suggest. And people are more likely to live longer in wealthier countries.

As to the higher rates of patient harms among older people, the researchers suggest that drugs are likely to explain most of these as a result of age-related physiological factors affecting drug metabolism and clearance, polypharmacy, co-existing health conditions, and declines in cognitive and functional capacity reducing medication adherence.

""This confluence of factors renders appropriate medication management exponentially more challenging in advanced-age populations with complex comorbidities,"" they write. 

The researchers acknowledge various limitations to their findings, including that many lower SDI countries lacked reliable original data, for which predictive estimates had to be substituted. And the GBD study only evaluated the overall numbers of patient harms without any analysis of the types or severity of incident.

But the researchers conclude: ""As population age and medical services expand with socio-economic development, addressing [adverse effects of medical treatment] incidents becomes a universal imperative to safeguard patient wellbeing and ensure equitable access to quality healthcare.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Arts-based body-maps reveal the complex lives of nail salon workers","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250614/Arts-based-body-maps-reveal-the-complex-lives-of-nail-salon-workers.aspx","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 05:41:00 GMT","

There is a growing body of evidence on the occupational health experiences of nail technicians, which can include musculoskeletal aches and pains (linked to poor ergonomic design), adverse respiratory, dermal, and ocular health impacts (linked to chemical exposures), worries about cancer and reproductive health (linked to long-term chemical exposures), and various digestive and neurological symptoms (linked to workplace stressors). While these studies contribute to work towards safe worksites, they may inadvertently reduce nail salons to sites of hazards and harms, as well as obscure the complexities of nail technicians' relationships to their work.

In partnership with the Toronto-based Parkdale Queen West Community Health Centre's Nail Salon Workers Project, Dr. Reena Shadaan facilitated an arts-based approach to understand nail technicians' relationships to their work - beyond occupational hazards.

""In the context of occupational health, looking at hazards is important. That's how we understand what's wrong and what needs to be addressed,"" shares Shadaan. ""However, a focus on the hazards alone erases the complexities of nail salon-based work and nail technicians. This can mean that a partial picture is interpreted as the whole picture, but hazards alone don't exclusively define this work or these workers.""

From February 2024 to May 2024, 19 Toronto-based nail technicians visualized their experiences of work and health on life-sized body-maps. Using various visual and textual elements, the body-maps highlight multiple layers of emotion—in the nail technicians' framing of their work experiences, in their labor as beauty service workers, and in their body-map creation processes. Moreover, their narratives illustrate how their work conditions are consequential to other aspects of their life, such as their social health.

The arts-based body-maps allow for a more comprehensive understanding of nail technicians experiences as workers. They illustrate the occupational hazards and resultant bodily harms, but also the joys, such as in creative work and in interacting with long-time clients, as well as nail technicians' hopes and dreams for the future.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Rapid generation of functional blood vessels from human stem cells","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250614/Rapid-generation-of-functional-blood-vessels-from-human-stem-cells.aspx","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 09:21:00 GMT","

Blood vessels are essential to nearly all tissues, delivering nutrients and oxygen, regulating hemostasis, and modulating inflammation. Recreating functional vascular networks is foundational to both basic and translational vascular biology, however current methods to make blood vessels from stem cells are often slow, inefficient, or lack the complexity needed for therapy.

In this study, researchers developed a fast and defined method to build vascular organoids-3D microvascular networks-from human stem cells. By precisely activating two transcription factors (ETV2 and NKX3.1), they were able to drive the formation of both endothelial and mural cells simultaneously. This resulted in self-assembling, functional vessels that can connect to host vasculature when implanted.

This approach not only accelerates the process of building blood vessels but-critically-achieves full, independent control over the two major vascular cell types needed to build functional blood vessels. This level of control has not been previously demonstrated in other models. As a result, this system offers a powerful new platform for vascular network modeling, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine.

For decades, scientists have used near-infrared light to study the brain in a noninvasive way. This optical technique, known as ""fNIRS"" (short for ""functional near-infrared spectroscopy""), measures how light is absorbed by blood in the brain, to infer activity. Valued for portability and low cost, fNIRS has a major drawback: it can't see very deep into the brain. Light typically only reaches the outermost layers of the brain, about 4 centimeters deep-enough to study the surface of the brain, but not deeper regions involved in critical functions like memory, emotion, and movement. This drawback has restricted the ability to study deeper brain regions without expensive and bulky equipment like MRI machines.

Now, researchers at the University of Glasgow have demonstrated something previously thought impossible: detecting light that has traveled all the way through an adult human head. Their study, published in Neurophotonics, shows that with the right setup, it is possible to measure photons that pass from one side of the head to the other, even across its widest point.

To achieve this, the team used powerful lasers and highly sensitive detectors in a carefully controlled experiment. They directed a pulsed laser beam at one side of a volunteer's head and placed a detector on the opposite side. The setup was designed to block out all other light and maximize the chances of catching the few photons that made the full journey through the skull and brain.

The researchers also ran detailed computer simulations to predict how light would move through the complex layers of the head. These simulations matched the experimental results closely, confirming that the detected photons had indeed traveled through the entire head. Interestingly, the simulations revealed that light tends to follow specific paths, guided by regions of the brain with lower scattering, such as the cerebrospinal fluid.

This breakthrough suggests that it may be possible to design new optical devices that can reach deeper brain areas than current technologies allow. While the current method is not yet practical for everyday use-it required 30 minutes of data collection and worked only on a subject with fair skin and no hair-this extreme case of detecting light diametrically across the head may inspire the community to rethink what is possible for the next generation of fNIRS systems.

With further development, this approach might help bring deep brain imaging into clinics and homes in a more affordable and portable form. This could eventually lead to better tools for diagnosing and monitoring conditions like strokes, brain injuries, or tumors, especially in settings where access to MRI or CT scans is limited.

A recent study published in Engineering has shed new light on how the combinations of foods we eat over the long term, rather than just individual food items, can significantly influence cardiometabolic health. The research, led by a team of scientists from various institutions, including the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University and the Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, analyzed data from two large cohorts: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the United States and the Guangdong Gut Microbiome Project (GGMP) in China. The findings suggest that the balance and imbalance of food intake, captured through long-term food pairing patterns, are independently associated with cardiometabolic traits and can modulate gut microbial functionalities.

The study introduced the concept of long-term food pairing patterns, which include additive food pairing patterns (AFPs) and subtractive food pairing patterns (SFPs). AFPs assume synergistic effects between two foods, while SFPs assume antagonistic effects. The researchers used normalized monthly consumption frequencies of individual foods to calculate these patterns. They identified 1759 and 306 cardiometabolic-related long-term food pairing patterns from the NHANES and GGMP cohorts, respectively, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. Notably, by comparing the cardiometabolic association results with single foods and long-term food pairing patterns, around 80.8%/82.5% of these pairing foods were not individually associated with cardiometabolic traits, indicating that the combined effects of food pairings play a crucial role in health outcomes.

The study found that long-term food pairing patterns were weakly correlated with single food intake frequencies and various dietary indices, such as the Healthy Eating Index 2020 (HEI2020) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index. This suggests that food pairing patterns provide unique insights beyond conventional dietary indicators. The researchers also observed that the associations between food pairing patterns and cardiometabolic traits were consistent across Eastern and Western populations at the hyper food classification group level, despite significant differences in individual food intake patterns.

The study further explored the mediating role of the gut microbiome in the relationship between long-term food pairing patterns and cardiometabolic traits. Mediation analysis revealed that 72.7% of long-term food pairing patterns affected cardiometabolic traits through 31 microbial genera, with Clostridium sensu stricto 1 playing a predominant role. The researchers found that microbes primarily mediated the impact of long-term food pairing patterns on cardiometabolic traits through their metabolic pathways, such as pyruvate fermentation to propanoate and ergothioneine biosynthesis pathways.

The findings highlight the importance of considering the balance and imbalance of food intake in dietary strategies aimed at improving cardiometabolic health. The study suggests that personalized dietary recommendations could benefit from incorporating long-term food pairing patterns, which may offer a more comprehensive understanding of how diet influences health compared to focusing solely on individual foods or dietary indices.

The study acknowledges several limitations, including the observational nature of the research and the potential for recall bias in food frequency questionnaires. Future research could explore the causal relationships between food pairing patterns, gut microbiome, and cardiometabolic health through longitudinal studies or controlled trials. Nonetheless, the study provides valuable insights into the potential role of long-term food pairing patterns in human health and opens new avenues for developing precision nutritional strategies.

Women with breast cancer who were also carriers of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and received textured breast implants as part of their reconstructive surgery after mastectomy were 16 times more likely to develop breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a rare T-cell lymphoma, compared with similar women without these genetic mutations, according to a study published today in Blood Advances.

Our findings show that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are a significant risk factor for developing this type of lymphoma, confirming earlier suggestions of a possible role. It's possible that implant-associated lymphoma is yet another cancer that can arise because of these genetic mutations.""

Paola Ghione, MD, lead researcher, lymphoma specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)

She adds that the analysis underscores the need for women to include their personal history of mastectomy and implants long after surviving breast cancer itself.

This is the first large study to look at whether the BIA-ALCL occurrence is higher among women who have a BRCA mutation, which is also responsible for the onset of breast cancer in 5-10% of cases. Carrying a harmful mutation in the BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 gene increases the risk of several cancers, including those of the breast, ovaries, pancreas, and skin.

Earlier studies had shown an association between textured implants and the development of BIA-ALCL, leading to their recall from the European and U.S. markets in 2019. BIA-ALCL is a type of T-cell lymphoma that arises near textured breast implants, either as a collection of fluid or mass. It usually develops seven to 10 years after women undergo mastectomy and reconstructive surgery with implants.

In 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported a total of 1,264 cases and 63 deaths related to BIA-ALCL. While textured breast implants were used in about 12% of reconstructive surgeries in the U.S., they were the go-to in Europe, used in up to 95% of surgeries. Breast implants are generally changed every 10 to 15 years, so there are many women who still have these implants in their bodies, Dr. Ghione explained.

""If we look at the absolute numbers [seen in this study], it's still fairly rare, but the important thing to note is that when we look at women with this genetic predisposition, there is a big jump in the percentage with this lymphoma,"" she said. Other factors, including the type of implant filling (saline or silicone), age at breast cancer surgery, and prior cancer treatments (radiation or chemotherapy), were not found to be associated with developing BIA-ALCL.

In this study, Dr. Ghione and her colleagues pulled from MSKCC's unique cohort of over 3,000 women who had breast implants as part of their breast cancer treatment and are followed over time to assess for complications. Within this group, 520 women were tested for the BRCA genes. They compared the prevalence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, confirmed through testing, between women who did and did not develop BIA-ALCL after reconstruction with textured implants only; smooth surface devices are not thought to carry the risk of lymphoma, Dr. Ghione explained.

Women were followed for a median of 11.5 years. Of the 520 women with breast cancer tested for BRCA, 8.3%, or 43 patients were carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. The age-adjusted rate of developing BIA-ALCL for women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations was 16 times the rate of BIA-ALCL among women without the genetic mutation. The researchers also conducted a case-control study with 13 BIA-ALCL cases matched one to three with 39 controls, which showed that the frequency of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations in BIA-ALCL cases was significantly higher than that of the controls.

""The implants that are put in place now are theoretically safe; however, there are still a lot of women who are living with textured breast implants, so it's important that women know what implants they have and talk with their doctor and remember to report this surgery as part of their medical history,"" Dr. Ghione said, further advising women to ask about genetic testing, including for BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutations, especially if they were diagnosed or have family members diagnosed with breast cancer at younger ages.

Given the low risk of BIA-ALCL, the FDA does not recommend having implants removed unless women are having symptoms. Symptoms can include pain, lumps, swelling, or unexpected changes in breast shape. However, the researchers said the study's findings should prompt women who have had reconstructive breast surgery because of breast cancer to have open discussions with their health care team about the type of breast implants they have and what steps they can take to minimize any risk. This is especially true if their plastic surgeon is suggesting it's time to replace the implants. 

This study did not include women with the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations who underwent prophylactic surgery to prevent breast cancer.

Dr. Ghione and team will continue to follow these women, as well as others in the cohort that have had textured implants removed. This study is limited in that it is from a single institution, though it included a diverse population and a very long follow up.

This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Small antibodies provide broad protection against SARS coronaviruses","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250614/Small-antibodies-provide-broad-protection-against-SARS-coronaviruses.aspx","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 08:52:00 GMT","

Scientists have discovered a unique class of small antibodies that are strongly protective against a wide range of SARS coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and numerous early and recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. The unique antibodies target an essential highly conserved site at the base of the virus's spike protein, effectively clamping it shut and preventing the virus from infecting cells. The findings, published in Nature Communications, offer a promising route to developing broad-spectrum antiviral treatments that could remain effective against future viral variants.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, continues to be a potential threat as it evolves into newer variants that are resistant to currently approved antibody therapies. Resistance largely emerges because antibodies typically target virus regions, such as the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, that also frequently mutate, enabling escape from antibody recognition. 

To address this, a research team led by Prof. Xavier Saelens and Dr. Bert Schepens at the VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology explored a different strategy by focusing on one of the more stable subunits of the spike protein. The so-called S2 subunit is critical for the virus's ability to fuse with host cells, a process essential for infection, and it is more conserved across different coronaviruses.

The team turned to llamas (more specifically a llama called Winter). Llamas generate so-called single-domain antibodies, also known as VHHs or nanobodies, that are much smaller than the antibodies generated by most animals, including humans. The researchers identified several llama antibodies that strongly neutralize a broad panel of SARS coronaviruses.

What makes these antibodies particularly promising is their unique mode of action: they act like a molecular clamp. They latch onto the poorly exposed, highly conserved region (a coiled coil of 3 alpha helices) at the base of the virus's spike protein. In doing so, they lock the spike protein in its original shape, physically preventing it from unfolding into the form the virus needs to infect cells. 

The antibodies showed strong protection against infection in lab animals, even at low doses. And when researchers attempted to force the virus to evolve resistance, the virus struggled, producing only rare escape variants that were much less infectious. This points to a powerful, hard-to-evade treatment option. 

This region is so crucial to the virus that it can't easily mutate without weakening the virus itself. That gives us a rare advantage: a target that's both essential and stable across variants.""

Prof. Xavier Saelens, senior author of the study

This discovery marks a significant advancement in the quest for durable and broadly effective antiviral therapies, offering hope for treatments that can keep pace with viral evolution.

""The combination of high potency, broad activity against numerous viral variants, and a high barrier to resistance is incredibly promising,"" adds Saelens. ""This work provides a strong foundation for developing next-generation antibodies that could be vital in combating not only current but also future coronavirus threats.""

The Rising T1DE Alliance (Rising T1DE), a national collaborative spearheading innovation in type 1 diabetes care, is transforming how healthcare systems leverage data, technology, and collaboration to drive improved patient outcomes. Launched in 2020 through grant supports from The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, Rising T1DE's work is helping shape a future where proactive, integrated, real-time diabetes management becomes the new standard of care. A recent $5.1 million grant from the Helmsley Charitable Trust to Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago adds Lurie Children's to Rising T1DE's leadership to focus on actively disseminating scalable, sustainable solutions across the broader diabetes care ecosystem.

Initiated in 2016 at Children's Mercy Kansas City, Rising T1DE was born from a bold vision: to use real-time, integrated data to guide clinical decision-making and prevent adverse outcomes. At the heart of Rising T1DE's work is the Diabetes Data Dock (D-Data Dock)- a cloud-based population health management software that integrates data from the electronic health record (EHR), self-management devices, patient reported outcome surveys, and other sources. D-Data Dock helps clinical teams proactively identify and engage high-risk patients, enabling earlier, targeted interventions while reducing friction for research. By aligning data from various sources and improving its consistency and quality, research can more effectively support ongoing efforts and expand its reach.

The Rising T1DE Alliance is about building a proactive, learning-based care model where data integration, clinical insight, and continuous innovation come together to improve outcomes for people with diabetes.""

Mark Clements, MD, PhD, Rising T1DE Co-Chair and Medical Director of Innovation at Children's Mercy

In 2024, Rising T1DE launched its next phase, focused on scaling adoption and refining implementation of the D-Data Dock across new health systems. This effort aims to build the frameworks, technical guidance, and operational playbooks necessary for widespread uptake of data-driven, patient-centered diabetes care. The team works closely with implementation sites like Lurie Children's, University of Cincinnati, and University of Kansas to test and refine rollout models.

""Integrating technology into clinical workflows is only part of the equation. More value comes from building a learning ecosystem where insights are shared, interventions are tested in real-time, and scalable models emerge,"" said Juan Espinoza, MD, a pediatrician, Rising T1DE Co-Chair, and Chief Research Informatics Officer at Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute at Lurie Children's.

The Rising T1DE Alliance's current initiative includes:

Oversight and guidance are provided by the Community Stakeholder Advisory Board, chaired by Sanjeev Mehta, MD, MPH, Chief Medical Officer and Chief Medical Information Officer at Joslin Diabetes Center, with representatives from the Helmsley Charitable Trust, T1D Exchange, National Committee for Quality Assurance, and multiple clinical institutions. Rising T1DE continues to grow into a dynamic partnership of leading healthcare institutions, technology experts, and patient advocates.

With a strong foundation and new support, the Rising T1DE Alliance is set to empower healthcare systems across the country to deliver high-quality, data-driven care that every person with diabetes deserves.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","USMNT aim to “change the narrative” with Gold Cup run","https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/usmnt-aim-to-change-the-narrative-with-concacaf-gold-cup-run","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 13:08:39 GMT","



How rough has the recent sailing been for the downcast, shorthanded US men's national team, currently riding a rare four-game losing skid into their Gold Cup opener on Sunday evening vs. Trinidad & Tobago?

Left back John Tolkin provided a sobering comparison in a Friday afternoon media availability.

“To be honest, the chaos of going through relegation has helped me,” said the New York Red Bulls product, who finished 17th of 18 in the German Bundesliga with Holstein Kiel in his just-completed first season overseas and thus may wind up at a new club this fall.

“It's kind of a chaotic time right now.”

Tuesday's 4-0 thumping at the hands of Switzerland in Nashville was a nightmare of a “send-off match,” a historically poor outing both statistically and via the eye test. According to Opta, it was the first time the Yanks have conceded four goals in the first 40 minutes of a home match, and the first overall since a 5-1 loss at Mexico in a 1980 World Cup qualifier.

“We wanted to give the possibility to the whole roster to have minutes and play for different circumstances, and I think that is the risk that we took,” head coach Mauricio Pochettino said afterward, assigning himself the blame for an inexperienced lineup against a quality opponent.

“It was in the wrong direction from the beginning. We were never in the game.”

❤️🤍💙IG: sebastianberhalter pic.twitter.com/I692Etyhta

Running parallel to the tough results is the discourse around the absence of captain and program talisman Christian Pulisic, who spoke to CBS Sports' “Call It What You Want” podcast on Thursday about his decision to rest his body and mind this month rather than take part in the USMNT's summer slate, citing the physical wear and tear of the past two seasons with Italian powers AC Milan on top of international duty.

Unity, poise and mutual trust are thus key themes in the USMNT camp, which has relocated to Stanford University ahead of Sunday's Group D curtain-raiser at PayPal Park, home of the San Jose Earthquakes (6 pm ET | FOX, TUDN). Then it's on to Austin FC's Q2 Stadium to meet Saudi Arabia on Thursday before a clash with Haiti at hulking AT&T Stadium in North Texas on June 22.

“What happened, happened,” said Charlotte FC veteran Tim Ream. “These things, they happen in this game. It has a funny way of knocking you down when you most need it. And it also has a funny way of building slowly.

“This is new to a lot of people, it's new to a lot of guys. And it's just a matter of, right, let's just put our heads down and back each other up, communication as high as it possibly can be, and we get through it. It's a storm and you can either run from it, you can hide from it, or you put yourself back out there and you say, 'OK, we're going again.'”

""It's something that I really worked hard for.""#USMNT defender Alex Freeman recounts last week's senior team debut at just 20 years old. pic.twitter.com/PYNoxOXUlJ

On paper, this group stage should be more forgiving than the European pedigree of Türkiye and Switzerland, though the Saudis, arriving as a guest side from Asia, are a wild card and both Caribbean sides can trouble the Yanks if they produce something close to their best.

Tolkin admitted the rising volume of criticism is inescapable, yet must be tuned out just the same.

“It sounds maybe like we're lying or something, but you really just have to look to the guy next to you, and just fight for the guys, each training session, each match,” said the 22-year-old. “Because what you see online, all that media, all the opinions, it's impossible this day not to see it.

“Obviously we're very disappointed, and we know it's not good enough and it's not the standard we want to be playing at. But the second you start getting too negative and self-defeating yourself, I think things can go very south.”

The Yanks' string of poor performances now extends across multiple international windows and a variety of different personnel, prompting alarm in some quarters as the countdown to the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil passes the year mark.

At 37, Ream has seen just about everything in his soccer journey and hopes he can help steady his younger colleagues' nerves.

“You don't play and go through a career without having so many ups and downs and negative moments and negative words and people saying this and people saying that, and opinions left, right, center, coming at you from forward, behind,” he said. “The overarching message for us is: This is our group right now. This is who we have to rely on. Each one of us has to have each other's back.”

The players believe they hold the power to shift the tone in a sunnier direction. The standing US goal of just about every Gold Cup campaign in the past decade-plus remains in place: claim the trophy. Doing so at NRG Stadium in Houston on July 6 would mark the USMNT's eighth such triumph, drawing them within striking distance of Mexico's Concacaf-best total of nine.

“You really have to lean to the guy to the left and right of you and trust that they're going to work their ass off for you,"" said Tolkin.

""We have a huge opportunity right now to change the narrative, set the focus towards the World Cup coming up next summer – that's to win this tournament.”","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

The USMNT will face Trinidad and Tobago in their first match of the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup. All eyes are on the United States Men's National Team after they suffered a 4-0 loss to Switzerland in a tune-up match earlier this week.

One year before the 2026 World Cup, CONCACAF teams -- and one guest -- will compete in the biannual Gold Cup that awards the top nation in the region.

Mexico is the reigning champion having beaten Panama in the 2023 final 1-0, with the U.S. men's national team falling to Los Canaleros in the semis.

Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are

El Tri will be the top dog to beat once again due to its experienced squad, and manager Javier Aguirre cannot afford a letdown ahead of the World Cup. 

The same applies to the Stars and Stripes, which is in the midst of a four-game losing streak under Mauricio Pochettino. The last four-game skid for the U.S. came in 2007, and Pochettino will be without several key stars as he seeks to turn things around fast.

So, when is the Gold Cup and how can you watch? Here's everything to know:

The Gold Cup will run from Saturday, June 14, to Sunday, July 6.

The Gold Cup is being held in the U.S.

With the Club World Cup transpiring in the U.S. alongside the Gold Cup, here are the venues to know:

The final on Sunday, July 6, will be at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.

Here's how the 16 teams are split up. Each group will be matched up round-robin style. The top eight will head to the single-game elimination matches until a champion is crowned.

Group A: Mexico, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Suriname

Group B: Canada, Honduras, El Salvador, Curaçao

Group C: Panama, Jamaica, Guatemala, Guadeloupe

Group D: United States, Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti, Saudi Arabia



Here's a breakdown of the USMNT's group games:

Saudi Arabia received a special invitation to play in the 2025 Gold Cup, with Qatar receiving an invite for the 2023 tournament.

Mexico is seen as the favorite due to their experience across all positions, with Raul Jimenez, Santi Gimenez, Alexis Vega, Edson Alvarez, Luis Chavez and Israel Reyes among the call-ups.

The main competitors will likely be the U.S. and Canada, despite both nations not having the best talent upgrades. The U.S., specifically, will be without players like Christian Pulisic, Folarin Balogun, Sergino Dest, Weston McKennie and more, while Canada's Alphonso Davis is out with a torn ACL suffered a few months back. Star striker Jonathan David is available for Jesse Marsch's side despite being a club free agent.

Saudi Arabia could produce some solid results, while Jamaica and Panama will be the underdogs to watch.

Gold Cup games in the U.S. will available to watch on FOX platforms. FOX will air all U.S. games and the final, while FS1 and FS2 will also broadcast fixtures.

Gold Cup games will be available to stream in the U.S. on FOXSports.com and the FOX Sports mobile app. TUDN has the rights in Spanish, while Canadian viewers can access games through OneSoccer.","{'href': 'https://www.nbcdfw.com', 'title': 'NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth'}","soccer"

Hoping to put the damaging friendly defeats over the past week behind them, the U.S. men's national team begin their 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup quest with a group stage game against Trinidad & Tobago on Sunday in San Jose.

The USMNT has lost four straight matches under Mauricio Pochettino. The vibes around the national team are borderline toxic, as fans become increasingly worried about their prospects at next summer's World Cup on home soil after being outmatched by Switzerland in an embarrassing 4-0 drubbing last week.

Pochettino will hope that a return to form against inferior CONCACAF opposition will help the team get back on its feet, but with many first-team regulars absent from the squad this summer, it will be a tougher task than usual, even against nations with far lower rankings.

Trinidad & Tobago, 100th in the world according to FIFA, are hoping to bolster their World Cup qualification journey with a strong Gold Cup performance. They have only qualified for one World Cup in the nation's history, back in 2006, but will never have a better chance than this cycle with the expanded field and three CONCACAF teams qualifying automatically as hosts.

The Soca Warriors have only reached the Gold Cup semifinals once in history, 25 years ago, and have only reached the quarterfinals once in the years since that result.

MORE: Christian Pulisic speaks following criticism of his USMNT absence this summer

Ahead of their final competitive matches before next summer's World Cup on home soil, the United States are without a significant number of first-team regulars for myriad reasons.

The likes of Christian Pulisic and Yunus Musah were left off the roster at the players' behest, having asked to rest for the summer. Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, and Gio Reyna are all participating in the Club World Cup and have stayed with their clubs, while Josh Sargent, Joe Scally, and Tanner Tessmann were all passed over for ""football reasons"" as Pochettino described it.

Meanwhile, Antonee Robinson had knee surgery to solve a chronic issue that has plagued him for months, Folarin Balogun sustained an ankle injury, Ricardo Pepi continues to rehab from a long-term knee injury, Sergino Dest withdrew from the squad to protect his recent recovery from a torn ACL. Zack Steffen suffered a knee injury in pre-tournament camp.

Tyler Adams told The Sporting News he's dealing with turf toe. After missing the Switzerland friendly, it's unclear if he'll be back for competitive matches or if a longer absence is on the horizon.

After making nine changes to his lineup from the first pre-Gold Cup friendly to the second, it's likely Pochettino will go back to something close to his XI from the Turkey game.

USA predicted lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Freese (GK) — Freeman, Richards, M. Robinson, Tolkin — Cardoso, de la Torre — McGlynn, Tillman, Luna— Agyemang.

Goalkeepers: Chris Brady, Matt Freese, Matt Turner.

Defenders: Max Arfsten, Alex Freeman, Nathan Harriel, Mark McKenzie, Tim Ream, Chris Richards, Miles Robinson, John Tolkin, Walker Zimmerman.

Midfielders: Brenden Aaronson, Paxten Aaronson, Tyler Adams, Sebastian Berhalter, Johnny Cardoso, Luca de la Torre, Diego Luna, Jack McGlynn, Quinn Sullivan, Malik Tillman.

Forwards: Patrick Agyemang, Damion Downs, Brian White, Haji Wright.

MORE: A full breakdown of the USMNT roster for the 2025 Gold Cup

Head coach Dwight Yorke has his full squad fit and ready to compete, but he was forced to make a few cuts heading into the Gold Cup.

Veterans left off the roster include ageing goalkeeper Adrian Foncette and 34-year-old defender Aubrey David, who were both not included in this summer's squad. Forward Reon Moore who has 32 international appearances and 10 goals was part of the Unity Cup squad earlier in the month but was left off as he continues to look for a new club. Another double-digit goal scorer not involved is Ryan Telfer, who plays for Canadian club Halifax Wanderers.

Attacking duo Levi Garcia and Dante Sealy combined for three goals and two assists in their 6-2 win over St. Kitts & Nevis in World Cup qualifying last weekend, and both should see the field against the United States.

Trinidad & Tobago predicted lineup (4-4-2 diamond, right to left): Phillip (GK) — Cardines, I. Garcia, A. Jones, Bateau, Sealy — Molino, D. Phillips, Fortune, Spicer — L. Garcia.

Goalkeepers: Marvin Phillip, Jabari St. Hillaire, Denzil Smith.

Defenders: Sheldon Bateau, Rio Cardines, Darnell Hospedales, Alvin Jones, Joevin Jones, Noah Powder, Andre Raymond, Josiah Trimmingham.

Midfielders: Ajani Fortune, Wayne Frederick, Real Gill, Nathaniel James, Daniel Phillips, Andre Rampersad, Steffen Yeates.

Forwards: Levi Garcia, Isaiah Leacock, Isaiah Lee, Kevin Molino, Dante Sealy, Tyrese Spicer, Kaihim Thomas.

The United States looked outmatched and outgunned against Switzerland, but the lineup deployed against Turkey competed hard and deserved to get a result from that game.

If Mauricio Pochettino goes back to the players who put in shifts through that first friendly, the USMNT should manage to handle Trinidad & Tobago, even if the Soca Warriors make it difficult by bunkering into a low block and hoping to hit with long-ball counters.

While the USMNT has been surprised by Trinidad & Tobago in the past, including the infamous World Cup qualifying disaster in Couva in 2018, this team lacks the international experience of that veteran squad, and should provide the U.S. with a pathway to a winning Gold Cup start.

Prediction: USA 1-0 Trinidad & Tobago

The entirety of the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup will be broadcast by FOX, with this USMNT opener televised on the network's flagship channel.

Many other matches will be televised on FS1 or FS2.

All games on Fox family of channels will be available to stream on Fubo, who are offering a free trial for new users.

GOAL takes a look at the tiers of teams in the 2025 Gold Cup, asking who's here to win it, and who's just filling out the numbers?

The 2025 Gold Cup is upon us. CONCACAF's best, and one bonus team, have gathered in the U.S. to compete for regional supremacy. And while the competition is admittedly lacking some star-power this year, regional supremacy is generally one heck of a motivator.

Just one year out from a World Cup, North America's best have a chance to claim their place on center stage by winning a trophy and building a bit of momentum towards next summer's tournament.

The U.S. men's national team and Mexico have won all but one of the 17 editions of this competition and both will be in the mix again this summer. Mexico will be looking to repeat, having won in 2023, while the shorthanded U.S. will look to reverse recent fortunes and turn a few heads.

The only other team to win? Canada back in 2000 and, on the 25th anniversary of their biggest trophy win, the Canadians might just be the best team in the field as they look to take over as kings of CONCACAF.

The road through won't be easy, even for those three. This tournament always has plenty of upsets and, now more than ever, it seems as if most teams in the tournament have the potential to cause one or two.

So who's here to win this summer? Who's in the spotlight? Who's going to bring the danger to the big contenders? GOAL US breaks it all down in the 2025 Gold Cup Tier Rankings.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

MIAMI — Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava has issued a statement saying the presence of a federal immigration agent at a South Florida barge party celebrating the advent of an international soccer tournament was “deeply troubling.”

The incident further ratcheted up anxiety ahead of this evening's opening game of the FIFA Club World Cup, which takes place amid ""No Kings Day"" protests and a U.S. military parade in Washington, D.C..

The long-awaited international soccer tournament already was to kick off this evening in Miami under a cloud of immigration enforcement. Earlier this week, U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement issued an ominous social media post, which was subsequently deleted, declaring that ""CBP will be suited and booted ready to provide security for the first round of games.""

The Miami Herald reported on the June 11 incident involving the Club World Cup party on a floating barge.

The barge was boarded by U.S. Coast Guard officials under what the agency said was a routine check, according to the report, but the inspection crew included a CBP official. The Herald reported attendees were asked for identification that purportedly would show their status.

“This should not have happened,” Levine Cava said in a statement quoted by the Herald. “Ensuring that all community members feel safe and included is crucial to maintaining our county's reputation as a welcoming destination for both residents and visitors.”

The opening game of the FIFA Club World Cup is scheduled at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, pitting local favorite Inter Miami FC and global star Lionel Messi against Egypt's Al Ahly squad. The tournament showcases the world's best soccer teams and is a prelude to next year's World Cup, which will match 48 teams in games to be played in 16 North American cities, including Miami.

One of the teams participating in the tournament, Real Madrid of Spain, is training in Palm Beach Gardens. Another, England's Manchester City, is training in Boca Raton.

Your matchday briefing on Chelsea, featuring team news and expert analysis from Malik Ouzia

Chelsea kick-start their Club World Cup campaign against LAFC on Monday.

Enzo Maresca has already made some tough decisions for his squad ahead the tournament, leaving out all players who spent time out of loan during the season, apart from Andrey Santos, despite opting against taking the maximum 35 players allowed.

There will also be a chance for debuts for new signings Liam Delap, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and young goalkeeper Mike Penders, but Sanchez should go fairly strong for this opening game.

Robert Sanchez remains the first-choice goalkeeper despite a concerted effort to sign Mike Maignan in the days and hours before the transfer deadline, and should get the nod behind a strong back line. Marc Cucurella as the only recognised senior left-back in the squad with Ben Chilwell absent, though Levi Colwill should deputise there.

Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez will surely start the opener, with the first-choice front four of Pedro Neto, Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke and Nicolas Jackson looking to get the Blues off to a strong start.

Captain Reece James is likely to be saved, while Aaron Anselmino is the sole injury doubt in the travelling squad.

Chelsea will be wary not to underestimate a LAFC team boasting the likes of familiar face Oliver Giroud, and then face Flamengo on Friday before an easier-looking test against ES Tunis on June 25.

Two cup winners collide in Group D of the 2025 Club World Cup on Monday, as Chelsea and Los Angeles FC open their campaigns at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.



The maiden battle pits the Conference League champions against the US Open Cup holders, who had to take a unique scenic route to enter the home tournament.









Back on the global stage after conquering the continent in both the primary and tertiary sense over the past four years, Chelsea punched their ticket to the current edition of the Club World Cup as soon as the final whistle blew in the 2020-21 Champions League final.



Since hoisting the biggest European honour of them all aloft, the Blues have also created a new page of UEFA history, becoming the first team to win all four major continental tournaments in the Champions League, Europa League, Conference League and Super Cup.



A 4-1 thumping of Real Betis in the Conference League final marked a wonderful end to an ultimately successful first campaign in charge for head coach Enzo Maresca, who may have surpassed the early-season expectations placed on him when he guided the West London giants back into the Champions League.



Ending the 2024-25 campaign with eight wins from their final nine games in all tournaments was near-perfect preparation for a third Club World Cup tournament, and the capital giants boast a 50% success rate from their previous two appearances in the competition.



As Champions League holders, Chelsea conquered the 2021-22 edition by beating Palmeiras in extra time in the final, but their inaugural appearance in 2013 saw the Blues finish as runners-up to another Brazilian giant in Corinthians.







The West London powerhouses must coincidentally make it past another Brasileiro outfit in Flamengo just to make it out of Group D, while Tunisian outfit Esperance de Tunis will seek to spring a surprise against both Chelsea and their upcoming foes.



LAFC were originally set to be watching the Club World Cup from home, only for Mexican outfit Leon - the winners of the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League - to be expelled from the tournament due to violations of FIFA's multi-club ownership rules.



As a result, LAFC and Club America contested a winner-takes-all play-in match for the final spot among the 32, and MLS outfit's 2-1 extra-time triumph saw them punch their ticket to a maiden appearance in the Club World Cup.



The reigning US Open Cup champions have been building up a head of steam for several weeks now, as a 3-1 MLS win over Sporting Kansas City on June 9 extended their unbeaten run to 10 games in all competitions, and they have scored at least twice in every single one of those contests.



However, Steven Cherundolo's men still have a nine-point gap to make up to Vancouver Whitecaps at the top of the Western Conference standings, but domestic exploits now take a back seat ahead of an intriguing - and daunting - Club World Cup debut.



Chelsea form (all competitions): WWLWWW



Los Angeles FC form (all competitions): DWDDWW









There was space in Chelsea's 28-man travelling squad for new signings Liam Delap, Dario Essugo and Mamadou Sarr, all of whom should feel optimistic of earning Blues baptisms as Maresca rotates his resources for the duration of the summer.



The big-hitters are all present too - Cole Palmer, Nicolas Jackson, Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo should all have significant parts to play - but hamstring victim Wesley Fofana is still on the treatment table.



In addition, Ukrainian winger Mykhaylo Mudryk is still serving his provisional doping suspension, while goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic was omitted from the party as he seeks pastures new in the transfer window.



From Chelsea strikers present to Chelsea strikers past, the LAFC squad is headlined by ex-Blues frontman Olivier Giroud, who is still going strong at 38 and netted his side's third and final goal against SKC last time out.



On-loan Celtic midfielder Odin Holm is also among the Black and Gold players, but the Norwegian lynchpin has been struggling with a leg injury of late and is not expected to feature on matchday one.



Chelsea possible starting lineup:



Penders; James, Adarabioyo, Badiashile, Cucurella; Lavia, Essugo; Madueke, Palmer, Neto; Delap



Los Angeles FC possible starting lineup:



Lloris; Palencia, Segura, Marlon, Hollingshead; Tillman, Jesus, Delgado; Yeboah, Giroud, Bouanga









A question sure to be on lots of fans' lips; how much do the Premier League teams actually want the Club World Cup? Maresca's team selection will certainly give us some pointers in that regard.



Nevertheless, with new signings seeking to make their mark, the Blues have our vote to get off to a flyer, even if they will be denied a clean sheet by a goal-happy LAFC side.

Alejandro Moreno speaks on LAFC's journey to the Club World Cup and the challenges they will face in the tournament. (0:51)

Major League Soccer doesn't have a particularly strong record in international competitions. In the league's 30 years of existence, MLS sides have won three continental titles: D.C. United (Concacaf Champions Cup and the short-lived Copa Interamericana) in 1998, the LA Galaxy (Concacaf Champions Cup) in 2000 and the Seattle Sounders  (Concacaf Champions League) in 2022.

Is the tide turning? Six of the past eight Concacaf Champions Cup finals have featured an MLS club, though only the 2022 Sounders managed to best opposition from Liga MX in the competition's showpiece event. In this year's finale held earlier this month, the MLS-leading Vancouver Whitecaps were thoroughly dismantled by this past season's third-best team in Mexico, Cruz Azul, by a 5-0 scoreline.

It was a disaster of a result for a league that aspires to be known as the best in North America, and yet, there may be worse to come.

The FIFA Club World Cup gets underway on Saturday, pitting 32 of the biggest teams in the world against one another. Inter Miami, LAFC and the Seattle Sounders will all participate, taking on some of the most decorated sides in the global game: reigning European champions Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Atlético Madrid, and winners of four of the past six South American championships in Flamengo and Palmeiras.

MLS is fresh off its league leader getting destroyed in a continental championship, and now with teams sitting sixth, 12th and 13th in its 30-team table facing the prospect of competing against the most talented sides from Europe and South America, a natural question arises: Is MLS going to struggle at the Club World Cup?

MLS teams can afford to make the occasional error during a regular-season match, but up against an elite Liga MX side such as Cruz Azul in the Concacaf Champions Cup final, the margins for those slipups suddenly became much, much smaller.

""When we made mistakes, they punished us,"" Vancouver's Brian White said after the 5-0 thrashing by Cruz Azul in the championship match. ""That's what good teams do in big finals like this.""

Clearly overwhelmed by the high press of the Liga MX squad, Vancouver stumbled over defensive mistakes and were down 4-0 by halftime. Arguments could be made whether manager Jesper Sørensen was too cautious, but the harsh reality when analyzing both teams was the contrast in talent available to Cruz Azul, who had the know-how to capitalize on the Whitecaps' errors.

For reference, without any of the roster limitations seen in MLS, Cruz Azul's starting XI market value was approximately $21.8 million higher than that of Vancouver. In fact, Cruz Azul had six players in their XI with a ""market value"" (for transfers) that was higher than the Whitecaps' lone designated player in the final, Andrés Cubas.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino speaks ahead of the start of the Club World Cup.

Coupled with a suspension for Sebastian Berhalter and an atypically poor evening from Cubas, Sørensen & Co. needed a near-perfect performance from other members of his roster who struggled to compensate.

Things won't get any easier for MLS representation at the Club World Cup. The gulf in depth and roster value of teams becomes even greater when you look at many of the opponents MLS clubs will have to face this summer. While spending more money doesn't necessarily guarantee success, it doesn't take much to find a general correlation between the two.

In Concacaf alone, it's also not a shock to see how that has played out with Liga MX -- which has more freedom with roster building than MLS does -- winning 19 of the past 20 Concacaf titles. When they're on the world stage against teams far more intimidating than Mexican clubs? Let's see if MLS hopefuls can avoid defeats that could be more severe than 5-0. -- Cesar Hernandez

Since Lionel Messi joined the Herons on July 15, 2023, Inter Miami have represented MLS in various international competitions, tasking players such as Messi and Luis Suárez to improve the league's image through participation in the likes of the Leagues Cup and the Concacaf Champions Cup.

MLS has generated a ton of publicity around Inter Miami since Messi and a trio of other former Barcelona players joined the team in the summer of 2023, with enhanced media coverage, marketing campaigns and publicity to increase the league's visibility. Now, with the world watching through the Club World Cup, the league depends on the Herons more than ever.

Miami stands as one of three MLS ambassadors at the Club World Cup with arguably higher expectations than their peers to lift the league's reputation around the world. Though the Seattle Sounders and LAFC will also compete, the league's hopes for international recognition depend on a successful run into the later knockout stages from Inter Miami and Messi.

Head coach Javier Mascherano and Inter Miami continue to take a more realistic approach. Despite boasting arguably the world's greatest player on the roster, Mascherano insists on tempering expectations by emphasizing that the level of the American league remains far below the levels of Club World Cup participants.

""We have to be honest. The level [of play] will be higher than what we've faced in Concacaf [Champions Cup] and MLS,"" Mascherano said. ""The Club World Cup has a very high level, and it's a level we clearly don't have. We have to be honest about it, and there's no shame in saying so.""

Veteran midfielder Sergio Busquets agreed.

""It's clear that we are not at the level to compete at the Club World Cup, but we will try to compete in our group,"" Busquets told DAZN. ""Go game by game, fight and hopefully advance to the next round though it'll be difficult.""

Though Inter Miami enter the competition on the back of two consecutive MLS victories, the month of May saw the Herons struggle. The South Florida side won just three of seven matches, conceding a total of 17 goals to expose defensive weaknesses.

There exists a real possibility that Inter Miami cannot survive the group stage. -- Lizzy Becherano

Al Ahly manager José Riveiro speaks about his excitement for the Club World Cup ahead of facing Inter Miami in the group stage.

Considering the lack of connectivity among leagues, obviously any sort of soccer power rankings trying to compare teams from each continent is going to be only somewhat accurate, but it's better than nothing. Opta's Power Rankings endeavor to do exactly this, and they have semi-encouraging things to say about the MLS teams involved in the Club World Cup.

LAFC (126th in the world, per Opta) are the No. 19 team in the field, Miami (146th) are 23rd, and the Sounders (191st) are 24th. Compared to European teams, LAFC sit between RB Salzburg and Sunderland, Inter Miami sit between FC Twente and West Bromwich Albion, and Seattle, having suffered a couple of poor results early in June, is between Blackburn Rovers and Southampton. None will be favored to advance to the knockout rounds, obviously, but all will have opportunities to win matches.

LAFC upset Club América (90th) to qualify for the tournament, and within Group D they're ranked ahead of Esperance Sportive De Tunis (255th) and not that far behind Flamengo (78th). Flamengo barely lead América, and based on the ratings, an LAFC upset of Flamengo -- one that theoretically might allow them to advance to the knockouts -- would be far less surprising than a Flamengo upset of Chelsea.

The other two teams have more of a steep climb. Seattle landed in Group B, the only group with two Opta top-20 teams (No. 3 PSG and No. 14 Atlético Madrid), and while they could perhaps pull one over on Botafogo (118th overall), their odds of advancing would still be almost zero. The draw will likely prevent them from getting too much useful experience from the tournament.

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

If Seattle landed in the hardest group, Inter Miami might have landed in the easiest: Thanks to a poor season from FC Porto, Group A doesn't feature a single Opta top-50 team as Porto rank 56th, Palmeiras 74th and African power Al Ahly 99th. If there's any home-soil advantage at play, Inter could pull an upset or two.

The Club World Cup is basically two competitions in one. First, lots of similarly ranked clubs from outside of Europe -- including MLS' three entries -- could get useful experience battling each other. Then, starting around the quarterfinals, the European teams will take over. MLS will almost certainly not have an entry in the quarterfinals or beyond, but the ""useful experience"" part is very much on the table. -- Bill Connelly

The FIFA Club World Cup presents MLS with risks, but also potential rewards.

Since its inception, MLS has contended with the narrative that it is nothing more than a low-level circuit that doubles as a retirement league. Yes, it's currently the league that Messi, Jordi Alba, Busquets and others call home. Before that, it was David Beckham, Thierry Henry and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

Yet the ""retirement league"" label ignores the fact that MLS has also become much more of a selling league, with 30 outbound transfers in the last winter transfer window. Players such as Miguel Almirón -- back with Atlanta United after a six-year spell with Newcastle United -- as well as Lazio forward Valentín Castellanos and even current U.S international and Bournemouth midfielder Tyler Adams have used the league as a springboard to greater heights.

Perhaps the best way to drive home that revised narrative is with memorable performances on the field against stiff competition. The league's ventures in the Concacaf Champions Cup have been humbling of late, especially given Vancouver's 5-0 shellacking at the hands of Cruz Azul. The Leagues Cup seems tainted given that most of the games are held on U.S. soil, although that is changing this year.

The Club World Cup is offering more given the increased level of competition. If the three MLS entrants fall flat on their faces, then the retirement league perception will be further entrenched. A respectable performance by any one of the three, though, will see the perception pendulum swing back a bit -- the possible upside is greater than the downside of already existing opinions.

What might success look like for MLS and its teams? Getting out of the group stage should suffice, although that will take some doing.

The bar for gaining respect is admittedly lower for the Sounders. Placed in a group with PSG, Botafogo and Atlético Madrid, Seattle's foray into the Club World Cup has the look of a damage-limitation exercise. If it can nick a point or three off of any of those teams, then the Sounders can exit the tournament with pride intact.

The expectations for LAFC and especially Miami are higher. The Opta rankings have them both placed third in their respective groups, and given the Messi factor, there is hope that the Herons will do MLS proud. Having LAFC progress out of the group stage might do even more to bolster MLS' image, though. The Black and Gold aren't exactly run on a tight budget, and they do boast FIFA World Cup winners Hugo Lloris and Olivier Giroud on their roster, but the linchpin of the team is a less-heralded French-born player in forward Denis Bouanga with lunch-bucket guys such as Mark Delgado and Aaron Long providing the glue.

If a side more representative of MLS and the way teams are built can reach the knockout stages, then fans around the world might cast a more respectful and nuanced glance at MLS, with the league moving up another step in respectability. -- Jeff Carlisle","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

But why has the country helped to bankroll an event that has struggled to generate interest, drawing criticism for the impact it could have on players, domestic leagues, and the environment?

For those wanting to understand the forces at play over the next month of competition in the US, Miami's Hard Rock Stadium on Wednesday would be an ideal place to start.

That, after all, is where Real Madrid will kick off their Club World Cup campaign, with new signing Trent Alexander-Arnold set to make his debut.

The fact the Spanish giants were willing to pay Liverpool a reported £8m to secure the defender's early release so he could play in the tournament is testament to the staggering riches on offer. 

With a prize pot of $1bn (£750m), top European teams are in line to earn up to £97m if they win, leading to concerns such money could distort domestic leagues and skew competitive balance. 

Real's Saudi opponents - Al-Hilal - highlight another intriguing aspect of the tournament.

The Riyadh club are owned by the kingdom's Public Investment Fund (PIF).

But the vast sovereign wealth fund's involvement in this competition does not stop there.

In December, sports streaming platform DAZN agreed to pay Fifa - football's world governing body - $1bn for the tournament's global broadcast rights.

That was not the only surprise, because it also promised to make the live action available for free. This despite Fifa having previously struggled to find broadcast partners, and after DAZN had posted several billion dollars worth of losses over recent years.  

Then, a few weeks later, a subsidiary of PIF announced it had acquired a minority stake in DAZN for what it has since confirmed was $1bn - explaining at the time it was ""an exciting opportunity to build on DAZN's significant successes in recent years by bringing more sports to fans and audiences around the world"".

Saudi ties with the Club World Cup strengthened further last week, when PIF became an official partner of an event Fifa president Gianni Infantino claims will ""make football truly global"".

In a statement at the time, PIF claimed the sponsorship deal showed it was ""at the forefront of growing football"", noting the sport ""plays a crucial role in the ongoing transformation"" of the country.

But is there more to it than that? After all, Fifa had initially struggled to attract sponsors, and ticket sales for some games have been sluggish, with the event perhaps hampered by a complicated qualification system that means recently crowned domestic champions including Liverpool and Barcelona are not present.

Expanding the event from seven teams to 32 has also sparked a legal complaint from both the international players' union and the body representing European leagues, who - despite Fifa denials - claim their concerns over a congested calendar and player workload have been ignored.

Back in December, just a few days after Fifa announced its ""landmark agreement"" with DAZN, the governing body confirmed Saudi Arabia as the host of the 2034 World Cup.

But it is not just the timeline that has inevitably led to speculation over a possible connection between Saudi's investment in the expanded Club World Cup and that hugely controversial decision.

Despite years of scrutiny over its human rights and environmental record, the Saudi bid for the World Cup was unopposed. Australia - the only other potential candidate - decided not to enter the running, hinting it was futile to do so after being given less than a month by Fifa to mount a challenge.

Fifa stood by a fast-tracked process critics argued lacked transparency, and which it was felt effectively paved the way for the Saudis thanks to a decision that only bids from Asia and Oceania would be considered - even though the World Cup had been staged in the Middle East - in Qatar - as recently as 2022.

The sense of inevitability surrounding Saudi's bid was only reinforced after Fifa's evaluation report awarded it a record high score. 

Ratification was then confirmed by acclamation - in the form of applause - rather than a traditional vote, with only Norway's football federation abstaining, and criticising the bidding process.

Despite fears his tournament may be used to improve Saudi Arabia's image, Infantino has defended Saudi's hosting of football's 2034 showpiece, insisting it can be a catalyst for social improvements, and Fifa insists it was an open and transparent process. 

But others remain dismayed.

Nicholas McGeehan, of football campaign group Fair Square, told BBC Sport the World Cup process effectively acted ""to ensure that Saudi Arabia was selected as host"".

""During this deeply flawed bidding process… Fifa sealed a commercially inexplicable broadcasting deal [for the Club World Cup] said to be worth $1bn with an entity that is now part-owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.

""Fifa does not like the fact that many people look at these facts and conclude that there must be a linkage between them, but had it run a fair and transparent bidding process in the first place it wouldn't be under this scrutiny.""

Such sentiments are echoed by Infantino's predecessor Sepp Blatter, who claims the Club World Cup will ""over-charge the international calendar"".

Replying to BBC Sport's questions via his lawyer, Blatter - who remains banned from football until 2028 for breaches of its ethics code - said: ""It is obvious that without Saudi's investment, the Club World Cup could not be organised in the US... it's only through financial help of $1bn from Saudi Arabia that the [DAZN] coverage of this competition was possible.

""There is no more mystery... Saudi Arabia has taken control of international football.""

In a statement, a Fifa spokesperson rejected the suggestion that investment into the Club World Cup was from one country, saying it now had nine tournament sponsors and that ""commercial momentum is strong"".

They insisted that Fifa has ""a duty to develop the game globally and this new competition is in the best interests of football"", with all profits redistributed to the clubs through prize money and a $250m 'solidarity' programme.

It added that the Club World Cup ""is not responsible for calendar congestion"", noting that it takes place once every four years with a maximum of seven matches for the two finalists.

""We believe that this new Club World Cup will mark a turning point for club football worldwide…[it] is an event that football needed.""

What is the Club World Cup?

Speaking to BBC Sport from Miami before the Club World Cup's opening match, DAZN's emerging markets chief executive Pete Oliver defended the investment in what he calls ""a fantastic competition"", insisting it made commercial sense.

""We've been looking for a big property to take DAZN to the next step,"" he said. ""This is an opportunity to establish ourselves as a global platform for football.""

Oliver said it was a ""very logical deal"" for DAZN, insisting the tournament would ""take off"" and was generating huge interest in regions such as South America.

""We think this will be the most streamed sports event ever. It will help us build a huge customer database,"" he added, pointing out DAZN had recouped some of its outlay by regionally sub-licensing rights to some matches.

Asked about PIF's subsequent investment in the company, Oliver said: ""People always speculate but I can tell you we're not being used as a pawn or anything like that.

""There was a lot that happened, but these things are not necessarily connected in any way. The investment we had from PIF was around a general investment, but also specifically to establish a partnership for the Middle East and North Africa region.

""We're an independent company... we're making our own decisions.""

PIF declined to comment, but sports business expert Callum McCarthy says their investment in DAZN ""is expected to result in a Saudi-based sports broadcaster that will rival Qatar's beIN Sports across the Middle East.

""Saudi Arabia has wanted to own a sports broadcaster for well over a decade and has never really known how to pull it off,"" he says. ""Fifa needed a global broadcaster for this tournament that could fund this thing, and DAZN now has a direct relationship with Fifa. All three parties have got what they wanted out of the equation.""

Speaking on condition of anonymity, one senior FA source told BBC Sport that Saudi's support for the Club World Cup was ""a marriage of convenience"". 

The country - they believe - was always likely to stage the 2034 World Cup regardless of the backing of the Club World Cup, thanks to its unprecedented investment in sport, along with the money Fifa believed it could make by returning to the Middle East after Qatar 2022.

They felt Saudi's financial backing of the Club World Cup should be viewed as a ""bailout"" for Fifa, rather than an agreed plan. Fifa, the source said, would have initially been hoping to attract more interest from broadcasters and sponsors, but may have sought help from the Saudis.

""Sport in the kingdom is still largely known for boxing and horse racing,"" they said.

""With Al-Hilal involved in the Club World Cup, this helps establish the country as a footballing nation ahead of the World Cup in 2034, in a way that Qatar failed to do for 2022.

""Involvement in the Club World Cup may help tempt some players to join the Saudi Pro League. They'll be hoping it brings football to a wider public in their own country, and helps to tackle low attendances at some games.""

It is notable that Saudi club Al-Ahli has already booked a place in the 2029 Club World Cup.

Sources close to the Saudi government told BBC Sport the country's investment is purely based on an opportunity for growth in a new market it can also benefit from, as it develops its own plans to use football to boost the economy, boost tourism and help modernise.

It says it fully concurs with Infantino's recent claim that if the US and Saudi Arabia could develop their football industries, and there was less reliance on European football, the sport's annual GDP could double to more than half a trillion dollars in economic impact.

Perhaps this helps explain why Fifa is reportedly already considering a 48-team Club World Cup in 2029 - in line with the expanded men's and women's World Cups.

""I think that concept could work, as long as the quality of the teams is high,"" says DAZN's Oliver.

""That could be very exciting.""

That is not how player unions will see such a prospect, as they insist their members are already at breaking point. 

Environmental campaign groups are also vehemently opposed to a competition that has gone from seven matches in a single city to 63 matches across 11 cities.

If nothing else, this Club World Cup could reveal just how much more expansion the game is capable of, and willing to accept.

A rumor that circulated online in June 2025 claimed FIFA canceled or considered canceling U.S.-hosted 2026 World Cup matches and moving those scheduled events to Mexico or Canada — countries that are already hosting some matches. 

According to social media users' posts, FIFA, the international soccer governing body, received thousands of complaints from players, coaches and fans who refused to travel to the U.S. due to concerns over stringent immigration policies imposed by President Donald Trump's administration.

For example, in early June, a TikTok user published a video (archived) announcing FIFA considered stripping the U.S. of its designation to host 2026 World Cup matches. The clip received nearly 900,000 views.

The clip's narrator recounted the story as follows:

Breaking news. FIFA is now considering stripping the United States of its right to host the 2026 World Cup, and all fingers are pointing directly at Donald Trump. Trump's latest policies are now threatening America's chance to host the world's biggest sporting event. His immigration crackdowns, trade sanctions, multiple nations have issued boycott threats, sponsors are panicking, and broadcasters fear massive global backlash. What was meant to be a global celebration has now turned into a political minefield under Trump's America First agenda.

At the core of FIFA's concern is Trump's refusal to meet their secret demands. No tax breaks, no special visa privileges, and full financial transparency. The backroom deals FIFA has quietly enjoyed for decades are finally being exposed. Will FIFA actually pull the World Cup out of the U.S., or is this just another global power play aiming to punish Trump's refusal to surrender to international pressure?

Other users also shared this rumor on Facebook (archived), Instagram (archived), Threads, TikTok (archived) and X (archived).

However, searches of Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo, as well as The Associated Press, CNN, Fox News and The Washington Post, found no credible reporting about FIFA canceling or considering relocating U.S.-hosted World Cup matches outside the U.S., at least not as of this writing in early June 2025. Rather, this matter marked the latest chapter of users sharing false or unfounded rumors, including some posts featuring the use of artificial-intelligence (AI) tools.

Snopes contacted FIFA's media relations representatives to inquire about the rumor's accuracy and will update this article with more information as it becomes available.

The aforementioned lookups of search engines located some relevant news regarding Trump's policies and the 2026 World Cup, though again no reports confirmed the central claim about FIFA deciding to move U.S.-hosted games to Canada or Mexico.

For example, in March, FIFA President Gianni Infantino met with Trump at the White House, with FIFA reporting Trump reaffirmed support for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and 2026 World Cup tournaments.

On April 25, The Associated Press reported U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a member of the Democratic Party in Oregon, asked the Trump administration to reconsider policies impacting travelers arriving in the U.S., including citing upcoming sporting events like the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

In early May, NBC News reported members of Trump's Cabinet warned World Cup visitors to the U.S. not to overstay their visas. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also cast the tournament as ""an opportunity for the world to become a friendlier place,"" adding, ""We will take care of their documentation and travel documents, and it will go smoothly. And we will make sure that they can come and enjoy and bring their families and friends and make memories together.""

On May 13, Politico (archived) reported the details of a letter (archived) the Human Rights Watch organization addressed to Infantino. The letter cited Human Rights Watch's ""grave concerns"" about Trump's immigration policies, and urged Infantino to be ""prepared to reconsider the hosting decision"" if the safety of fans and players couldn't be guaranteed. Other reports told of concerns about long visa appointment wait times, as well as European countries issuing travel advisories for the U.S.

Two days later, on May 15, Reuters (archived) reported Infantino reassured that ""the world is welcome in America,"" referencing the 2025 and 2026 tournaments.

Trump's travel ban, which targets 12 countries and adds restrictions on others, includes exceptions for ""any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State.""

Why normal practice is raising concerns","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2025/06/12/ice-border-protection-fifa-club-world-cup-gold-cup-security/84153876007/","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 17:19:34 GMT","

Thousands of soccer fans will flock to stadiums across the United States over the next week as the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup gets underway, starting with the opener between Inter Miami and Egyptian club Al-Ahly on June 14.

According to a since-deleted social media post, U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) will be there, too.

""CBP will be suited and booted,"" the organization wrote June 4 on X, ""ready to provide security for the first round of games.""

The presence of federal law enforcement officers, including those from CBP or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), is relatively common at major sporting events like the Super Bowl, which often carry special designations that prompt more rigorous security.

But as the Trump administration continues to aggressively enforce immigration laws, prompting wide-scale protests in Los Angeles, there are concerns that CBP and ICE will go beyond their traditional security roles at the Club World Cup.

""You never know with how this administration, the aggression they're showing on immigration enforcement, whether they have other intentions, as well,"" said John Sandweg, a partner at Nixon Peabody LLP who previously served as the acting director of ICE in late 2013 and early 2014. ""But the role, certainly of CBP and even ICE, in terms of a major sporting event is not unusual.""

CBP has since deleted its post about being ""suited and booted"" for the opening round of games, with The Athletic reporting June 12 that FIFA officials had ""expressed concerns to the CBP about the reaction it had provoked.""

In response to a series of emailed questions about that report, how many CBP officers would be at Club World Cup games and what their roles would be, a CBP spokesperson said the organization is ""committed to working with our local and federal partners"" to ensure the event is safe for everyone involved, as it does with other major sporting events.

""Our mission remains unchanged,"" the spokesperson said.

ICE did not reply to an email from USA TODAY Sports seeking more information about its role at the Club World Cup, though the organization confirmed to WTVJ-TV in Miami that its officers will be assisting with security. The NBC Miami station also reported the statement from ICE included a reminder that ""non-American citizens need to carry proof of their legal status.""

That sort of language is concerning to people like Thomas Kennedy of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, who said it could be intimidating both to U.S. residents and foreign fans with valid travel visas.

""I'd be worried and disturbed if I were going to the games,"" Kennedy told The Miami Herald. ""If I didn't have status, I would probably stay away altogether.""

When asked about ICE agents working security at Club World Cup games, and the possibility of fans being detained, president Gianni Infantino told reporters June 10 that he didn't have any concerns.

“No, I don't have any concerns about anything in the sense that we are very attentive on any security question,"" he said. ""Of course the most important (thing) for us is to guarantee security for all the fans who come to the games. This is our priority. This is a priority of all the authorities who are here.""

While there has been concern and confusion on social media about why CBP and ICE officers would be on hand at a sporting event, Sandweg said their presence alone is not strange.

At major sporting events that receive a special security designation, he said, federal law enforcement officers usually support local and state officials with general security efforts while also offering different forms of expertise. ICE, for example, has worked to identify, investigate and curtail the sale of counterfeit merchandise at past Super Bowls. And CBP has mobile technology they use to screen vehicles at the border, which can instead be used to scan delivery trucks entering a stadium.

The questions around the Club World Cup, however, stem from a broader shift in immigration enforcement efforts under President Donald Trump.

The Trump administration has taken aggressive and sometimes extreme steps to enforce immigration laws over the past few months, with officers sometimes wearing masks and detaining people at schools, restaurants or as they leave courtrooms after immigration court proceedings. The raids have prompted both national and local backlash, with the most recent flashpoint coming in Los Angeles over the weekend, when Trump dispatched the national guard to quell protests in the streets.

Many of those enforcement efforts have targeted Hispanic people, who also make up a significant portion of soccer fans in the U.S.

""If people think they are going to get scooped up, they wouldn't go. I wouldn't,"" Gerald Foston, national president of the U.S. Soccer supporters group Sammers SC, told NorthJersey.com, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.

""I'm African American. I've been mistaken for Dominican, so even though I'm going to a game, do I have to walk around with my passport?""

The Club World Cup features 32 teams from 20 countries, including the United States, with games spread across a dozen venues during the next several weeks. It will run concurrently with the Concacaf Gold Cup, another soccer tournament that includes national teams from North and Central America. Citizens of Haiti, a country whose national team is playing in the Gold Cup, have been banned from traveling to the U.S. by Trump, though the ban includes an exception for competing athletes and coaches.

In many ways, the two events will serve as a tune-up for next summer's men's World Cup, which the U.S. is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico, and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

While Trump has embraced the United States' role as an international sports host and pledged to welcome fans from around the world, some immigration advocates see his recent actions as having the opposite effect.

""Military parades, Border Patrol officers 'providing security' at international sporting events ... no, this is not a description of the buildup towards the 1936 Summer Olympic Games. This is how the Trump regime welcomes the world,"" George Escobar, the chief of programs and services at immigration advocacy group CASA, said in a statement.

""Sports are supposed to bring people together, not be used as weaponized targets for political agendas.""

It's unclear whether or how the broader political environment in the U.S. will impact international attendance at the World Cup or Summer Olympics. But for the Club World Cup, Sandweg wonders if even the potential presence of ICE and CBP could put a damper on the festitivies or drive away fans.

""Given all that's going on right now, the optics are such that it's certainly going to have a chilling effect, I think, on attendance,"" he said.

    Real Madrid, PSG, Man City, River Plate and Inter Miami are among the teams battling for a world title -- and a share of a $1 billion prize pool -- in this revamped cup tournament.
  

The FIFA Club World Cup kicks off in its new, expanded format this weekend, featuring 32 of the world's top clubs competing over four weeks and 63 matches across 11 host cities in the US.

Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch every match of the tournament as it happens, wherever you are in the world, and how to use a VPN if the match isn't available where you are, along with a full fixture list. 

Modeled after the international FIFA World Cup, this newly restructured tournament is set to be held every four years, marking a major shift in the global club football calendar.

Teams taking part are mainly the champions of their respective continental tournaments over the past four years — such as the UEFA Champions League and Copa Libertadores — with additional slots allocated to clubs from stronger confederations like Europe's UEFA and South America's CONMEBOL.

European heavyweights in the lineup include pretournament favorites Real Madrid, holders Manchester City, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and this year's UCL winners Paris Saint-Germain. South America will be represented by the likes of Palmeiras, Flamengo, River Plate and Boca Juniors. From the CONCACAF region, Monterrey, Seattle Sounders and Pachuca will lead the charge, while the tournament is also set to feature the likes of Al-Ahly from Egypt, Auckland City from New Zealand and Urawa Red Diamonds from Japan. 

The buildup to the Club World Cup hasn't been without controversy. Several high-profile clubs, including Premier League champions Liverpool, are notably absent. The qualification process has also drawn criticism, particularly the selection of Lionel Messi's Inter Miami to represent Major League Soccer instead of reigning MLS Cup champions LAFC, though the latter did eventually qualify through a play-in game.

In addition, concerns about player burnout have intensified, with coaches and players raising the alarm over the increasingly congested football calendar. Ticket sales across several venues have reportedly been sluggish, suggesting that enthusiasm for the new format may take time to build.

Armchair fans will nevertheless lap up a new summer showcase of elite club soccer, with big-name stars like Messi, Erling Haaland, Kylian Mbappé, Ousmane Dembélé and Jude Bellingham all set to feature.

Thirty-two teams from around the world are set to take part in the four-week tournament, with the final set to be held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

The great news for footy fans is that sports streaming platform DAZN is set to broadcast all 63 matches of the FIFA Club World Cup for free in almost every country on the planet, with coverage available in multiple languages.

Existing DAZN subscribers or Freemium members can watch every game of the tournament as part of their current membership.

If you're not a member, it's easy to sign up for a free DAZN Freemium account using your email address to watch all the action at no cost through the DAZN app.

As well as dedicated apps for iOS and Android, DAZN offers a wide range of support for set-top boxes and smart TVs.

If you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the international soccer action while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. 

It encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds, and can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security. 

However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN use to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance. 

If you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN use is crucial.

As well as DAZN, footy fans in the UK have a second option for watching FIFA Club World Cup matches that is also free.

Free-to-air broadcaster Channel 5 is set to show 23 select fixtures live during the tournament, including 15 group games, four last-16 ties, two quarterfinals, one semifinal and the final.

That also means those games can be live streamed via the network's My5 online service. 

Channel 5 is available through Freeview, Freesat, Freely, Sky or Virgin Media. 

If you want to stream the network's coverage from the tournament, you can head to channel5.com, or download the dedicated My5 app for iOS, Android and smart TVs 

Like the UK, Australia also has a second option for watching the tournament live. Alongside DAZN's free coverage, pay TV broadcaster Foxtel and its sister streaming service Kayo will also be showing all 63 games. 

A Kayo Sports subscription starts at AU$25 a month and lets you stream on one screen, while its Premium tier costs AU$40 a month for simultaneous viewing on up to three devices.

The service gives you access to a wide range of sports, including F1, NRL, NFL, NHL and MLB, and there are no lock-in contracts. 

Better still, if you're a new customer, you can take advantage of a one-week Kayo Sports free trial.

Today's News

FIFA Club World Cup

Last summer, as FIFA attempted to set the wheels in motion for the revamped 32-team Club World Cup in the United States, disagreement surfaced within the organization.

According to multiple sources familiar with the discussions, all of whom wished to remain anonymous to protect their working relationships, FIFA staff based in Miami wanted the tournament to lean more heavily on smaller MLS stadiums, particularly for games that may involve teams who are unfamiliar to the U.S. market. Their thesis was that hot-ticket events could boost revenues, while FIFA would also avoid empty seats in the first edition of a remodelled tournament.

Yet the message from senior officials in FIFA's European office, led by the organization's president Gianni Infantino, was clear. They wanted this tournament to be the biggest and the best. Infantino has described it as “a big bang” and the “most coveted” competition in world club football.

In the White House, standing next to the sitting President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, Infantino described the Club World Cup as the “best players from the best teams” and he said “millions of people will be coming”. He even ensured his own name was inscribed — in more than one place — on a trophy designed by Tiffany & Co; the brand was recommended by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

Infantino told confidantes he wanted the prize money to be the biggest for any tournament in club football. He fell narrowly short — the winner of the Club World Cup, according to figures published by FIFA, may earn up to $125m (£93.5m), which is less than the $154m Real Madrid earned by winning the Champions League in 2024.

His ambition was reflected with the choice of stadiums, as eight of the 12 venues have capacities in excess of 65,000 and only 12 of the 64 games will be played in MLS venues — in Nashville, Cincinnati, Orlando and Washington, D.C.

This leaves modest fixtures in huge stadiums; Brazilian team Fluminense against South African side Mamelodi Sundowns in Hard Rock Stadium (65,000 capacity); Fluminense and Korea's Ulsan HD at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey (82,500 capacity); and Brazilian side Flamengo against the Tunisian team Esperance de Tunis at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field (69,000 capacity). As of last week, the Sundowns' match against Fluminense had sold less than 10,000 tickets, and even games involving Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain in Pasadena and Seattle are likely to fall way short of selling out.

At this point, we should remember tournaments do not always sell out, even in football markets often considered more mature. Amid the nostalgic folklore of the European Championship held in England in 1996, which is often framed as the summer when “football came home,” attendances were actually rather modest.

Spain's opening match against Bulgaria attracted 26,000 at Leeds United's Elland Road. Five group-stage games had crowds of less than 20,000. There were tens of thousands of empty seats at Manchester United's Old Trafford for the semi-final between the Czech Republic and France. There were plenty of reasons for this; ticket prices were considered high, while the average British football fan may have been less curious about foreign teams in the 1990s than they are today, and an IRA bomb early in the tournament in Manchester city centre also may have dissuaded people away from public spaces — although some of the early group games with low attendances preceded the attack. A quick search of “empty seats” on Google also reveals discussions on the topic during the World Cup in Qatar in 2022, Brazil in 2014 and Japan and South Korea in 2002, although this was more due to no-shows and ticketing issues than a lack of demand.

The sight of empty seats for the Club World Cup will lead to plenty of scorn, and probably plenty of memes. There are worries among some figures involved with host-city planning for next year's World Cup in the U.S. that empty seats at the Club World Cup will undermine the story they seek to tell of soccer being on the brink of exploding across the country. Some worry that it may impact their pitches to potential sponsors of fan festivals around the World Cup. In short, there is a danger the Club World Cup will be seen as the latest referendum on America's appetite for the sport, but such conclusions should come with caution, and there are plenty of reasons why American fans may be sceptical of spending big on these games.

Any post-mortem should focus more heavily on the supply (FIFA) rather than the demand (soccer fans in the U.S.). Many factors combined to create a tournament that has been struggling for positive publicity outside of the quotes largely published as press releases by either competing clubs or FIFA.

Firstly, FIFA set expectations and prices for the competition at a level that were wildly out of kilter for the product. FIFA's tournament slogan of “the best against the best” is immediately undermined by the fact the current champions of England, Spain and Italy are not involved, owing to the qualification format FIFA laid out.

FIFA's chances of maximizing success were also hindered by arriving late into the planning and organization of the tournament. This is not something the U.S. bid for — they were simply told Infantino was bringing the competition to their country. This is why FIFA was left with so little leverage when securing venues for the tournament, paying high rental fees that nearly guarantee stadiums will receive healthy profits regardless of ticket sales. FIFA says venues were offered incentives via commissions on further ticket sales if they connected the stadium's “legacy fans” with tickets.

Yet FIFA did not have venues secured until last autumn, while sponsors also arrived late in the day — at lower rates than the governing body first imagined when conceptualizing the tournament. A broadcaster, DAZN, was announced as a $1billion partner in December. This was before the streaming platform received around the same amount in funding from Saudi Arabia, but this fell billions short of Infantino's original hopes for the competition's TV deal. In the weeks before striking the DAZN deal, which also secured the participation and prize money for competing teams, several European clubs were privately considering walking away from the competition.

As for the appetite of the U.S. public, FIFA presumed it was onto a winner in a country where tickets for major sports events sell and resell into many hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars. The problem this time, however, is few people across the world appeared to fully understand the event, which has also been the subject of criticism and lawsuits from bodies such as the Premier League, La Liga and world players' union FIFPro, who have expressed concerns about a cluttered football calendar or players being overworked.

FIFA set expensive ticket prices for teams who are, to put it mildly, new to the U.S. market. Some games are scheduled for weekday afternoons, which can be inconvenient both for those who work but also due to the summer heat. There are exceptions, notably games involving Argentina's Boca Juniors in Miami, or Real Madrid anywhere at all, while a match between PSG and Atletico Madrid in the group stage at the Rose Bowl is selling better since the French team won the Champions League, but will still fall short of a sell-out. Infantino's claims about millions of visitors also appear highly unlikely, while some domestic fans have been concerned by reports of government immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents being present at games amid the Trump administration's rhetoric on immigration. ICE told NBC that “all non-American citizens need to carry proof of their legal status.”

The Athletic has reported how, as of two weeks before the tournament, tens of thousands of seats remained unsold at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens to host Lionel Messi's Inter Miami against Egyptian team Al-Ahly. FIFA has offered students of Miami Dade College (which has over 100,000 enrolled) the opportunity to buy tickets for $20, with up to four complimentary tickets. This means some fans will be watching Messi for as little as $4, which is a far cry from the cheapest seats being cast at $349 when the draw was made in December. Elsewhere, FIFA has been quietly sending partial refunds to some supporters who bought tickets at higher prices through their club team allocations when they first became available, while other games are also braced for either low attendances or late giveaways to avoid vast sections of empty seats.

To fill the stadiums, the dynamically priced market may work in favor of consumers, driving prices down where supply is low. There has been a substantial increase in ticket sales over the past fortnight, and there is also hope that once the tournament starts — and established European teams with large followings advance to the final rounds — both interest and demand will follow. By the end, this first edition may even start to look like a roaring success after a false start.

Speaking this week, Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey said his “guess” was that MetLife Stadium would have between 40,000 and 50,000 for their first game this weekend between Portuguese side Porto and Brazilian team Palmeiras. While this would leave at least 30,000 empty seats, it would also, in most settings, be a pretty impressive attendance for a game between two teams who are not hugely familiar to an American audience in an unproven tournament. It is hard to imagine, for example, the attendance being any higher if the same game were played in England.

In FIFA HQ, there have been strategic mistakes. FIFA presumed a home market would turn out for Inter Miami, but locals did not want to stump up significantly more than they usually do to watch Messi regularly in MLS. It would have been smarter to take Messi on tour, hitting different markets where he appears less regularly. The late inclusion of MLS side LAFC — owing to the expulsion of Mexican team Leon — meant games involving LAFC could not be played in Los Angeles, where the team is well-supported in their local market, as the calendar was already set.

FIFA is also operating in a market that is saturated. Other soccer is available this summer in the U.S., notably the Gold Cup, which will include the U.S. men's national team and a full-strength Mexico. FIFA also managed to irritate Concacaf, which hoped to have the southern portion of the west coast largely to themselves for the Gold Cup, only for FIFA to then strike a deal to play games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. The Premier League will also bring Manchester United to New Jersey, Atlanta and Chicago this summer as part of its Summer Series, while many fans may be saving up for FIFA's own World Cup next summer, particularly since The Athletic recently revealed the tournament will also be dynamically priced.

Some humility, therefore, may have been in order this summer for FIFA, which had an opportunity to develop goodwill and excitement ahead of the World Cup. FIFA, which projects $13bn of revenue during the cycle leading through next year's tournament, might have used this as a chance to recognize the sport is still emerging and offer a wider selection of truly affordable tickets from the outset. Those same supporters who benefited this summer may then have been inspired to either save up for next summer or spend money around fan festivals at the World Cup. Instead, the tickets only became affordable when the organization's president was at risk of being embarrassed by attendances.

FIFA's attempts to capture the imagination of the U.S. market have been increasingly frantic. Infantino has been touring the U.S., but some clubs wonder whether the divisive FIFA president is the best salesman for the tournament.

As part of his recent attempts to charm a younger audience, he visited the influencer iShowSpeed in late May, when he claimed Cristiano Ronaldo was talking to participating clubs about a transfer that would enable him to compete in the tournament. No move materialized, and Ronaldo's representatives were irritated by Infantino's comments.

A spokesperson representing the influencer told The Athletic no payment was offered or received in either direction for Infantino to appear on Speed's stream.

FIFA has engaged numerous American influencers to promote the tournament, an apparent attempt at connecting with the most casual of soccer fans. They have hired Shayne Boyle, who appears to be most famous for catching items in his mouth on an Instagram account called insaneshayne1 followed by 2.9 million people, as well as food content creator meals_by_cug, the innovation creator unnecessaryinventions and the baseball video creator Kait Maniscalco (askkait).

The coming weeks will tell us whether FIFA's strategy has paid dividends.

Alejandro Moreno speaks on LAFC's journey to the Club World Cup and the challenges they will face in the tournament. (0:51)

Major League Soccer doesn't have a particularly strong record in international competitions. In the league's 30 years of existence, MLS sides have won three continental titles: D.C. United (Concacaf Champions Cup and the short-lived Copa Interamericana) in 1998, the LA Galaxy (Concacaf Champions Cup) in 2000 and the Seattle Sounders  (Concacaf Champions League) in 2022.

Is the tide turning? Six of the past eight Concacaf Champions Cup finals have featured an MLS club, though only the 2022 Sounders managed to best opposition from Liga MX in the competition's showpiece event. In this year's finale held earlier this month, the MLS-leading Vancouver Whitecaps were thoroughly dismantled by this past season's third-best team in Mexico, Cruz Azul, by a 5-0 scoreline.

It was a disaster of a result for a league that aspires to be known as the best in North America, and yet, there may be worse to come.

The FIFA Club World Cup gets underway on Saturday, pitting 32 of the biggest teams in the world against one another. Inter Miami, LAFC and the Seattle Sounders will all participate, taking on some of the most decorated sides in the global game: reigning European champions Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Atlético Madrid, and winners of four of the past six South American championships in Flamengo and Palmeiras.

MLS is fresh off its league leader getting destroyed in a continental championship, and now with teams sitting sixth, 12th and 13th in its 30-team table facing the prospect of competing against the most talented sides from Europe and South America, a natural question arises: Is MLS going to struggle at the Club World Cup?

MLS teams can afford to make the occasional error during a regular-season match, but up against an elite Liga MX side such as Cruz Azul in the Concacaf Champions Cup final, the margins for those slipups suddenly became much, much smaller.

""When we made mistakes, they punished us,"" Vancouver's Brian White said after the 5-0 thrashing by Cruz Azul in the championship match. ""That's what good teams do in big finals like this.""

Clearly overwhelmed by the high press of the Liga MX squad, Vancouver stumbled over defensive mistakes and were down 4-0 by halftime. Arguments could be made whether manager Jesper Sørensen was too cautious, but the harsh reality when analyzing both teams was the contrast in talent available to Cruz Azul, who had the know-how to capitalize on the Whitecaps' errors.

For reference, without any of the roster limitations seen in MLS, Cruz Azul's starting XI market value was approximately $21.8 million higher than that of Vancouver. In fact, Cruz Azul had six players in their XI with a ""market value"" (for transfers) that was higher than the Whitecaps' lone designated player in the final, Andrés Cubas.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino speaks ahead of the start of the Club World Cup.

Coupled with a suspension for Sebastian Berhalter and an atypically poor evening from Cubas, Sørensen & Co. needed a near-perfect performance from other members of his roster who struggled to compensate.

Things won't get any easier for MLS representation at the Club World Cup. The gulf in depth and roster value of teams becomes even greater when you look at many of the opponents MLS clubs will have to face this summer. While spending more money doesn't necessarily guarantee success, it doesn't take much to find a general correlation between the two.

In Concacaf alone, it's also not a shock to see how that has played out with Liga MX -- which has more freedom with roster building than MLS does -- winning 19 of the past 20 Concacaf titles. When they're on the world stage against teams far more intimidating than Mexican clubs? Let's see if MLS hopefuls can avoid defeats that could be more severe than 5-0. -- Cesar Hernandez

Since Lionel Messi joined the Herons on July 15, 2023, Inter Miami have represented MLS in various international competitions, tasking players such as Messi and Luis Suárez to improve the league's image through participation in the likes of the Leagues Cup and the Concacaf Champions Cup.

MLS has generated a ton of publicity around Inter Miami since Messi and a trio of other former Barcelona players joined the team in the summer of 2023, with enhanced media coverage, marketing campaigns and publicity to increase the league's visibility. Now, with the world watching through the Club World Cup, the league depends on the Herons more than ever.

Miami stands as one of three MLS ambassadors at the Club World Cup with arguably higher expectations than their peers to lift the league's reputation around the world. Though the Seattle Sounders and LAFC will also compete, the league's hopes for international recognition depend on a successful run into the later knockout stages from Inter Miami and Messi.

Head coach Javier Mascherano and Inter Miami continue to take a more realistic approach. Despite boasting arguably the world's greatest player on the roster, Mascherano insists on tempering expectations by emphasizing that the level of the American league remains far below the levels of Club World Cup participants.

""We have to be honest. The level [of play] will be higher than what we've faced in Concacaf [Champions Cup] and MLS,"" Mascherano said. ""The Club World Cup has a very high level, and it's a level we clearly don't have. We have to be honest about it, and there's no shame in saying so.""

Veteran midfielder Sergio Busquets agreed.

""It's clear that we are not at the level to compete at the Club World Cup, but we will try to compete in our group,"" Busquets told DAZN. ""Go game by game, fight and hopefully advance to the next round though it'll be difficult.""

Though Inter Miami enter the competition on the back of two consecutive MLS victories, the month of May saw the Herons struggle. The South Florida side won just three of seven matches, conceding a total of 17 goals to expose defensive weaknesses.

There exists a real possibility that Inter Miami cannot survive the group stage. -- Lizzy Becherano

Al Ahly manager José Riveiro speaks about his excitement for the Club World Cup ahead of facing Inter Miami in the group stage.

Considering the lack of connectivity among leagues, obviously any sort of soccer power rankings trying to compare teams from each continent is going to be only somewhat accurate, but it's better than nothing. Opta's Power Rankings endeavor to do exactly this, and they have semi-encouraging things to say about the MLS teams involved in the Club World Cup.

LAFC (126th in the world, per Opta) are the No. 19 team in the field, Miami (146th) are 23rd, and the Sounders (191st) are 24th. Compared to European teams, LAFC sit between RB Salzburg and Sunderland, Inter Miami sit between FC Twente and West Bromwich Albion, and Seattle, having suffered a couple of poor results early in June, is between Blackburn Rovers and Southampton. None will be favored to advance to the knockout rounds, obviously, but all will have opportunities to win matches.

LAFC upset Club América (90th) to qualify for the tournament, and within Group D they're ranked ahead of Esperance Sportive De Tunis (255th) and not that far behind Flamengo (78th). Flamengo barely lead América, and based on the ratings, an LAFC upset of Flamengo -- one that theoretically might allow them to advance to the knockouts -- would be far less surprising than a Flamengo upset of Chelsea.

The other two teams have more of a steep climb. Seattle landed in Group B, the only group with two Opta top-20 teams (No. 3 PSG and No. 14 Atlético Madrid), and while they could perhaps pull one over on Botafogo (118th overall), their odds of advancing would still be almost zero. The draw will likely prevent them from getting too much useful experience from the tournament.

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

If Seattle landed in the hardest group, Inter Miami might have landed in the easiest: Thanks to a poor season from FC Porto, Group A doesn't feature a single Opta top-50 team as Porto rank 56th, Palmeiras 74th and African power Al Ahly 99th. If there's any home-soil advantage at play, Inter could pull an upset or two.

The Club World Cup is basically two competitions in one. First, lots of similarly ranked clubs from outside of Europe -- including MLS' three entries -- could get useful experience battling each other. Then, starting around the quarterfinals, the European teams will take over. MLS will almost certainly not have an entry in the quarterfinals or beyond, but the ""useful experience"" part is very much on the table. -- Bill Connelly

The FIFA Club World Cup presents MLS with risks, but also potential rewards.

Since its inception, MLS has contended with the narrative that it is nothing more than a low-level circuit that doubles as a retirement league. Yes, it's currently the league that Messi, Jordi Alba, Busquets and others call home. Before that, it was David Beckham, Thierry Henry and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

Yet the ""retirement league"" label ignores the fact that MLS has also become much more of a selling league, with 30 outbound transfers in the last winter transfer window. Players such as Miguel Almirón -- back with Atlanta United after a six-year spell with Newcastle United -- as well as Lazio forward Valentín Castellanos and even current U.S international and Bournemouth midfielder Tyler Adams have used the league as a springboard to greater heights.

Perhaps the best way to drive home that revised narrative is with memorable performances on the field against stiff competition. The league's ventures in the Concacaf Champions Cup have been humbling of late, especially given Vancouver's 5-0 shellacking at the hands of Cruz Azul. The Leagues Cup seems tainted given that most of the games are held on U.S. soil, although that is changing this year.

The Club World Cup is offering more given the increased level of competition. If the three MLS entrants fall flat on their faces, then the retirement league perception will be further entrenched. A respectable performance by any one of the three, though, will see the perception pendulum swing back a bit -- the possible upside is greater than the downside of already existing opinions.

What might success look like for MLS and its teams? Getting out of the group stage should suffice, although that will take some doing.

The bar for gaining respect is admittedly lower for the Sounders. Placed in a group with PSG, Botafogo and Atlético Madrid, Seattle's foray into the Club World Cup has the look of a damage-limitation exercise. If it can nick a point or three off of any of those teams, then the Sounders can exit the tournament with pride intact.

The expectations for LAFC and especially Miami are higher. The Opta rankings have them both placed third in their respective groups, and given the Messi factor, there is hope that the Herons will do MLS proud. Having LAFC progress out of the group stage might do even more to bolster MLS' image, though. The Black and Gold aren't exactly run on a tight budget, and they do boast FIFA World Cup winners Hugo Lloris and Olivier Giroud on their roster, but the linchpin of the team is a less-heralded French-born player in forward Denis Bouanga with lunch-bucket guys such as Mark Delgado and Aaron Long providing the glue.

If a side more representative of MLS and the way teams are built can reach the knockout stages, then fans around the world might cast a more respectful and nuanced glance at MLS, with the league moving up another step in respectability. -- Jeff Carlisle","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

GOAL runs through the winger's possible next destinations after what appears to be the final nail in the coffin of his career at Etihad Stadium

""Of course, Jack has to play. He's an unbelievable player who has to play football every three days. It didn't happen this season and last season either,"" Pep Guardiola said after leaving Jack Grealish out of Manchester City's squad for their 2-0 win over Fulham on the final day of the Premier League season. ""He needs to do it. With us or another place. It's a question for Jack, his agent and the club.""

That was the politest possible way of saying 'you're not needed here anymore'. The final confirmation of that came on Wednesday, as Grealish was omitted from Guardiola's 27-man list of travelling players for the Club World Cup in the United States.

A new era is starting at City, who have already spent £116 million ($158m) on four new players this summer, and Grealish won't be part of it. It's a sad state of affairs for the 29-year-old, not only because he is not leaving on his own terms, but because he has arguably wasted the best years of his career trying to be something he's not under a manager known for discouraging freedom of expression.

Grealish struggled to adjust after completing his British-record £100m ($136m) transfer from Aston Villa to the Etihad in 2021, and although he played his part in City's historic treble success in 2022-23, the last two seasons have been completely miserable for the England international. Indeed, he was restricted to just seven Premier League starts in 2024-25 after falling behind Savinho and Jeremy Doku in the attacking pecking order, and failed to make the most of the rare chances he did get.

The unpredictable genius who thrilled Premier League crowds at Villa has been zapped of all confidence, and he's also surrendered his place in the England squad as a result. But all is not lost yet. Grealish can still get back to his scintillating best if he picks the right new club, and GOAL is on hand to rank the eight options available to the City outcast...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Alexander Zverev moved to within one victory of capturing his maiden grass-court title on Saturday at the BOSS OPEN in Stuttgart, where he edged Ben Shelton to reach the final.

The top-seeded German delivered an assured display to prevail 7-6(8), 7-6(1) in a serve-dominated semi-final clash at the ATP 250 event. Zverev, who struck 36 winners and did not face a break point, is into his third tour-level final on the surface after he reached that stage in Halle in 2016 and 2017.

“I'm super happy to be in the final, it's my first grass-court final since 2017,” said Zverev after his two-hour win. “It's been eight years. I actually really like playing on the surface. I'm happy to be in the final in Germany again, I'm looking forward to it.”

And the final is set... 🍿Zverev overcomes Shelton 7-6(8) 7-6(1) to set up a spectacular showdown with Fritz 🔥@boss__open | #BOSSOPEN pic.twitter.com/aKyZcp3O91

After reaching his third major final at the Australian Open in January, Zverev fell to opening-round defeats in Indian Wells and Monte-Carlo, but responded by claiming his first title of the season in Munich. The No. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings can look ahead to another championship-match clash on home soil, where he faces second seed Taylor Fritz, who leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 7-5.

Shelton saved all six break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, but was picked off with ease in the second-set tie-break, when he often charged the net in a last-gasp attempt to salvage the match. The American can, however, reflect on a milestone week in Stuttgart, where he confirmed his debut inside the Top 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings for this coming Monday.
Fritz sealed his spot in his first tour-level final since last November by defeating Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 7-6(5) on Saturday lunchtime. The American went 3-4 during the clay season, and dropped three spots to No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings, but he has responded by advancing to the Stuttgart final without dropping a set.
“The clay-court season wasn't the best for me, so I came here more motivated to start the grass season off well,” said Fritz. “I'm super happy that I've been able to start it off with a final.
“I'm locked in and ready to go. Once I start winning a couple of matches on grass and start feeling good, all the other things start clicking for me.”

A three-time champion in Eastbourne (2019, 2022, 2024), Fritz is no stranger to success on the grass. While Zverev is chasing his first trophy on the surface, Fritz can also look to their recent Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry for motivation. 
The 27-year-old has won his past four meetings against Zverev, including in the semi-finals at the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin last year, when the American advanced to his most recent tour-level final.

 Jannik Sinner's goal of bouncing back quickly from his Roland Garros final disappointment will not be an easy one to fulfil at the Terra Wortmann Open. 

 The top seed and defending champion will open against a qualifier at the grass-court ATP 500 in Halle. He could then face a fellow former titlist in each of his next two rounds. 

 The 2023 winner Alexander Bublik is a potential second-round opponent for Sinner, with the Kazakhstani taking on Alexandre Muller in his opener. The 2022 champion Hubert Hurkacz, who starts against seventh seed Tomas Machac, is a potential quarter-final opponent. 

 Sinner is bidding to quickly put behind him the memory of Roland Garros, where he held three championship points before falling to Carlos Alcaraz in last Sunday's final with another deep run on the Halle grass.

 The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner's potential semi-final opponents in Germany include fourth seed Andrey Rublev (who opens against a qualifier), eighth seed Karen Khachanov (who plays Zizou Bergs) and Felix Auger-Aliassime (who plays a qualifier). 

 Second seed Alexander Zverev, who reached the championship match in Halle in 2016 and 2017, will begin his latest campaign at OWL Arena against Marcos Giron. Zverev has won all three of the pair's previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings, including a straight-sets triumph on grass at Wimbledon last year.

 Even for someone as mentally resilient as Jannik Sinner, bouncing back from the disappointment of his Roland Garros final loss was never going to be an easy task. 

 Yet the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings believes he has already made good strides in moving on from letting slip three championship points before falling to Carlos Alcaraz at the clay major. Speaking in his pre-tournament press conference at the Terra Wortmann Open in Halle, Sinner acknowledged the pain of his loss had affected him, but said he was already focused on his title defence at the grass-court ATP 500. 

 “Often,” said Sinner, speaking in German, when asked if he had ‘mourned' the three championship points he held in the Roland Garros final over the past week. “It happens. I don't know how it will look in the future. I think that it is not the most important thing, but I nevertheless try to forget the negative things and see what I can do here [in Halle]. 

 ""I think that for me to play another tournament is positive, because every match is a new beginning, and I must be mentally ready to give my all on the court. Therefore, it is great I can be here in Halle. But yes, I had already a few sleepless nights, but I think every day it gets better. My family stand behind me, and my friends. That is the most important thing for me. Tennis is important in my life but nevertheless are family and friends more important. Nonetheless I think often about the match.”

 Sinner's methods to help him move on quickly from his Paris disappointment did not involve any complex plan. Instead, the 23-year-old simply headed home to Italy to spend time with those who know him best. 

 “I was very relaxed with my family. We grilled a bit, played table tennis with my friends,” said Sinner. “Really normal things, nothing special. I like going home, when a lot is going on. I feel safe at home and with my friends. They know how I am, and how I was before. They know me very well. 

 “I didn't do much. I was relatively relaxed, and now I have been here since yesterday. The most important thing is to bring 100 per cent to this tournament. The first grass match is very difficult, but I am happy to be here.”

 In the coming weeks, Sinner will hope to build on the developments he made in his grass-court game in 2024. That mission will start in Halle, where he lifted his maiden grass title a year ago in his first event as World No. 1. This year, he faces a qualifier in the first round. 
 The Italian arrived at the German ATP 500, renowned for its relaxed countryside atmosphere and on-site players' hotel, on Friday morning. Later that day, he picked up a racquet for the first time since his defeat to Alcaraz. 
 “The first practice session was OK. I hadn't played since Paris, so my general feeling on the court were not so perfect, but I think today it will go better,” said Sinner, who is 18-2 for 2025 according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. “I think a good grass-court player can move well. The ball can bounce a bit funny because of the grass, and you have to serve intelligently. 
 ""But in general, it is a surface on which I took a step forward last year and we will see how it goes this year.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","John Isner names the two players he really thought would win a French Open title but they never did","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/john-isner-names-the-two-players-he-really-thought-would-win-a-french-open-title-but-they-never-did/","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

For the last two decades, the French Open has been the hardest Grand Slam to capture for anyone not named Rafael Nadal. 

Between 2005 and 2025, there have only been seven years where someone other than Nadal has hoisted the Roland Garros title on Court Philippe Chatrier.

The most recent of which was this year, when Carlos Alcaraz defeated Jannik Sinner in a five-set thriller that lasted five hours and 29 minutes. 

Many have come agonisingly close to winning it all in Paris, including two players who retired American tennis player John Isner thought should have at least clinched the title once. 

On the Nothing Major Podcast, Isner said: “I was certain Dominic Thiem was going to win one and be the number one clay court player. But injuries held him back.”

Compatriot and former player Stevie Johnson replied: “I think it is Dominic Thiem. But I don't think he was ever going to win one in that era.

“I think he is an incredible clay-court player. Probably the second or third best ever, over the course of his career, but the guys he had to beat along the way, it was just never going to happen.”

Isner responded: “For me, I think it's [Guillermo] Coria. Didn't he have match points in the final, and he lost to Gaudio?

“I feel like Coria was so good on clay. He was never going to win the US Open or Wimbledon, but you thought if he was going to win something, he was going to win the French.”

Dominic Thiem enjoyed plenty of success on clay courts throughout his career, winning 10 titles on the surface, but never managed to emerge victorious at Roland Garros. 

The Austrian made two French Open finals, in 2018 and 2019, both times coming up against the 14-time champion Nadal. 

He was swept aside in straight sets by the Spaniard in 2018, and only managed to take a set off the king of clay the following year. 

In Guillermo Coria's case, the Argentine had just one appearance in the final of Roland Garros, which came in 2004, when he met countryman Gaston Gaudio. 

Coria was two sets up in the match, but saw his dream of winning a maiden Grand Slam title fade away as Gaudio completed a historic comeback to win the tournament.

In his defeat, the former world number three became the first man in the Open Era to lose a major final after having a match point. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The second grand slam of the year is ongoing at Roland-Garros. The 2025 French Open has reached the men's semifinals. Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. 2 Coco Gauff in the women's final this Saturday. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max.

Are you ready to watch the men's semis at the French Open? Here's how to follow all the action down on the clay courts at Roland-Garros.

Dates: May 25 - June 8

Time: Play starts daily at 5 a.m. ET

Location: Stade Roland-Garros

TV channel: TNT, truTV

Streaming: HBO Max

The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8.

Thanks to the time difference between the U.S. and France, the tennis tournament at Roland-Garros will start daily play at 5 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT.

In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max).

Disney

The Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle gets you exactly what it sounds like: access to Disney+, Hulu and Max. If you go ad-free ($29.99/month) you'll save up to 38% off compared to individually paying for all three services — and gain access to all French Open coverage. 

If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus.

 

While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. 

Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. 

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

By Chris Oddo | @TheFanChild  | Saturday June 14, 2025 

Jannik Sinner spent the last few days back home in Italy, barbecuing and playing ping pong with friends and family, before heading to Germany to begin his grass court season at Halle.



Though he said he had a “relaxed” time, Sinner admits that it wasn't exactly easy to keep from dwelling on the three championship points he had against Carlos Alcaraz in Sunday's Roland-Garros final for the ages in Paris.

Amazing Alcaraz! All the Milestones Cracked by Alcaraz After Epic RG Final 

“I had already a few sleepless nights, but I think every day it gets better,” Sinner said, according to the ATP. “It was for sure a tough loss. I still think about these couple of points, and it won't stop here – I know that.” Sinner says there are still plenty of positives to take from his clay-court season, and the final. “You can still see the positive side,” he said. “I've never played tennis on clay like this, I went to Rome, I made the final there, in Paris I made the final of a Grand Slam – Amazing – and then the level that [me and Carlos] have played was extremely high, so I was happy to be a part of this.”

Sinner says getting back to the challenge of grass and beginning his title defense in Halle might be best to help him take his mind off the shattering loss he suffered in the longest Roland-Garros final in history.

""I think that for me to play another tournament is positive, because every match is a new beginning, and I must be mentally ready to give my all on the court,” he said. “Therefore, it is great I can be here in Halle.”

Sinner, who won his lone grass-court title in Halle last year, owns a 21-9 lifetime record on the surface. He went 9-1 last year on the surface, losing only to Daniil Medvedev in the Wimbledon quarterfinals.

“The first practice session was OK,” he told the media. “I hadn't played since Paris, so my general feeling on the court was not so perfect, but I think today it will go better.

“I think a good grass-court player can move well. The ball can bounce a bit funny because of the grass, and you have to serve intelligently. But in general, it is a surface on which I took a step forward last year and we will see how it goes this year.”

Emma Raducanu has pulled out of next week's Berlin Open due to her ongoing back problems. 

The 22-year-old has been struggling with an issue in the build-up to Wimbledon, which begins in only two weeks time.

Raducanu was in action at Queens' over the last week, reaching the quarter-finals of the tournament and becoming British No.1.

However, after her defeat to Qinwen Zheng, in which she took a medical timeout, she was asked about her back issue.

She told the BBC: ""I've played five matches in a pretty short amount of time. 

""I'm probably feeling that, so I need to let the back rest and see how it goes from there.

""I'm not overly concerned that [the back issue] is something serious.

""But I know it's something that's very annoying and needs proper and careful management.""

Raducanu mentioned 'careful management' of her back in her interview, and she's now proceeding with caution ahead of Wimbledon. 

She has decided to remove herself from the Berlin Open, which gets started on Monday, to look after her injury.

It has been something she has been dealing with since competing in Strasbourg before the French Open began.

And now, rather than risking further damage, Raducanu is going to have a break and prioritise her recovery.

But there are some negative knock-on effects from that decision. 

Raducanu will now not be seeded at Wimbledon, as she will remain outside the top 32 in the WTA rankings. 

The Brit No.1 needed to win a couple more games at either Queens or the Berlin Open to rise from her spot in 37th. 

Following her loss in the quarter-finals in London and now her decision not to play in Germany, that's now not possible. 

That is a big blow for Raducanu, who would have wanted a seed in her home Grand Slam to use to her advantage. 

Seeded players are spread throughout the initial tournament draw, meaning they won't play each other too early. 

By missing out on a seed, Raducanu will now run the risk of being handed a tough draw against some of the best in the world. 

On top of that, her fitness will remain a doubt if this lingering back issue continues to pester her. 

That could throw her participation at Wimbledon into question too, with only two weeks until it begins.

Raducanu is reported to still be confident of featuring in the Eastbourne Open the week before Wimbledon though.

And she was seemingly focused on future events when speaking on Friday, following her Queens quarter-final loss.

""I've improved a lot and done a lot of good work behind the scenes, but there's a lot to go to get to the next level,"" she said. 

""They are stronger than I and have had more time training - I need to do the same. I need to raise my level.""

Heading into Wimbledon in 2011, Centre Court hadn't seen a champion not named Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal since 2002. 

Federer won five titles in a row at the All England Club from 2003 to 2007, and picked up his sixth in 2009 against Andy Roddick. 

Nadal emerged victorious in 2008 against the Swiss legend and clinched his second crown at the championships in 2010, defeating Tomas Berdych in the final. 

The second seed in 2011, Novak Djokovic, had won his second Australian Open that year and was looking to put an end to the Federer-Nadal dominance at Wimbledon. 

He did exactly that, triumphing over the Spaniard in the final over four sets to lift the trophy for the first time.

Following the victory, which saw him become the first Serbian in the Open Era to win the tournament, Djokovic was asked about competing with the two former champions.

In his post-match press conference, he was asked: “When you started to play really well, Federer and Nadal had the world divided and they owned the world basically.

“How difficult was it to break this, both personally, psychologically in your own mind, to be able to beat both these guys, and also just in general?”

Djokovic responded: “Well, we all know the careers of Nadal and Federer. We don't need to spend words again. They have been the two most dominant players in the world for the last five years. They have won most of the majors we are playing on. 

“So sometimes it did feel a little bit frustrating when you kind of get to the later stages of a Grand Slam, meaning last four, last eight, and then you have to meet them. They always come up with their best tennis when it matters the most. 

“But, look, you know, it's a process of learning, a process of developing and improving as a tennis player, as a person, and just finding the way to mentally overcome those pressures and expectations and issues that you have. 

“I always believed that I have quality to beat those two guys. I always believed I have quality to win majors, Grand Slams, and that was the only way I could be here in this position, you know. 

“I mean, I have full respect for those two guys, what they have done. Anytime I play them, I mean, it's a great match. But the mental approach has to be positive. You know, I have to win this match. There's no other way.”

Djokovic played Federer four times at Wimbledon throughout his career, the most recent of which was their 2019 clash in the final. 

Their first meeting at the championships was in the 2012 semi-final, which Federer won over four sets. 

Djokovic won their next three clashes in South West London, which all came in the final, beating the 20-time major champion in 2014, 2015 and 2019. 

Nadal has played the Serb at Wimbledon three times, in 2007, 2011, and once more in 2018. 

Djokovic won their bouts in the 2011 final and the 2018 semi-final, and was tied at one set each in their 2007 semi-final showdown, before he withdrew due to injury in the third set. 

In pursuit of a 25th Grand Slam title this year, Djokovic could equal Federer's record tally of eight Wimbledon championships, should he emerge  victorious this year. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Emma Raducanu is managing a back injury in the build up to Wimbledon; The new British No 1 was knocked out of Queen's in the quarter-finals by Qinwen Zheng; watch all the action from the ATP and WTA on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Saturday 14 June 2025 13:08, UK

Emma Raducanu will miss next week's Berlin Tennis Open as she continues to manage a back problem.

The 22-year-old has been struggling with the issue since competing in Strasbourg last month before the French Open and took an off-court medical timeout during her quarter-final loss to Qinwen Zheng at Queen's Club on Friday.

Speaking afterwards, Raducanu said: ""It's been lingering for the last few weeks, and I have had back issues before. I think it's just a vulnerability of mine. I know I need to take good care of it.

""I'm not overly concerned that it's something serious, but I know it's something that's very annoying and needs proper and careful management.""

Raducanu had elected to play in the German capital rather than Nottingham after being offered a wild card into the WTA 500 event, which is set to feature nine of the world's top 10.

But the former US Open champion will instead prioritise rest and recovery to ensure she is fully fit for Wimbledon.

Raducanu's decision means she will miss out on being seeded for her home grand slam but she is understood to be confident of playing in the Lexus Eastbourne Open the week before Wimbledon.

Tennis

Carlos Alcaraz, the reigning French Open and Wimbledon champion, is in the draw for the HSBC Championships at the Queen's Club in west London.

There had been doubts over his participation following last weekend's epic French Open final win, but Alcaraz confirmed his intention to play the event to the tournament Friday, and will give a news conference at Queen's Sunday afternoon. It is a boost for the event, which had already lost last year's finalists Tommy Paul and Lorenzo Musetti, as well as the 2022 champion Matteo Berrettini.

Paul and Musetti picked up abdominal and leg injuries at Roland Garros respectively, while Berrettini has not played since retiring from his match against Casper Ruud at last month's Italian Open in Rome because of an ongoing abdominal issue of his own.

Last Sunday, Alcaraz defeated Jannik Sinner to win his second French Open title, coming from two sets down for the first time to win a match that lasted five hours and 29 minutes — the second-longest final in Grand Slam history.

Alcaraz went on holiday to Ibiza, Spain following the final, as has become an annual post-Roland Garros tradition ahead of playing Queen's, which he won two years ago. Last year, he lost to Britain's Jack Draper in the second round. Alcaraz went on to claim the Wimbledon title in both of those years, and is sticking to that winning formula this year.

The men's event at Queen's begins on Monday June 16, and is one of the most high-profile Wimbledon warm-up events. As well as Alcaraz, former champions at the men's tournament include John McEnroe, Pete Sampras and Rafael Nadal.

It this year runs after the WTA Tour event, which is being held for the first time since 1973. Alcaraz will play compatriot Alejandro Davidovich-Fokina in the first round; Draper faces Jenson Brooksby of the U.S.

The second grand slam of the year is ongoing at Roland-Garros. The 2025 French Open has reached the men's semifinals. Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. 2 Coco Gauff in the women's final this Saturday. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max.

Are you ready to watch the men's semis at the French Open? Here's how to follow all the action down on the clay courts at Roland-Garros.

Dates: May 25 - June 8

Time: Play starts daily at 5 a.m. ET

Location: Stade Roland-Garros

TV channel: TNT, truTV

Streaming: HBO Max

The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8.

Thanks to the time difference between the U.S. and France, the tennis tournament at Roland-Garros will start daily play at 5 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT.

In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max).

Disney

The Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle gets you exactly what it sounds like: access to Disney+, Hulu and Max. If you go ad-free ($29.99/month) you'll save up to 38% off compared to individually paying for all three services — and gain access to all French Open coverage. 

If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus.

 

While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. 

Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. 

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

The 2025 Wimbledon men's and women's singles champions will earn the biggest cheque in Grand Slam history after the All England Club confirmed a huge increase in prize money.

The overall prize pot for the grass-court major is up by seven per cent from 2024 as a total of £53,5 million will be shared among those competing from the qualifying rounds until the finals.

In terms of the men's and women's singles champions, prize money will be boosted by a handsome 11 per cent while those who lose in the first round will earn 10 per cent more than they did 12 months ago.

Carlos Alcaraz and Marketa Vondrousova earned £2,700,000 after they won the titles, but this year's champions will receive £3,000,000, which is roughly US$4m, and it is the first time that the winners of a major will crack the £3m mark or the $4m in earnings.

The US Open came close to that mark in 2024 as champions were handed cheques of $3,600,000 (about £2,8m).

Wimbledon first broke the £1m mark for the singles winners' prize money in 2010, six years later it doubled to £2m and nine years later it will hit £3m, although it has to be remembered that prize money at all sporting events took a big blow during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Champion – £3,000,000 ($4,060,473)
Finalist – £1,520,000 ($2,057,306)
Semi-finalist – £775,000 ($1,048,955)
Quarter-finalist – £400,000 ($541,396)
R16 – £240,000 ($32,4837)
R32 – £152,000 ($205,730)
R64 – £99,000 ($133,995)
R128 – £66,000 ($89,330)

The increase in prize money comes just a few months after the top 20 highest-ranked players in the men's and women's game wrote a letter to the Grand Slams (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open) asking for a bigger share of revenue.

The likes of Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz, Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff and Iga Swiatek all signed the letter that stated the Grand Slam should increase prize money “to a more appropriate percentage of tournament revenues, reflective of the players' contribution to tournament value”.

Wimbledon women's favourite named by former British No 1 as Coco Gauff barrier revealed

Jannik Sinner must overcome his Carlos Alcaraz kryptonite if tennis' next great rivalry is to survive

All England chairperson Deborah Jevans says they are listening to concerns by players.

“The focus on just the prize money at four events, the Grand Slams, does not get to the heart of what the challenge is for tennis,” she said.

“The challenge with tennis is the fact that the players don't have an offseason which they want, they have increasing injuries that they're speaking about, and we've always said that we as Wimbledon are willing to engage and talk with the tours to try and find solutions, and that door remains open.”

So how does the 2025 Wimbledon prize money compare to this year's Australian Open and French Open, and the 2024 US Open?

Champion – $3,600,000 (£2,839,285)
Finalist – $1,800,000 (£1,419,642)
Semi-finalist – $1,000,000 (£788,690)
Quarter-finalist – $530,000 (£418,006)
R16 – $325,000 (£256,324)
R32 – $215,000 (£169,568)
R64 – $140,000 (£110,417)
R128 – $100,000 (£78,869)

Champion – A$3,500,000 (US$2,198,928/£1,752,853)

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Berlin Open: Emma Raducanu withdraws because of back injury","https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/articles/cj6rl3w82r8o","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 12:37:41 GMT","

Emma Raducanu won the US Open in 2021

Emma Raducanu will not play in the coming week's Berlin Open as she continues to manage a back problem.

The 22-year-old, who will regain her status as British number one on Monday, has been struggling with the issue since competing in Strasbourg last month before the French Open.

The former US Open champion took an off-court medical timeout during her quarter-final loss to Zheng Qinwen at Queen's on Friday.

""It's been lingering for the last few weeks, and I have had back issues before,"" she said.

""It's just a vulnerability of mine. I know I need to take good care of it.

""I need to let the back rest. [It] needs proper and careful management.""

Raducanu had opted to play in Berlin rather than Nottingham after being offered a wildcard for the WTA 500 event, which starts on Monday and is set to feature nine of the world's top 10 female players.

She will leapfrog Katie Boulter when the WTA rankings are updated.

Eastbourne takes place from 23-28 June and Wimbledon starts on 30 June.

Raducanu beat Jessica Pegula at Eastbourne last year to claim her first win over a top-10 player, before reaching the fourth round at Wimbledon.

The second grand slam of the year is ongoing at Roland-Garros. The 2025 French Open has reached the men's semifinals. Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. 2 Coco Gauff in the women's final this Saturday. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max.

Are you ready to watch the men's semis at the French Open? Here's how to follow all the action down on the clay courts at Roland-Garros.

Dates: May 25 - June 8

Time: Play starts daily at 5 a.m. ET

Location: Stade Roland-Garros

TV channel: TNT, truTV

Streaming: HBO Max

The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8.

Thanks to the time difference between the U.S. and France, the tennis tournament at Roland-Garros will start daily play at 5 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT.

In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max).

Disney

The Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle gets you exactly what it sounds like: access to Disney+, Hulu and Max. If you go ad-free ($29.99/month) you'll save up to 38% off compared to individually paying for all three services — and gain access to all French Open coverage. 

If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus.

 

While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. 

Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. 

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Wimbledon v French Open v Australian Open v US Open prize money as new milestone reached","https://www.tennis365.com/australian-open/wimbledon-v-french-open-v-australian-open-v-us-open-prize-money-new-milestone-reached","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 11:45:38 GMT","

The 2025 Wimbledon men's and women's singles champions will earn the biggest cheque in Grand Slam history after the All England Club confirmed a huge increase in prize money.

The overall prize pot for the grass-court major is up by seven per cent from 2024 as a total of £53,5 million will be shared among those competing from the qualifying rounds until the finals.

In terms of the men's and women's singles champions, prize money will be boosted by a handsome 11 per cent while those who lose in the first round will earn 10 per cent more than they did 12 months ago.

Carlos Alcaraz and Marketa Vondrousova earned £2,700,000 after they won the titles, but this year's champions will receive £3,000,000, which is roughly US$4m, and it is the first time that the winners of a major will crack the £3m mark or the $4m in earnings.

The US Open came close to that mark in 2024 as champions were handed cheques of $3,600,000 (about £2,8m).

Wimbledon first broke the £1m mark for the singles winners' prize money in 2010, six years later it doubled to £2m and nine years later it will hit £3m, although it has to be remembered that prize money at all sporting events took a big blow during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Champion – £3,000,000 ($4,060,473)
Finalist – £1,520,000 ($2,057,306)
Semi-finalist – £775,000 ($1,048,955)
Quarter-finalist – £400,000 ($541,396)
R16 – £240,000 ($32,4837)
R32 – £152,000 ($205,730)
R64 – £99,000 ($133,995)
R128 – £66,000 ($89,330)

The increase in prize money comes just a few months after the top 20 highest-ranked players in the men's and women's game wrote a letter to the Grand Slams (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open) asking for a bigger share of revenue.

The likes of Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz, Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff and Iga Swiatek all signed the letter that stated the Grand Slam should increase prize money “to a more appropriate percentage of tournament revenues, reflective of the players' contribution to tournament value”.

Wimbledon women's favourite named by former British No 1 as Coco Gauff barrier revealed

Jannik Sinner must overcome his Carlos Alcaraz kryptonite if tennis' next great rivalry is to survive

All England chairperson Deborah Jevans says they are listening to concerns by players.

“The focus on just the prize money at four events, the Grand Slams, does not get to the heart of what the challenge is for tennis,” she said.

“The challenge with tennis is the fact that the players don't have an offseason which they want, they have increasing injuries that they're speaking about, and we've always said that we as Wimbledon are willing to engage and talk with the tours to try and find solutions, and that door remains open.”

So how does the 2025 Wimbledon prize money compare to this year's Australian Open and French Open, and the 2024 US Open?

Champion – $3,600,000 (£2,839,285)
Finalist – $1,800,000 (£1,419,642)
Semi-finalist – $1,000,000 (£788,690)
Quarter-finalist – $530,000 (£418,006)
R16 – $325,000 (£256,324)
R32 – $215,000 (£169,568)
R64 – $140,000 (£110,417)
R128 – $100,000 (£78,869)

Champion – A$3,500,000 (US$2,198,928/£1,752,853)
Finalist – A$1,900,000 (US$1,193,704/£951,549)
Semi-finalist – A$1,100,000 (US$691,092/£550,897)
Quarter-finalist – A$665,000 (US$417,796/£333,042)
R16 – A$420,000 (US$263,871/£210,342)
R32 – A$290,000 ($182,197/£145,236)
R64 – A$200,000 ($125,653/£100,163)
R128 – A$132,000 ($82,931/£66,108)

June 14, 2025									


The French Open completed this past weekend with Coco Gauff of the United States (pictured above) and Carlos Alcaraz of Spain being victorious. However, there was one particular incident from watching the two-week grand slam tennis tournament that stands out the most. It is when Italy's Matteo Gigante tripped over the Lacoste advertising located at the back of the tennis court behind the baseline (also pictured above).
Gigante was not injured on the play, and ended up losing his third round match to two-time grand slam semifinalist and 13th seed Ben Shelton of the United States, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. Shelton, who reached the semifinals of the 2023 United States Open, and 2025 Australian Open, was without a doubt the better player. However, it is too bad the advertising on the court impacted the match.
I agree with the comments made by Jim Courier of TNT. Courier, who won the French Open in 1991 and 1992 (as well as the Australian Open in 1992 and 1993), was very critical of the French Open organizers of having Lacoste advertising on the court. Courier stated he was willing to “say Lacoste 10 times” if that was required to have the structures with their logo and name brand removed.
Not every comment Courier has said on television I agree with. However in this particular incident, he had the players's health in mind. In the future, tennis organizers need to be aware of what is placed on the tennis court. The safety of the players need to be top priority. Let's see what happens at next year's French Open.

Jack Draper is back on the grass at the HSBC Championships and back doing what he does best: hitting big.

The British lefty returns to the iconic ATP 500 event at Queen's Club at career-high No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings and seemingly on the cusp of his prime. Draper, who trained with countryman Billy Harris on Saturday lunchtime, offered fans in west London a glimpse of what they can expect throughout the week.

“He's always intense in his practice, ripping big forehands,” Harris told ATPTour.com after their session. “It makes you a bit sharper: You have to be ready for the ball coming through very quick. It's always good to sharpen yourself up against someone who's nailing the ball at you.”

A key aspect to Draper's ascent on the ATP Tour has been his adaptability and proven potential across all surfaces. The Londoner recorded his first wins over Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz on the grass at Queen's Club in 2021 and 2024, respectively, and won his first tour-level title on the same surface in Stuttgart 12 months ago.

This year, Draper triumphed at the hard-court ATP Masters 1000 in Indian Wells and backed it up with a run to the final on the Madrid clay. Yet while his ability to achieve success across all surfaces has been pivotal, Draper has also placed renewed emphasis on his strength and conditioning.

“He's built like a brick,” one astonished fan remarked after seeing Draper up close on Saturday.

With a booming lefty forehand, a devastatingly flat backhand and pinpoint accuracy on serve, Draper is able to do damage from anywhere on the court. But the 23-year-old is particularly potent on grass, where the power behind his shots are amplified by the speed of the surface.

“He's obviously shot up the rankings and is leading the way for British tennis, so it's always good to practise with him,” Harris added of Draper. “His serve on the grass is very, very dangerous, he's a perfect guy to prepare with.”

The second-seeded Draper opens his campaign against Jenson Brooksby, whom he leads 3-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, having recently defeated the American en route to the Indian Wells title.

Draper will hope to reignite fond memories from his time at Queen's Club, where he owns a 5-3 record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Competing as a 19-year-old wild card, Draper stunned third-seeded Sinner for his maiden tour-level match win in 2021 and returned to sink then-defending champion Alcaraz last year before falling to eventual winner Tommy Paul in the quarter-finals.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Sinner faces tough path to Halle title defence","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/halle-2025-draw-preview","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 13:14:32 GMT","

 Jannik Sinner's goal of bouncing back quickly from his Roland Garros final disappointment will not be an easy one to fulfil at the Terra Wortmann Open. 

 The top seed and defending champion will open against a qualifier at the grass-court ATP 500 in Halle. He could then face a fellow former titlist in each of his next two rounds. 

 The 2023 winner Alexander Bublik is a potential second-round opponent for Sinner, with the Kazakhstani taking on Alexandre Muller in his opener. The 2022 champion Hubert Hurkacz, who starts against seventh seed Tomas Machac, is a potential quarter-final opponent. 

 Sinner is bidding to quickly put behind him the memory of Roland Garros, where he held three championship points before falling to Carlos Alcaraz in last Sunday's final with another deep run on the Halle grass.

 The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner's potential semi-final opponents in Germany include fourth seed Andrey Rublev (who opens against a qualifier), eighth seed Karen Khachanov (who plays Zizou Bergs) and Felix Auger-Aliassime (who plays a qualifier). 

 Second seed Alexander Zverev, who reached the championship match in Halle in 2016 and 2017, will begin his latest campaign at OWL Arena against Marcos Giron. Zverev has won all three of the pair's previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings, including a straight-sets triumph on grass at Wimbledon last year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Taking a set off Sinner: How Schoolkate gained confidence from memorable clash","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/schoolkate-ilkley-challenger-2025-feature","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 13:23:03 GMT","

Out of Jannik Sinner's 20 matches this season, only four of his opponents have managed to win at least a set: Carlos Alcaraz, Holger Rune, Tommy Paul and Australian Tristan Schoolkate.


While Alcaraz is the only one who went on to beat the Italian, Rune and Paul are established in the Top 10, leaving World No. 131 Schoolkate as the outlier of the group.


The 24-year-old, who competes mainly on the ATP Challenger Tour, clashed against Sinner in the second round of the Australian Open. It was a memorable moment for Schoolkate, who had his home crowd's support throughout the four-set battle.


“It was obviously surreal,” Schoolkate told ATPTour.com at the Lexus Ilkley Open, an ATP Challenger Tour 125 event. “You can say ‘pinch-me moments'. As a kid, I watched so many matches on TV — Rod Laver Arena, just in awe. Then as I got older, I watched matches live there and of course you always want to be on that stage.”




Under the bright lights, Schoolkate showed flashes of his best level, rising to the occasion to take the opening set off the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. Sinner regrouped and went on to claim the title for the loss of just two sets. Meanwhile, Schoolkate would triumph in his next outing, the Brisbane Challenger, where the Aussie claimed his second title at that level.


“I always knew that the brand of tennis I can play and the level I can bring, it can trouble anyone and that was reiterated against the best player in the world,” Schoolkate said. “It gave me a lot of confidence.”


By going toe to toe with Sinner for nearly three hours, Schoolkate proved he could hold his own against one of the game's superstars.


“I just wanted to go out there and have a crack and show him something different too. I've obviously watched a lot of tennis and he hadn't watched too much of mine, but I've just seen so many guys just getting chopped up by him,” Schoolkate said.


“There's a reason why he's ranked number one and I'm ranked 130, 140. He's able to hold his best level and his quality of tennis for a longer period of time and his highest level is better than mine. Of course there's aspects of your game that maybe get shown out.”

A native of Perth, Schoolkate began playing tennis at age four alongside his father, Peter, a tennis coach who relocated to the Netherlands last year.


The 24-year-old grew up playing primarily on grass at the Claremont Lawn Tennis Club, located less than three kilometres from the picturesque shores of the Indian Ocean. Now competing amidst the Challenger grass-court swing, Schoolkate's background on the surface particularly makes him a tricky opponent during this portion of the season.


“He [my dad] taught me most of my technique and we played a lot,” said Schoolkate, who will be competing in Wimbledon qualifying later this month. “A lot of it was to do with coming forward, hitting volleys and using different parts of the courts and trying to have a pretty whole game where I obviously play at the baseline, try to come forward.”


Schoolkate is aiming to make the leap to the ATP Tour, a transition he has seen many of his peers make. Even the sport's best players, such as Sinner, who won three Challenger titles in 2019, have had to first prove themselves on the ATP Challenger Tour.




“The level is so close and you can see that week in, week out,” Schoolkate said. “When I started playing Challengers, I remember seeing [Tallon] Griekspoor and [Jack] Draper, they went on a tear on the Challenger Tour and sure enough, now they've cemented themselves right at the top of the game. That's just two examples.


“Obviously last year I think the biggest example for me was [Giovanni] Mpetshi Perricard. I saw him a lot and I just felt like he was playing unreal and he kept winning and then a few months later he was 30 in the world.”


As Schoolkate reflects on that match against Sinner in Melbourne, he recalls the powerful moment of looking up at his player's box and seeing family, coaches and others who have invested in his journey. While he was soaking in the experience, he was also sharing it with his loved ones. That mindset of holding onto his childhood dreams is something Schoolkate always carries with him.


“I try to keep that enjoyment and remember the little kid that enjoyed coming to net and hitting drop shots and watching the best guys in the world play on TV,” Schoolkate said. “And then trying to live those moments out myself.”

The usual competitive order was shaken up on the first day of running for the Canadian Grand Prix as both Red Bull drivers found it a challenge to keep pace with their rivals, while Max Verstappen expressed a belief that his performance regressed across the sessions.

After finishing FP1 in top spot just ahead of the Williams pair of Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz, the Dutchman slid down the timesheets to ninth place by the end of second practice, over half a second adrift of pace-setter George Russell.

Some of the attention coming into the weekend still lingered on Verstappen's reaction and penalty for his collision with the Briton in Spain, with Team Principal Christian Horner revealing that the driver issued an apology to the team during their post-race debrief.

But the cooler conditions that Canada offers have thrown up other difficulties for Red Bull as Verstappen lamented over the radio: “When the brakes are cold, it doesn't bite – it's worse than FP1”. Like many others, he struggled to find the necessary grip and was seen cutting the final chicane numerous times during FP2.

Verstappen ‘lost something with the car' between FP1 and FP2

“The day was alright to be honest,” he said. “I felt quite happy with the car. FP2 was a bit more difficult for other reasons – I think we lost something with the car balance-wise that we need to investigate, but overall I think it was quite a positive day for us.

“If we can get it back to how it felt in FP1, I think we look quite okay. Let's see tomorrow – there's still one more session where people can get it right. For us, we just want to get it in a good window and then we'll see how far we are up there in Qualifying.”

HIGHLIGHTS: Catch the action as Russell tops second practice in Canada


In contrast to previous rounds, there was no clear team out at the front following the first two practice sessions – drivers from Mercedes, Red Bull, McLaren and Williams all broke into the top three without establishing an obvious favourite for Qualifying.

While Verstappen seemed assured that they could still be in the fight for the higher positions, Tsunoda held the more low-key ambition of progressing to the final stage of Qualifying, a feat he has not achieved since the Miami Grand Prix.

Tsunoda has so far struggled to close the gap to Verstappen

As the track evolved, everyone's lap times improved between FP1 and FP2, but the Japanese driver dropped back from P11 to P15 with a 0.273s deficit to his team mate in the latter session.

However, he hinted at a potential change to the car that will be implemented for the remainder of the weekend and hopefully help him return to the top 10.

“I think the feeling was okay,” Tsunoda said. “I know there's something coming for tomorrow which is good – that will hopefully give me a bit of free lap time.

“Other than that, I think it was good progress in terms of set-up but obviously not enough in the end. I definitely have to be in Q3, that's the target. Let's see how it goes.”

The seven-member boy group also reflect on growing alongside their music and fans from their 2020 debut to present day: “We don't consider ourselves 100 percent perfect even now.”


							By 

	Nicole Fell



K-pop stars Enhypen are in the middle of a banner year. 


	Back with their sixth EP, Desire : Unleash, the seven-member boy group under Hybe's Belift Lab made their Coachella debut in April and are preparing to head out on a world tour across North America and Europe.




	Enhypen — comprised of members Jungwon, Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo and Ni-ki — were formed through the music survival show I-Land. The show, a joint venture between Hybe and Korean entertainment giant CJ ENM, aired on the CJ ENM-owned channel Mnet in South Korea.

	On the latest album, the group, unsurprisingly, explores desire in all its forms. Their lead single, “Bad Desire (With or Without You)” is endlessly catchy and sonically in line with past releases. The otherworldly music video starts with a chilling voiceover: “Did you really think I could just stand by and watch you disappear?” Enhypen's lore — the storyline that has unraveled throughout their career — leans supernatural, specifically vampiric, in nature, and “Bad Desire” continues that through-line.


	Below, Enhypen shares the inspiration behind the album, what their Coachella experience was like and what they're planning for their upcoming world tour.  


What's the concept behind Desire : Unleash, and why are you all so excited about the release? 


JUNGWON Just as the title implies, the overarching theme and concept is desire. To elaborate a little bit on our lead single (“Bad Desire”), there can be various forms of desire, right? I think one of them could be how you want to be equal to the person that you're in love with. This song revolves around the concept of that and the struggles and internal conflicts that comes with love.


Does anyone have a favorite song on the album?












JAKE “Loose.” It's a very good song. With the weather getting very hot, I think it's a good song to listen to when you're feeling a bit too hot. It makes you more relaxed and makes you cooler. It's a very nice, light and breezy song.


SUNOO “Flashover” is my favorite. The song itself is just really uplifting. I get very hyped when I listen to it, and I just think it's the perfect opening track to kick the album off.


“Outside” is a really fun track. Can you tell me a bit more about the song? 


JAKE “Outside” has a very tense and very strong baseline, which is I think is very unique and very appealing. I feel like it's a very hip hop style song. We haven't done that before. We've done hip hop style songs before, but I think this one is very unique and it's even more deep. It's a great song that we decided to put on the album because we felt like the energy of the song and the style of the song suits the whole theme of Desire very well.


Jay, what was it like getting to produce and play guitar on “Helium?” 


JAY This was an opportunity that I have been training for ever since our debut, so I'm really grateful for it. I'm especially proud and happy that I got to write a song for the group. I really put every bit of my last effort into this and the recording went really smoothly. The outcome also came out very beautifully. I'm very happy and proud of the results.

	











What was the experience of performing at Coachella like? Were there any moments that stood out?


JAY We prepared very hard for the performance. It was a tricky performance. There were some weather issues, but I believe just every moment of it was a great experience and it enabled us to grow further as artists.


Do you feel you learned anything about yourself as a performer during your sets? At a big festival like that, there can be technical difficulties or extreme weather conditions that you can't control. 


JAKE The technical difficulties, like you said, it's something that the group and our team can prepare for prior to the performance. Other than that, being up on stage, I feel like we all felt something different because Coachella itself is a very well-known stage that a lot of artists dream about playing, and it really was more than expected. The energy, the vibe and the crowd were very different to what we were used to, but in a very good way. Just performing there was very fun, very exciting [to be] walking around, seeing everyone. We actually got to watch Post Malone's set the day after our performance. Overall, we had a great time.


Was there anyone else that you saw and you enjoyed?


JUNGWON I watched the show for about two hours straight the day before we went on the stage. The artists that left the biggest impression on me were Benson Boone and Tyla. Their live vocals were just so impeccable [that] I thought they were playing the [studio version].

	











JAKE We also watched Lisa.


JUNGWON We really wanted to be there for her show, but it was the day before, so we were really sad that we couldn't go, but we saw Lisa's performance as well online.


You're preparing to head to the U.S. this summer for your world tour. What can fans expect? 


HEESEUNG I think it's been a while since our last U.S. tour, and we're really excited to go and meet the Engenes and in each state. We're super excited for their enthusiasm. I know that they're also very excited, and I just hope that we'll be there In no time.


Is there a song in particular you're excited to perform this time around? 


NI-KI We prepared a lot of rearrangements for this tour. The set list features a lot of rearranged songs. I'm particularly excited for “Pass the Mic” [“Future Perfect (Pass the Mic)”] because during other shows fans loved it. We had a great time performing it at Coachella as well. I'm really excited for the U.S. fans to see it and watch it in person.


When we spoke last year, you said you felt you were at a turning point as a group. How do you feel currently?


SUNGHOON We definitely believe this album is coming at a very important time. Of course, every single new album or new release is important to us, but this one in particular comes at a very important point in time. We're standing at a critical juncture. That's why it holds a very special place in our heart, and I believe this will mark a milestone in our career where the before and after are very different. I believe there has to be a difference as we go forward.

	











Your trajectory as a group is really interesting. You've grown alongside your music, but you've also grown up alongside your fans, Engenes. What has that experience been like?


JUNGWON I believe we are a rather unique case because we debuted through an audition program. We don't consider ourselves 100 percent perfect even now. Back then, likewise, we weren't fully perfected as a new group. On the bright side, I think that gave us a great opportunity to share this growth journey with our fans. They were with us every step of the way. In the past, we used to have some what ifs about our debut. Looking back, I think it was a great opportunity for us to form a tighter bond with our fans. Like I said, we don't believe that we are 100 percent perfect even now. We just want to continue on communicating and connecting with our fans and sharing this growth journey with them as we go forward. I just hope that this beautiful relationship will last further into the future.

The final show of j-hope's ""HOPE ON THE STAGE"" world tour coincided with the 12th anniversary of BTS' debut.

	Billboard Korea


All seven members of BTS reunited in person at j-hope's solo concert, marking the group's long-awaited return as a complete unit.

The emotional highlight of the evening came when Jin and Jung Kook surprised fans by joining j-hope onstage, creating unforgettable moments for those in attendance.

Held Friday (June 13) at the Goyang Sports Complex Main Stadium in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, the final show of j-hope's “HOPE ON THE STAGE” world tour encore coincided with the 12th anniversary of BTS' debut — making the night even more meaningful for both the group and its global fandom, ARMY.

Jung Kook made a surprise appearance during j-hope's solo track “i wonder…,” instantly sending the crowd into a frenzy. His unexpected entrance electrified the atmosphere, and fans responded with roaring cheers. “I really missed you,” he told the audience with a bright smile, before launching into a powerful performance of his solo hit “Seven,” drawing an explosive response.

Later in the show, Jin took the stage during the encore segment. After performing BTS' beloved hit “Spring Day” alongside j-hope, Jin continued with a moving performance of his second solo EP's title track, “Don't Say You Love Me.” The emotional momentum continued as Jung Kook returned to the stage, joining Jin and j-hope for a special unit performance of “Jamais Vu,” closing the evening on a high note.

While Jin and Jung Kook took the stage, RM, Jimin, V and SUGA were spotted in the audience, watching the show and cheering their bandmate on. “I was singing while looking at my members,” j-hope told the crowd, expressing his deep affection for the group.

Jung Kook later added, “I was so nervous backstage. I'm here today because of my members. It felt overwhelming to stand in front of our fans again.”

This show also marked the first live performance of j-hope's new post-military track “Killin' It Girl” featuring GloRilla, signaling the start of a new chapter in his solo journey.

The stadium was filled with fans from both Korea and around the world, who came together to witness the long-awaited full group reunion. As all seven members reunited at j-hope's concert, the moment served as a powerful reminder of BTS' enduring unity and connection with their fans.

BTS officially kicked off its offline event 2025 BTS FESTA on Friday (June 13) at Halls 9 and 10 of KINTEX Exhibition Center 2 in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, in celebration of the group's 12th debut anniversary. Running for two days from June 13 to 14, this year's FESTA features a variety of hands-on experiences designed especially for their fandom, ARMY.

The theme for this year's FESTA is Twelve O'Clock, symbolizing the beginning of a new chapter and hinting at the group's imminent full-group return. BTS members Jin and j-hope introduced the concept in the YouTube segment BTS News released in early June, marking their first official appearance in a while.

The event is open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m KST, with last entry allowed until 6 p.m. Admission is available for fans age 9 and above; children under 9 are not permitted to enter, regardless of parental accompaniment.

From early in the morning, countless fans holding ARMY Bomb light sticks gathered at the venue, filling the KINTEX exhibition halls. Long lines quickly formed in front of the most popular interactive zones.

The venue includes more than 20 interactive zones. Below, we have a closer look at a few of the zones.

1. ARMY BOMB PHOTO SPOT & WHALE PHOTO SPOT

Two large-scale installations greet fans as they enter: the ARMY BOMB PHOTO SPOT and the WHALE PHOTO SPOT, both inspired by BTS' signature motifs.

2. LIGHT SHOW

Beginning at noon, a five-minute light show takes place every hour on the hour, utilizing the synchronized ARMY Bomb light sticks to create a breathtaking visual spectacle. Widely praised by fans and media alike, the light show transformed the venue into an emotionally charged atmosphere and was hailed as one of the major highlights of the event.

3. VOICE ZONE

The Voice Zone offers an emotional connection as fans listen to voice messages recorded by BTS members specifically for the 2025 FESTA. These messages carry deeper meaning as the members participated directly in scripting them.

4. BTS LOCKER

BTS Locker presents personalized displays curated by each member, offering a look into their tastes, personalities, and memories.

5. TROPHY ZONE

The Trophy Zone commemorates BTS's historic milestones. The display includes 50 trophies, from their first rookie award at the 5th Melon Music Awards in 2013 to their first music show win on KBS2's Music Bank in 2015, and their first international honor at the Billboard Music Awards in 2017. Awards received by ARMY, such as the iHeartRadio Music Awards' “Best Fan Army,” are also on display, reflecting the shared journey of the group and its fans.

6. COLORING WALL

The Coloring Wall, where fans filled in a large white artwork outline, was a participatory art zone at the 2025 BTS FESTA. Fans added their own colors and personal touches to the mural, contributing to its creation while covering the wall with heartfelt messages of support for BTS.

With an array of immersive experiences and engaging attractions tailored for fans, the 2025 BTS FESTA proved to be more than just a celebration — it was a heartfelt tribute to BTS's legacy and their long-awaited return as a full group.

BIGHIT MUSIC stated, “We are sincerely grateful to ARMY for the unwavering love and support for BTS,” adding, “To better accommodate visitors, we have significantly expanded the event in terms of venue, content, and operations compared to previous years. We are doing our utmost to ensure that all attendees can enjoy a safe and meaningful experience.”

The Motown singer says his former housekeepers' strategy is to ""let the lawsuit linger publicly"" until he gives in to an extortionate $100 million settlement demand.

	Rachel Scharf



Smokey Robinson claims in a new court filing that the former housekeepers suing him for rape are trying to slow-walk the lawsuit to gain maximum leverage for an extortionate settlement payout, including by dealing a financial blow to the Motown legend's ongoing tour.


	Lawyers for the 85-year-old singer made this argument in a Thursday (June 12) motion to require the deposition of one of the four anonymous former housekeepers who allege he forced them to have sex at his Los Angeles-area home dozens of times over nearly two decades. Robinson adamantly denies the claims and has countersued the women for extortion, defamation and elder abuse.


	Robinson's attorney, Christopher Frost, says in the new court filing that the housekeepers are refusing to participate in evidence collection. He claims that the women's lawyer, John Harris, allegedly informed him that he wants to delay all discovery until they've litigated a motion to strike Robinson's counterclaims, a lengthy process that could take months.


	Frost claims the housekeepers, who he says demanded $100 million from Robinson and his wife Frances before suing them both in May, are doing so as a tactic to maximize settlement leverage. According to the motion, this strategy is aimed at cutting into profits from Robinson's ongoing international tour celebrating the 50th anniversary of his album A Quiet Storm.


	“Plaintiffs have effectively conceded that their intention was to file a salacious lawsuit, do nothing to prosecute it, neuter the Robinsons' ability to defend themselves, and let the lawsuit linger publicly while the Robinsons have to live every day under the unfair specter of public opinion and while Mr. Robinson's tour is negatively affected,” Frost writes.


	“This plays into plaintiffs and cross-defendants' strategy to exact leverage on Mr. and Ms. Robinson,” Frost adds. “The longer Mr. Robinson's livelihood is harmed, the more pressure there is for the Robinsons to give in to plaintiffs' and cross-defendants' extortionate demands.”


	Frost is asking for a court order requiring one of the four housekeepers, identified in court filings as “Jane Doe 2,” to sit for a deposition at his Los Angeles law office within two weeks of the motion being heard. Frost says the women should also foot the bill for nearly $5,000 in legal fees the Robinsons have run up bringing this motion.


	“If plaintiffs and cross-defendants are not sanctioned for their abusive behavior, they will expect that they can continue this behavior during the pendency of this case, which will only create more delays and more motion practice,” writes Frost. “The utilization of this strategy must be nipped in the bud.”


	The housekeepers' lawyers released a statement on Friday (June 13) calling Robinson's motion to compel a “calculated effort to misuse the discovery process in a manner that is both retaliatory and chilling.” 


	“By singling out Jane Doe 2 for a compelled deposition at this early stage, the defendant is engaging in a broader strategy of harassment and coercion — an attempt to retraumatize a survivor of sexual violence under the guise of lawful process,” said attorneys John Harris and Herbert Hayden. “This motion is not about truth-seeking; it is about exerting power. It should be recognized for what it is: a transparent attempt to chill participation in this case and deter other survivors from coming forward. We remain steadfast in defending her rights and will hold the Robinsons accountable for any effort to subvert those rights through abusive and vexatious litigation tactics.”


	In addition to the civil lawsuit, the former Robinson housekeepers have also filed a police report against the singer. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is now investigating the women's sexual assault claims.


This story was updated on June 13 at 11:22 p.m. ET to add a statement from the plaintiffs' lawyers.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are undergoing another internal shuffle within their team.


	Four of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex‘s employees have recently parted ways with the royal couple after Meredith Maines (Google, Hulu, American Idol) came on as their first chief communications officer earlier this year, Deadline can confirm.


	Among the departed staffers are LA-based deputy press secretary Kyle Boulia and UK press officer Charlie Gipson, both of whom were hired last March. These four are the most recent exits from their team. Since stepping back from royal duties, reports suggest at least 22 people have left their team, with six in the last two months.

	











	Harry and Meghan previously took on Emily Robinson (Netflix) as their director of communications, along with a team from Method Communications. Markle also hired Bill Gates' former assistant Sarah Fosmo as her first chief of staff last month.

	Last year, their global press secretary and head of communications Ashley Hansen departed to launch her own firm, bringing Harry and Meghan on as clients. Meanwhile, the Duke of Sussex's chief of staff Josh Kettler also exited following a trial period.

Justin Baldoni Fracas, Actress' Lawyer Says In Pitch For Protective Order","https://deadline.com/2025/06/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-taylor-swift-protective-order-1236433866/","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 00:05:00 GMT","


					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


Blake Lively doesn't want anyone, especially Justin Baldoni, to know what she and Taylor Swift text, email or talk about – and the Another Simple Favor actress wants a federal judge to guarantee the pals' privacy.


	“Blake Lively respectfully submits this letter motion for a protective order regarding the Wayfarer Parties' continuing demands for Ms. Lively's communications with Taylor Swift (made again yesterday), which they have pursued at the same time they have refused to produce to Ms. Lively the documents they publicly claimed to have received as part of a deal to withdraw their subpoenas to Ms. Swift and her counsel,” declares a letter submitted to Judge Lewis J. Liman today from Lively lawyer Esra A. Hudson of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. “Good cause exists for this request because it has been the Wayfarer Parties' tactic since August 2024 to make Ms. Swift and her fan base central to their media strategy against Ms. Lively.” 

	











	It was the attorney's latest against Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, execs and publicists.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In case you don't know the point Hudson is making — after a big win for Lively, Ryan Reynolds, their publicist Leslie Sloane and The New York Times earlier this week — she makes it perfectly clear: “Ms. Swift is not central to Ms. Lively's claims (unlike dozens of other witnesses she identified who the Wayfarer Parties have largely ignored), and is otherwise irrelevant to the Wayfarer Parties' claims, which were dismissed on June 9.”

	











	Godmother to one of Lively and Reynold's children, Swift's name has been bandied about in what is now a multi-lawsuit, multimillion-dollar battle between the It Ends With Us stars almost since Lively filed her sexual harassment and retaliation complaint against Baldoni and his inner circle with the California Civil Rights department on December 20. Escalating rapidly, the action saw more legal actions and then Lively herself filing an official suit against Baldoni and the Wayfarer gang on New Year's Eve – followed by a $400 million defamation and extortion suit from Baldoni against Lively, Deadpool star Reynolds and Sloane. That complaint, dismissed by Judge Liman on June 9 with leave for the greatly trimmed amended complaint to be filed by June 23, had an intimidating cameo by Swift at a creative meeting between Lively and Baldoni at the former's NYC apartment.


	Sweetening the pot of sorts, Baldoni lawyers last month served a subpoena on Swift and her attorneys at Venables.


	Almost immediately, a rep for Swift, who contributed a song for the It Ends With Us soundtrack for friend Lively, bluntly called out the subpoena as being “designed to use Taylor Swift's name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.” After attracting the kind of media attention usually reserved for the Second Coming or a Beyoncé or Swift tour announcement, Baldoni's Bryan Freedman-led lawyers on May 22 withdrew the paperwork seeking information from Swift about what she knew about what occurred with Lively and Wayfarer Studios co-founder Baldoni on the domestic violence themed IEWU.

	End of Swift story?


	Not really, as word on the street was the Baldoni parties dropped the subpoena because they got what they needed voluntarily.


	Today, Lively lawyer Hudson says that, in fact, never happened. “The purpose was not to obtain discovery but rather press reports is consistent with the statements by counsel to Ms. Swift that they have not produced any materials to the Wayfarer Parties,” the attorney notes in a footnote to today's correspondence. To that, the letter today to Judge Liman includes a May 22 email to Freedman, Lively attorneys and others from Swift lawyer Doug Baldridge on the subpoena being scuttled, stating “no documents are being produced, and no deposition is being scheduled.”


	Reps for Baldoni had no comment Friday on the Lively lawyer letter to Judge Liman.


	As has been the norm in this back and forth in the media and the courts, Lively's reps had something to say today.


	Despite the drama of this week, including subpoenas against Swift foil and Baldoni PR investor Scooter Braun and HYBE America, there are still no talks of a settlement between the Lively and Baldoni camps. Yet, with a March 9 trial getting closer every day, that might change as exit strategies come into focus.


	In the end it could be a case of, to quote Taylor Swift, “look what you made me do.”

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


Updated Saturday AM: Universal‘s How to Train Your Dragon is still on course for a similar opening to what we spotted yesterday, now at $82.7M, but the real story with this live-action movie, as Nancy pointed out in the preview, is the overseas gross. The global start on Dean DeBlois' latest is $200.3M, which is the fourth best of the year behind only A Minecraft Movie, Lilo & Stitch and Ne Zha 2. The live-action take of the 2014 animated toon gets its fourth straight A CinemaScore. Also, at $82.7M, that's the third best opening for a Marc Platt production behind Wicked ($112.5M) and The Little Mermaid ($95.5M).

	











	Meanwhile, A24's Dakota Johnson-Chris Evans-Pedro Pascal romcom, The Materialists, is posting the distributor's third highest opening ever at $12M, behind Civil War ($25.5M) and Hereditary ($13.5M). Sources consider this result another win for rom-coms after Ticket to Paradise‘s $16.5M and Anyone But You‘s $6M (remember, that opened before Christmas and legged out to a near 15x multiple to $88M+). CinemaScore is B-, and that's likely because moviegoers are arguing over who Johnson winds up with at the end of the film. Among rom-coms of late, Materialists in regards to CinemaScore ranks behind Ticket to Paradise (A-) and Anyone But You (B+). In Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits, Materialists is 50%.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The marketplace at an estimated $150M is down from a year ago by -30% because that's when Pixar/Disney's Inside Out 2 debuted to a massive $154M, driving a $213.9M marketplace. The good news is that we're up +33% over last weekend's $113M (per Comscore). Look, this is as good as it gets for a family IP such as How to Train Your Dragon. There's plenty of buzz in the exits. Arguably, the market is not in a funk. BTW, wait until you catch Sony's Danny Boyle threequel 28 Years Later — you don't know what's coming.

	











HTTYD is playing strong in the middle of the country, with Imax and PLFs contributing 38% of the weekend's ticket sales and 18% coming from 3D. PostTrak positive score is 94% with general audiences and 83% definite recommend with kids under 12 giving 95% and a 64% must see right away. Diversity demos are 49% Caucasian, 24% Latino and Hispanic, 11% Asian American and 8% Black. Mom skewing at 63%, which is no surprise considering that they determine when the family heads to the movies, with a 56% female leaning in the overall general demo. Millennial-heavy turnout here ala Lilo & Stitch with 68% under 35 (in fact, Lilo was heavier at 79% under 35). Women under 25 who showed up at 28% gave the pic its best grades at 97%, while women over 25 at 28% loved it at 95%, men over 25 showed up at 25% and graded it a 92% while men under 25 at 19% gave Dragon an 89%. AMC's Disney Springs in Orlando is currently the top grossing venue in the nation with over $102K.


Materialists is 69% positive, 3 stars in PostTrak exits. A big turnout by women at 74%, 69% under 35. The female audience for this movie is largely watching it with their friends at 51% (meaning anywhere from one friend to five) versus making it a date night (21%). Women over 25 showed the biggest turnout at 53%, but also the hardest grade at 68%. Women overall are recommending at 50%, which is alright, not stupendous. Materialists is playing best on the coasts with AMC Century City the top grossing venue stateside with north of $40K.


	A third of the audience came for Johnson per PostTrak while 43% came for either Pascal or Evans. Forty percent of the audience came for the trio as a whole. Celine Song also had some pull as 22% of ticketholders cited the filmmaker as a reason for attending. With 57% buying their tickets same day, that's an indication of walk-up business.

	A24's Materialists is also ahead of projections with $12M in third place at 2,844 theaters after a $5M Friday (that includes $1.5M in previews).

Updated Friday AM: Universal is reporting $8.6M for last night's previews at 3,200 sites for How to Train Your Dragon and when Wednesday early access screenings are included that number rises to $11.1M. Excellent start. Similar to Lilo & Stitch, there's a lot of millennial love for How to Train Your Dragon. The Dean DeBlois directed family epic is booked at 4,356 theaters this weekend including all premium upcharge formats.


	A24's Materialists from Celine Song is off to a great start with $1.5M in Thursday previews at 2,844 locations. That figure isn't that far from Luca Guadagnino's Challengers ($1.9M previews, $15M opening). The Dakota Johnson-Pedro Pascal-Chris Evans movie stands at 77% with Rotten Tomatoes audiences (audiences may be divided in Johnson's choice of dudes in the film) with critics making heart eyes with 87% certified fresh. Outlook for Materialists was $7M-$8M. There's hope especially after last night that it's bound to be better. Previews for Materialists are also ahead of Universal's George Clooney-Julia Roberts romcom Ticket to Paradise which did $1.1M on its way to a $16.5M start. Materialists cost around $20M before P&A. 


	Rest of the week went down as follows:


	1.) Lilo & Stitch (Dis) 4,185 theaters, Thu $2.8M (-14% from Wed), Wk $47.5M (-44%), Total $350.8M/Wk 3


	2.) Ballerina (LG) 3,409 theaters, Thu $1.3M (-15%), Wk $32.4M/Wk 1 For its Monday through Thursday stretch, Ballerina made $7.9M, which is $1M more than Mission: Impossible 8 over the same frame this past week ($6.9M). On Wednesday, each film made $1.5M. 


	3.) Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning (Par) Thu $1.27M (-16%), Wk $21.7M (-44%), Total $156M/Wk 3


	4.) Karate Kid: Legends (Sony) 3,859 theaters, Thu $705K (-14%), Wk $12.3M (-54%), Total $39.1M/Wk 2


	5. Final Destination: Bloodlines (NL) 2,867 theaters, Thu $642K (-16%), Wk $9.6M (-40%), Total $126.7M/Wk 4


PREVIOUS EXCLUSIVE: Universal's live action take of DreamWorks Animation's How to Train Your Dragon is eyeing around $8M-$9M in Thursday previews. As we always say, these are industry estimates, so they could fluctuate by the time Universal reports in the morning. The studio didn't return request for comment on what we were spotting.


	While early week projections were $65M-$75M, exhibition has been pushing this one in hopes they can wrangle a $100M opening. We could use more of those this summer post Memorial Day weekend.  


	The audience score on Rotten Tomatoes for this Dean DeBlois directed movie (he did the original animated trilogy) is an epic 99% with critics at 77% certified fresh (that's a little higher than Lilo & Stitch‘s 72% fresh; that pic's audience score settling at 93%). Previews began today at 2PM.

	Hands down, How to Trian Your Dragon‘s early money is ahead of the third animated pic, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World ($3M previews, $55M opening) and it's also ahead of How to Train Your Dragon 2‘s $2M in cash (that sequel released by 20th Century Fox when DWA had their distribution deal there) which turned into a $49.4M 3-day opening. 


	The How to Train Your Dragon trilogy of movies have grossed close to $1.7 billion at the global box office.

Kylie Minogue has announced the cancellation of four of her upcoming shows after being struck down with illness.


	The Australian perennial chart-topper has been performing on her Tension tour to sell-out crowds in the UK, but has been forced to abort four imminent European dates after coming down with laryngitis – inflammation of the vocal chords and voice box.


	The Tension Tour is her first global one in seven years, and the 16th in her long career. She was due to perform in Berlin on Monday, followed by concerts in Poland, Lithuania and Estonia. However, she announced Friday on X:

Since the August 2024 birth of his son, Jack Blues Bieber, Justin Bieber has shared pictures of the youngster a few times. He did so again on June 13, 2025, posting two different sets of snaps to his Instagram page.

The “Holy” singer and his wife, Hailey Bieber, have continued to keep their tot's face hidden, and the newly released pictures only show the baby's upper body and hands. The adorable infant was dressed in an oversized gray sweatshirt.

But what really grabbed fans attention was what the popstar wrote in the caption. 

The caption on the first post reads “Ay bay bay” along with a middle finger emoji. The second series of pictures is captioned more simply, as the singer simply left the same emoji again.

Two days before sharing the new baby pics, Justin Bieber let his followers in on a memory from what he called “my first real make out sesh.” He said the smooching went down at a seventh grade dance, and happened to the tune of the song “How to Save a Life” by The Fray.

The heartthrob used the song as background music for a post promoting his new brand, SKYLRK. He showed off a set of shades in crisp white packaging, and a collection of plush-looking neon slides.

The “Mistletoe” singer previously hinted at a feud with the people running his former brand, Drew House. A People report says sources called the move “a slap in the face to all the people who had been working hard on the next Drew House release.

Bieber implored people to stay away from the brand in a post which read, “If you're rocking with me the human Justin Bieber don't waste ur money on Drew House.” He did not elaborate on where things between himself and the fashion label went sour.

A TMZ report from Thursday shows the star calling out photographers outside the Soho House in Malibu. The musician complained “You'll take this video out of context like you always do,” before adding, “You think I'm an idiot bro.”

As the standoff continued, Bieber exclaimed, “You're confusing my anger for disrespect. You don't get to disrespect me and get away with it. 

Dressed in a blue oversized hoodie and baggy pants, the Ontario native shielded his face from the flashes at several points.

Country star and “American Idol” alum Lauren Alaina is a first-time mom! The singer shared an emotional post on June 13, 2025, to reveal that she and her husband, Cam Arnold, had welcomed their baby girl — Beni Doll Arnold — on the morning of June 11. 

“The right words are hard to find to describe how parts of my heart that I didn't even knew existed were unlocked at 8:44 am when they laid you on my belly for the first time,” Alaina wrote, captioning a phot of the three of them at the hospital. “I will never be the same.”

“You, to your dad and me, are absolute perfection,” Alaina continued. “We are honored God chose us to be your parents. Thank you to everyone for all of the love, prayers and support for our precious daughter.”

In addition to sharing emotional details about the timing of baby Beni's birth, Alaina shared a surprise with her fans in the post: a new song she wrote for her daughter that she decided to release in her honor. 

A post shared by Lauren Alaina (@laurenalaina)

Baby Beni arrived more than a week past Alaina's due date. The country singer, who was runner-up to friend Scotty McCreery on season 10 of “American Idol,” shared many posts about how she was trying to trigger labor. But in the end, she said her little girl arrived right on time. 

“We learned she was coming in a time of deep sadness after the loss of my daddy,” wrote Alaina, whose dad died suddenly in July 2024. While she was expecting, she wrote a song called “Heaven Sent” about missing him while waiting for her baby girl's arrival. 

“I wasn't sure when I would share Heaven Sent but watching my own husband become a father the last couple of days has made me want to share it with you now,” Alaina shared in her post. “She came just before Father's Day. My first without my own father. A day that will forever be hard to me, but I now have a new and perfect reason to celebrate it. Beni's daddy. My sweet and steady husband. Beni truly is a gift from God that my old man sitting up there in Heaven Sent.”

Friends and fans flooded Alaina's post with notes of congratulations and reactions to her song, “Heaven Sent.” 

Fellow country singer and “Idol” alum Grace Leer wrote, “So so beautiful…congratulations!!!!”

Country star Carly Pearce left four sweet emoji — “😍😍😍😍” — and HGTV star Jasmine Roth, who has two little girls, commented, “She's beautiful! Congratulations!”

The social media team for the Grand Ole Opry, of which Alaina is a member, wrote, “Welcome to the world, Beni! 💕 Congratulations, Lauren & Cam!”

A lyric video for the song was released ahead of her baby announcement and fans noted how touched they were by the words, including one who wrote, “As someone who lost their daddy and had a baby girl 3 months ago, this song just wrecked me!! It is so good!”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Scott Wolf's Friend Billy Bush Shares Hopeful Overnight Update Amid Family Crisis: 'Say a Prayer'","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/scott-wolf-wife-kelley-billy-bush-update/","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 08:33:17 GMT","

Late at night on June 13, 2025, TV and podcast host Billy Bush uploaded an Instagram video with his second update of the day about the wellbeing of his dear friend, “Doc” star and Hallmark actor Scott Wolf, and his estranged wife, Kelley Wolf, who announced the couple's impending divorce on June 10. 

Fans had been concerned since earlier in the day, when news broke that Kelley, 48, had been detained and handcuffed by police in Utah at the Sundance Resort, per People. Audio and a brief moment of video footage of the ordeal was posted on her Instagram Live, including a shocking moment in which Kelly accused Scott, 57, of “abusing” her. 

In an afternoon video update, Bush, who announced in May he was leaving his anchor job at “Extra,” called Wolf “one of my best friends” and said that after talking personally with Kelley, he could confirm there was no truth behind her earlier comment. But he had more to say after some of the dust had settled later in the evening. 

A post shared by Billy Bush (@billybush)

In Bush's late night video on June 13, he praised the Wolfs' kids for being “amazing” during a very challenging week in which their parents have been in the headlines. The couple shares Jackson, 16, Miller, 12, and Lucy, 11.

Bush told fans, “Final message here before going to bed about Scott and Kelley Wolf: no Team Scott, no Team Kelley. One team — the team that the kids are on, and they're amazing.” 

Bush then said there had been some commenters on his previous post who were upset with him for defending his friend Scott without knowing the facts of what unfolded earlier in the day. 

Bush said, “There's a few commenters down below saying, ‘Shut up, Billy Bush, you have no idea what you're talking about. You don't know what happens behind closed doors. You don't have a leg to stand on when it comes to domestic violence.' Things like that. First of all, I know it — in my family.” 

“But I can tell you,” he continued, “I know both of these people very well. I love Scott and I love Kelley … I spent a lot of time on the phone with Kelley and been involved in what's going on. And I can tell you, they're both amazing people, but a couple days ago, when she says ‘the most loving father and husband ever,' she's right, and it's true.'” 

Bush was referring to Kelley's June 10 statement about her and Scott's split, in which she praised her husband of 21 years for being “one of the best fathers I've ever known and one of the best partners a woman could have the privilege of sharing life with.”

Bush continued in his overnight update, “When you hear the worst about a man you thought you knew, there's almost always a corroborating story that comes out that confirms that ‘Ooh, he really isn't that guy.' You will not hear that (about Scott). It will not come out. There's nothing there, because that's not what this is.” 

“Anyway, I have great love for both people,” Bush concluded. “I do know what's happening. They are going to be okay. Say a prayer. Be positive. Everyone's gonna be alright.”

A post shared by KELLEY WOLF (@kelleywolf)

After more than two decades together, Kelley — who was a cast member on MTV's “The Real World” before meeting Scott — announced her impending divorce via a lengthy Instagram post on June 10, writing, “It is with a heavy heart that Scott and I are moving forward with the dissolution of our marriage.” 

Later that day, Scott released a statement to People that said, “After 21 years of marriage, I have made the most difficult decision of my life, and filed for divorce from my wife Kelley. Our children have always been, and continue to be, the loves of our lives and our every priority, so I kindly ask for privacy at this time as we help guide them through this new chapter.”

Scott remained quiet on social media after that, but Kelley began posting photos and videos of herself and their daughter Lucy spending time at Sundance Resort in Utah, where the family lives. 

After things spiraled on June 13, People reported that police took Kelley to a local hospital after being called to the resort “for a report of a female that needed some help. Upon speaking with the female, our Deputies learned that she had made concerning comments to a family member, and she also made similar comments to our Deputies.”

A spokesperson for the Utah Sheriff's Department told the outlet anyone transported in their patrol vehicles is typically “placed in properly-fitted hand restraints, just for their protection and our protection as law enforcement as well.” 

Once she was at the hospital, Kelley posted a photo from her room in her Stories and wrote, “This is horrible. I have been taken against my will. Please check on my kids. Also… I am happy!! Happier than I have ever been.”

She noted that she was “compliant, calm and respectful” and expressed hope that “this is all sorted very quickly.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Fans Rally Around Snoop Dogg as He Mourns His Beloved Pup","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/snoop-dogg-dog-died-french-bulldog/","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 06:02:11 GMT","

When Snoop Dogg accepted the Ultimate Icon Award at the BET Awards on June 9, 2025, the legendary rapper thanked his family “for riding with me through the highs and the lows — more highs than lows.” But days later, they — and “The Voice” coach's fans — are helping him through a new low. 

On June 12, Snoop revealed on Instagram that he was mourning the loss of his beloved French bulldog, Juelz, who was a gift from fellow rapper Wiz Khalifa, according to TMZ. 

Snoop posted a video of himself driving with Juelz in the passenger seat of his car, and wrote, “Rip @juelzbroadus 😢 thank wiz for giving him to me 🌹 🕊️.” 

A post shared by snoopdogg (@snoopdogg)

Khalifa gave Juelz to Snoop as a birthday gift in 2014, TMZ reported, as a companion to the rapper's other French bulldog, Frank. Snoop started an Instagram account for Juelz in May 2015 and, until 2021, regularly posted pics of the pup wearing pint-sized outfits, meeting celebrities, and chilling at home. 

Later in the day on June 12, Snoop posted a second video in memory of Juelz, featuring a montage of photos set to Khalifa's song “See You Again.” He captioned the post, “Miss my dogg @juelzbroadus”

Fans have flooded Snoops posts with condolences, including one who wrote, “Daaaaamn, i know of him since he was a baby 😩 rest in peace big boy 💔ALL DOGGS GOES TO HEAVEN 🕊️”

Another fan commented, “RIP Juelz 🕊️🙏Our fur babies become a part of our family we love them with all of our hearts, and they give us that love back.”

“10 years for a frenchie is amazing,” someone else wrote. “I bet he had the dopest life. 🙌🏼”

French bulldogs, also known as Frenchies, are among the most popular dog breeds in the U.S, with a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years, according to the American Kennel Club. 

Snoop Dogg's stage name is perfect for someone who's such a huge fan of dogs, but the rapper is actually a lover of all kinds of critters. In 2023, he confirmed to YouTuber Nardwuar that he even befriended a roach when he was young. 

Snoop told him, “In my apartment I had a roach that we couldn't kill. We tried to kill the (expletive) when we first moved in and he wouldn't die, so we called him ‘The Gooch.' He just kept getting bigger and bigger. I stayed in that apartment for like about six, seven months — Cuz grew to the size of about a whole dollar bill. We used to leave food out for him and everything.” 

In 2017, Snoop teamed up with comedian Jimmy Kimmel for a popular series of “Plizzanet Earth” mockumentaries, narrating segments about various animals, including one about reptiles seen above. Snoop and Martha Stewart have hosted the Puppy Bowl on Animal Planet since 2021 and, unsurprisingly, the rapper also sells his own line of Snoop Doggie Dogg accessories for pups of all sizes and breeds.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jamal Roberts on Carrie Underwood Judging Controversy: ‘We Applaud Her'","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/jamal-roberts-comments-carrie-underwood-controversy/","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 13:33:00 GMT","

Nearly three weeks after Jamal Roberts won season 23 of “American Idol,” the R&B singer continues to be asked by media and fans about widespread speculation that judge Carrie Underwood wasn't thrilled about his rise to the top. 

Roberts has repeatedly taken the high road, giving Underwood the benefit of the doubt and insisting that the country star seemed supportive while he was on the show. But at the BET Awards 45th anniversary dinner on June 11, 2025, 27-year-old Roberts admitted to online journalist Nate Vinson that he knows he likely wasn't her favorite — and that he's proud of her for staying true to her “roots.”

A post shared by Carrie Underwood (@carrieunderwood)

In a clip Vinson tweeted of his interview with Roberts, he could be heard telling the “American Idol” winner, “There is a very strong narrative online about one of the judges of the show, Miss Carrie Underwood.” 

Roberts laughed, clearly unsurprised by getting another question about the supposed controversy, as Vinson continued, “People that watched the show felt like, you know, she really wasn't supportive of you like other judges, other people were of you. Have you seen any of that backlash and what is your response to that?”

“My response is Carrie is a country singer,” Roberts replied. “She likes country music. I mean, I don't think she likes every genre, for real. She had her picks, and she had to choose who she really liked, and she stuck with it. So, we applaud her for sticking to her roots and sticking to who she liked. But, you know, I feel like the better person won.”

Roberts beat out 19-year-old country crooner John Foster and 27-year-old contemporary Christian artist Breanna Nix for the top spot. 

Roberts' clip with Vinson drew lots of reactions on X. Some defended Underwood, others said she should have been more supportive, and a few neutral observers encouraged everyone to calm down and drop the drama. 

One tweeted, “Leave dude be and let him glow. Leave her be and let people actually express their opinions without (expletive) like this. Dude is super talented, but not my genre. Whatever. Congrats bro 💯💪👏”

The controversy stems from some of Roberts' supporters taking issue with Underwood's comments and expressions during the singer's season 23 performances. During his audition, for example, she said he needed more “swagger” to match his big voice. Later, after one of his top five performances, she said, “I feel like you missed such an opportunity to move around and entertain,” adding that it was time to “pull out all the stops.”

On May 30, a week after Roberts' victory, “The Morning Hustle” co-host Lore'l told Roberts that some viewers thought Underwood “kind of side-eyed you” after host Ryan Seacrest announced him as the winner. 

Roberts diplomatically replied, “Watching all the past performances, I see that she was clapping and getting on board, so I really don't know.”

“I didn't like her energy toward you,” Lore'l admitted, “and I think that's why I'm shading her in this interview here … is because I did not like the swagless comment, or saying that you needed swag, I did not like how she looked at you sometimes in some performances. I really wanted to come through the screen.”

Right after the finale ended, Underwood told Extra, “I do like the way it was set up, there was no way America could've gotten it wrong. We had three incredible finalists occupying three different lanes, they all had their own vibes, their own styles, their own vocal ranges and styles and techniques, and I feel like it was a great finale.” 

“But Jamal just has a gift from God,” she continued. “His voice is insane. Every time he opens his mouth, it's flawless … I got to tell him afterwards, ‘Now, go do great things!' And I feel like he certainly can.”

After she returned home to her farm near Nashville, Underwood named a baby sheep after Roberts that was born on the same day of the finale. She has since called the lamb “Baby J” in subsequent Instagram Stories.

Keira Knightley and Rosamund Pike sat down with Vanity Fair to discuss the 20th anniversary of the beloved adaptation of “Pride & Prejudice,” which has become the definitive version of the oft-filmed story for many a Jane Austen fan. Knightley and Pike played sisters Elizabeth and Jane Bennett, with their cinematic patriarch portrayed by the legendary Donald Sutherland.

“I have to say, most actors have been a disappointment since then,” said Knightley, who was just 19 when she starred in the film. The actress netted her first Oscar nomination for her work.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“Donald was pretty legendary,” Pike added. “We did have dinners with him sometimes, and he told us some pretty wild stories which cannot be shared.”

Sutherland, Knightley noted, was vehemently anti-smoking, a quality his castmates did note share.

“There was the party that Donald Sutherland came to. You weren't allowed to smoke. He had it in his contract that nobody on the set was allowed to smoke anywhere near, and you couldn't smell of smoke,” she recalled. “But of course everyone smoked back then. And everybody would be smoking, and then you'd be sort of spraying yourself. But the party he came to, he came in a gas mask. And he was like, ‘I want you to all be able to smoke. And I wanted to come to the party.'”

 










Sutherland died at 88 in 2024, leaving behind a filmography that included acclaimed performances in “Klute,” “Ordinary People,” and “The Hunger Games.” Helen Mirren, who worked with Sutherland in 2017's “The Leisure Seeker,” told IndieWire he was “one of the smartest actors I ever worked with.”

“He had a wonderful enquiring brain, and a great knowledge on a wide variety of subjects,” Mirren said. “He combined this great intelligence with a deep sensitivity and with a seriousness about his profession as an actor. This all made him into the legend of film that he became.”

At the Lumière Festival in 2019, Sutherland reflected on his decision to become an actor.

“I come from a small town of 5,000 inhabitants. When I was 16 years old, my father brought me into his car — as was the tradition in Nova Scotia, where I'm from — and took me for a quick drive. He then stopped on the side of the road and asked what I wanted to do with my life. I told him I wanted to become an actor,” he said. “I have no idea why I thought to become an actor. Neither of us had ever been to the theatre before.”

Oscar Wilde knew it, Roald Dahl knew it, and Black Moth Super Rainbow know it, too: the most fucked-up stories are fairy tales. In the grainy video for “All 2 of Us,” the woozy lead single of Soft New Magic Dream, grotesque clowns gnaw on hamburgers with their mouths open, salivate over human flesh, and bare their fangs with sadistic, slack-jawed glee. It's R.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour meets Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti, a psych-pop lullaby set against a psychological thriller. In the insular world of BMSR, is it necessarily new? For two decades and counting, the Pittsburgh band has churned out synthy dreamscapes with a dreadful edge, music for the moment a weed brownie makes you nauseous. At the band's online shop, you can purchase a vinyl record, or, if you like, a shrunken head preserved in eternal anguish. If this new album is an attempt, in the words of its first song, to “Open the Fucking Fantasy,” the desire seems misplaced—the fantasy has been open, and unchanging, since 2003. Is it still magic or just muscle memory?

On their first album in seven years, there is evidence for both: some moments that surprise, and others that make the fantasy feel formulaic. Black Moth Super Rainbow's sound remains distinctly their own, which is impressive considering the referential era they outlived. In the mid-2000s, when they released their earliest and most enduring work, hypnagogic pop was in vogue, as was hauntology—home-recorded soundtracks for half-remembered dreams. What BMSR did differently than, say, John Maus and James Ferraro, was pinpoint not the depressive downfall, but the even-eerier period when everything feels too okay. Their best songs were deceptively wistful, mourning someone who wasn't there, something that hadn't happened yet. On the new album, though, this funhouse-meets-funeral concept more often feels rehearsed—a mysterious band demystified by its own increasingly unmysterious vibe.

That the mystery still hits, even if only sometimes, is a testament to how strong the BMSR spell can be. While Soft New Magic Dream largely re-hashes the Black Moth Super Rainbow formula, it also occasionally manages to find new colors in old constraints—not abandoning their schtick, but not copy-pasting it either. In the slinky music breaks of “Unknown Potion,” you might make out traces of “Smile the Day After Today,” a sparse instrumental standout from 2009's Eating Us. Self-parody? No. A step forward? Also no: It's the sound of a band whose longevity has left it standing in its own shadow. This feels particularly grating on tracks that go on for a little too long, like the otherwise-solid “Open the Fucking Fantasy.” By the third chorus—and for much of the LP—the magic carpet is indeed revved up. It would be nice if we went somewhere.

Black Moth Super Rainbow are led by Tobacco, a semi-anonymous vocoder enthusiast with creepy-crawly music of his own. In some ways, BMSR represent an extension of his warped universe: same gooey typeface, same friendly-monster vocals, same sickly-sweet fever dream. For better or worse, his fingerprints are everywhere on Soft New Magic Dream. “Tastebud” is the strongest non-single here, in part because of its uncomfortable pauses—a trick that gave Hot Wet & Sassy its tense, impending-doom textures. It's a rare moment that sounds like Black Moth Super Rainbow produced by Tobacco the eclectic artist, rather than Tobacco the eclectic artist putting away his MPC to stand behind a microphone. More often, we get less-exciting moments like “Demon's Glue,” a five-minute song that plateaus in BMSR's candy-colored comfort zone by minute two. Black Moth Super Rainbow are masters of their insular, very specific, Nyan Cat-adjacent musical world. More and more, it's beginning to feel like Neverland: a place where no one ever grows up, but nothing ever changes.

							By 

	Guy Lawson



	The longest undefended border in the world has a new and insurmountable wall running the entire length of its extent, from sea to shining sea, a barrier as real as it is imaginary. For Canadians, the constant recipients of Donald Trump's lurid attempts to be press-ganged into becoming the 51st state, there is no longer any need for American border control at the many crossings into the United States. The border is now self-controlled and self-policed, with virtually the entire population of America's peaceful neighbor to the north, my homeland, agreeing that crossing over to America is not just taboo — it's a kind of betrayal, even borderline treasonous.


	For decades, the greatest cross-border threats to Canada have come from the south: guns, drugs, weak beer, idiotic wars, reactionary politics, reality TV, idiotic wars, and now epically stupid tariffs and the deranged lunge for annexation. For Americans, Canada has always been a place of refuge — for loyalists fleeing the Revolutionary War and slaves in the Civil War, to draft dodgers during the Vietnam War and women in the all-too-real fictional gender war of The Handmaid's Tale. It has also been the butt of lame jokes — an easy source of mockery, yin to the Yankee yang, universal health care and social justice to America's “we're all going to die” nihilism. A quiet and politely passive neighbor, prospering under a mutually beneficial trade agreement negotiated by Trump in his first term, Canada has long been taken for granted, to the extent its existence is even noticed at all.

	











	Former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, father of the recently replaced  prime minister Justin, once said that living next door to the United States was like sleeping with an elephant — every twitch and twinge can be felt. But what about trying to exist next to an angry, irrational, vengeful orangutan on a rampage, a tariff-imposing, grudge-holding mob boss with a Nero-strength case of narcissism, who seems intent making himself a Mount Rushmore-worthy historical figure, or failing that, a dictator — even as he turns himself and increasingly America into a laughingstock?

	AS A SELF-DESCRIBED mastermind marketer and salesman, Donald Trump has always placed a supreme premium on the value of his brand, claiming it alone is worth billions — ascribing the greatest part of his invented net worth to the intangible monetary appeal of his P. T. Barnum carnival act. As president, Trump has enriched himself and his grifter children with corrupt crypto and creepo businesses, with his family demanding the construction of a Trump-branded golf course for peasants to play on the rice paddies of Vietnam as their latest extortion racket, along the way plunging the concept of graft to a new low — perhaps even rivaling his hero Vladimir Putin.


	But Trump is also the steward of the most valuable brand in human history: the United States. Instead of Trump's paltry few billion, the brand of America is worth trillions upon trillions, an incalculable value proposition that is undergoing the most radical relaunch since New Coke in the 1980s. 


	A Manhattan advertising executive for a global agency once hired to promote “Brand USA” during the Obama years tells me that the approach used then was simple and effective: democracy, independence, freedom. The key phrases now, he says, are capitalism and culture — but that is putting the best possible spin on what's really happening to America's global reputation.


	“The world is in denial about what's really going on in America,” the executive says. “The election was a mirror reflecting America back to itself — the election is who America really is right now — and that is frustrated young white dudes who are angry at the world.”


	For Canadians intent on boycotting American-made goods and services in favor of Canadian content, as a reaction to Trump's frontal assault on its economy and sovereignty, there is still a humorous element to the undeniable crack-like attraction of American culture. A recent comedy sketch from the CBC show This Hour Has Twenty-Two Minutes titled “Canadians Anonymous,” illustrates the point, as addled hosers admit that they can't get enough Yankee three-ply toilet paper from Walmart, let alone swap Diet Pepsi for generic Canadian diet cola. As the mortified Canadians sit in a circle of trust, confessing to their relapses buying American products like dry drunks in an AA meeting, they share the strange love-hate relationship between the two countries — a longing felt exclusively, it seems, by America's northern neighbor.

	“Now, who wants to get drunk?” the sponsor asks as the group session ends.


	“Me,” comes the instant reply. “I can't be sober during this trade war.”


	The star of This Hour is Mark Critch, a Newfoundlander, a peculiar subspecies of Canadian with a mid-Atlantic brogue and a wicked sense of humor — not the kind of comedy that travels to America in the milquetoast guise of Mike Myers or Jim Carrey, with Canadians passing as Americans. Critch is a specific kind of celebrity — world-famous all-over Canada, you might say — who creates comedy for Canadians, without having to pander in search of the supposed big time.


	“When I order a Manhattan in a bar in Toronto now I get the instant judgy eye,” Critch tells me. “Like it's the most horrible thing.”


	Critch likens Trump to a toxic boyfriend negging Canada, a form of gaslighting that has the predator president claiming that America doesn't need Canada's lumber or steel or boundless fresh water — when of course the opposite is true. Ironically, Trump's constant attempt to neg Canada has only developed an historically unprecedented positive form of patriotism, from urban hipster leftists to redneck prairie farmers insulted by the bullying and repulsive lechery for Canada's own priceless resources — natural, national, intellectual, historical, but above all civilizational. For generations, Canadians have defined themselves largely as not being American, a counterpoint form of identity that seemed to lack its own driving force, until Trump came along. Now, not being American has taken on an entirely new significance — a national characteristic that is both exceptional and the envy of the world.


	A LITTLE APPRECIATED aspect of the self-generated reality of the con artist is that they need to surround themselves with people stupid or craven enough to go along with their scams. The same is true for Trump, just on an epic level, with the halfwitted J.D. Vance and fake tough guy Don Jr. leading the charge, along with wide-eyed maniacs like Peter Navarro, Stephen Miller, and Kash Patel, as the new brand ambassadors for the United States. Then there are those who are wise to the con, but who believe it's profitable to go along with the Big Lie while it lasts — like Elon Musk, depending on the level of ketamine in his system measured against his naked, corrupt self interest and sadistic impulses. Together, as the con artist preys upon the gullibility of his followers, promising fantasies that are literally too good to be true, they are enveloped by the giddy sense that if the lies are big enough the bullshit might actually come true.

	











	But the result is that the loneliest man in every room is the con man surrounded by idiots — particularly because he is frequently his own victim, convinced by his own lies, isolating himself from his own tenuous grasp on reality. The new prime minister of Canada appears aware of this context — and the dire threat to Canada's national interest Trump represents. Sitting with Trump in the White House, as poised as any Goldman Sachs banker — because he was one — freshly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney is the kind of sophisticated financial figure who routinely refused to do business with the failed businessman Trump, and for very good reason. Carney is a true plutocrat, fluent in the language of Wall Street and global commerce in a way that Trump can only dream of. As Carney sits politely listening to a torrent of Trump's lies, he effortlessly deploys the arcane argot of the global elite, offering a “step change” in the trade agreement between the two countries, for example, as Trump leans forward in an odd form of deference wondering what precisely fancy words like “step change” might actually mean — an illustration of the Canadian leader's mastery of America's worst and most ridiculous excesses.


	“Carney gives Trump the opportunity to not look stupid,” the comedian Critch tells me. “Carney can explain things to him. Carney has dealt with every kind of bullshit developer like Trump. They recognize something in each other.”


	So it is that Trump lives inside a kind of Potemkin village, the fake model settlements 19th century Russians courtiers built to hide the truth about the poverty and suffering of the peasants from the clueless tyrannical Tsar. Only in Trump's case, the entire world is his ornate Potemkin snow globe, a kind of inverted psychedelic trip where Trump is never wrong and foreigners pay tariffs — not American consumers. Inside this bubble, Trump is respected and admired and worshipped — not ridiculed and loathed. In this alternate reality, with Trump's acolytes urging on his worst instincts, he continues to insist that Canada will become the 51st state, despite the nearly universal disgust and contempt the president engenders in Canada.


	“The Canada stuff started as a joke, and I suppose it still is a joke,” Critch sighs. “But the world is starting to realize there is no plan.”


	For Carney, having a plan always beats having no plan, as he said repeatedly during his successful electoral campaign. Like most every world leader — many eagerly watching Carney to see how it's done — Carney's plan is to not rile Trump, thus not poking the bear, at least in theory. But behind the polite deference, Canada is furiously building a future that looks beyond America to trade across the country's provinces, with internal commercial barriers disappearing, along with new treaties with Europe and Asia; like the rest of the western world, Canada is frantically preparing for a post-America order, the aftermath of the decline and fall of an empire at the hyper-speed of the digital age.

	











	THE WORD “CANADA” is derived from the Iroquois word for a collection of villages, an apt metaphor for a society defined by diversity and contradictions and multiplicity. There are countless complexities to Canadian politics, like the fact that the French-speaking separatist movement in Quebec likely saved the country in the past election by voting for Mark Carney's federalist Liberal party, while a rump of hard-right prairie MAGA-wannabes have now set out to separate from the country. In the same way that Americans quake in fear at so-called “polar vortex” storm fronts that Canadians simply call “winter,” there is a word the folks north of the border use for resolving seemingly intractable problems, without resorting to fascism or assaults on sanity and fundamental human decency: “democracy.”


	Just below the surface for Canadians, rarely mentioned, is the shocking and painful realization that virtually no one in America has defended the country and the centuries-long alliance — at least not until the economic pain started to be felt. Despite the unhinged attacks, Trump's approval rating remains relatively high, with many Americans apparently more than happy to toss aside generations of cooperation — displaying the appallingly flimsy roots of the relationship with Canada. Another of the most difficult facts to swallow for Canadians is also the biggest reality of them all: Trump's attack on diversity, equity, and inclusion is an assault on the most basic values of Canadian society. Canada is a nation built on immigrants, as is America, and it's also a society that is facing a demographic catastrophe without the influx of immigrants creating a new kind of society and nation. Through a policy of multicultural toleration and even celebration of difference, Canada is becoming a post-national nation, as former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau noted in an interview with me more than a decade ago — a notion that has been mocked by Trump and America's extremist nationalists, but that is the only plausible way forward for a species sharing a fragile, warming, and shrinking planet.


	THE BORDER CROSSING north of Watertown, New York, usually has hundreds of cars lined up on both sides of the frontier on Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start to the summer. This year there were no cars waiting on the Canadian side to cross into the United States, despite the onset of the tourist season. Not a few cars or a slow day: only the one driven by my kids returning from a semester in university in Canada.

	











	The statistics about declining tourism revenue in America aren't simply numbers: This is a cultural and patriotic and civilizational transformation, a fact that MAGA extremists delight in, but that will only further isolate America in Trump's chaotic, delusional, and cowering country. Canadians love America, truth be told, but not at the price of their dignity and independence and self-respect. The half-filled state fairs in Minnesota and the condos for sale in Florida and the struggling Maine hotels are a sign of a troubling change for relations between the countries, but on a deeper level they represent the fact that the two countries are really parting ways.

	As seen from the far side of the 49th parallel, America doesn't seem to be turning its back on Canada, so much as it is turning its back on itself — its history and Constitution, the world, the future. To Canadians, America is freefalling into an abyss where even freedom of speech is becoming a questionable right. Consider this: Possessing the magazine you're reading — in print, on your electronic device — could now easily constitute a crime at the border crossing into America from Canada, if you possess the wrong nationality or passport or skin color or religion or immigration status. As Canadians are discovering on the frontier to the United States, all it takes is for an American border patrol officer to confiscate your belongings and search for any expression that is objectionable to the Trump regime — whatever the Dear Leader says that means on any given day, a category that might easily include Rolling Stone.


	Cross into Canada at the same frontier, over the majestic Thousand Islands Bridge spanning the blue waters of the St. Lawrence River, and you, dear reader, can find yourself on the far side of the only actual wall Donald Trump has ever successfully constructed, in a land that is not seized by the pathetic rage and self-pity of a sad old man — in the true north, strong and free.

Blake Lively's lawyers filed a motion Friday asking the judge overseeing her lawsuit against Justin Baldoni to block his lawyers from seeking any communication between the actress and Taylor Swift.


	Back in May, Baldoni's legal team dropped their efforts to subpoena Swift as part as their ongoing legal action against Lively; however, according to Lively's lawyers, Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios' lawyers continued to pursue previous communication, via texts and emails, between Lively and Swift as it pertains to the case.


	On Friday, Lively's lawyers filed “a protective order regarding the Wayfarer Parties' continuing demands for Ms. Lively's communications with Taylor Swift (made again yesterday), which they have pursued at the same time they have refused to produce to Ms. Lively the documents they publicly claimed to have received as part of a deal to withdraw their subpoenas to Ms. Swift and her counsel.”

	The motion, obtained by Variety, adds that “Ms. Swift is not central to Ms. Lively's claims (unlike dozens of other witnesses she identified who the Wayfarer Parties have largely ignored), and is otherwise irrelevant to the Wayfarer Parties' claims,” and that “the Wayfarer Parties should not be permitted to withhold documents from Ms. Lively while demanding her communications with Ms. Swift.”

	











	Earlier this week, Baldoni suffered a massive setback in his own counter legal action against Lively when the judge dismissed his $400 million lawsuit against the actress, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and publicist Leslie Sloane, as well as threw out a separate $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times. (In December, The New York Times published a story with Lively‘s sexual harassment and smear campaign allegations against Baldoni, which in turn sparked Lively's lawsuit against Baldoni.)

	A Lively spokesperson told Variety Friday, “The ongoing attempts to once again try and use the world's biggest star as a PR tactic in this matter reflects a public unraveling of epic proportions and serves only to distract from the fact that Justin Baldoni's lawsuits against Ms. Lively, Ryan Reynolds, their publicist, and the New York Times have been entirely dismissed.”


	The trial for Lively's suit against Baldoni is scheduled for March 2026.

	All over America today, it's No Kings Day, as the people rise up to make the kind of protests none of us thought we'd ever need to make in our lifetimes. It's a day for defiance, for solidarity, as we watch the whole idea of a constitutional republic get dismantled piece by piece — not just by one man, but by a regime, an entire political party that no longer even pretends to have a platform, committed to the abolition of American democracy.


	So what better day to blast Pavement? “No More Kings” is an eccentric deep cut that nonetheless has turned into an accidentally perfect protest song for our times. “I want no more kings!” Stephen Malkmus yells. “No more kings!” He's singing about King George III of England in 1776, but somehow, it's the anthem we need right now. 


	The Nineties indie pranksters in Pavement cut “No More Kings” for a 1996 tribute album devoted to Schoolhouse Rock, the Seventies educational kiddie-TV shorts that ran during the Saturday-morning cartoons. “No More Kings” was a history lesson written and sung in 1975 by future Broadway legend Lynn Ahrens, who'd go on to win a Tony Award for Ragtime. It tells the story of the American Revolution, when the colonists rose up to rebel against the British Empire, leading to the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. 

	











	But Pavement remade it in their own gloriously ramshackle way, goosing it with new melodies and rowdy band interaction. When Malkmus drawls, “That's what I call taxation without representation, and that's not fair,” Bob Nastanovich really loses his shit, screaming, “It's wrong! It's WRONG!” There's also a hilarious moment where the music stops and you can hear Malkmus turn the page of his lyric sheet.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“Essentially, it was pick a song from the fantastic Schoolhouse Rock era,” Bob Nastanovich recalled in 2023 on the podcast In Loving Recollection. “We loved the song. I mean, ‘No More Kings'—if we were one of the first to choose, it was sort of an obvious one for us.”

	The original was a perky folk-pop ditty that sums up the events of the Revolution, like the Boston Tea Party. “He even had the nerve to tax our cup of tea!” the song goes. “To put it kindly, King, we really don't agree.” But Pavement tweak it into a gorgeously shaggy guitar ramble. At the end, where the original has the sunny promise “we're gonna run things our own way,” Malkmus adds a sly twist. “We're gonna run our things our own way! We're gonna run it into the ground!” Now there's an American credo.


	Pavement cut it in Memphis at the Pacific Trim sessions, with just the threesome of Malkmus, Nastanovich, and drummer Steve West, fresh from their long Crooked Rain tour. The studio time was booked for a Silver Jews album, but David Berman lasted just a couple hours before hopping in his car and driving home to Charlottesville. So the Pavement trio used the time to whip up a brilliant quickie EP, plus “No More Kings.” All three were big history buffs — at UVA, Malkmus majored in history and Nastanovich in government. 


	“No More Kings” is totally in the spirit of Pavement, with their Nineties irreverence, as a band of riot-grrrl-adjacent punk boys. At a 2010 reunion show on the Brooklyn waterfront, Malkmus got one of the night's biggest cheers when he said, “We saw a Bikini Kill show around here in 1992.” “Greenlander,” one of their best songs ever, was their contribution to the classic pro-choice benefit Born To Choose, a quintessential rock project of the era. As a Bernie Sanders supporter and Chapo Trap House fan, Malkmus told Rolling Stone, “Back in the Nineties, it was a little bit vague, and I would just kind of vote for whoever was the left-est reasonable candidate by the time the election happened.”

	In a 2010 interview, Stephen Colbert asked Pavement, “Do you have a musical hero? Somebody that if they didn't exist, you wouldn't be rocking?” Malkmus quipped, “Reagan?” He wasn't kidding — Nineties rock culture was shaped by the end of the Reagan-Bush regime, a twelve-year nightmare from which young America was desperate to awake. (On Election Night 1992, as my wife and I watched the invincible George H.W. Bush go down to defeat, the first record we put on to celebrate was “Debris Slide,” from the 10-inch Perfect Sound Forever.) What is “No More Kings” but a very Pavement declaration of independence?

	











Schoolhouse Rock had a phenomenal body of kiddie pop tunes — it's the reason why Gen Xers can all sing the preamble to the Constitution, or tell you all about conjunctions. The cartoon vignettes ran every Saturday morning on ABC, in between classic kids' shows like Hong Kong Phooey, Scooby Doo, The Krofft Supershow, and Uncle Croc's Block. But most of all, Schoolhouse Rock got the music right, with jazz hepcats like Bob Dorough and Blossom Dearie. There was Multiplication Rock, with math lessons like the De La Soul-inspiring “Three Is a Magic Number.” Grammar Rock had classic odes to adjectives, nouns, and interjections, which show excitement and emotion. “No More Kings” came from America Rock, like the legislative explainer “I'm Just a Bill,” the Nineteenth Amendment feminist banger “Sufferin' Till Suffrage,” and the timely celebration of immigrants, “The Great American Melting Pot.” 


	The 1996 tribute Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks revived these songs in new versions by Biz Markie, Blind Melon, The Lemonheads, Moby, Skee-Lo, even Ween. But the obvious keeper was Pavement's “No More Kings,” which came out as a 7-inch single. “It is what it is, kinda jokey,” Nastanovich said. “But that was the vibe, that sort of silliness. Obviously, Schoolhouse Rock was meant to be an effective, fun way to learn. So that was a pretty easy thing for us to pull off.” Malkmus took it somewhere different. “As he went through that process of siphoning it from a ditty to a Pavement song, he essentially—as he did with a lot of things—he just Malkmus'd it.”


	They always approached everything in their own playful way — as seen in the excellent new semi-demi-quasi documentary Pavements, director Alex Ross Perry's send-up/celebration of a band whose story couldn't be told any other way.  They brought that mischievous wit to American history, whether it was Cotton Mather (“Give It a Day,” from Pacific Trim), or “Unseen Power of the Picket Fence,” an ode to R.E.M. that bizarrely that bizarrely turns into General Sherman marching through Georgia. (“G-G-G-G-G-Georgia!”)


	All three of the Pavement dudes at this session had deep Virginia ties, which explains why they had so much fun playing up the “taxation without representation” line — it was a resonant local reference, to the then-burning issue of Washington, D.C. statehood. The district had federal taxes yet no representation in Congress — a vexed issue for a mostly-Black city, inevitably tied in with the issue of Puerto Rican statehood. D.C. even introduced “Taxation Without Representation” license plates, which Bill Clinton put on the presidential limo. (George W. Bush had them removed.)

	But when they banged out “No More Kings,” they definitely weren't envisioning a future that looked like this — nobody did. They never pictured a moment when the White House would send in the National Guard and the Marines to invade a U.S. city and round up immigrants. (The city's name is “Los Angeles,” a todo esto.) The reckless ICE attacks on immigrant workers have been just one symptom of the Republican regime's war on America and the people who live in it. Trump, in office only five months, has checked off practically every item on the Declaration of Independence's list of George III's “repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.”  As the Declaration put it: “A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.”


	“No More Kings” is a Seventies story that Pavement updated for the Nineties, yet one that sounds absolutely in the spirit of right now. The idea of “No More Kings” doesn't sound like ancient history these days, the way it did when they did this song in 1996. Here's hoping it goes back to sounding that way sooner rather than later.

	As cities across the nation brace for “No Kings” protests on June 14, Donald Trump deployed 700 Marines to Los Angeles, with 200 troops arriving Friday to guard the Wilshire Federal Building  — the latest provocation in the president's militarized answer to immigration enforcement and protest policing.


	Marines have already carried out the first known detainment in the city. Reuters obtained photographs of armed Marines temporarily detaining a civilian. The U.S. military confirmed the incident, which took place at the Wilshire Federal Building, to the outlet. The New York Times reported that the individual said he was an Army veteran and tried to reach the Veteran's Affairs office located past caution tape. The man said he was undisturbed by his brief detention.


	Earlier this week, the commander overseeing military operations in the city said that military personnel can only temporarily detain people but cannot make arrests.

	The move to have Marines involved in local police work tests the boundaries of the Posse Comitatus Act, which broadly prohibits the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement.

	











	On Thursday, a federal judge attempted to place a restraining order on Trump's move to federalize 4,000 California National Guard Troops. (That injunction has since been stayed by an appeals court.)


	The judge did not address the role of Marines under Trump's command, writing that he would await a court date to weigh evidence as to whether these federal forces were engaging in police-like behavior including “interrogating, detaining, or searching civilians.”

	











	Trump has long dreamed of using military force to counter his domestic opposition. On June 6, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids targeted warehouses, clothing manufacturers, and Home Depot parking lots across Los Angeles, prompting a wave of local protests. Trump seized the opportunity to exert control over the state, deploying 2,000 National Guard troops into the city despite protests from both California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass.

	The president has since mobilized as many as 4,000 members of the California National Guard along with the 700 Marines to deploy in Los Angeles.


	On Thursday, Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) was dragged out of a Department of Homeland Security press conference, forced to the ground, and handcuffed by members of the FBI after attempting to ask DHS Secretary Kristi Noem a question. Padilla later said in a press conference that he was “there peacefully” and was hoping to get answers from the administration about their immigration policies. “I began to ask a question,” the senator recalled. “I was forced to the ground, and I was handcuffed,” he said, clarifying: “I was not arrested. I was not detained.” Padilla then addressed reporters: “If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question you can only imagine what they're doing do farmers … and day laborers.”


	Millions are expected to protest President Trump's military parade on his birthday (which is also Flag Day and the 250th anniversary of the Army). The president has planned for a procession of tanks, Howitzers, mobile rocket launchers, and other war machines to roll through the streets of Washington, D.C., as military aircraft, including Apache helicopters, fly overhead. 


	Protest organizers have called June 14 a “nationwide day of defiance.” The protest website reads: “They've defied our courts, deported Americans, disappeared people off the streets, attacked our civil rights, and slashed our services. The corruption has gone too. far. No thrones. No crowns. No kings.”

A scientist has sounded the alarm for humanity after the discovery of a UFO adorned with bizarre and inexplicable inscriptions, suggesting a seismic shift in our understanding of extraterrestrial life.

Dr. Julia Mossbridge, a cognitive neuroscientist and researcher into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs)—the updated term for UFO sightings—warns that we as humans may soon have to grapple with the reality of alien existence and step into a new epoch of comprehension.

This comes amid a growing body of information about supposed encounters with UFOs and extraterrestrials. Notably, an odd, spherical artifact uncovered in Colombia is thought by researchers to be a fragment of UFO technology.

The artifact features markings reminiscent of ancient scripts such as runes, and scientists are employing AI in attempts to decode the enigmatic symbols. Dr. Mossbridge shared with Fox News: ""We are entering a time when we are starting to recognize as humans we don't have the control that we thought we had over everything.""

She posts that the potential revelation of extraterrestrial beings could plunge numerous individuals and societies worldwide into turmoil as they struggle to assimilate the truth of their presence, reports the Daily Star.

""One of the mistakes we make is [saying] because I think I understand this, everything I think today is true,"" she observed, noting that it leads to confusion when something arises that doesn't ""fit our model of the world.""

Mossbridge remains cautious about jumping to the conclusion that this find is an actual alien artifact, yet a significant part of the public is already convinced. ""The sphere itself seems kind of like an art project,"" she mentioned.

""If an artist is doing this, why is that? Well, I think it's partly the same reason. It's because we're learning that we don't understand what's in our skies or our waters. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us.""

Conversely, Dr Jose Luis Velazquez, a radiologist who inspected the sphere, indicated he didn't find any typical hallmarks suggesting human fabrication.

""It is of artificial origin, in that it shows no evidence of welding, and its internal structure is composed of high-density elements. More testing is needed to establish its origin,"" he revealed.

Mail Online has reported that the research team employed AI technology to decode the enigmatic design, which interpreted to say: ""The origin of birth through union and energy in the cycle of transformation, meeting point of unity, expansion, and consciousness - individual consciousness.""

They expressed the sentiment: ""We interpret it as a message to humanity, encouraging a collective shift in consciousness to help Mother Earth-especially considering the current issues with pollution and environmental decline.""

In a related mystery, three-fingered alien mummies found in 2017 in the Nazca desert have been perplexing experts, with new claims from scientists dating them back 1,200 years.

Often brushed off as merely an art project, experts now believe the 'alien' mummies of Peru may have been victims of homicide. Scientists studying the enigmatic three-fingered bodies with elongated skulls have unveiled new discoveries they assert confirm the specimens are '100% real'.

The injuries they sustained imply they met violent ends - and might have been deliberately killed. Unearthed in 2017 in Peru's Nazca desert, the mummies were introduced to the world in Mexico two years later as potential fossilized remains of extraterrestrials not part of Earth's evolutionary lineage.

Preliminary DNA tests indicated they were part-human and part 'unknown species', leading to Mexico's inaugural congressional hearing on UFOs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","The Supernatural Spin-Off About Sam And Dean That Fans Forgot Existed","https://www.slashfilm.com/1881851/supernatural-the-animation-horror-spin-off/","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 16:30:00 GMT","



""Supernatural"" enjoyed 15 successful seasons on the air, and there are many fans out there who wish that Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) were given more monster-hunting adventures for years to come. Despite the show's success, however, attempts to expand the franchise haven't set the world on fire. The CW canceled ""The Winchesters"" spin-off after one season, while the planned mafia-inspired ""Supernatural: Bloodlines"" series never materialized due to the lukewarm response to its backdoor pilot. Similarly, ""Supernatural: The Animation"" was put to rest after one season before becoming a forgotten memory — like the many spirits Sam and Dean encounter while traveling America's haunted hotspots.

Produced by Madhouse — the legendary Japanese animation studio behind ""Death Note,"" ""Perfect Blue"" and other beloved anime properties — ""Supernatural: The Animation"" follows Sam and Dean as they battle all manner of beasts. Most of the episodes are retellings of stories from ""Supernatural's"" first two seasons, which features monster-of-the-week adventures and an overarching story about the siblings' search for The Yellowed-Eyed Demon who killed their mother. There are some original episodes, too, but the majority of the animated show's one and only season covers well-trodden ground.

That said, ""Supernatural: The Animation"" is arguably more visually interesting than the original saga. The live-action series had to contend with budget restraints, meaning that the demons typically look like regular people with black eyes. What's more, the action sequences are pretty basic. The creative leeway afforded by the anime format, however, allows for the monsters to look like otherworldly nightmares, and the overall spectacle is more imaginative. However, if you go into this one having seen the original live-action series, ""Supernatural: The Animation"" might get boring rather quickly — and some elements of the show are downright frustrating.



While the monster designs add some nightmare juice to familiar tales of terror, ""Supernatural: The Animation"" is an unnecessary show. The series had an opportunity to tell some brand-new stories centered around Sam and Dean that could have expanded the franchise's lore, but the creators instead chose to condense the first two seasons of ""Supernatural"" into 22 short episodes. The animated series is a fine introduction to Sam and Dean's story for newcomers, but for seasoned fans, it's unessential viewing.

Not only that, but some of the animated show's characters leave a lot to be desired. Sam and Dean are similar to their live-action counterparts — Jared Padalecki even voices Sam for the whole season, and Jensen Ackles reprises Dean for two episodes — but their ally, Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver), is unrecognizable. The original Bobby is a no-nonsense hunter with a beard, but the anime adaptation reimagines him as a doofus with a bowler hat. Granted, remakes should bring new ideas and characterizations to the table, but this version of Bobby is inferior to the O.G.

Minor quibbles aside, ""Supernatural: The Animation"" is entertaining for the most part. The scary monsters and darker tone are commendable, which makes the series' lack of originality easier to swallow. Still, the series might have been more memorable and successful if it pitted Sam and Dean against a fresh rogues gallery of creatures, as opposed to spooks they'd already faced before.","{'href': 'https://www.slashfilm.com', 'title': 'SlashFilm'}","other"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Unsolved+Mysteries","The unsolved mysteries from Chicago Bears offseason work","https://www.si.com/nfl/bears/the-unsolved-mysteries-from-chicago-bears-offseason-work","Sat, 14 Jun 2025 15:25:38 GMT","

By their nature, NFL organized team activities and minicamps provide answers for coaches but no one else.

Then they are done until training camp, leaving mysteries to be sorted out later. Coaches can see a player's ability to compete at the NFL level but hitting even they need the verification padded practices bring.

It's like Bears coach Ben Johnson said when OTAs began: ""We're not earning jobs here this springtime.""

There were many aspects of play that could have been apparent, though and haven't been for an assortment of reasons. In most cases, it was a minor injury the team didn't want to worsen before camp starts.

""We want to be smart with how we're taking care of their bodies and we're not pushing them too hard and have the soft tissue things pop up already,"" Johnson said.

As a result, OTAs and minicamp came and the Bears head toward training camp with numerous mysteries still remaining. 

#Bears edge rusher Dayo Odeyingbo pic.twitter.com/QoRFLCM5IA

What exactly is he? Who is he? The Bears signed the former Colts edge player who is said to be able to move inside to tackle, if needed, in some pass rush situations. 

Odeyingbo briefly practiced at the outset of offseason work, presumably due to injury. 

No one really saw how he might be deployed. Instead, Montez Sweat, Dominique Robinson, Jamree Kromah and a few others did the bulk of edge work. Sweat deserves great credit here for being at work throughout voluntary practices a year after he didn't participate to a great extent.

Training camp can finally show everyone what the Bears got for three years and $48 million and maybe it will become more obvious then whether they really do need more edge rush help.

Do you find it alarming that we have literally heard nothing about Dayo? We paid this dude so much $$ and I have heard nothing about him so far…

Defensive coordinator Dennis Allen left everyone wondering about what the starting slot cornerback would actually be doing.

Bears will be a fun defense to watch with Dennis Allen!Love his scheme and defense. cover 1 pressure ⏬⏬Has been a top dc for years.Will love his creativity on 3rd down with his 3-2 and load package!#DaBears https://t.co/x4TKvKb16h pic.twitter.com/dmcFBUQVHp

“He's played more outside corner, so obviously that would be the comfort level,"" Allen said. ""Some of the things that I see him do and the way that he fits in the run game tells me that he could be a fit with safety also.""

Allen left it in the air whether Gordon is a safety, cornerback, slot cornerback or what, but then a soft tissue injury occurred and now no one knows before this could be explored. 

Fortunately Gordon was just rounding back into shape enough to come on the field and do stretches with the rest of the team by the end of OTAs. It won't be long into camp before it's obvious what Allen has up his sleeve with Gordon, who just received a contract extension.

Well now that Kyler Gordon got an extensionAnd George Pickens has been TRADEDAll the fans who complained about that pick for YEARS can stop now right? Right? #Bears pic.twitter.com/7NKzInkh9A

Ozzy Trapilo got his snaps as a replacement for injured Braxton Jones. Kiran Amegadjie did, as well. Jones is supposed to be ready at some point, though no one is saying yet if it's at the start of training camp. 

There was no indication between the two tackles whether the slightly more experienced Amegadjie or rookie Trapilo receives first crack should Jones not be ready when camp starts following last season's broken ankle. 

We know no one wins jobs in OTAs but noting says pecking order can't be established.

Neither. #Bears TE was on the side of a milk carton in 2024Despite leading all NFL WR & TEs in catch rate (85.45%)and Leading all #Bears receivers in EPA/tgt (0.44 vs. 0.14 avg for DJ, Rome, Keenan & Swift), success rate, 1st down % and CPOE Thank God for Ben 🙌He'll… https://t.co/OBuiRariPv

If anyone on the roster needed to step up besides edge rusher Dominique Robinson during offseason work it was Pickens, their third-year defensive tackle. Robinson, who frequented the game-day inactive list last year, actually did step up and impress coaches. 

Pickens, meanwhile, couldn't be seen on the practice field until the end of OTAs and then only once briefly. 

His time for being inactive apparently extended over from games last year to offseason work.

The Bears have added Grady Jarrett, Shemar Turner and signed Chris Williams to a restricted free agent offer sheet at the defensive tackle position since last season. They even said Odeyingbo can slide there if need be, but it would be good to see him slide onto the practice field first. 

It's too crowded at the position for missing people to eventually have a role. What's in the works for Pickens, a third-round pick in 2023, is total guesswork.

Zacch Pickens has been a bigger draft bust than Velus Jones. https://t.co/OQZ8fsrTeC

With about a month and a half until training camp, three Bears second-round picks remain unsigned. It's a mystery how and when this gets resolved because it's a league-wide standoff and not just the Bears' negotiations failing. Picks 35-64 want guaranteed contracts like 33 and 34 received. The mystery will be who blinks and when.  Turner, Trapilo and Colston Loveland all could get off to late starts if this drags out.

Last I heard we were waiting on Luther Burden, Ozzy Trapilo, and Shemar Turner.Williams/Odunze didn't sign until July last year, though worth noting none of these players have missed OTA's or anything.

What's the deal with all of the soft tissue injuries from offseason? Loveland's is the most perplexing, because of how it occurred in rookie camp  back at the beginning of May. He suffered an injury, then was at practice the next day  but wasn't participating at OTAs.

It's not as if Johnson's offseason practices were particularly more strenuous physically than the ones Matt Eberflus conducted. In fact, from the sessions media saw, they looked slightly less physically challenging but with more mental work. This should be expected, though, when they're putting in new schemes.

The Bears went from Jim Arthur to Pierre Ngo as head strength and conditioning coach. Andre Tucker, the head athletic trainer, is still there. 

Yet, the number of players filtering out of practices because of injuries seemed to grow by the day.

It could simply be Johnson values having everyone available to a greater extent for the start of training camp than the past regime, and prefers keeping anyone with the slightest issue on the side. Or it could be they've simply been unlucky. 

It's better to be unlucky at this time of year than in training camp. 

Which NFL player has the most to prove this year? Caleb Williams was mentioned 1st on PFFs article but I think it's Trevor Lawrence. #DaBears #Jaguars #Bears pic.twitter.com/t2G2zQTuIY

Ben Johnson wants his offense run and says he likes this ability of Caleb Williams to leave the pocket and create. Jared Goff certainly didn't do this, but how much does Johnson really like this? 

It's easy to say you appreciate Williams bailing on the play and ad-libbing during the offseason when there are no stakes.  

How much does Johnson really like seeing Williams give up in practice on a play to try and create something on his own, though? It happened quite frequently at OTAs, and if Williams does it in games without producing enough big plays then there is the potential for a real firestorm. 

How these two can co-exist will be a very big mystery until it's clear.

These large, flightless birds have powerful, muscular legs and tough, prehistoric-looking feet with claws that can deliver a powerful blow.

Name: Southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius)

Where it lives: Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and northeastern Australia

What it eats: Fruit, seeds, fungi, insects, snails, fish, frogs, small birds, small mammals and carrion

Why it's awesome: The southern cassowary is one of the most prehistoric-looking birds on Earth. They are often likened to a modern-day dinosaur due to their massive size, vivid colouration and powerful, raptor-like feet, earning them the title of the ""world's most dangerous birds.""

Native to tropical rainforests, the southern cassowary is the heaviest flightless bird in Australia and the second-heaviest in the world, after the common ostrich (Struthio camelus). These birds can grow up to 5.6 feet (1.7 meters) tall and belong to the ratite group, which includes ostriches, emus and kiwis, according to the San Diego Zoo Fossil evidence and genetic studies suggest that cassowaries have existed in some form for tens of millions of years.

One of the cassowary's most prehistoric-looking features is its feet. Each foot has three toes, with the inner toe bearing a dagger-like claw that can grow up to 5 inches (12 centimeters) long. These claws aren't just for show; they're capable of delivering powerful, slashing kicks that can injure or even kill potential threats, including humans. Their legs are extremely muscular and adapted for quick, forceful movements, which helps them lash out at predators, such as crocodiles and pythons.

Cassowaries also have a striking and unusual appearance. Their heads and necks are bare and vividly colored in shades of blue and red, but their bodies are covered in coarse, black feathers that look more like hair than typical bird plumage. This coat provides protection from sharp thorns and branches as they move through dense vegetation.

The giant birds also have brightly-coloured pouches of flesh, called wattles, that dangle down from their necks. These are thought to help cassowaries relay social cues to others: For example, if they shake their heads and clap their wattles it may be a sign of territorial aggression.

—Hoatzin: The strange 'stinkbird' born with clawed wings that appears to be an evolutionary 'orphan'

—Turkey vulture: The bird that vomits acid up to 10 feet and poops antiseptic onto its legs

They also have large, helmet-like structures called 'casques' on top of their heads. The exact function of the casque is still debated among biologists, but research suggests these structures act as ""thermal windows,"" or radiators, allowing the bird to release excess heat in hot weather and conserve it in cooler conditions. It may also amplify and direct the birds' low-frequency calls, helping them communicate over long distances.

Unlike many animal species, male cassowaries are the primary caregivers for their offspring. They sit on their eggs for about 50 days and once the eggs have hatched, they tend to their chicks for around nine months.

Despite their fearsome nickname, cassowaries are generally shy and elusive and prefer to avoid confrontation and people when possible. However, attacks can occasionally happen if cassowaries are approached by humans.

In 2019, a man in Florida was killed by a cassowary that he was keeping as a pet. This was the first reported fatality in almost 100 years.

Two Democratic Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses were shot Saturday in what Governor Tim Walz said was likely a targeted political attack by a suspect impersonating a police officer.

Democratic House leader Melissa Hortman, 55,and her husband, Mark, were killed at their home. State Senator John Hoffman, 60, and his wife, Yvette, were wounded in a separate shooting at their home, authorities said. President Donald Trump has been briefed and condemned the “horrific violence,” according to a social post from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

GENEVA, June 14. /TASS/. Events after Israel's strikes on Iran may start developing according to the worst scenario and the conflict could spread to Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and the Persian Gulf countries, Hicheme Lehmici, secretary of GIPRI, a lecturer at the SWISS UMEF University of Applied Sciences Institute, told TASS.

According to him, the Israelis are acting at an accelerated pace in their attacks against Tehran without showing any intention to defuse tensions. ""And this is very alarming because it actually signifies a course toward an all-out war between Israel and Iran,"" Lehmici explained, noting that once it begins, the US will definitely get involved.

""And then the risk of an apocalyptic scenario materializing would be very real. We risk seeing either an Iraq-type scenario for Iran or, if Iran's resistance proves stronger, possibly a regionalization of the conflict, which could affect the entire territory from Israel to Iran, including Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and possibly the Gulf countries,"" the expert believes.

Overnight into June 13, Israel kicked off Operation Rising Lion aimed against Iran's nuclear program. The Israel Defense Forces said that 200 fighter jets attacked more than 100 targets in Iran, including nuclear facilities.

On the evening of June 13, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps announced that Iran retaliated by attacking dozens of targets in Israel with missiles, including military facilities and air bases, striking, in particular, the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv. Israel said some targets were hit but most of the missiles were intercepted.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"
