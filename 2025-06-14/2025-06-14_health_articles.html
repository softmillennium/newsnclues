                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blood vessels are essential to nearly all tissues, delivering nutrients and oxygen, regulating hemostasis, and modulating inflammation. Recreating functional vascular networks is foundational to both basic and translational vascular biology, however current methods to make blood vessels from stem cells are often slow, inefficient, or lack the complexity needed for therapy. In this study, researchers developed a fast and defined method to build vascular organoids-3D microvascular networks-from human stem cells. By precisely activating two transcription factors (ETV2 and NKX3.1), they were able to drive the formation of both endothelial and mural cells simultaneously. This resulted in self-assembling, functional vessels that can connect to host vasculature when implanted. This approach not only accelerates the process of building blood vessels but-critically-achieves full, independent control over the two major vascular cell types needed to build functional blood vessels. This level of control has not been previously demonstrated in other models. As a result, this system offers a powerful new platform for vascular network modeling, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have discovered a unique class of small antibodies that are strongly protective against a wide range of SARS coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and numerous early and recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. The findings, published in Nature Communications, offer a promising route to developing broad-spectrum antiviral treatments that could remain effective against future viral variants. SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, continues to be a potential threat as it evolves into newer variants that are resistant to currently approved antibody therapies. Resistance largely emerges because antibodies typically target virus regions, such as the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, that also frequently mutate, enabling escape from antibody recognition. To address this, a research team led by Prof. Xavier Saelens and Dr. Bert Schepens at the VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology explored a different strategy by focusing on one of the more stable subunits of the spike protein. The so-called S2 subunit is critical for the virus's ability to fuse with host cells, a process essential for infection, and it is more conserved across different coronaviruses. The team turned to llamas (more specifically a llama called Winter). Llamas generate so-called single-domain antibodies, also known as VHHs or nanobodies, that are much smaller than the antibodies generated by most animals, including humans. The researchers identified several llama antibodies that strongly neutralize a broad panel of SARS coronaviruses. What makes these antibodies particularly promising is their unique mode of action: they act like a molecular clamp. The antibodies showed strong protection against infection in lab animals, even at low doses. And when researchers attempted to force the virus to evolve resistance, the virus struggled, producing only rare escape variants that were much less infectious. This points to a powerful, hard-to-evade treatment option. This discovery marks a significant advancement in the quest for durable and broadly effective antiviral therapies, offering hope for treatments that can keep pace with viral evolution. "The combination of high potency, broad activity against numerous viral variants, and a high barrier to resistance is incredibly promising," adds Saelens. "This work provides a strong foundation for developing next-generation antibodies that could be vital in combating not only current but also future coronavirus threats."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Initially identified as a proto-oncogene, c-Fos is essential for neural activity, synaptic plasticity, and stress responses. This review synthesizes findings from postmortem studies, animal models, and cell cultures to elucidate the dual roles of c-Fos and its mechanisms in AD pathogenesis. c-Fos is expressed in specific brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex, mapping neural activity in response to stimuli. It is not limited to neurons; glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia, also exhibit c-Fos induction under stress or inflammation. This broad expression pattern underscores its role in both physiological and pathological states. In healthy brains, c-Fos is crucial for memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity. Its expression peaks during novel experiences but diminishes with habituation, reflecting adaptive neural responses. Disruptions in c-Fos function impair long-term memory, as evidenced by studies using antisense oligonucleotides. These pathways culminate in the formation of the AP-1 transcription complex, which regulates genes such as Arc and BDNF, essential for synaptic plasticity. The biphasic regulation of c-Fos-acute induction followed by adaptation-ensures efficient memory formation while preventing overstimulation. In AD, c-Fos expression is aberrantly elevated, correlating with amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and cognitive impairment. Aβ stabilizes c-Fos via O-GlcNAcylation, promoting apoptosis through AP-1 and ATF3. Chronic c-Fos activation disrupts synaptic function and exacerbates neuroinflammation, creating a vicious cycle of neurodegeneration. Studies in AD models reveal hippocampal hyperactivity and neuronal loss linked to c-Fos overexpression, suggesting its role in early disease markers. The pathological effects of c-Fos in AD stem from dysregulated calcium signaling, oxidative stress, and epigenetic modifications. Constitutive CREB activation and mitochondrial dysfunction further perpetuate neuronal damage. c-Fos promotes apoptosis via ATF3 and pro-apoptotic genes like Bim and cytochrome c. In AD, this pathway is hyperactivated, leading to widespread neuronal death. The ERK/FOS axis also intensifies inflammatory responses, highlighting c-Fos as a mediator of both apoptosis and neuroinflammation. Oxidative stress in AD activates MAPK pathways, upregulating c-Fos and disrupting mitochondrial function. This exacerbates ROS production and inflammatory cytokine release, further damaging neurons. The interplay between oxidative stress and c-Fos underscores its central role in AD progression. Its dysregulation in AD involves multiple pathways, including Aβ toxicity, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Targeting c-Fos modulation offers promising therapeutic avenues to mitigate cognitive decline. c-Fos Expression Differentially Acts in the Healthy Brain Compared with Alzheimer's Disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Women with breast cancer who were also carriers of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and received textured breast implants as part of their reconstructive surgery after mastectomy were 16 times more likely to develop breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a rare T-cell lymphoma, compared with similar women without these genetic mutations, according to a study published today in Blood Advances. Our findings show that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are a significant risk factor for developing this type of lymphoma, confirming earlier suggestions of a possible role. Paola Ghione, MD, lead researcher, lymphoma specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) She adds that the analysis underscores the need for women to include their personal history of mastectomy and implants long after surviving breast cancer itself. This is the first large study to look at whether the BIA-ALCL occurrence is higher among women who have a BRCA mutation, which is also responsible for the onset of breast cancer in 5-10% of cases. Earlier studies had shown an association between textured implants and the development of BIA-ALCL, leading to their recall from the European and U.S. markets in 2019. BIA-ALCL is a type of T-cell lymphoma that arises near textured breast implants, either as a collection of fluid or mass. It usually develops seven to 10 years after women undergo mastectomy and reconstructive surgery with implants. Breast implants are generally changed every 10 to 15 years, so there are many women who still have these implants in their bodies, Dr. Ghione explained. "If we look at the absolute numbers [seen in this study], it's still fairly rare, but the important thing to note is that when we look at women with this genetic predisposition, there is a big jump in the percentage with this lymphoma," she said. Other factors, including the type of implant filling (saline or silicone), age at breast cancer surgery, and prior cancer treatments (radiation or chemotherapy), were not found to be associated with developing BIA-ALCL. In this study, Dr. Ghione and her colleagues pulled from MSKCC's unique cohort of over 3,000 women who had breast implants as part of their breast cancer treatment and are followed over time to assess for complications. Within this group, 520 women were tested for the BRCA genes. They compared the prevalence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, confirmed through testing, between women who did and did not develop BIA-ALCL after reconstruction with textured implants only; smooth surface devices are not thought to carry the risk of lymphoma, Dr. Ghione explained. Women were followed for a median of 11.5 years. The researchers also conducted a case-control study with 13 BIA-ALCL cases matched one to three with 39 controls, which showed that the frequency of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations in BIA-ALCL cases was significantly higher than that of the controls. "The implants that are put in place now are theoretically safe; however, there are still a lot of women who are living with textured breast implants, so it's important that women know what implants they have and talk with their doctor and remember to report this surgery as part of their medical history," Dr. Ghione said, further advising women to ask about genetic testing, including for BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutations, especially if they were diagnosed or have family members diagnosed with breast cancer at younger ages. Given the low risk of BIA-ALCL, the FDA does not recommend having implants removed unless women are having symptoms. Symptoms can include pain, lumps, swelling, or unexpected changes in breast shape. However, the researchers said the study's findings should prompt women who have had reconstructive breast surgery because of breast cancer to have open discussions with their health care team about the type of breast implants they have and what steps they can take to minimize any risk. This study did not include women with the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations who underwent prophylactic surgery to prevent breast cancer. Dr. Ghione and team will continue to follow these women, as well as others in the cohort that have had textured implants removed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The proportion of patient harms associated with medical procedures, treatment, and contact with healthcare systems rose by 59%, from 11 million to 18 million globally between 1990 and 2019, finds a data analysis published online in the journal BMJ Quality & Safety. In developed nations, over 50% of inpatient harms are deemed preventable, rising to 83% in developing nations, note the researchers. These harms undermine health and the quality of life, are costly, and erode public trust, while squandering valuable resources, they add. But current estimates of the 'adverse effects of medical treatment' rely heavily on medical record reviews and voluntary reporting systems. In a bid to address this, they drew on data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for 204 countries for the period 1990-2019. The GBD includes information from a range of sources, including surveillance systems, government records, health facility reports, and surveys. The researchers looked at the overall and age standardised number of new incidents globally and nationally. Between 1990 and 2019, the global population increased by 45%. But over the same period, reported cases of patient harm arising from medical treatment rose faster—by 59% from around 11 million to 18 million. And the age standardised incidence rate was just over 233/100,000, representing an increase of 4.5%. And the age standardised incidence rate rose from 502 to 648/100,000, an increase of 29%. France was the only country in the high SDI region to buck this trend for all age groups, with the steepest decline in cases among 50 to 70 year olds, possibly because of a string of patient safety policies and measures implemented nationwide, suggest the researchers. The sharpest fall in overall incidence rate was observed in low SDI regions, falling by 14% from 155 to 141/100,000; the age-standardised incidence rate in these regions fell by around 10% from 147 to 139/100,000. Globally, the incidence remained largely unchanged across age bands up to the 45-49 year old age bracket. Cases among those aged under 1, 1-4, 5-9, and 10-24 fell. There are several possible reasons for the disparate trends between high and low SDI regions, suggest the researchers. These include the extent of healthcare provision, which is higher in wealthier and more developed countries. For example, the incidence of patient harm in the USA was about 50 times higher at all ages than it was in Indonesia. Higher incidence in the high SDI region may also reflect better monitoring systems and greater and more equitable population access to healthcare, not just poor quality or overtreatment, they suggest. And people are more likely to live longer in wealthier countries. As to the higher rates of patient harms among older people, the researchers suggest that drugs are likely to explain most of these as a result of age-related physiological factors affecting drug metabolism and clearance, polypharmacy, co-existing health conditions, and declines in cognitive and functional capacity reducing medication adherence. "This confluence of factors renders appropriate medication management exponentially more challenging in advanced-age populations with complex comorbidities," they write. The researchers acknowledge various limitations to their findings, including that many lower SDI countries lacked reliable original data, for which predictive estimates had to be substituted. But the researchers conclude: "As population age and medical services expand with socio-economic development, addressing [adverse effects of medical treatment] incidents becomes a universal imperative to safeguard patient wellbeing and ensure equitable access to quality healthcare."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is a growing body of evidence on the occupational health experiences of nail technicians, which can include musculoskeletal aches and pains (linked to poor ergonomic design), adverse respiratory, dermal, and ocular health impacts (linked to chemical exposures), worries about cancer and reproductive health (linked to long-term chemical exposures), and various digestive and neurological symptoms (linked to workplace stressors). While these studies contribute to work towards safe worksites, they may inadvertently reduce nail salons to sites of hazards and harms, as well as obscure the complexities of nail technicians' relationships to their work. In partnership with the Toronto-based Parkdale Queen West Community Health Centre's Nail Salon Workers Project, Dr. Reena Shadaan facilitated an arts-based approach to understand nail technicians' relationships to their work - beyond occupational hazards. "In the context of occupational health, looking at hazards is important. "However, a focus on the hazards alone erases the complexities of nail salon-based work and nail technicians. This can mean that a partial picture is interpreted as the whole picture, but hazards alone don't exclusively define this work or these workers." From February 2024 to May 2024, 19 Toronto-based nail technicians visualized their experiences of work and health on life-sized body-maps. Using various visual and textual elements, the body-maps highlight multiple layers of emotion—in the nail technicians' framing of their work experiences, in their labor as beauty service workers, and in their body-map creation processes. The arts-based body-maps allow for a more comprehensive understanding of nail technicians experiences as workers. They illustrate the occupational hazards and resultant bodily harms, but also the joys, such as in creative work and in interacting with long-time clients, as well as nail technicians' hopes and dreams for the future."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent study published in Engineering has shed new light on how the combinations of foods we eat over the long term, rather than just individual food items, can significantly influence cardiometabolic health. The findings suggest that the balance and imbalance of food intake, captured through long-term food pairing patterns, are independently associated with cardiometabolic traits and can modulate gut microbial functionalities. The researchers used normalized monthly consumption frequencies of individual foods to calculate these patterns. They identified 1759 and 306 cardiometabolic-related long-term food pairing patterns from the NHANES and GGMP cohorts, respectively, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. Notably, by comparing the cardiometabolic association results with single foods and long-term food pairing patterns, around 80.8%/82.5% of these pairing foods were not individually associated with cardiometabolic traits, indicating that the combined effects of food pairings play a crucial role in health outcomes. The study found that long-term food pairing patterns were weakly correlated with single food intake frequencies and various dietary indices, such as the Healthy Eating Index 2020 (HEI2020) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index. This suggests that food pairing patterns provide unique insights beyond conventional dietary indicators. The researchers also observed that the associations between food pairing patterns and cardiometabolic traits were consistent across Eastern and Western populations at the hyper food classification group level, despite significant differences in individual food intake patterns. Mediation analysis revealed that 72.7% of long-term food pairing patterns affected cardiometabolic traits through 31 microbial genera, with Clostridium sensu stricto 1 playing a predominant role. The researchers found that microbes primarily mediated the impact of long-term food pairing patterns on cardiometabolic traits through their metabolic pathways, such as pyruvate fermentation to propanoate and ergothioneine biosynthesis pathways. The study suggests that personalized dietary recommendations could benefit from incorporating long-term food pairing patterns, which may offer a more comprehensive understanding of how diet influences health compared to focusing solely on individual foods or dietary indices. Future research could explore the causal relationships between food pairing patterns, gut microbiome, and cardiometabolic health through longitudinal studies or controlled trials. Nonetheless, the study provides valuable insights into the potential role of long-term food pairing patterns in human health and opens new avenues for developing precision nutritional strategies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For decades, scientists have used near-infrared light to study the brain in a noninvasive way. This optical technique, known as "fNIRS" (short for "functional near-infrared spectroscopy"), measures how light is absorbed by blood in the brain, to infer activity. Valued for portability and low cost, fNIRS has a major drawback: it can't see very deep into the brain. This drawback has restricted the ability to study deeper brain regions without expensive and bulky equipment like MRI machines. Now, researchers at the University of Glasgow have demonstrated something previously thought impossible: detecting light that has traveled all the way through an adult human head. Their study, published in Neurophotonics, shows that with the right setup, it is possible to measure photons that pass from one side of the head to the other, even across its widest point. To achieve this, the team used powerful lasers and highly sensitive detectors in a carefully controlled experiment. This breakthrough suggests that it may be possible to design new optical devices that can reach deeper brain areas than current technologies allow. While the current method is not yet practical for everyday use-it required 30 minutes of data collection and worked only on a subject with fair skin and no hair-this extreme case of detecting light diametrically across the head may inspire the community to rethink what is possible for the next generation of fNIRS systems. With further development, this approach might help bring deep brain imaging into clinics and homes in a more affordable and portable form. This could eventually lead to better tools for diagnosing and monitoring conditions like strokes, brain injuries, or tumors, especially in settings where access to MRI or CT scans is limited.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Rising T1DE Alliance (Rising T1DE), a national collaborative spearheading innovation in type 1 diabetes care, is transforming how healthcare systems leverage data, technology, and collaboration to drive improved patient outcomes. Launched in 2020 through grant supports from The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, Rising T1DE's work is helping shape a future where proactive, integrated, real-time diabetes management becomes the new standard of care. Initiated in 2016 at Children's Mercy Kansas City, Rising T1DE was born from a bold vision: to use real-time, integrated data to guide clinical decision-making and prevent adverse outcomes. D-Data Dock helps clinical teams proactively identify and engage high-risk patients, enabling earlier, targeted interventions while reducing friction for research. The Rising T1DE Alliance is about building a proactive, learning-based care model where data integration, clinical insight, and continuous innovation come together to improve outcomes for people with diabetes." Mark Clements, MD, PhD, Rising T1DE Co-Chair and Medical Director of Innovation at Children's Mercy In 2024, Rising T1DE launched its next phase, focused on scaling adoption and refining implementation of the D-Data Dock across new health systems. This effort aims to build the frameworks, technical guidance, and operational playbooks necessary for widespread uptake of data-driven, patient-centered diabetes care. The team works closely with implementation sites like Lurie Children's, University of Cincinnati, and University of Kansas to test and refine rollout models. "Integrating technology into clinical workflows is only part of the equation. More value comes from building a learning ecosystem where insights are shared, interventions are tested in real-time, and scalable models emerge," said Juan Espinoza, MD, a pediatrician, Rising T1DE Co-Chair, and Chief Research Informatics Officer at Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute at Lurie Children's. Oversight and guidance are provided by the Community Stakeholder Advisory Board, chaired by Sanjeev Mehta, MD, MPH, Chief Medical Officer and Chief Medical Information Officer at Joslin Diabetes Center, with representatives from the Helmsley Charitable Trust, T1D Exchange, National Committee for Quality Assurance, and multiple clinical institutions. Rising T1DE continues to grow into a dynamic partnership of leading healthcare institutions, technology experts, and patient advocates. With a strong foundation and new support, the Rising T1DE Alliance is set to empower healthcare systems across the country to deliver high-quality, data-driven care that every person with diabetes deserves.
