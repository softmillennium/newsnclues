                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stanford soccer is hosting a very special guest this weekend. Per their social media pages, the United States Men's National Team is practicing at the Stanford training ground, as well as their stadium. On the run towards Sunday in San Jose. This is mostly a collection of teams from North American soccer championships, with KSA, or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, being the lone exception in the tournament. All four groups will compete for two spots in each group to qualify for the knockout rounds. From there, it is a one game elimination where teams have to survive and advance all the way until they hoist the trophy. If they qualify out of the group, they will have to win three knockout games to win the cup. Their first group game will take place on Sunday evening at PayPal Park in San Jose, home of the Earthquakes. The United States will take on Trinidad and Tobago in an effort to get an early lead in the group standings. With a great men's and women's soccer program, the Cardinal not only helped train for Sunday, but also provided an incredible facility that essentially no college can compete with. Over the last four games, the United States has gone 0-4, losing Nations League games to Panama and Canada, along with losses in friendlies to Turkey and Switzerland. However, Pulisic is staying put on his decision. His goal is to be ready for next year's World Cup after playing two 50-game season with AC Milan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — The FIFA Club World Cup begins Saturday night with Lionel Messi and Inter Miami from Major League Soccer in action against Egyptian Premier League champions Al Ahly at Hard Rock Stadium. Messi is healthy and expected to play, but his status will be confirmed when Inter Miami announces its lineup about an hour before the match. Don't expect Messi – the Argentine World Cup champion, eight-time Ballon d'Or winner and soccer's biggest star – to miss this one. Here's everything you need to know about tonight's match, and stay tuned here for live updates from the Inter Miami vs. Al Alhy match from USA TODAY Sports: ET at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. Messi is expected to play, but his status will be confirmed when Inter Miami announces its starting lineup before the match. Inter Miami and its former Barcelona stars in Messi, Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba (who won't play due to hamstring injury) enter the Club World Cup as a bit of an underdog despite being favored to win vs. Al Ahly. Under new coach Javier Mascherano, Inter Miami started this season unbeaten in its first 14 matches across all competitions (11 wins and three draws) but hit a major slump toward the end of April. It was outscored 23-15 in the first eight matches, before outscoring CF Montreal and Columbus Crew 9-3 in two wins before the Club World Cup. Al Alhy is regarded as one of the best teams in Africa. Messi will turn 38 years old on June 24 – which is one day after Inter Miami completes its group stage matches in the Club World Cup. Messi will turn 39 during FIFA World Cup 2026, which he has not yet declared to play in for defending champion Argentina. The presence of federal law enforcement officers, including those from U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), is relatively common at major sporting events, which often carry special designations that prompt more rigorous security. There are concerns that CBP and ICE will go beyond their traditional security roles at the Club World Cup. After Inter Miami-Al Ahly Club World Cup opener, four matches will be played across the country on Sunday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Riot police, fire and a chainsaw provided a violent backdrop to Club World Cup qualification for Esperance de Tunis. The 34-time league champions will face Flamengo, Chelsea and Los Angeles FC in Group D of the 32-team tournament this summer. Confederation of African Football [CAF] ranking points earned from 2021 to 2024 confirmed Esperance's participation. One final and two semi-final appearances in Africa's CAF Champions League helped send them to their fourth ever Club World Cup. However, a continental fixture in 2023 was interrupted by dramatic scenes that saw a riot make the headlines. Esperance beat JS Kabylie 1-0 in their quarter-final first leg to hold a one-goal advantage for the second leg at home in Rades. But during the break, some Esperance fans reportedly attempted to invade the pitch and therefore sparked a response from security. Riot police had to intervene as a number of objects were thrown by supporters that were said to come from an equipment storeroom. One rioter, whose face was covered, walked around the destruction with what appeared to be a live chainsaw. Another person had to quickly dodge out of its way to avoid what could have been a serious injury. Police also threw tear gas in their bid to control the supporters, 60 of which were reported to have been arrested. Mohamed Ali Ben Romdhane put them 2-0 up on aggregate and despite a late Kabylie goal, it was the Tunisians who progressed. Following their defeat, Kabylie released a statement that revealed their attempts to stop the match entirely due to the rioting fans. "Our leaders actively challenged the CAF officials about the unbearable atmosphere which called into question the safety of our supporters and that of our delegation, even going so far as to ask for the match to be stopped as time went by. Furthermore, we have been working since early this morning on preparing a virulent dossier, containing solid evidence that recounts the hell that was going on in Rades. Esperance were fined $300,000 and handed a four-match home stadium ban by the CAF as a result of the rioting. It meant no supporters were in attendance for their semi-final first leg match against Al Ahly, which ended in a 3-0 defeat. The Tunisian outfit were ultimately beaten 4-0 on aggregate to end their hopes of winning a fifth CAF Champions League title. Esperance open their 2025 Club World Cup campaign against Flamengo at the Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia on June 17. Los Angeles FC follow three days later before Chelsea arrive as their final group stage opponents on June 25. Watch all of the FIFA Club World Cup free on DAZN.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) authority has removed a controversial social media post highlighting its upcoming security presence around the upcoming Club World Cup after direct contact from FIFA expressing concerns. Last Friday, the CBP announced on its Facebook page and other social channels that its agents would be “suited and booted ready to provide security for the first round of games” while noting that the tournament begins at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium this Saturday. According to sources familiar with the conversations, speaking anonymously due to their sensitive nature, the post, which attracted thousands of interactions, was deleted after senior personnel from FIFA expressed concerns to the CBP about the reaction it had provoked. With President Trump's administration having made deportations and a clampdown on illegal immigration key objectives, the post sparked a wave of media and public attention, heightening concerns that fans may be deterred from attending games due to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and CBP presence. Following contact from FIFA, CBP removed the post. FIFA declined to comment when approached by The Athletic. Customs and Border Protection is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the FIFA Club World Cup is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event, including the Super Bowl. The organization's Air and Marine Operations will also be involved to enforce temporary flight restrictions around stadiums during matches. ICE agents will also be at Club World Cup games, as part of the overall security operation. FIFA president Gianni Infantino brushed the controversy aside earlier this week, telling reporters: “No, I don't have any concerns about anything in the sense that we are very attentive on any security question, of course the most important for us is to guarantee security for all the fans who come to the games, this is our priority.” FIFA has taken active steps to boost its promotional efforts for the opening games after the initial uptake of tickets was slow. Local college students in the Miami area have been given the opportunity to buy five tickets for just $20 for Saturday's clash between Lionel Messi's Inter Miami and Egyptian club Al-Ahly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>INGLEWOOD, Calif. — The U.S. men's national team failed its first competitive test of the Mauricio Pochettino era in rather embarrassing fashion, losing to Panama 1-0 in a CONCACAF Nations League semifinal here at a half-empty SoFi Stadium. The Americans played timidly, unimaginatively and laboriously for 90 scoreless minutes. They were booed off the field at halftime. They looked uninspired, even with a home-soil World Cup on the horizon. They seemed destined for extra time against a team they were heavily favored to beat — and one that, based solely on talent, they should have beaten. [You could win $25K in the Women's Bracket Mayhem contest. Panama prevailed, and jumped for joy at midfield as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and the rest of the USMNT's golden generation trudged out of sight, into Sunday's third-place match. Panama will face Mexico, which beat Canada 2-0 in Thursday's late game, in the final on Sunday. They played just as they had toward the tail end of the Gregg Berhalter era. Berhalter was fired following the Copa América, largely because the U.S. lost to Panama 2-1 after playing most of a group-stage match with 10 men. His mandate was to revive a plateauing program. But in his first true elimination game, with 11 men, the U.S. suffered a familiar fate. Under head coach Thomas Christiansen, Los Canaleros are now 4-1 against the U.S. in competitive games. They frustrated the USMNT yet again on Thursday, and earned a famous result. And they gave Pochettino, and players, and fans a lot to chew on at the start of this last full calendar year before a landmark World Cup. "We didn't show aggression with the ball" — nor without it. "The first half was really painful to see," Pochettino said. They played with none of “the grit, the desire, the nastiness” that McKennie said Pochettino has been trying to instill, and as a result, they have relinquished their grip on regional supremacy; they flunked one of only two competitions that they'll have between now and June 2026; and they got this critical phase of World Cup preparations off to a downright dreadful start.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIAMI — Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava has issued a statement saying the presence of a federal immigration agent at a South Florida barge party celebrating the advent of an international soccer tournament was “deeply troubling.” The incident further ratcheted up anxiety ahead of this evening's opening game of the FIFA Club World Cup, which takes place amid "No Kings Day" protests and a U.S. military parade in Washington, D.C.. The long-awaited international soccer tournament already was to kick off this evening in Miami under a cloud of immigration enforcement. Earlier this week, U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement issued an ominous social media post, which was subsequently deleted, declaring that "CBP will be suited and booted ready to provide security for the first round of games." The Herald reported attendees were asked for identification that purportedly would show their status. “This should not have happened,” Levine Cava said in a statement quoted by the Herald. “Ensuring that all community members feel safe and included is crucial to maintaining our county's reputation as a welcoming destination for both residents and visitors.” The opening game of the FIFA Club World Cup is scheduled at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, pitting local favorite Inter Miami FC and global star Lionel Messi against Egypt's Al Ahly squad. The tournament showcases the world's best soccer teams and is a prelude to next year's World Cup, which will match 48 teams in games to be played in 16 North American cities, including Miami. Another, England's Manchester City, is training in Boca Raton.</p>

Chelsea jetted off to the United States on Friday afternoon, taking 24 players to their training base in Philadelphia. The west London side, who have been drawn into Group D, won't have long to adjust to their surroundings before they step on to the pitch. On Monday night, Chelsea will lock horns with Los Angeles FC in their opening match. A few days later, Maresca's side will meet Flamengo before playing Espérance Sportive de Tunis in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Jacobs claims that Paez will stay with Maresca's squad and participate in training. Back in February, the Ecuadorian also spent some time at Chelsea's training base in Surrey to begin his integration. The Blues boss said: "When you are at Chelsea, your goal is always to win. You need to see it [replicating coaches of years gone by] as a source of fantastic motivation. "We were there last summer, and it's pretty great. "There's no doubt that it will be a great occasion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A rumor that circulated online in June 2025 claimed FIFA canceled or considered canceling U.S.-hosted 2026 World Cup matches and moving those scheduled events to Mexico or Canada — countries that are already hosting some matches. According to social media users' posts, FIFA, the international soccer governing body, received thousands of complaints from players, coaches and fans who refused to travel to the U.S. due to concerns over stringent immigration policies imposed by President Donald Trump's administration. For example, in early June, a TikTok user published a video (archived) announcing FIFA considered stripping the U.S. of its designation to host 2026 World Cup matches. The clip received nearly 900,000 views. The clip's narrator recounted the story as follows: FIFA is now considering stripping the United States of its right to host the 2026 World Cup, and all fingers are pointing directly at Donald Trump. Trump's latest policies are now threatening America's chance to host the world's biggest sporting event. His immigration crackdowns, trade sanctions, multiple nations have issued boycott threats, sponsors are panicking, and broadcasters fear massive global backlash. What was meant to be a global celebration has now turned into a political minefield under Trump's America First agenda. At the core of FIFA's concern is Trump's refusal to meet their secret demands. No tax breaks, no special visa privileges, and full financial transparency. The backroom deals FIFA has quietly enjoyed for decades are finally being exposed. Will FIFA actually pull the World Cup out of the U.S., or is this just another global power play aiming to punish Trump's refusal to surrender to international pressure? Other users also shared this rumor on Facebook (archived), Instagram (archived), Threads, TikTok (archived) and X (archived). However, searches of Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo, as well as The Associated Press, CNN, Fox News and The Washington Post, found no credible reporting about FIFA canceling or considering relocating U.S.-hosted World Cup matches outside the U.S., at least not as of this writing in early June 2025. Rather, this matter marked the latest chapter of users sharing false or unfounded rumors, including some posts featuring the use of artificial-intelligence (AI) tools. Snopes contacted FIFA's media relations representatives to inquire about the rumor's accuracy and will update this article with more information as it becomes available. The aforementioned lookups of search engines located some relevant news regarding Trump's policies and the 2026 World Cup, though again no reports confirmed the central claim about FIFA deciding to move U.S.-hosted games to Canada or Mexico. For example, in March, FIFA President Gianni Infantino met with Trump at the White House, with FIFA reporting Trump reaffirmed support for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and 2026 World Cup tournaments. On April 25, The Associated Press reported U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a member of the Democratic Party in Oregon, asked the Trump administration to reconsider policies impacting travelers arriving in the U.S., including citing upcoming sporting events like the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. In early May, NBC News reported members of Trump's Cabinet warned World Cup visitors to the U.S. not to overstay their visas. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also cast the tournament as "an opportunity for the world to become a friendlier place," adding, "We will take care of their documentation and travel documents, and it will go smoothly. And we will make sure that they can come and enjoy and bring their families and friends and make memories together." On May 13, Politico (archived) reported the details of a letter (archived) the Human Rights Watch organization addressed to Infantino. The letter cited Human Rights Watch's "grave concerns" about Trump's immigration policies, and urged Infantino to be "prepared to reconsider the hosting decision" if the safety of fans and players couldn't be guaranteed. Other reports told of concerns about long visa appointment wait times, as well as European countries issuing travel advisories for the U.S. Two days later, on May 15, Reuters (archived) reported Infantino reassured that "the world is welcome in America," referencing the 2025 and 2026 tournaments. Trump's travel ban, which targets 12 countries and adds restrictions on others, includes exceptions for "any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State."

The USMNT has lost four straight matches under Mauricio Pochettino. The vibes around the national team are borderline toxic, as fans become increasingly worried about their prospects at next summer's World Cup on home soil after being outmatched by Switzerland in an embarrassing 4-0 drubbing last week. Pochettino will hope that a return to form against inferior CONCACAF opposition will help the team get back on its feet, but with many first-team regulars absent from the squad this summer, it will be a tougher task than usual, even against nations with far lower rankings. Trinidad & Tobago, 100th in the world according to FIFA, are hoping to bolster their World Cup qualification journey with a strong Gold Cup performance. They have only qualified for one World Cup in the nation's history, back in 2006, but will never have a better chance than this cycle with the expanded field and three CONCACAF teams qualifying automatically as hosts. MORE: Christian Pulisic speaks following criticism of his USMNT absence this summer Ahead of their final competitive matches before next summer's World Cup on home soil, the United States are without a significant number of first-team regulars for myriad reasons. Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, and Gio Reyna are all participating in the Club World Cup and have stayed with their clubs, while Josh Sargent, Joe Scally, and Tanner Tessmann were all passed over for "football reasons" as Pochettino described it. Meanwhile, Antonee Robinson had knee surgery to solve a chronic issue that has plagued him for months, Folarin Balogun sustained an ankle injury, Ricardo Pepi continues to rehab from a long-term knee injury, Sergino Dest withdrew from the squad to protect his recent recovery from a torn ACL. Tyler Adams told The Sporting News he's dealing with turf toe. After missing the Switzerland friendly, it's unclear if he'll be back for competitive matches or if a longer absence is on the horizon. USA predicted lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Freese (GK) — Freeman, Richards, M. Robinson, Tolkin — Cardoso, de la Torre — McGlynn, Tillman, Luna— Agyemang. Defenders: Max Arfsten, Alex Freeman, Nathan Harriel, Mark McKenzie, Tim Ream, Chris Richards, Miles Robinson, John Tolkin, Walker Zimmerman. Midfielders: Brenden Aaronson, Paxten Aaronson, Tyler Adams, Sebastian Berhalter, Johnny Cardoso, Luca de la Torre, Diego Luna, Jack McGlynn, Quinn Sullivan, Malik Tillman. Head coach Dwight Yorke has his full squad fit and ready to compete, but he was forced to make a few cuts heading into the Gold Cup. Veterans left off the roster include ageing goalkeeper Adrian Foncette and 34-year-old defender Aubrey David, who were both not included in this summer's squad. Forward Reon Moore who has 32 international appearances and 10 goals was part of the Unity Cup squad earlier in the month but was left off as he continues to look for a new club. Another double-digit goal scorer not involved is Ryan Telfer, who plays for Canadian club Halifax Wanderers. Attacking duo Levi Garcia and Dante Sealy combined for three goals and two assists in their 6-2 win over St. Kitts & Nevis in World Cup qualifying last weekend, and both should see the field against the United States. Midfielders: Ajani Fortune, Wayne Frederick, Real Gill, Nathaniel James, Daniel Phillips, Andre Rampersad, Steffen Yeates. The United States looked outmatched and outgunned against Switzerland, but the lineup deployed against Turkey competed hard and deserved to get a result from that game. If Mauricio Pochettino goes back to the players who put in shifts through that first friendly, the USMNT should manage to handle Trinidad & Tobago, even if the Soca Warriors make it difficult by bunkering into a low block and hoping to hit with long-ball counters.

Modeled after the international FIFA World Cup, this newly restructured tournament is set to be held every four years, marking a major shift in the global club football calendar. Teams taking part are mainly the champions of their respective continental tournaments over the past four years — such as the UEFA Champions League and Copa Libertadores — with additional slots allocated to clubs from stronger confederations like Europe's UEFA and South America's CONMEBOL. European heavyweights in the lineup include pretournament favorites Real Madrid, holders Manchester City, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and this year's UCL winners Paris Saint-Germain. South America will be represented by the likes of Palmeiras, Flamengo, River Plate and Boca Juniors. Several high-profile clubs, including Premier League champions Liverpool, are notably absent. The qualification process has also drawn criticism, particularly the selection of Lionel Messi's Inter Miami to represent Major League Soccer instead of reigning MLS Cup champions LAFC, though the latter did eventually qualify through a play-in game. Ticket sales across several venues have reportedly been sluggish, suggesting that enthusiasm for the new format may take time to build. Armchair fans will nevertheless lap up a new summer showcase of elite club soccer, with big-name stars like Messi, Erling Haaland, Kylian Mbappé, Ousmane Dembélé and Jude Bellingham all set to feature. The great news for footy fans is that sports streaming platform DAZN is set to broadcast all 63 matches of the FIFA Club World Cup for free in almost every country on the planet, with coverage available in multiple languages. If you're not a member, it's easy to sign up for a free DAZN Freemium account using your email address to watch all the action at no cost through the DAZN app. As well as dedicated apps for iOS and Android, DAZN offers a wide range of support for set-top boxes and smart TVs. If you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the international soccer action while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN use to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance. If you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN use is crucial. ExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN and it works on a variety of devices. As well as DAZN, footy fans in the UK have a second option for watching FIFA Club World Cup matches that is also free. Free-to-air broadcaster Channel 5 is set to show 23 select fixtures live during the tournament, including 15 group games, four last-16 ties, two quarterfinals, one semifinal and the final. That also means those games can be live streamed via the network's My5 online service. Channel 5 is available through Freeview, Freesat, Freely, Sky or Virgin Media. Alongside DAZN's free coverage, pay TV broadcaster Foxtel and its sister streaming service Kayo will also be showing all 63 games. The service gives you access to a wide range of sports, including F1, NRL, NFL, NHL and MLB, and there are no lock-in contracts.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Without the financial backing of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, this summer's Club World Cup could have looked very different Saudi Arabia's money appears to be underpinning the revamped Club World Cup. That, after all, is where Real Madrid will kick off their Club World Cup campaign, with new signing Trent Alexander-Arnold set to make his debut. Real's Saudi opponents - Al-Hilal - highlight another intriguing aspect of the tournament. But the vast sovereign wealth fund's involvement in this competition does not stop there. In December, sports streaming platform DAZN agreed to pay Fifa - football's world governing body - $1bn for the tournament's global broadcast rights. This despite Fifa having previously struggled to find broadcast partners, and after DAZN had posted several billion dollars worth of losses over recent years. Then, a few weeks later, a subsidiary of PIF announced it had acquired a minority stake in DAZN for what it has since confirmed was $1bn - explaining at the time it was "an exciting opportunity to build on DAZN's significant successes in recent years by bringing more sports to fans and audiences around the world". Saudi ties with the Club World Cup strengthened further last week, when PIF became an official partner of an event Fifa president Gianni Infantino claims will "make football truly global". After all, Fifa had initially struggled to attract sponsors, and ticket sales for some games have been sluggish, with the event perhaps hampered by a complicated qualification system that means recently crowned domestic champions including Liverpool and Barcelona are not present. Expanding the event from seven teams to 32 has also sparked a legal complaint from both the international players' union and the body representing European leagues, who - despite Fifa denials - claim their concerns over a congested calendar and player workload have been ignored. But it is not just the timeline that has inevitably led to speculation over a possible connection between Saudi's investment in the expanded Club World Cup and that hugely controversial decision. Fifa stood by a fast-tracked process critics argued lacked transparency, and which it was felt effectively paved the way for the Saudis thanks to a decision that only bids from Asia and Oceania would be considered - even though the World Cup had been staged in the Middle East - in Qatar - as recently as 2022. The sense of inevitability surrounding Saudi's bid was only reinforced after Fifa's evaluation report awarded it a record high score. Ratification was then confirmed by acclamation - in the form of applause - rather than a traditional vote, with only Norway's football federation abstaining, and criticising the bidding process. Despite fears his tournament may be used to improve Saudi Arabia's image, Infantino has defended Saudi's hosting of football's 2034 showpiece, insisting it can be a catalyst for social improvements, and Fifa insists it was an open and transparent process. Nicholas McGeehan, of football campaign group Fair Square, told BBC Sport the World Cup process effectively acted "to ensure that Saudi Arabia was selected as host". "During this deeply flawed bidding process… Fifa sealed a commercially inexplicable broadcasting deal [for the Club World Cup] said to be worth $1bn with an entity that is now part-owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. "Fifa does not like the fact that many people look at these facts and conclude that there must be a linkage between them, but had it run a fair and transparent bidding process in the first place it wouldn't be under this scrutiny." Replying to BBC Sport's questions via his lawyer, Blatter - who remains banned from football until 2028 for breaches of its ethics code - said: "It is obvious that without Saudi's investment, the Club World Cup could not be organised in the US... it's only through financial help of $1bn from Saudi Arabia that the [DAZN] coverage of this competition was possible. "There is no more mystery... Saudi Arabia has taken control of international football." In a statement, a Fifa spokesperson rejected the suggestion that investment into the Club World Cup was from one country, saying it now had nine tournament sponsors and that "commercial momentum is strong". It added that the Club World Cup "is not responsible for calendar congestion", noting that it takes place once every four years with a maximum of seven matches for the two finalists. "We believe that this new Club World Cup will mark a turning point for club football worldwide…[it] is an event that football needed." Speaking to BBC Sport from Miami before the Club World Cup's opening match, DAZN's emerging markets chief executive Pete Oliver defended the investment in what he calls "a fantastic competition", insisting it made commercial sense. "This is an opportunity to establish ourselves as a global platform for football." Oliver said it was a "very logical deal" for DAZN, insisting the tournament would "take off" and was generating huge interest in regions such as South America. "We think this will be the most streamed sports event ever. It will help us build a huge customer database," he added, pointing out DAZN had recouped some of its outlay by regionally sub-licensing rights to some matches. Asked about PIF's subsequent investment in the company, Oliver said: "People always speculate but I can tell you we're not being used as a pawn or anything like that. "There was a lot that happened, but these things are not necessarily connected in any way. The investment we had from PIF was around a general investment, but also specifically to establish a partnership for the Middle East and North Africa region. "Saudi Arabia has wanted to own a sports broadcaster for well over a decade and has never really known how to pull it off," he says. "Fifa needed a global broadcaster for this tournament that could fund this thing, and DAZN now has a direct relationship with Fifa. All three parties have got what they wanted out of the equation." Speaking on condition of anonymity, one senior FA source told BBC Sport that Saudi's support for the Club World Cup was "a marriage of convenience". They felt Saudi's financial backing of the Club World Cup should be viewed as a "bailout" for Fifa, rather than an agreed plan. Fifa, the source said, would have initially been hoping to attract more interest from broadcasters and sponsors, but may have sought help from the Saudis. "Sport in the kingdom is still largely known for boxing and horse racing," they said. They'll be hoping it brings football to a wider public in their own country, and helps to tackle low attendances at some games." Sources close to the Saudi government told BBC Sport the country's investment is purely based on an opportunity for growth in a new market it can also benefit from, as it develops its own plans to use football to boost the economy, boost tourism and help modernise. It says it fully concurs with Infantino's recent claim that if the US and Saudi Arabia could develop their football industries, and there was less reliance on European football, the sport's annual GDP could double to more than half a trillion dollars in economic impact. Perhaps this helps explain why Fifa is reportedly already considering a 48-team Club World Cup in 2029 - in line with the expanded men's and women's World Cups. That is not how player unions will see such a prospect, as they insist their members are already at breaking point. Environmental campaign groups are also vehemently opposed to a competition that has gone from seven matches in a single city to 63 matches across 11 cities. If nothing else, this Club World Cup could reveal just how much more expansion the game is capable of, and willing to accept.
