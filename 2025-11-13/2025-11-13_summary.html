On my journey home, memories of my former life flooded me: the streets once beautiful, full of cars and smiling faces.

When I finally fled from my home in Gaza City to Khan Younis in southern Gaza this September, I left behind everything that reminded me of myself. I dreamed of returning, yet I kept wondering whether there was anything left for me to stay for in this land.

In the south, I felt like a stranger. If exile feels this hollow inside Gaza, what would life abroad be like? I spent a whole month in a tent among the trees, haunted by the details of Gaza — its streets, its scent, its mornings. The most painful part was knowing that I was still in Gaza, yet unable to reach my own city. I was displaced by force, not by “choice”: The tower I lived in was bombed twice. The situation was unbearable.

Every night, I sat outside the tent asking myself: How can they keep me away from my home, my life, my place, and all my memories? I dreamed of returning to a place only about 25 kilometers (15 miles) away — and yet, it felt unreachable. I became a stranger in my own land.

The day I was displaced to the south, September 23, was one of exhaustion and terror. Our area was heavily bombed, and when death began to close in from every direction, we decided to flee.

The journey took 10 long hours — filled with fear, fatigue, and chaos. Everyone was running from death, yet there were no vehicles to escape in. The few vehicles that existed were weak, overcrowded, and painfully expensive because of the soaring fuel prices.

This October, when I finally left my tent in Khan Younis and set off once again for Gaza City, the road wasn't much different. On October 10, the ceasefire was officially declared and enforced, but most of the conditions of our lives remain unchanged: I thought the war had finally ended — that I would no longer hear the sound of another explosion. But the opposite happened. The bombings and killings continued, justified by claims that displaced people were “illegally returning” to their homes in areas like Shujaiya, where Israeli forces remain present. Anyone found near the so-called “yellow line” — the border Israel drew to divide the territories it occupied, now controlling over half of Gaza's land (nearly 60 percent) — was targeted. Since the ceasefire, at least 245 Palestinians have been killed. Meanwhile fuel remains scarce and costly, transportation nearly nonexistent, and demand overwhelming due to the huge population.

We managed to book a bus to carry us — along with our mattresses — back to Gaza City. But because of the difficulties and the high cost of transport, we couldn't return until October 26. As I prepared myself for the journey and said goodbye to the relatives whose land in Al-Mawasi near Khan Younis had sheltered us, I felt something strange. I asked myself: How can everything change in a single moment?

We had left believing Gaza would be wiped out completely — that we would never come back, that another year of war awaited us. I still remember when our neighbor, Marwan Al-Namra, told my father: “Take everything you own to the south — we will never return.”

And yet, here we are, returning. It's as if the occupation has taught us not to hold on to any place — not even the tent that had become warm and safe for us, the tent we left behind after just one month.

We left Khan Younis at eight in the morning, boarding the bus with our belongings, our hearts swelling with joy at the very thought of returning. As my father always says, “Our souls are bound to Gaza.”

No matter how long or exhausting the road was, the mere idea of going back filled us with a happiness we hadn't felt in months.

But how could such pain exist on a road meant to lead us to hope? The journey was supposed to carry us home, yet it was heavy with despair. I tried to cling to my joy, but I couldn't. It wasn't physical exhaustion that broke me — after two years of war, that kind of tiredness had become part of us — but what I saw along the road.

People walked in silence, carrying their belongings, worn down by the impossibility of paying for transport. I saw a family returning on a donkey cart — their journey took 15 hours, a fragile ride through a land that felt dragged back to the 1950s.

As we passed the sea, the scene grew heavier. The shore was lined with tents; entire families were living on the sand. Children, barely 2 years old, sat under the burning sun, their only shelter a worn-out piece of fabric. I asked myself: How can a child survive both the heat of summer and the cold of winter inside a tent?

I knew, deep down, that nothing would truly change after the ceasefire. No one was speaking of rebuilding the city. And even if reconstruction began, as the driver murmured quietly, “Gaza would need at least 10 years to be rebuilt — but it will never be the same again.”

As I took all of this in, memories of my former life flooded me: the streets once beautiful, filled with cars and smiling faces, people strolling for leisure or exercise with those they loved.

For a moment, I stopped comparing, because I was comparing two entirely different cities: Gaza — warm by day, skies clear and bright, and by night illuminated with the soft glow of yellow lights and bustling cafés — versus today, a city that feels like a battlefield, a ghost town.

I reflected on this contrast while witnessing the tragedies along the road: How has selling vegetables and clothes on the street become normal? How are people living along the beach? Nothing is in its natural place.

I also remembered the suffering in my own neighborhood: the house I had taken refuge in for two years had no water, and some of its walls were destroyed.

I asked myself: How many wars are we living through? The war of weapons, of hunger, of lost homes, of scarce water?

After three hours on the road, we reached Gaza Valley — the valley that separates the north from the south. The Israeli occupation had classified everything before the valley as the north, and everything beyond as the south. It was a strange feeling, for how many tragedies have happened at this boundary? About 20 meters in, the driver told us that to the right of the valley there was a road designated by the occupation for displaced people. And from there, I saw Gaza City — I saw its destruction from afar.

Seeing it pierced my heart. I wanted to cry. A city like a bird with broken wings! And the closer we got, the closer we drew to the devastation. I passed many formerly beautiful places, like Al-Rashid Street, which was once lined with upscale restaurants overlooking the sea. I looked at the destruction and remembered the Lighthouse restaurant we used to visit on school trips. It felt as though the reel of my life was passing before my eyes.

An hour later, we arrived at Al-Rimal neighborhood, the neighborhood I had fled after it was heavily targeted and the Israeli army shelled the residential high-rise buildings where my neighbors and I were living. The scene was unbearably bleak: Since I last set foot in Al-Rimal, the destruction of the neighborhood had deepened, with the Israeli military turning more and more buildings to rubble.

On October 28, my father tried to repair our house and block its many openings with plastic sheets to keep out the dust and debris, but his attempts at repair were repeatedly undone by the force of nearby bombardments. On October 29, despite the ceasefire, there was a severe airstrike nearby around 3 am that destroyed everything my father had managed to fix. Even now, due to the lack of journalistic reporting, we don't know the exact location of the airstrike. And the next day, at 10 in the morning, Trump announced a return to the ceasefire. Those who had been killed were reduced to numbers with no value. Life returned to its cruel cycle: bombardment, then ceasefire — and this is how we continue to live today.

This is life in Gaza: bombardment and death, followed suddenly by the announcement of a ceasefire. It's as if we are living on land that is not ours, forced to endure everything. In Gaza, Israel is imposing collective punishment on us during its negotiations with Hamas. Whenever Hamas fails to meet certain demands, Israel immediately restricts food supplies, causing prices in the markets to skyrocket due to the limited availability of essential goods. We are still struggling to get meat and eggs — so far, we have eaten meat only twice, and eggs not at all. Meanwhile, Israel allows luxury goods to enter, while basic food remains nearly impossible for us to obtain.

I wish I had never lived to witness all of this — it is a kind of pain that steals the meaning of life itself.

Closeup of studded stilettos in trailer for The Devil Wears Prada 2 causes fashion debate on social media

Posting the first trailer for The Devil Wears Prada 2 on Instagram on her birthday this week, the film's star Anne Hathaway captioned the video with “it's everybody's birthday”, prompting copious comments featuring emojis of flames, hearts and – of course – the red shoe now associated with the film's poster.

But with the trailer circulating on social media, it's the shoes that have become the focus of fashion debate – and not in a good way.

The trailer starts with the feet of the film's fearsome fashion editor, Miranda Priestly, wearing red-studded Rockstud stilettos made by Valentino in 2010, a shoe that became popular with fashion editors of the decade.

It's this that has caused offence – the idea that someone so plugged into fashion would be wearing what is considered passe. On the Who What Wear Instagram account, in comments below Hathaway's post, followers made their feelings known. “Giving rockstuds that much airtime was a … choice,” wrote one, while another simply said “no to shoes”.

On TikTok, the creator NewsWithLils wrote: “I'm no fashion expert but even I know Miranda Priestly wearing Valentino rockstud shoes in 2025 is a diabolical move and not in a good way.”

The reaction is in line with a wider trend for online debate after the release of trailers or on-set images from films and TV that have a fashion angle.

In June, images from the forthcoming biopic series of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy were released, with the actor Sarah Pidgeon as Kennedy. They were quickly trashed by fans, with one describing the images as “fashion murder”, with everything from the shade of blond of Pidgeon's hair to the “wrong” handbag becoming a source of outrage.

Strong reactions around costumes demonstrate the love of fashion in film and TV, which is something those making the shows are no doubt conscious of – so much so a preview of “wrongness” in the costumes could be deliberate and designed to get the internet talking and create more buzz before release.

With the Rockstud, there's also the possibility that the tide could turn and the shoe be viewed as a clever choice – because something that feels so behind the times is, in fact, ripe for a revival.

“When I started at Vogue in 2011, I remember Rockstuds being a familiar sight,” says Julia Hobbs, a senior contributing fashion features editor at Vogue. “In my mind, there's something deeply nostalgic about them.”

She suggests there is more to come with the film. “If I were to play devil's advocate, I'd say I'm always here for a vintage shoe revival – if we can call the 2010s vintage, which is a debate for another day,” she says. “And if anyone can kickstart a shoe trend, it's Miranda Priestly.”

Republican Kevin Stitt commuted Tremane Wood's death sentence to life in prison for 2002 murder of Ronnie Wipf

After a controversial trial, an Oklahoma man makes a final plea to avoid execution

Tremane Wood, the 46-year-old death row inmate who faced execution on Thursday in Oklahoma, has had his life spared just minutes before he was set to receive a lethal injection.

Kevin Stitt, the state's Republican governor, accepted the Oklahoma pardon and parole board's recommendation that Wood's sentence be commuted to life in prison without parole. It is just the second time during Stitt's nearly seven years as governor that he has granted clemency.

Earlier in the day, the US supreme court issued a ruling denying a request from Wood's attorneys to stop the execution.

Wood was convicted of felony murder in the stabbing death of Ronnie Wipf, a 19-year-old migrant farm worker from Montana, during a botched robbery in 2002. Wood's attorneys have not denied that he participated in the robbery but maintain that his brother, Zjaiton (“Jake”) Wood, was the one who stabbed Wipf. Zjaiton Wood was sentenced to life without parole and died by suicide in prison in 2019 after admitting in court that he killed Wipf, said Tremane Wood's attorney, Amanda Bass Castro Alves.

In issuing the pardon, Stitt said in a statement: “This action reflects the same punishment his brother received for their murder of an innocent young man and ensures a severe punishment that keeps a violent offender off the streets forever.”

Stitt, who has served two terms and cannot run for re-election in 2026, has only granted clemency once during his nearly seven years as governor.

Wood has been imprisoned at the Oklahoma state penitentiary in McAlester for more than 20 years. The state's pardon and parole board issued an uncommon clemency recommendation last week.

“I'm not a monster. I'm not a killer,” Wood told the hearing via a video link from prison. “I never was, and I never have been.”

Wood's attorneys had argued, among other things, that trial prosecutors did not properly reveal details of a plea agreement with a key witness.

Prosecutors have painted Wood as a dangerous criminal who has continued to participate in gang activity and commit crimes while incarcerated, including buying and selling drugs, using contraband cellphones and ordering an attack on another person in the prison.

“Even within the confines of maximum security prison, Tremane Wood has continued to manipulate, exploit and harm others,” the state's attorney general, Gentner Drummond, said earlier.

Wood's son, Brendan Wood, spoke to the Guardian just outside the prison later on Thursday morning, having moments before been on the premises waiting to witness his father's execution. He said he felt “very joyous”.

“I feel lighter. I feel like a thousand pounds has been lifted off my shoulders”, Brendon Wood added.

He called the fact that the clemency was not granted until the minute that his father was about to be put to death “mental torture”.

Brendon Wood said: “I think there needs to be possibly some precaution in place maybe even a bill that prevents last-second decisions like this … I believe that a person wholeheartedly thinking that they are about to take their last breath, and its coming down to seconds, minutes before the decision is made … I find that to be mental torture, I don't find that to be humane.”

He added: “I think it is cruel and inhumane, mental torture because at that point they are trying to find their peace and find a place where they aren't going to go out in anguish.”

Jasmine Brown-Jutras, a community organizer and advocate for the Wood family said she was grateful and relieved.

“We saved him together, God saved him. Thank you to Governor Stitt for making the decision – the right decision – to give Tremane a chance at redemption and seeing his humanity,” she said.

She also talked of the stress of the last minute decision.

“My stomach still hurts, it was really scary and it's extremely traumatizing. All of the tears that I've had over the last weeks are not in despair that we won't have Tremane any more, it's in sadness for what trauma the family and what trauma Tremane and what trauma the legal team has been though. I can't thank God enough,” she said.

During testimony last week, Tremane Wood accepted responsibility for his prison misconduct and his participation in the robbery, but reiterated that he was not the one who killed Wipf.

“I regret my role in everything that happened that night,” he said.

In Florida, Bryan Frederick Jennings was scheduled to die by lethal injection on Thursday. In South Carolina, Stephen Bryant was scheduled to die by firing squad on Friday.

As well as the 41 people who have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the US, at least another 17, including Jennings and Bryant, are scheduled to be put to death during the remainder of 2025 and next year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

If you think that you're doing your body a favor by choosing diet soda over regular soda, new research suggests that your liver might disagree.

A study of nearly 124,000 people found that drinking just one daily serving of artificially sweetened drinks increased the risk of a liver disease known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). This condition involves fat buildup in the liver, which can cause inflammation, pain, fatigue, and loss of appetite.

            Newly released documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate have once again raised questions over Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's account of his friendship with the late sex offender and his denials of the allegations of his accuser Virginia Giuffre.
    


            The former prince told Epstein and convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell “I can't take any more of this” when informed 14 years ago that a British newspaper was going to publish a story about the trio.
    


            A fresh tranche of documents provided by Epstein's estate, some of which also mentioned US President Donald Trump, was released by the US House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.
    


            Among the thousands of documents was the email conversation from March 2011 in which Andrew repeatedly pleaded with the couple to make it clear that he had no involvement in the alleged activities.
    


            “Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations,” Andrew wrote to Epstein. “I can't take any more of this my end.”
    


            The messages were sent months after Andrew claimed to have severed all ties with the convicted pedophile in December 2010.  CNN has reached out to Andrew for comment following the latest release of material from the House committee.
    


            In what appears to be a separate email chain between the former Duke of York and Maxwell on the same day, discussing a response to the press enquiry from the Mail on Sunday newspaper, he wrote: “Hey there! What's all this? I don't know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can't take any more of this.”
    


            Andrew sent his messages after he was forwarded a right-to-reply email by Epstein from the newspaper, in which, he featured in several claims. The email alleged that a woman, whose name has been redacted in the released documents, worked as a masseuse for Epstein and met and had sex with Andrew at Maxwell's London home in 2001.
    


            It alleged that the masseuse met Andrew again at Epstein's New York residence where she and another girl were directed by Maxwell to sit on his knee, and he groped them before Maxwell directed the girls to have sex with him.
    


            It also alleged that the woman was later directed to stage an orgy for Andrew and Epstein on the financier's private Caribbean island, Little St. James.
    


            The emails appear to be referring to the claims of Virginia Giuffre, who has spoken extensively about her years of being sexually trafficked, allegedly at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking in 2022 and is serving a 20-year sentence.
    


            Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Epstein who died by suicide in April, repeatedly claimed that she was forced to have sex with Andrew while underage on three occasions – in London, New York and on Little St. James.
    


            She alleged that third encounter was “an orgy” on Epstein's island with the financier and “approximately eight other girls” who “appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn't really speak English,” as detailed in her posthumous memoir.
    


            She claimed that the-then prince was aware she was underage in the US when they were introduced.
    


            Andrew has always denied all allegations against him.
    


            “I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,” Andrew told the BBC in a television interview in 2019.  He said in the same sit-down that visiting Epstein in 2010 was the “wrong decision” and that he regretted acting in a manner that was “unbecoming.”
    


            In another email exchange with a journalist in July 2011, Epstein also appeared to discuss Giuffre and the now infamous photograph of Andrew with his arm around the then-17-year-old. The now former royal has repeatedly said that he has no recollection of the photograph being taken and has suggested the image could be fake.
    


            “Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew, as many of my employees have,” Epstein wrote.
    


            The disgraced financier also appeared to ask the journalist to investigate Giuffre.
    


            “I never misled you, this girl is a total liar,” Epstein wrote in the email.
    


            “Maybe your paper should jump on and show that (redacted)'s allegations re andrew (sic) are the same, she also accused numnerous (sic) people of having sex with her,” he added.
    


            Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn't admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre's suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.
    


            Earlier this month, after Giuffre's memoir reignited public attention on Andrew's links to Epstein, he was officially stripped of his titles in an extraordinary move by his brother, King Charles III.
    


            Meanwhile last week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee requested Andrew answer questions as part of the panel's investigation into Epstein and his accomplices. Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told the BBC that he has not responded yet to the committee's invitation to testify.
    


            The new cache of documents from the House committee also seem to shed further light on the extent of the contact between Epstein and Peter Mandelson, who was recently fired as British ambassador to the United States over his ties to Epstein.
    


            Emails show that the pair were in contact as late as 2016 when Mandelson appeared to reference Epstein's birthday two weeks earlier. “63 years old. You made it,” he wrote.
    


            Their exchange also appears to suggest that Mandelson had cautioned Epstein to avoid Mountbatten-Windsor, with the disgraced financier writing that “you were right about staying away from Andrew.”
    


            Mandelson responds, “Yes, without Andrew it would not have gone nuclear.”
    


            It's unclear exactly what the two men are referring to. CNN has attempted to reach out to Mandelson for comment.
    


            Mandelson was fired as Britain's ambassador to the US in September after Bloomberg published a trove of emails between him and Epstein which revealed the depth of their friendship.
    


            Those emails had shown that Mandelson had sent Epstein messages of support until 2010 – even after the sex offender was convicted of soliciting prostitution with a minor in Florida two years prior.
    


            Mandelson's ties to Epstein were known prior to his appointment to the post in Washington in 2024. But the September emails sparked a crisis for Britain's Labour government and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with many questioning why he appointed Mandelson despite concerns about his past.
    


            Britain's Foreign Office told CNN at the time that the emails showed that “the depth and extent” of the now-ex-ambassador's relationship with Epstein is “materially different from that known at the time of his appointment.”
    


            Following his dismissal two months ago, Mandelson said in a letter to embassy staff reported by the BBC that he continued “to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago and the plight of his victims.”

Lewis was fined $5m and given three years probation by New York judge over ‘brazen' insider trading scheme

Joe Lewis, the British billionaire and former owner of Tottenham Hotspur FC, is to be pardoned by Donald Trump over a 2024 conviction for his part in a “brazen” insider trading scheme.

Lewis, 88, was fined $5m (£3.8m) and given three years probation by a New York judge last year but was spared jail time after pleading guilty to involvement in a plan that prosecutors said was designed to enrich his friends, lovers and employees.

Lawyers for the east London-born investor initially accused prosecutors of making an “egregious” mistake by charging him with multiple counts of securities fraud and conspiracy.

But Lewis, who also owns the largest stake in one of the UK's biggest operators of pubs, bars and restaurants, Mitchells & Butlers, later changed his plea to guilty after prosecutors agreed to a non-custodial sentence.

Lewis retained his right to change his plea again if a custodial sentence were imposed.

In a statement to the court at his sentencing last year, he said: “I made a terrible mistake. I broke the law. I am ashamed, sorry, and I hold myself accountable.”

The judge, Jessica Clarke, said Lewis's circumstances did not warrant incarceration and imposed a $44m fine on his company, Broad Bay, on top of his $5m personal fine and probation.

But on Thursday, the Daily Telegraph was first to report that Trump now planned to pardon Lewis entirely. The Guardian understands that the fine will not be repaid to Lewis or his company.

Lewis said: “I am pleased all of this is now behind me, and I can enjoy retirement and watch as my family and extended family continue to build our businesses based on the quality and pursuit of excellence that has become our trademark.”

A source close to the family said: “Joe and the Lewis family are extremely grateful for this pardon and would like to thank President Trump for taking this action.

“Over his long business career, Joe has been a visionary, creating businesses across the world, which multiple generations of his family are now taking forward. There is so much more to the Joe Lewis story than this one event.”

Lewis already transferred his majority ownership interest in Tottenham to his family via a trust in 2022, the year before he was charged.

The north London football club is now overseen by Lewis's daughter Vivienne, his son Charles, and Vivienne's son-in-law Nick Beucher.

Details of the insider trading scheme were documented in a 29-page dossier published by the US attorney for the southern district of New York in 2023.

Prosecutors accused Lewis of passing on share tips based on inside information to his employees, including his private jet pilot and his then 33-year-old girlfriend, Carolyn Carter, to allow them to make a profit from stock trading.

Official confirmation of the pardon from the US Department of Justice is expected this week.

            Israeli settlers torched a mosque and sprayed it with graffiti in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, according to Palestinian authorities, the latest in a surge of increasingly brazen settler attacks against Palestinians.
    


            The Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs said settlers attacked the Hajjah Hamidah Mosque in Salfit in the northern West Bank, calling it a “heinous crime and a blatant assault on the feelings of Muslims.”
    


            “The attack resulted in parts of the mosque being set on fire and defaced with racist graffiti by settler gangs, who carry out daily assaults on Islamic holy sites and citizens' properties amid a systematic escalation in both the frequency and nature of these violations,” the ministry statement said.
    


            Images shared by the ministry showed writing in Hebrew on the exterior of the mosque saying, “Mohammed is a pig,” a reference to Islam's prophet, and “Not afraid of Avi Bluth.” Bluth is the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) commander in the West Bank, who issued a statement on Wednesday condemning the settler attacks and calling the perpetrators an “anarchist fringe youth.”
    


            Images showed parts of the interior damaged by fire, with a pile of charred debris scattered across the ground. The walls appear blackened with smoke and heat marks, and the glass of the windows smashed.
    


            The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the attack in a statement, saying it “holds the Israeli government fully and directly responsible for this crime and its consequences.”
    


            In a statement to CNN, the IDF acknowledged the attack, saying it dispatched forces to the scene to “review the incident and conduct scans” and transferred the case to the Israel Police for further processing. The IDF said “no suspects were identified.”
    


            Some 700,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territory the Palestinians want for a future state. Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are considered illegal according to international law.
    


            Settler attacks on Palestinians and their properties have surged this year, particularly during the olive harvest season in October and November. A United Nations report released last week found that Israeli settlers launched at least 264 attacks in October, the largest number since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006. The repeated attacks have marred this year's olive harvest.
    


            On Tuesday, dozens of Israeli settlers launched a major arson attack against an agricultural area in the northern West Bank village of Beit Lid, setting fire to a a new dairy factory and torching vehicles and tents in a nearby Bedouin community.
    


            Footage obtained by CNN showed the settlers pouring gasoline on cars and trucks before setting the vehicles alight. The video showed smoke engulfing the area, with Palestinian women wailing as men carry extinguishers and water buckets in a scramble to douse the fires.
    


            CNN visited the site of the attack and saw charred vehicles, and the damage left around the Bedouin community.
    


Dozens of Israeli settlers launch arson attack in West Bank as attacks against Palestinians surge



            Monjed Aljuneidi, an executive of Al-Juneidi Dairy and Food Company said the scene was “indescribable.” He recalled dozens of settlers scaling the factory fences from multiple directions.
    


            “I think it was just a message to scare us, to scare our employees… to try to enforce their reality on the ground… (but) we will continue operations, they can't stop us,” he said.
    


            In the nearby Bedouin community of Deir Sharaf, residents told CNN at least four Palestinians were injured and required hospitalization from the attack. They said settlers beat them and killed four of their sheep.
    


            Fifteen-year-old Nabil Dueis was tending to his livestock when the settlers rampaged the area.
    


            “It was terrifying, especially for the women and children…I was defensless against 100 of them…we need protection from the state” he told CNN.
    


            According to the IDF, the settlers then attacked Israeli soldiers and damaged and Israeli military vehicle.
    


            Israeli Police initially said it had arrested four suspects for questioning following what it called “extreme violence.” at the site. But by Wednesday evening, police said they had released three of the suspects.
    


            The Palestinian foreign ministry said the series of attacks “affirms the increasing terrorism and crimes of the settlers, carried out with the direct support of the occupation government, as part of a systematic and widespread policy aimed at undermining the rights of the Palestinian people.”
    


            Palestinian officials called on international and Islamic institutions to take action to ensure accountability.

LUGANSK, November 13. /TASS/. The Ukrainian army command is threatening to kill its own soldiers who refuse to fight in Kupyansk, Vitaly Ganchev, head of the Kharkov military-civilian administration, said at a press conference in response to a question from TASS.

"Of course, they are being coerced. They are told: either you go to fight, or we will abandon you there – and sometimes even bury you ourselves. We know how nationalist blocking detachments treat mobilized [Ukrainian] soldiers who refuse to fight. They did not want to fight when they were living their ordinary lives in Kharkov, Odessa, or elsewhere. And they still do not want to fight even when holding an automatic weapon," Ganchev said.

He emphasized that former Ukrainian soldiers who had already surrendered to Russian forces spoke of such threats from their own commanders. Despite the risks, they lay down arms to Russian troops in hopes of saving their lives.

"As soon as they turn themselves in, they are essentially liberated – freed from the oppression of their commanders. So, of course, they tell everything as it is," Ganchev added.

Russian rapper Morgenshtern has been banned from entering Lithuania for 10 years after the government deemed him a potential "threat to national security."

Morgenshtern had been scheduled to perform in Vilnius, the country's capital, later this month. Vilnius Mayor Valdas Benkunskas welcomed the rapper's entry ban, telling the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 13 that his city is "not a guest house for (Vladimir) Putin worshippers."

"I truly appreciate the decision of the national institutions, by which they expressed a clear position on the absurdity of the situation we had before," Benkunskas said, adding that it would have been Morgenshtern's third concert in Vilnius since the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine.

"Previously, appeals were made to the awareness and responsibility of the event organizers, but it changed nothing, so it was not enough. Finally, Lithuania said 'stop' to this."A spokesperson from Lithuania's Migration Department told the Baltic News Service that the ban "takes effect immediately" but provided the media outlet no other information. Although Morgenshtern, whose real name is Alisher Valeyev, was sanctioned by the Russian government as a "foreign agent" in 2022, he has a history of publicly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and making questionable statements about Ukraine.In a 2019 interview with Russian journalist Yuriy Dud, Morgenshtern referred to Putin as "the man" and said it's better to "accept everything" than to fight injustice in the world. During a 2021 interview with Ukrainian journalist Dmitry Gordon, Morgenshtern refused to acknowledge that Russian-occupied Crimea is part of Ukraine and said that "as a showman" he respects how "the whole world fears Putin."Some have praised Morgenshtern's songs post-2022 as being anti-war, but many of them, like the song "12," avoid political framing with broad statements like "He is Ukrainian, I am Russian. We make music together. We want peace. We want friendship."News of Morgenshtern's 10-year ban from entering Lithuania comes as the European Union moves to tighten multiple-entry visa rules for Russian citizens, citing security concerns. The EU has also called for Russian visa applications to be "scrutinized thoroughly and frequently" to "mitigate threats to public policy or internal security."European governments have sounded the alarm over a growing wave of hybrid operations aimed at Ukraine's allies in the European Union and NATO, including arson, cyberattacks, infrastructure sabotage, and drone incursions.Critics of the measures caution that the crackdown on multiple-entry visas could put Russian democracy activists, independent journalists, human rights defenders, and others who dangerous work within Russia at heightened risk. However, exemptions to the tightening of visa rules may apply to humanitarian cases, family members of EU citizens, Russian citizens who are legally residing in the EU, and certain professionals.

Her newsletter Explaining Ukraine with Kate Tsurkan, which focuses specifically on Ukrainian culture, is published weekly by the Kyiv Independent and is partially supported by a generous grant from the Nadia Sophie Seiler Fund. 

Kate co-translated Oleh Sentsov's “Diary of a Hunger Striker,” Myroslav Laiuk's “Bakhmut,” Andriy Lyubka's “War from the Rear,” and Khrystia Vengryniuk's “Long Eyes,” among other books. Some of her previous writing and translations have appeared in the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Harpers, the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Review of Books, and elsewhere. She is the co-founder of Apofenie Magazine and, in addition to Ukrainian and Russian, also knows French.  





Saakashvili requested the status "with the corresponding legal consequences," adding that "Ukrainians never abandon their own." Kyiv has previously managed to free civilian Ukrainian captives during exchanges with Moscow.

Ihor Fursenko, one of the key members of the group allegedly laundering money from the scheme, was formally employed at Fire Point to save him from mobilization and allow him to travel outside of Ukraine, according to a snippet of dialogue released in the trial.

The two Ukrainian companies targeted were Ekofera and Imperative Ukraine, which the U.S Treasury says are Ukrainian front corporations.



Rubio also confirmed that the U.S. is not interfering in the expansion of a Hungarian nuclear power plant by a Russian company. "We want them to be able to complete it because we want them (Hungary) to be energy independent," he said.

Germany is preparing to reintroduce compulsory military service under a new model agreed by the country's main political parties during joint consultations on Nov. 13, Tagesschau reported, citing ARD's Berlin bureau. A formal press conference is expected later on Nov. 13.

Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden have agreed on a joint arms donation intended to strengthen "air defense and support for the Ukrainian Air Force," the Danish Defense Ministry said.

Explosions were reported in the Russian city of Oryol overnight as authorities simultaneously declared missile and drone threats in the region, according to local residents and Russian media. 



Russian rapper Morgenshtern has been banned from entering Lithuania for 10 years after the government deemed him a potential "threat to national security."

Ukrainian Defense Forces reportedly struck "several dozen" targets.

The two are implicated in the $100 million corruption scandal centered on the state-owned nuclear power company Energoatom, which has rocked the country since Monday.

The hearings were held after the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) charged eight suspects with bribery, abuse of office, and illicit enrichment in a large-scale corruption case involving the state nuclear power company Energoatom on Nov. 11.

Hello, this is Chris York reporting from Kyiv on day 1,358 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story so far:

President Volodymyr Zelensky has insisted that Ukrainian soldiers are not being "pushed to die for the sake of ruins" in the defense of Pokrovsk, as concerns mount over the fate of the embattled city.

Russian troops have encircled Pokrovsk on three sides, leaving only a roughly 15-kilometer (nine-mile) corridor for Ukrainian forces to bring in reinforcements and supplies, according to the Ukrainian open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState.

In an interview with Bloomberg published Nov. 13, Zelensky admitted the situation is "very difficult," but insisted any decision to withdraw from the city was down to military commanders. 

"Nobody is pushing them to die for the sake of ruins," he said. "I will support our soldiers, especially commanders who are there, how they can control the situation. Or it's too costly for us — the most important for us is our soldiers."

More than two weeks since Russian soldiers were filmed breaking into the urban area of the mining city in Donetsk Oblast en masse, the city has descended into a deep gray zone, in which the concept of territorial control is lost in a fog of chaotic movement.

"The situation hasn't changed that much in Pokrovsk," a Ukrainian drone pilot fighting in the area, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the Kyiv Independent last week.

"It's a mess, with a bunch of our soldiers and a bunch of bastards and all of them mixed together."

Three civilians were killed by a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone while fleeing fighting in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine's 77th Brigade said on Nov. 13.

"Drone pilots of the 77th Brigade recorded another crime — a strike by an FPV drone on civilians who were traveling on a motorized tractor between the settlements of Zagryzove and Boguslavka, Kharkiv region.

"People were trying to evacuate from the fighting area, but at that very moment, Russian forces deliberately attacked them with a drone."

A Russian Su-27 crashed inside Russia on Nov. 13, according to media reports.

The SHOT Telegram channel said it went down in the Republic of Karelia which borders Finland and both crew members on board were killed.

Russia's Defense Minsitry later confimed the incident: "The plane crashed in a deserted area. The flight was carried out without ammunition. The crew of the plane died."

Germany is preparing to reintroduce compulsory military service under a new model agreed by the country's main political parties during joint consultations on Nov. 13, Tagesschau reported, citing ARD's Berlin bureau. A formal press conference is expected later on Nov. 13.

According to ARD, beginning in 2026, all 18-year-old men will be required to complete a mandatory questionnaire assessing their motivation and physical fitness for military duty.

Ukraine carried out a series of long-range strikes on Russian military infrastructure in occupied Crimea, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and on Russian territory overnight on Nov. 13, using several types of domestically produced long-range weapons, including Flamingo and Bars missiles, Ukraine's General Staff reported.

According to the report, Ukrainian Defense Forces struck "several dozen" targets as part of efforts to degrade Russia's military, logistical, and economic capabilities.

"To conduct complex strikes, Ukraine employs attack UAVs, loitering munitions, and various types of missiles. Last night, several long-range strike systems were launched, including the domestically developed Flamingo, Bars, and Liutyi (drones)," the report said.

The Flamingo is a domestically produced missile which was described by President Zelensky as "the most successful" missile Ukraine currently has. It has a claimed range of 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) and a 1,150 kilogram warhead.

Russia has not taken control of Pokrovsk, but the area remains Russia's primary offensive focus, with the highest number of daily assaults and a significant concentration of Russian forces, Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 13.

Syrskyi said he recently traveled to the sector to assess the progress of earlier tasks and coordinate further actions with local commanders.

"There is no talk of Russian control over the city of Pokrovsk or the operational encirclement of the Defense Forces of Ukraine group," Syrskyi said in a post on Telegram.

"Stabilizing the situation depends largely on effective coordination between command bodies and units operating in the area," he said, adding that Moscow is also attempting to use difficult and foggy weather conditions to push forward.

Pokrovsk, with a pre-war population of around 60,000, has been a key target for Russia in recent months. Since this summer, Russian reconnaissance and sabotage groups have entered the city but have so far failed to capture it.

At least three people have been killed and nine others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Nov. 13.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 102 out of the 138 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys launched by Russia overnight, according to a post from the Air Force. Thirty-six drone strikes occurred at 10 locations, the post said.

Kharkiv and Oblast: 3 killed, 4 injured

The most brutal attack occurred in Kharkiv Oblast, where what preliminary reports suggest was a drone strike on a two-wheeled tractor near the village of Bohuslavka killed three people and injured one, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov.

In the city of Kharkiv, overnight drone strikes injured a 58-year-old man, a 54-year-old man, and a 60-year-old woman, authorities reported.

Kherson and Oblast: 4 injured, 1 dead

In Kherson Oblast, Russia's documented practice of targeting civilians with FPV drones continued: a man born in 1947, a resident of Osokorivka, was fatally wounded in a strike at around 8 p.m., Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.

Other strikes on villages and towns in the region injured another four people, according to Prokudin.

Zaporizhzhia Oblast: 1 injured

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces targeted another civilian with an FPV drone — a 52-year-old man in the village of Huliaipole received multiple injuries to his limbs and torso, according to Ivan Fedorov, head of the Zaporizhzhia Regional State Administration.

Russia has lost around 1,155,360 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Nov. 12.

The number includes 1,180 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.According to the report, Russia has also lost 23,567 (+11) armored fighting vehicles, 67,211 (+88) vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,388 (+9) artillery systems, 1,242 (+2) anti-aircraft systems, 1,540  multiple rocket launchers,  and 79, 945 (+141) drones.

MOSCOW, November 13. /TASS/. Russia is forced to proceed with its special military operation since Ukraine has no intention to negotiate, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.

"Given the lack of an opportunity to continue negotiations, we will certainly proceed with the special military operation to achieve the objectives set by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief and the President [Vladimir Putin]," Peskov said at a news briefing while commenting on the recent statement by the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry to halt talks with Russia on the conflict settlement.

He also reiterated that Russia is still open to settle the Ukrainian conflict by political and diplomatic means.

"Russia is open to settling the Ukrainian conflict via political and diplomatic means. But with the lack of such an opportunity, when the doors for this have been slammed shut by the Kiev regime, we continue with the special military operation," according to Peskov.

British-based daily The Times published an article on November 12 based on an interview with Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Kislitsa, who was cited as saying that there was no "significant progress" in the Russian-Ukrainian negotiations this year and Kiev decided to "withdraw" from contacts with Moscow on the conflict settlement.

Russia has repeatedly stated its readiness to continue negotiations with Ukraine and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated this in early September. The Russian top diplomat emphasized that the diplomatic settlement of the crisis in Ukraine remained a priority for Russia and the sides achieved some progress in this regard during three rounds of direct negotiations earlier in the year.

Alexey Polishchuk, director of the Second Department of CIS countries at the Russian Foreign Ministry, told TASS on November 12 that Russia was willing to resume the negotiation process in Istanbul with Ukraine, and the ball is in Ukraine's court.

The first round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine was held in Istanbul on May 16, where the sides agreed on exchanging prisoners on the "1,000 for 1,000" formula and submitting memorandums on the aspects of overcoming the crisis.

The second round of resumed direct negotiations was also held in Istanbul on June 2. Following it, the sides exchanged peace terms as well as agreed on exchanging severely injured prisoners of war and the bodies of deceased servicemen. Moscow also handed over to Kiev several thousand bodies of fallen soldiers.

A third round of direct Russia-Ukraine talks on the Ukrainian settlement took place in Istanbul on July 23. Before a collective meeting, delegation heads Russian Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky and Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, held a one-on-one conversation. The collective meeting lasted about 40 minutes during which the sides discussed the positions outlined in draft memorandums.

Ukraine carried out a series of long-range strikes on Russian military infrastructure in occupied Crimea, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and on Russian territory overnight on Nov. 13, using several types of domestically produced long-range weapons, including Flamingo and Bars missiles, Ukraine's General Staff reported.

According to the report, Ukrainian Defense Forces struck "several dozen" targets as part of efforts to degrade Russia's military, logistical, and economic capabilities.

"To conduct complex strikes, Ukraine employs attack UAVs, loitering munitions, and various types of missiles. Last night, several long-range strike systems were launched, including the domestically developed Flamingo, Bars, and Liutyi (drones)," the report said.

The Flamingo is a domestically produced missile which was described by President Zelensky as "the most successful" missile Ukraine currently has. It has a claimed range of 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) and a 1,150 kilogram warhead.

In occupied Crimea, Ukrainian weapons hit the Morskoy Neftyanoy Terminal oil storage facility, a helicopter parking site, and locations where Russian forces store and prepare drones at the Kirovske airfield, as well as an air-defense radar station near Yevpatoriya.

In occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian forces targeted an oil depot near Berdyansk and forward command posts of Russia's 5th Combined Arms Army and the 127th Motor Rifle Division.

The General Staff added that Ukrainian strikes also hit multiple sites inside Russia, with the scale of damage still being assessed.

Earlier on Nov. 13, local authorities in Russia's city of Oryol reported explosions. 

Local Telegram channels posted videos showing loud blasts and debris falling into residential areas. No casualties have been confirmed.

While President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Flamingo as the "most successful" missile in Ukraine's arsenal in August, the maker of the domestically produced missile, a deep-strike drone company called Fire Point, is tainted with controversy.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) has been investigating Fire Point over concerns that it inflated the components' value or the number of drones it delivers to the army, or both, sources with knowledge of the investigation, who include current and former govrnment officials and industry representatives, told the Kyiv Independent in August.

Weapon production has been kept a wartime secret, making it difficult for independent investigations to scrutinize money flows.

Fire Point confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that the investigation exists but denied the accusations, downplaying its significance.

Saakashvili requested the status "with the corresponding legal consequences," adding that "Ukrainians never abandon their own." Kyiv has previously managed to free civilian Ukrainian captives during exchanges with Moscow.

Ihor Fursenko, one of the key members of the group allegedly laundering money from the scheme, was formally employed at Fire Point to save him from mobilization and allow him to travel outside of Ukraine, according to a snippet of dialogue released in the trial.

The two Ukrainian companies targeted were Ekofera and Imperative Ukraine, which the U.S Treasury says are Ukrainian front corporations.

Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has long been a supporter of Taiwan and called earlier this year for Tokyo and Taipei to 'jointly address defence challenges.'Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images

China on Thursday demanded Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi retract remarks she made about how a conflict over Taiwan might prompt a military response from Japan, warning Tokyo would “bear all consequences” if she does not. 

Ms. Takaichi, a conservative nationalist and China hawk, became Japan's first female prime minister in October. At the time, Beijing broke with protocol by not formally congratulating her, and when she met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit later in the month, a photo showed him looking severe and stone-faced, a stark contrast to his easy smiles and laughs with other leaders. 

That frostiness has since given way to outright hostility after Ms. Takaichi's comments about Taiwan, a self-ruled island over which China claims sovereignty – a stance rejected by an overwhelming majority of the Taiwanese people. 

Speaking to lawmakers last week, Ms. Takaichi – who wants to increase military spending and amend Japan's post-World War II pacifist constitution – warned an attack by China against Taiwan could “constitute a situation threatening Japan's survival.” That is the current bar for the Japanese military to intervene in an ostensibly foreign conflict. 

Beijing issued a formal protest and Tokyo responded in kind after a senior Chinese diplomat in Japan, Xue Jian, shared an article about Ms. Takaichi on social media, writing that the “filthy neck which sticks itself in uninvited will be cut off without a moment's hesitation.” 

China accuses Canada of ‘provocative actions' in Taiwan Strait transit

Mr. Xue later deleted his post, and Tokyo sought to downplay the spat. While refusing to retract her remarks, Ms. Takaichi has characterized them as in-keeping with Japan's long-standing posture regarding peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and suggested she would not repeat them. 

Any chances of tamping down the drama went out of the window this week however, as Chinese state media launched a barrage of criticism against Ms. Takaichi, with one outlet calling her a “political opportunist” who appeared to have been “kicked in the head by a donkey.” 

“If Takaichi keeps crossing the line and talking crap, she might have to pay a price,” said a post by Yuyuan Tantian, a publication under state broadcaster CCTV which often issues commentary on foreign affairs. 

Another CCTV publication focused on Taiwan said Ms. Takaichi's comments had been “extremely egregious in nature and impact” and warned “such reckless words and deeds will have profoundly harmful consequences.” 

“Those who start a fire will get burned by it,” the post read. “Japanese leaders attempting to disrupt the situation in the Taiwan Strait and the region are destined to dig their own graves.” 

Referring to calls by Japanese lawmakers to expel Mr. Xue, Hu Xijin, an influential former editor of the state-run tabloid Global Times, wrote on social media that “China will inevitably retaliate.” 

He called Ms. Takaichi “an evil witch,” who has “successfully ignited a new explosion of mutual hatred between Chinese and Japanese public opinion.” 

China begins military drills around Taiwan in ‘stern warning' to Taipei

Speaking to reporters in Beijing on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said Ms. Takaichi's comments had been “egregious,” and warned were Japan to “dare to intervene militarily in the Taiwan Strait situation, it will constitute an act of aggression and China will surely strike back head-on.”

Ms. Takaichi, a protege of former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe, has long been a supporter of Taiwan, and called earlier this year – before she became prime minister – for Tokyo and Taipei to “jointly address defence challenges.” While her comments did go further than Japanese leaders have in the past, Tokyo has long warned of the potential risks a conflict over Taiwan could bring to Japan.

Taiwan is a former Japanese colony and Tokyo still controls several islands less than 150 kilometres from the Taiwanese coast, which have come under threat from Chinese military drills in the past, with missiles landing in Japanese waters. Japan also hosts multiple major U.S. military bases which could be targeted by China if Washington were to intervene in a conflict over Taiwan. 

The fierce condemnation of Ms. Takaichi comes after a summit between Mr. Xi and U.S. President Donald Trump notably did not touch on Taiwan, a rarity in such discussions and amid a renewed pressure campaign by China against Taipei. 

Last week, China launched its third and most-advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, which would be expected to be involved in any potential conflict over Taiwan. The People's Liberation Army has also been seen testing landing barges that could potentially be used in an invasion scenario – though most analysts believe such an action is not imminent and may never be militarily feasible. 

In a statement Wednesday, the G7, which includes Japan, Canada and the U.S., expressed concern over “China's military build-up” and reiterated a long-standing opposition to “any unilateral attempts to change the status quo,” across the Taiwan Strait “particularly by force or coercion.”

Unfair labor practice strike on ‘red cup day' in over 40 cities comes amid stagnant negotiations with coffee chain

More than a thousand Starbucks workers have commenced a strike in more than 40 cities across the US on Thursday amid stagnant negotiations with the world's largest coffee chain over a first union contract.

On the company's annual “red cup day”, hailing the start of the lucrative holiday season, Starbucks Workers United is launching an unfair labor practice (ULP) strike, with rallies planned in locations including New York City; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Chicago, Illinois; Columbus, Ohio; and Anaheim, California.

About 65 stores are initially affected. Organizers plan to expand the strike to more locations should executives hold firm – and want customers to steer clear of the chain as part of a campaign dubbed “no contract, no coffee”.

Starbucks said it was “disappointed” that Workers United had voted to strike, rather than continue bargaining, but insisted the “vast majority” of stores would be unaffected by the action. The company stands accused of “stonewalling” at the table by union officials.

Since the first Starbucks store voted to unionize in 2021, more than 650 have followed, in the face of vehement opposition from the chain's management. Contract negotiations broke down earlier this year, following the union's rejection of Starbucks' economic offer.

Starbucks Workers United announced last week that workers had voted to authorize an open-ended ULP strike with 92% voting in favor. The union had spent months demanding that managers consider new proposals to improve staffing and pay, and resolve hundreds of unfair labor practice charges filed by the union against Starbucks throughout its organizing campaign.

“We have not been given meaningful proposals to finalize this contract since the announcement of the strike authorization vote,” Jasmine Leli, a Starbucks barista for three years and strike captain from Buffalo, New York, told the Guardian. “The baristas are prepared to do whatever it takes to get this finalized contract.”

Striking baristas are asking that customers “do not buy at Starbucks while workers are on strike”, Leli added, to help “win the fair contract that we have spent many, many months negotiating with Starbucks”.

“We've waited long enough,” said Leli. “We are so close to finishing this contract, and we need them to just finish it.”

The beginning of the strike coincides with Starbucks' “red cup day”, a promotion in which customers receive a reusable red holiday cup with the purchase of a holiday drink. It is typically one of the company's biggest sales days of the year.

The chain is scrambling to turn around its US business and win back customers, after several years of sluggish sales. In September it announced plans to shut more than 100 cafes across North America and lay off about 900 corporate staff.

“Union baristas mean business and are ready to do whatever it takes to win a fair contract and end Starbucks' unfair labor practices,” said Michelle Eisen, a Starbucks Workers United spokesperson and veteran barista of 15 years. “We want Starbucks to succeed, but turning the company around and bringing customers back begins with listening to and supporting the baristas who are responsible for the Starbucks experience.

“If Starbucks keeps stonewalling, they should expect to see their business grind to a halt. The ball is in Starbucks' court.”

A spokesperson for Starbucks, Jaci Anderson, said: “We are disappointed that Workers United, who only represents around 4% of our partners, has voted to authorize a strike instead of returning to the bargaining table. When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.”

Any contract “needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners”, added Anderson. “The facts show people like working at Starbucks. Partner engagement is up, turnover is nearly half the industry average, and we get more than 1m million job applications a year.

“Our customers can be assured that our partners will be ready to serve them at the vast majority of our more than 10,000 company operated coffeehouses and nearly 7,000 licensed locations throughout the holiday season, regardless of the union's plans.”

Canada is in the running to headquarter a new multinational bank dedicated specifically to financing defence projects, a sea change for a sector that has traditionally been shunned by the country's financial institutions.

The Defence, Security and Resilience Bank, or DSRB, is a multilateral lending institution being established by a collective of countries that includes NATO members and their Indo-Pacific allies. 

If it were headquartered in Canada, it would bring about 3,500 jobs in defence finance to the country, along with the advantage of being the global hub for meetings of member countries, according to Kevin Reed, the president of the bank's development group.

“This is Canada's time to lead in NATO and with our allies in defence finance. Canada has the leadership – we're known for our finance prudence – and we have the support of a lot of other nations if we choose to take the lead,” he said while testifying before the federal government's standing committee on industry and technology on Nov. 5. 

The blueprint for the DSRB was laid out last year by Rob Murray, the chief executive officer of the bank's development group. Mr. Murray is also the founding architect of NATO's Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, as well as its Innovation Fund.

Federal budget earmarks $6.6-billion to grow defence industry with focus on emerging tech

The DSRB, to be established by the end of 2026, will include as many as 40 member countries. Twelve will be anchor countries, tasked with ratifying and governing the bank's founding charter and choosing the location of its headquarters. Those 12 are currently being finalized, and industry members, as well as members of the bank's development group, are lobbying Ottawa to throw its hat into the ring.

Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne told The Globe he is open to discussions about the bank being headquartered in Canada and is keen to learn more about the cost, and opportunity, for the country.

Glenn Cowan, the founder and managing partner of defence-focused venture capital fund ONE9, says Canada missed out when it didn't join the 24 NATO allies establishing the NATO Innovation Fund for defence, security and resilience. He sees this as a second chance.

“That was a huge missed opportunity. So the question I would pose rhetorically to anyone in the position to help decide this is, ‘Do you want to miss out on this again?'” he said.

Banks like this don't come around too often. Most recently, the New Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure Bank were established in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Similar institutions such as the World Bank Group are set up to mobilize capital to address issues affecting multiple countries. In the case of the DSRB, that issue is an increasingly divided world in which countries all over the world are increasing their defence spending.

A handful of institutions, including Royal Bank of Canada, JPMorgan Chase & Co., ING Group NV, Commerzbank AG and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, have already signed on to help establish the DSRB.

The bank will be owned by its member countries, which will be asked to contribute in two ways: paid-in and callable capital. The former is an upfront contribution made when a country joins the bank, like a down payment. The latter is a promise to provide extra money if the bank is ever in a crisis – a factor that will help secure a AAA rating for the bank.

Any contributions made by NATO members should count toward their commitment to spend the equivalent of 5 per cent of GDP on defence.

Defence companies in Canada have come up against a wall of stigma in the past when seeking financing domestically, Mr. Reed told the industry committee. “Companies, just because they were in the defence category, were debanked,” he said, referring to the banking practice of terminating relations with a client based on perceived risk.

A lot of that stigma stems from environmental, social and governance standards that do not look favourably upon financial institutions lending to defence firms. This is changing, slowly, across banks, pension funds and insurance companies, Mr. Reed said, but there's still a way to go before more credit and equity become available. 

Opinion: Ottawa defence procurement risks being mired in bureaucratic mess

“We have to be able to finance our entrepreneurs, because if we don't finance our entrepreneurs, we don't build the capability,” he said.

The DSRB will work with national banks to co-finance countries and companies and indirectly, through guarantees, with commercial banks. This will make it easier for banks interested in lending to a defence company to offer more loans, at better rates, with less risk. 

Drones, munitions, cyberinfrastructure, AI and other technologies with both civilian and military uses are among the projects the DSRB intends to finance.

If Canada were to win the bid for the DSRB's headquarters, Sonya Shorey, the president and CEO of Invest Ottawa, is jockeying for her city to be the beneficiary. “Canada's capital region brings together innovation, technology and national policy. Having the DSRB anchored here would integrate finance into that triad.”

Whoever lands the headquarters for the bank will have a home court advantage in terms of securing financing for their domestic defence industries, Ms. Shorey said.

Explosions were reported in the Russian city of Oryol overnight on Nov. 13 as authorities simultaneously declared missile and drone threats in the region, according to local residents and Russian media. 

A brief shelter-in-place alert was issued around 4:30 a.m., followed by loud noises and strong blasts that residents captured on video, including footage of debris falling into a residential area.

Local online communities said air defense systems were active and claimed several aerial targets were destroyed, while residents reported unidentified drones in the sky. 

"Several cars and the windows of balconies in apartment buildings and private homes were damaged," Oryol Oblast Governor Andrey Klychkov wrote. "At this time, there is no information about casualties."

Ukraine's General Staff confirmed on Telegram that Ukrainian forces conducted overnight strikes on Russian territory using Flamingo missiles and other domestically produced systems. It is not specified what exactly was used in the attack on Oryol.

Oryol has multiple oil depots and a military base used to launch Shahed drones toward Ukraine. The region lies roughly 150 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports at the time of publication.

Ukraine regularly targets military and industrial facilities in Russia and in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.

On Nov. 11, Ukrainian forces struck an oil refinery in Russia's city of Orsk, Orenburg Oblast. According to the General Staff, the attack targeted Orsknefteorgsintez, a refinery that produces over 30 types of petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation kerosene, and oils.

Saakashvili requested the status "with the corresponding legal consequences," adding that "Ukrainians never abandon their own." Kyiv has previously managed to free civilian Ukrainian captives during exchanges with Moscow.



Ihor Fursenko, one of the key members of the group allegedly laundering money from the scheme, was formally employed at Fire Point to save him from mobilization and allow him to travel outside of Ukraine, according to a snippet of dialogue released in the trial.

The two Ukrainian companies targeted were Ekofera and Imperative Ukraine, which the U.S Treasury says are Ukrainian front corporations.



Rubio also confirmed that the U.S. is not interfering in the expansion of a Hungarian nuclear power plant by a Russian company. "We want them to be able to complete it because we want them (Hungary) to be energy independent," he said.

Germany is preparing to reintroduce compulsory military service under a new model agreed by the country's main political parties during joint consultations on Nov. 13, Tagesschau reported, citing ARD's Berlin bureau. A formal press conference is expected later on Nov. 13.

Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden have agreed on a joint arms donation intended to strengthen "air defense and support for the Ukrainian Air Force," the Danish Defense Ministry said.

Explosions were reported in the Russian city of Oryol overnight as authorities simultaneously declared missile and drone threats in the region, according to local residents and Russian media. 



Russian rapper Morgenshtern has been banned from entering Lithuania for 10 years after the government deemed him a potential "threat to national security."

Ukrainian Defense Forces reportedly struck "several dozen" targets.

The two are implicated in the $100 million corruption scandal centered on the state-owned nuclear power company Energoatom, which has rocked the country since Monday.

The hearings were held after the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) charged eight suspects with bribery, abuse of office, and illicit enrichment in a large-scale corruption case involving the state nuclear power company Energoatom on Nov. 11.

            Pakistan's parliament approved a constitutional amendment on Wednesday to expand the powers of the army chief and curb the remit of its Supreme Court, a move that critics said had done irreparable harm to the country's democracy.
    


            The lower house of parliament approved the legislation with a more than two-thirds majority, with only four lawmakers voting against.
    


            The upper house passed the bill two days earlier after the opposition boycotted the debate — an unusually swift passage for a constitutional change. Such amendments usually require weeks or months of consideration. The amendment will become law once signed by the president, a formality.
    


            Army chief Asim Munir will now be elevated to the new post of Chief of Defence Forces, placing the navy and air force under his command in addition to the army. After completion of his term, he will retain his rank and have legal immunity for life.
    


            Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the amendment as a step toward institutional harmony and national unity.
    


            “If we've made this part of the Constitution today, it's not just about the field marshal,” Sharif said, adding that it also recognized the air force and navy. “What's wrong with that?” he asked the speaker. “Nations honor their heroes … We know how to show and earn respect to our heroes.”
    


            Critics say the changes concentrate power in the hands of the military and the ruling coalition.
    


            Under the amendment, constitutional cases will move from the Supreme Court to a new Federal Constitutional Court, whose judges will be appointed by the government. In recent years, the Supreme Court has blocked government policies and ousted prime ministers.
    


Two blasts a day apart in India and Pakistan's capitals fray regional nerves in an already tense year



            Opposition lawmakers from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), founded by jailed former premier Imran Khan, walked out before the vote and tore up copies of the bill in protest, saying they had not been consulted.
    


            “None of the parliamentarians cared about democracy and the judiciary being eliminated. They have voted for being a silent observer whilst the country becomes a banana republic,” PTI spokesman Zulfikar Bukhari said. “Rest in peace constitution of Pakistan.”
    


            Legal experts warned the reform could erode judicial independence.
    


            “We are facing completely uncharted territory: a breach in our judicial system the likes of which we haven't seen in almost a century,” said constitutional lawyer Asad Rahim Khan. “The members slapping each other on the back should prepare themselves for when they'll be seeking relief from the same courts they have destroyed and subordinated to the state.”
    


            Constitutional lawyer Mirza Moiz Baig said the amendment spelled “the death knell of an independent judiciary,” giving the prime minister and president power to hand-pick the chief justice and other judges of the new Federal Constitutional Court, weakening its ability to check government overreach.
    


            The military has long wielded extensive influence in Pakistan's politics, but the reforms give it greater constitutional backing that would be difficult to reverse.
    


            “With the amendment's passage, parliament has done what previous dictators could only dream of,” Baig said.

Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre speaks at a news conference in Calgary, on Wednesday. On Nov. 4, 2025, MP Chris d'Entremont crossed the floor from the Conservatives to the Liberals.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press

Pierre Poilievre was asked Wednesday if he had reflected on his leadership style “moving forward.” The answer was simple: “No.” 

True to his word, Mr. Poilievre did what he does. He attacked.

He attacked Prime Minister Mark Carney, which is part of his job. And he attacked the MP who crossed the floor last week from his Conservatives to the Liberals, Chris d'Entremont, which looked like the sourest of sour grapes. Then he attacked CTV and CBC and the news organizations who dared to ask about MPs quitting his caucus. 

Never explain, never reconsider. Attack.

What about Mr. d'Entremont's complaint that the Conservative caucus often felt more like a frat house than a serious party? 

“Are you with the CBC by the way? Mr. Poilievre asked. He tried to ask the reporter questions.

Robyn Urback: Can the Conservative caucus please eat a Snickers bar?

No matter. The leader has spoken: There is no need to change. Or even think about it. No one should ask about it, there's nothing to see here, and any suggestion there might be is angrily rebuffed.

Is that a good strategy to buck up the Conservatives and bolster his leadership? Mr. Poilievre promised to keep on fighting the Liberal agenda. Most current members of the party joined to vote for Mr. Poilievre as leader, so perhaps the make-no-apologies, fire-all-cannons response is a way to unite his troops in battle. 

But strategy or not, it's what he does. And will keep doing.

Mr. Poilievre's criticism of Mr. d'Entremont came in the form of reading quotes of the Nova Scotia MP criticizing Mr. Carney and the Liberals – and that's fair game, even if the quotes were full of the carbon-copy phrases that the Conservative Party's communications office gives MPs to say. Certainly, floor-crossers can be hoisted on their own past partisan statements. 

But Mr. d'Entremont's accusations about the party's negativity and the frat-house culture, possibly a reference to the caucus leadership's clubhouse love of gotchas and wild blasts, might hit a little closer to home, even for some of Mr. Poilievre's own MPs. 

Mr. Poilievre's response to any question about caucus departures was to repeat the same quotes, or to tell a CTV reporter that his network should be covering Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith's critique of last week's federal budget. Incidentally, CTV had already aired a story about that. 

In the same news conference, Mr. Poilievre made the wild-eyed claim that a leaked government report had said that “Liberal policies have us on track so that Canadians will have to forage and hunt for food because they can't afford groceries.” 

In truth, that's not what the report said. It was not a prediction, but one of the admittedly weird, what-if, “future lives” thought-experiment reports occasionally published by a small government group – in this case, imagining what 2040 could be like if Canada's declining social mobility gets far worse.

Opinion: Floor-crossing is not a threat to Canadian democracy – in fact, it might be beneficial to it

But hey, why not claim a secret government report says the Hunger Games are on their way? Unless, of course, some of your own caucus were already perturbed when you told YouTubers that former prime minister Justin Trudeau would be locked up if the RCMP didn't cover for him. Maybe all that stuff is better left in the frat house.

Of course, Mr. Poilievre is supposed to criticize Mr. Carney's government. You also have to expect partisans to criticize floor-crossers. The Conservatives called Mr. d'Entremont a liar – even though they accepted Liberal defectors in the past. 

But Mr. d'Entremont was well-liked by fellow Conservative MPs. He told the CBC that what “sealed the deal” on his floor-crossing was when Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer and the party's whip, Chris Warkentin – two senior caucus officers close to Mr. Poilievre – barged into his office and started yelling at him. 

If there are other Conservative MPs irritated by the way the caucus leadership has treated them, then sending a message that the leader has no regrets might not be the best way to prevent more defections.

The Decibel: Two Conservative MPs are gone. Where does the party go from here?

Whatever. It's full speed ahead.

With that, Mr. Poilievre has also left himself little choice but to demand that every single one of his MPs show up for next week's confidence vote on the budget – to declare, on the record, they are against Mr. Carney's Liberal agenda and are with the Conservatives. And leave it to other parties to avoid an election. 

There can be no reflection. When in trouble, the response must be a redoubling. That's what Mr. Poilievre does.

Marco Rubio has denied claims Britain stopped intelligence sharing with the US over its strikes on “narcoboats” in the Caribbean.

CNN reported on Tuesday the UK was no longer providing sensitive information because it believed the US attacks on the boats suspected of smuggling drugs to its shores are illegal.

However, Mr Rubio, the US secretary of state, denied the claim following a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Canada.

It was a “false story”, Mr Rubio said, adding the US had a strong partnership with the UK.According to CNN, Britain had cut off intelligence sharing a month ago because it did not want to become entangled in attacks it has deemed illegal.

The UK has intelligence assets based in several of its territories in the Caribbean, and in the past has helped Washington identify drug boats so they can be intercepted by the US Coast Guard.

However, British officials reportedly believed the strikes, which have killed at least 76 people, break international law and agree with an assessment by the UN's human rights chief that they amount to “extrajudicial killing”.

Donald Trump's administration has faced criticism in Congress about the legal basis on which it is proceeding with the attacks, of which 19 have been publicly announced.In a memo to congressional committees, the US president signalled he was invoking sweeping wartime powers to justify the policy, which began in early September.He declared the US was in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, whose members he called “unlawful combatants”, which under international law allows countries to kill enemies who pose no immediate threat.Mr Trump has also argued the attacks are justified because each boat is laden with enough narcotics to kill 25,000 Americans.

Top government officials briefed a group of congressional leaders last week on the military campaign, which is taking place in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.Democrats said they need more clarity on how the strikes are conducted and the legal justification for doing so, following claims by critics that the administration is violating both international and US law.“What we heard isn't enough. We need a lot more answers. And I am now asking for an all senators briefing on this issue,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said following the meeting.

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Thursday that an individual attempted to confront Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba on Wednesday night, "destroyed property in her office" and then "fled the scene.'

"Thankfully, Alina is ok," Bondi added. "Any violence or threats of violence against any federal officer will not be tolerated. Period. This is unfortunately becoming a trend as radicals continue to attack law enforcement agents around the country."

"We will find this person, and the individual will be brought to justice. Our federal prosecutors, agents, and law-enforcement partners put their lives on the line every day to protect the American people, and this Department will use every legal tool available to ensure their safety and hold violent offenders fully accountable," Bondi also said.

Habba said following the incident that, "I will not be intimidated by radical lunatics for doing my job."

The Justice Department, on its website, said, "As Acting U.S. Attorney and Special Attorney to the United States Attorney General," Habba "is responsible for overseeing all federal criminal prosecutions and the litigation of all civil matters in New Jersey in which the federal government has an interest.

Randolph ‘Buster' Murdaugh Jr. speaks on a possible rush to judgment on his father on 'The Fall of the House of Murdaugh' on Fox Nation.

Blanca Turrubiate-Simpson, who worked for the Murdaugh family for more than a decade, says one detail finally convinced her that Alex Murdaugh had murdered his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul.

In an exclusive interview with People, the longtime Murdaugh employee discussed the details that led her to believe that the now disgraced South Carolina lawyer killed his wife and son in 2021. Turrubiate-Simpson wrote that she long trusted Alex and loved the family she served.

"There was no universe in which Alex could have committed these crimes," she wrote in her new memoir, "Within the House of Murdaugh: Amid a Unique Friendship – Blanca and Maggie," co-written with Mary Frances Weaver, which will be released this month.

But after the June 7, 2021, killings at the Murdaughs' Moselle estate in South Carolina, small inconsistencies began to trouble her.

The morning after the murders, Maggie's Mercedes SUV had been parked in an unusual spot, something Turrubiate-Simpson said Maggie never did.

Pajamas and a pair of underwear were laid out neatly in the laundry-room doorway, even though Maggie "never wore underwear to bed," Turrubiate-Simpson said.

"I knew automatically that wasn't her," she told the outlet.

In Alex's bathroom, she found a puddle of water, a towel and a pair of khaki pants she recognized from the morning before. She also noticed that the shirt Alex wore in a Snapchat video that day disappeared and was never seen again.

NEW TEXT MESSAGES FUEL ALEX MURDAUGH'S PUSH FOR NEW TRIAL

Months later, Alex asked her if she remembered him wearing a Vineyard Vines shirt on the day of the murders.

"You remember what I was wearing that day," she remembers him telling her, she writes. "You know, the Vinny Vines [Vineyard Vines] shirt."

Turrubiate-Simpson said she did not, saying she remembered ironing a seafoam green polo. The question, she said, felt like an attempt to change his story from that night.

"One thing was for sure," Simpson writes. "He was lying."

Her turning point came during Alex's 2023 murder trial, when she saw police bodycam video showing a beach towel on the front seat of his car.

The longtime housekeeper said she had washed, dried and folded that towel earlier that day and placed it on a high shelf in the laundry room.

"When I saw that towel in his car, I said, ‘Oh my God. He did it,'" she told People.

She speculates in the book that Alex hosed himself off near the kennels and either changed there or back at the house.

Alex, she speculates in the book, "went to the laundry room, grabbed the towel to finish drying himself, and possibly took the freshly washed T-shirt hanging there."

Alex told police he had been sleeping in the main house at Moselle when Maggie and Paul were shot. He said he went to his parents' house in nearby Varnville to check on his father, Randolph Murdaugh, 81, who died three days after the murders. 

Alex said that when he returned to Moselle at 10:07 p.m., he found the bodies of his wife and son and called 911.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The six-week government shutdown that came to an end late Wednesday will be another drag on an economy already facing many challenges, though the full impact will take months to measure.

About 1.25 million federal workers haven't been paid since Oct. 1. Roughly 10,000 flights have been cancelled since last week and disruptions will continue, the officials say, even as air traffic controllers return to work. Government contract awards have slowed and many food aid recipients have seen their benefits interrupted. 

Most of the lost economic activity will be recovered when the government reopens, as federal workers will receive back pay. But some canceled flights won't be rebooked, many canceled restaurant reservations won't be made again, and some postponed purchases will never happen. 

The shutdown also cut off the flow of economic data on jobs, inflation, and consumer spending, which could lead the Federal Reserve to skip what had been an expected interest rate cut at its next meeting in December. 

“The shutdown has been harmful to the U.S. economy and to critical data collection about employment, prices and more,” said Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union. 

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a six-week shutdown will reduce growth in this year's fourth quarter by about 1.5 percentage points. That would cut growth by about half from the third quarter. The reopening should boost first-quarter growth next year by 2.2 percentage points, the CBO projected, but about $11 billion in economic activity will be permanently lost. 




The previous longest government shutdown, in 2018-2019, lasted 35 days but only partially shut the government because many agencies had been fully funded. It only nicked the economy by about 0.02% of GDP, the CBO said then. 

This year's shutdown adds to the economy's existing challenges, which include sluggish hiring, stubbornly elevated inflation, and President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have caused uncertainty for many businesses. Still, few economists foresee a recession. 

Here are the ways the government closure has weighed on the economy: 

All told, federal workers missed about $16 billion in wages, the CBO estimates. That has meant less spending at stores, restaurants, and likely reduced holiday travel. Large purchases will probably be postponed, slowing the broader economy. 

Trump had threatened during the shutdown to not provide back pay but the deal struck in Congress would replace those lost wages once the government reopens.

The shutdown has added to the Washington, D.C. area's economic woes, where the unemployment rate was already 6% before the shutdown, after Trump's cuts to the federal workforce this spring. While the Washington, D.C. area — including the nearby suburbs in Virginia and Maryland — has the highest concentration of federal workers, most live and work outside of the nation's capital.

Federal workers make up about 5.5% of Maryland's workforce, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. But they also comprise 2.9% of New Mexico's workers, 2.6% of Oklahoma's, and 3.8% of Alaska's. 

Then there are the federal contractors. Bernard Yaros, an economist at Oxford Economics, estimates they could total as many as 5.2 million, and they are not guaranteed back pay once the shutdown ends. 

The government shutdown cut off the flow of economic data on unemployment, inflation, and retail spending that the Federal Reserve depends on to monitor the economy's health. Even as the government reopens, some of that data may not ever be reported, while other data will be delayed. As a result, the Fed may not deliver a third interest rate cut at its December meeting, which was widely expected before the shutdown. 

“What do you do if you're driving in the fog? You slow down,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference late last month. 

Powell said the Fed's interest-rate setting committee is deeply divided over whether to reduce its key rate, partly because the economy's health is unusually cloudy right now. The government has missed two monthly jobs reports and the October inflation data, scheduled to be published Thursday, will likely never be issued. 

On Wednesday, Susan Collins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said that the lack of economic data is one reason she is “hesitant” to support another rate cut next month. Collins has a vote on the Fed's interest-rate setting committee. 

Fewer rate cuts could discourage borrowing and spending and weigh on the economy in the coming months. 

Airlines have scrapped more than 10,000 flights on orders from the Federal Aviation Administration, which is attempting to reduce the burden on overworked air traffic controllers who have now missed two paychecks. 

Even before the flight cancellations, Tourism Economics, an economic consulting firm, estimated that the shutdown would reduce travel spending by $63 million a day. That means the six-week standoff cost the travel industry $2.6 billion.

The shutdown has worsened Americans' outlook on the broader economy. Declining consumer sentiment can over time reduce spending and slow growth, though in recent years Americans have kept shopping even when their outlooks turned grim. 

Consumer sentiment dropped to a three-year low and close to the lowest point ever recorded last week in a survey by the University of Michigan, with pessimism over personal finances and anticipated business conditions weighing on Americans.

The November survey showed the index of consumer sentiment at 50.4, down a startling 6.2% from last month and a plunge of nearly 30% from a year ago.

While the shutdown hasn't cut off all federal government spending, it has reduced purchases of equipment and has cut off the issuance of new contracts. 

Yaros estimates that about $800 million in new contracts were at risk of not being awarded each day of the shutdown. 

“The federal award spigot has all but turned off at the Department of Defense, NASA, and the Department of Homeland Security,” Yaros wrote.

The shutdown delayed the payment of $8 billion in monthly SNAP food aid to 42 million recipients in November, creating a significant financial disruption for many households that likely reduced spending. 

It's still not clear how soon all the benefits will be paid this month, though the government says they could be paid as soon as Thursday in many states.

Commercial pilot Anthony Roman joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss post-shutdown impacts on air travel, air traffic control staffing shortages and efforts to modernize the nation's aviation system.

The longest government shutdown in history finally ended on Wednesday night after nearly every member of the House of Representatives raced to Washington to cast their vote.

The threat of air travel delays — fueled in no small part by the fiscal standoff — as well as bad weather in parts of the country forced some lawmakers to find more unconventional routes to ensure they arrived on time.

First-term Rep. Addison McDowell, R-N.C., for example, found himself carpooling more than five hours alongside House Rules Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C. — a powerful GOP lawmaker more than 50 years his senior.

"It dawned on me that, for a while there, I was one of the most powerful people in America, because I had the Rules chair, who — we couldn't start the process of passing this bill until she got here," McDowell told Fox News Digital. "We had a one-seat majority, and there was two of us. So, you know, there was a lot of pressure to make sure she got here on time."

Foxx's committee was responsible for preparing federal funding legislation for a House-wide vote, which it did from just before 7 p.m. Tuesday until around 2 a.m. Wednesday.

"She just kind of asked, ‘Hey, would you be willing to carpool?' And I was like, ‘Yeah, not a problem at all.' I've got a truck, so I've got plenty of room. We could have taken the whole delegation up, just put all the guys in the back," McDowell joked.

He also knew that driving Foxx up earlier than most lawmakers had to be there came with sacrifices.

"Neither of us got to participate in any Veterans Day events in our district, which was a real bummer. But we had an important job to do, and that was make sure our government services and our current troops are getting paid," he said.

McDowell said he spent the roughly five-and-a-half-hour drive asking Foxx questions about her work and her own life, which she happily answered.

And the senior House Republican told Fox News Digital that she appreciated the experience herself.

BILL TO END GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN SURVIVES KEY HURDLE BEFORE HOUSE-WIDE VOTE

"I have never had a chance to really sit down with him for a long period of time, so I really welcome the opportunity to get to know him better," Foxx said. "He told me a lot about experiences he's had. We talked about things from my side, mostly policy issues, but I did tell him a little bit more about my background."

Foxx said it was a combination of bad weather in the North Carolina mountains and concerns about flight delays that moved her to contact colleagues about driving up — until she found her schedule most aligned with McDowell's, and she drove herself to meet him before the long ride.

"I have to say he's an excellent driver," Foxx said. "We stopped in Henderson, North Carolina, and got Chick-fil-A sandwiches — of course, what else would we get? We left there at 11 [a.m.] and we got here at about 4:40 [p.m.]."

Asked if she would do it all again, Foxx said, "In a heartbeat."

Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, also opted to drive instead of fly — a trip that spanned more than 1,000 miles across 15 hours overnight.

Feenstra said he and two staffers "took turns driving" through the night, stopping only for gas and arriving in Washington some time on Wednesday morning before the vote.

"I had a lot of Veterans Day events. I wanted to make sure that I was in my district for that. And then, once that was completed at 5 last night, we headed this way," he said. "When that's your only option, you do it. This job — you've got to do whatever you have to." 

And Midwestern Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., also took to the roads, but in a different vehicle.

"Democrats shut the government down over 40 days ago now. And I could not count on air travel," he told Fox News Digital. "So I talked to my wife for about five seconds and said, 'I'm getting on the motorcycle and leaving.' So I did, and I got here on time."

Van Orden, who first told The Hill of his plans, said he rode through sub-zero temperatures and had to navigate black ice on the roads. At one point, he stopped at a hotel "for four or five hours" when the environment appeared "sketchy," he said.

"Someone asked me, 'Why don't you just drive a car?' Here's why. We only have one car. And I wasn't going to inconvenience my wife, because she is one of my constituents, and she happens to be my favorite constituent," he said.

"People around here don't seem to understand that the mission is more important than their personal security or comfort. And if more people in this building took their job more seriously and realized it's about the American people than not, then we will be a better country."

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — Lawyers for two of President Donald Trump's foes who have been charged by the Justice Department asked a judge on Thursday to dismiss the cases against them, saying the prosecutor who secured the indictments was illegally installed in the role.

U.S. District Cameron McGowan Currie didn't immediately rule from the bench but said she expects to decide by Thanksgiving on challenges to Lindsey Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

The requests are part of multiprong efforts by former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James to get their cases dismissed before trial.

At issue during Thursday's arguments are the complex constitutional and statutory rules governing the appointment of the nation's U.S. attorneys, who function as top federal prosecutors in Justice Department offices across the country. 

The role is typically filled by lawyers who have been nominated by a president and confirmed by the Senate. Attorneys general do have the authority to get around that process by naming an interim U.S. attorney who can serve for 120 days, but lawyers for Comey and James note that once that period expires, the law gives federal judges of that district exclusive say over who can fill the vacancy.

But that's not what happened in this instance.

After then-interim U.S. attorney Erik Siebert resigned in September while facing Trump administration pressure to bring charges against Comey and James, Attorney General Pam Bondi, at Trump's public urging, installed Halligan to the role. 




Siebert had been appointed by Bondi in January to serve as interim U.S. attorney. Trump, a Republican, in May announced his intention to nominate him, and judges in the Eastern District unanimously agreed after his 120-day period expired that he should be retained in the role. But after the Trump administration effectively pushed him out in September, the Justice Department again opted to make an interim appointment in place of the courts, something defense lawyers say it was not empowered under the law to do.

Prosecutors in the cases say that the law does not explicitly prevent successive appointments of interim U.S. attorneys by the Justice Department and that, even if Halligan's appointment is deemed invalid, the proper fix is not the dismissal of the indictments.

Comey has pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress, and James, a Democrat, has pleaded not guilty to mortgage fraud allegations. Their lawyers have separately argued that the prosecutions are improperly vindictive and motivated by the president's personal animus toward their clients and should therefore be dismissed. 

Comey, as FBI director in the early months of Trump's first term, infuriated the president through his oversight of an investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. Trump fired Comey in May 2017. The two have been open adversaries since, with Comey labeling Trump “unethical” and comparing him to a Mafia boss and Trump branding Comey an “untruthful slime ball” and calling for him to be punished because of the Russia investigation.

James has been a frequent target of Trump's ire, especially since she won a staggering judgment against him and the Trump Organization in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Trump had committed fraud.

A Maryland man who was released from jail with no bail requirement after allegedly beating up a woman went back to the victim's home and assaulted her again, according to officials.

James Bowman III, 40, was arrested Nov. 7 in Waldorf, Maryland, for domestic-related assault after he allegedly punched a woman in the face and bit her hand, according to the Charles County Sheriff's Office.

A district court commissioner released Bowman from the Charles County Detention Center on his own recognizance following his arrest, meaning he didn't have to post bail.

Bowman was released under the condition that he doesn't abuse the woman he allegedly punched and bit.

One hour after Bowman was released, authorities claim he returned to the woman's house and assaulted her as she was holding a toddler. The woman was able to call 911 and get inside a bedroom to lock the door, but Bowman allegedly forced the door open. The sheriff's office said the woman called 911 at around 12:52 a.m. on Nov. 8.

Bowman continued to assault the woman as she tried to place the toddler on a nearby bed, the sheriff's office said, adding that he allegedly hit the child in the forehead.

‘Outnumbered' reacts to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's criticisms of his own party for walking away from America's masculinity crisis.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed this week that he would stop a reported Trump administration effort to unleash energy production off California's coast in a social media post that was widely criticized by conservatives and experts who spoke to Fox News Digital. 

"Dead on arrival," Newsom said in a post on X on Tuesday in response to a Washington Post article reporting that Trump officials are mulling plans to propose oil drilling off California's coast "for the first time in decades."

Newsom's post, viewed over 3 million times, drew quick pushback from conservatives.

"'Dead on arrival' is what @GavinNewsom says about Trump proposal to drill offshore California," ophthalmologist and commentator Houman David Hemmati posted on X.

"The SAME man who's been pushing for overpriced, unreliable, environmentally catastrophic offshore wind."

Gabriella Hoffman, director of the Independent Women's Forum Center for Energy and Conservation, told Fox News Digital that new offshore oil and gas projects "should be explored in California" and that the projects are "safe" and "have a minimal environmental footprint due to improved technology and increased safety measures."

"California is considered an oil island, despite having plentiful onshore and offshore recoverable oil reserves," Hoffman said. "Governor Newsom purports to hate oil and gas, yet 60% of California's petroleum is imported from foreign nations including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Guyana. That's unsettling, but a natural consequence of forcing a 100% transition to renewables."

Newsom was the most prominent American official to attend the COP30 global climate conference in Belém, Brazil, this week — using the platform to criticize the absent Trump administration.

The White House mocked the trip, noting California's continued rank among the highest in U.S. energy costs.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for Newsom's office said, "The Trump administration has yet to formally share with us their plan, but expensive and riskier offshore drilling would put our communities at risk and undermine the economic stability of our coastal economies. Given recent history, we're not surprised by the lack of communication or their lack of thought into how their actions will impact Americans. The Trump administration's focus continues to be on the next grift, and not the well-being of our people and communities."

Newsom's office put out a summary of his visit to the conference, saying it shows California is "leading by example" and proving that "climate action and economic growth go hand in hand."

Hoffman told Fox News Digital that while every energy project has "environmental trade-offs," Newsom's climate agenda has resulted in renewables getting "a pass."

"Governor Newsom desires to litter my home state's coastline with offshore wind farms that are eyesores, produce expensive unreliable electricity, and threaten fish and marine mammals," Hoffman said. "Once decommissioned, oil rigs are converted to sanctuaries under the ‘rigs to reef' program to support marine life — including endangered fish species — with habitat. Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger wisely laid the groundwork for this conservation program in 2010 when he signed AB 2503 into law."

Mark Bednar, former communications director for Speaker Kevin McCarthy, told Fox News Digital that the Trump administration is focused on "expanding America's energy dominance through further exploration" and cautioned Newsom on being out of step with that. 

"Right now, adversaries like Russia, China, Venezuela, and Iran are working around the clock to expand their economic and geopolitical footholds, and any American lawmaker who opposes moves to grow America's energy dominance will have a hard time explaining to the American people why unilaterally tying one arm behind our back is good for America," Bednar said.

Ultimately, Newsom's climate policies, according to Hoffman, "invited energy scarcity in the Golden State."

"California has the second-highest electricity rates after Hawaii. Californians also pay the highest gas tax rate of any U.S. state," Hoffman said. "If two oil refineries close by 2026, California residents will soon pay $8 per gallon at the gas pump. That's unsustainable.

"California's energy crisis is entirely self-inflicted. New offshore oil and gas projects, along with new nuclear, geothermal, and natural gas, can reduce energy prices and make the Golden State energy independent once again."

Baby formula manufacturer ByHeart recalled all of its products sold nationwide Tuesday. The move comes days after some batches were recalled amid an expanding outbreak of infant botulism.

The parents of at least two babies sickened in an infantile botulism outbreak are suing the makers of the ByHeart baby formula at the heart of a nationwide recall.

Stephen and Yurany Dexter, of Flagstaff, Arizona, said their 4-month-old daughter, Rose, had to be flown by air ambulance to a children's hospital two hours from home and treated for several weeks this summer.

Michael and Hanna Everett, of Richmond, Kentucky, said their daughter, Piper, also 4 months, was rushed to a hospital Nov. 8 with worsening symptoms of the rare and potentially deadly disease.

The lawsuits, filed in federal courts in two states, allege that the ByHeart formula the babies consumed was defective and that the company was negligent in selling it. They seek financial payment for medical bills, emotional distress and other harm.

Both families said they bought the organic formula to provide what they viewed as a natural, healthier alternative to traditional baby formulas, and that they were shocked and angered by the suffering their children endured.

“I wouldn't guess that a product designed for a helpless, developing human in the United States could cause something this severe,” said Stephen Dexter, 44.

“She's so little and you're just helplessly watching this,” said Hanna Everett, 28. “It was awful.”




Rose Dexter and Piper Everett are among at least 15 infants in a dozen states who have been sickened in the outbreak that began in August, according to federal and state health officials. No deaths have been reported.

Both received the sole treatment available for botulism in children less than a year old: an IV medication called BabyBIG, made from the blood plasma of people immunized against the neurotoxins that cause the illness.

Investigations into more potential botulism cases are pending after ByHeart, the New York-based formula manufacturer, recalled all of its formula nationwide on Tuesday. At least 84 U.S. babies have been treated for infantile botulism since August, including those in the outbreak, California officials said. 

The company sells about 200,000 cans of formula per month. It can take up to 30 days for signs of infantile botulism infection to appear, medical experts said.

California officials confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart formula fed to an infant who fell ill contained the type of bacteria that can lead to illness.

The lawsuits filed Wednesday could be the first of many legal actions against ByHeart, said Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer who represents Dexter.

“This company potentially faces an existential crisis,” he said. 

ByHeart officials didn't respond to questions about the new lawsuits but said they would “address any legal claims in due course.”

“We remain focused on ensuring that families using ByHeart products are aware of the recall and have factual information about steps they should take,” the company said in a statement.

In Rose Dexter's case, she received ByHeart formula within days of her birth in July after breast milk was insufficient, her father said. Stephen Dexter said he went to Whole Foods to find a “natural option.”

“I'm a little concerned with things that are in food that may cause problems,” he said. “We do our best to buy something that says it's organic.”

But Rose, who was healthy at birth, didn't thrive on the formula. She had trouble feeding and was fussy and fretful as she got sicker. On Aug. 31, when she was 8 weeks old, her parents couldn't wake her.

Rose was flown by air ambulance to Phoenix Children's Hospital, where she stayed for nearly two weeks.

Hanna Everett said she used ByHeart to supplement breastfeeding starting when Piper was 6 weeks old. 

“It's supposed to be similar to breast milk,” she said.

Last weekend, Piper started showing signs of illness. Everett said she became more worried when a friend told her ByHeart had recalled two lots of its Whole Nutrition Infant Formula. When a family member checked the empty cans, they matched the recalled lots. 

“I was like, 'Oh my god, we need to go to the ER,” Everett recalled.

At Kentucky Children's Hospital, Piper's condition worsened rapidly. Her pupils stopped dilating correctly and she lost her gag reflex. Her head and arms became limp and floppy.

Doctors immediately ordered doses of the BabyBIG medication, which had to be shipped from California, Everett said. In the meantime, Piper had to have a feeding tube and IV lines inserted.

In both cases, the babies improved after receiving treatment. Rose went home in September and she no longer requires a feeding tube. Piper went home this week. 

They appear to be doing well on different formulas, the families said.

The brother of the missing woman featured on the hit Netflix docuseries "Amy Bradley is Missing" spoke with Fox News Digital to disclose further information in the case that was not discussed on the show. 

The FBI is investigating the death of 18-year-old Anna Kepner, a Florida high school senior found dead aboard a Carnival cruise ship — just days after she posted a TikTok hinting at heartbreak and resilience.

In an Oct. 26 video, she shared a series of selfies and wrote that she would continue to "have a smile" on her face despite what sounds like a rough breakup.

"Even after every breakup, being disrespected, being lied to, being cheated on, being used, getting manipulated, getting played, I will always have a smile on my face and a kind heart," reads the on-screen text in her video, reported earlier by the New York-based legal news site, Lawyer Herald.

"I don't know why I've been through what I've been through, but I can promise you, I never deserved it," the post continued. "Am I mad at those people for what they did to me? No. Am I upset? Yes."

Her final post, on Oct. 30, was much shorter.

"You deserve to be happy, but if it ain't with me then nvm," it reads, using shorthand for "never mind."

Around 11:15 a.m. on Nov. 7, she was found dead aboard the Carnival Horizon cruise ship.

Anna Marie Kepner was a senior and member of the varsity cheerleading squad at Temple Christian School, a private K-12 Baptist school in Titusville, Florida, about 40 miles east of Orlando, Fox News Digital reported previously.

Her remains were returned to shore in Miami Saturday morning, and a cause and manner of death have not yet been released.

She was reportedly a straight-A student who planned to join the U.S. military after graduation, according to FOX 35 Orlando.

Kepner's close friend, Gennavicia Guerrero, 18, told FOX 35 that Kepner was a positive influence on her friends and encouraged them to do well in school, too.

"This can't be real," she said.

Attempts to reach her family were unsuccessful Thursday.

Her father broke his silence in an interview Wednesday with the Daily Mail, explaining that the family went on a six-day cruise together and that she had died under unknown circumstances while the vessel was in international waters in the Gulf of America. 

"We were there as a family," he told the outlet. "Everybody was questioned. Everybody came off that ship. I don't know who they are looking at or what their investigation is."

He said he had not yet heard anything from the FBI.

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, in a Fox News Digital interview, amid calls for Minority Leader Schumer to step aside, says Democrats "need more effective leadership."

CONCORD, N.H. — Amid heated calls by some House Democrats and others in the party to remove Sen. Chuck Schumer from his longtime role as Senate Democratic leader, a top Democrat in the chamber is calling for "more effective leadership."

Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told Fox News Digital that Schumer needs to lead a conversation to "stop having a group of members cross over and support Donald Trump's agenda."

Murphy was interviewed on Wednesday, two days after seven Senate Democrats and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the party, bucked Senate Democratic leaders and voted with the majority Republicans to end the longest federal government shutdown in history.

Plenty of progressives and center-left Democrats have pilloried the deal to end the shutdown, which didn't include the Democrats' top priority, an agreement to extend expiring subsidies that make health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, known as the ACA or Obamacare, more affordable to millions of Americans.

And even though he opposed the agreement, Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber, has faced calls from some House Democrats and others in the party to step down due to his inability to keep Senate Democrats unified.

But to date, no Senate Democrat has joined those calls for Schumer to step down.

Asked if Schumer was still up to the task of steering Senate Democrats, Murphy said, "I think his job is really, really hard. He obviously did not want this outcome. He wanted the caucus to stay together. He was not successful in that endeavor."

TRUMP ARGUES SCHUMER MADE A MISTAKE

"We've got to have a hard conversation as a caucus about what we all need to do, what kind of leadership we need in order to make sure that we don't continue to break apart," added Murphy, who as Deputy Democratic Conference Secretary is a member of the party's leadership in the chamber.

And he noted that "this is the fourth major moment this year where a handful of Democrats have crossed over and voted with Donald Trump."

"That means we need more effective leadership. That also means that the caucus has to decide for itself that we're not going to continue to break apart like this," he emphasized.

And pointing to Schumer, he added, "That's a conversation that, yes, the leader of the caucus has to head up, but it's a conversation all of us have to have. We all have to hold each other accountable."

Murphy was interviewed after headlining an event in New Hampshire's capital city with the Merrimack County Democrats. New Hampshire's two senators — Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan — were among the Democrats who supported the deal with Republicans.

SHUTDOWN SHOWDOWN: DEMOCRATIC SENATOR STANDS FIRM AFTER DEFYING PARTY 

Shaheen, who previously supported a bill to extend the ACA subsidies, on Monday defended breaking with her party to support the deal.

"We're making sure that the people of America can get the food benefits that they need, that air traffic controllers can get paid, that federal workers are able to come back, the ones who were let go, that they get paid, that contractors get paid, that aviation moves forward," Shaheen said in a "Fox and Friends" interview.

Asked about Shaheen's comments, Murphy said Senate Democrats "had a big disagreement."

"I understand why my colleagues wanted to end the shutdown. I wanted to end this shutdown. The fact is that shutdowns hurt and Trump was making the shutdown even worse than it had to be by, for instance, illegally denying people food stamp benefits, nutrition benefits," Murphy argued.

But he added, "I still think we could have won. I think as these premium increases were just becoming real for people, as folks are digesting an election that clearly was a referendum on the way that Donald Trump was plunging the country to shut down, we could have actually gotten a resolution that would have stopped at least some of the pain that's coming to families as these healthcare premiums go into effect."

The deal to end the shutdown does not include such a provision, but only a promise by the majority Republicans to hold an upcoming vote on extending the subsidies.

And Murphy lamented that the deal will only embolden the president.

"I definitely worry that when Trump gets the opposition party to yield to him, as he did last week, that it just emboldens him, that he ends up acting even more lawlessly and recklessly and illegally," he said. "I understand why my colleagues wanted to end this shutdown. I am just of the belief that Trump is going to constantly try to weaponize our compassion against us."

Murphy, who during former President Joe Biden's tenure in the White House spent much of his time trying to reach across the aisle to find common ground with Republicans on such issues as gun control, immigration and Ukraine, is now helping fund organizations that are pushing back against Trump and his agenda.

"I've been making grants to protest organizations and grassroots organizations all around the country," he said.

And the senator, who won re-election last year in blue-leaning Connecticut by nearly 20 points, highlighted that "I've been all over the country this year. I've been holding town halls, often with other colleagues, targeting mostly states that are represented by Republicans, so that they're hearing the other side."

And looking ahead to next year's midterm elections, he said, "I'll likely be traveling throughout New England, but also throughout the rest of the country, to try to help stand up a national mobilization against Trump's corruption."

Murphy is seen by political pundits as a possible contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, which is expected to be a crowded and competitive race.

After his interview with Fox News Digital, Murphy headlined the latest "Stand Up New Hampshire Town Hall." The speaking series, organized by top New Hampshire Democratic elected officials and party leaders, is seen as an early cattle call for potential White House contenders.

The New Hampshire Republican Party welcomed Murphy to the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state with an email released titled "NHGOP Welcomes Future Failed Presidential Candidate Chris Murphy to New Hampshire."

Asked about a possible presidential run in 2028, Murphy said, "I think it'd be so foolish for any of us to be thinking about running in an election in 2028 that may not happen. I mean, I think this moment is really serious. I think Donald Trump is trying to rig the rules of American democracy so that either he can run again or that the opposition party has no chance to win."

Pointing to his current mission "to help save our democracy," Murphy insisted "that's all I'm focused on right now. And I think that is what I would recommend to all of my colleagues, whether they're thinking about running for national office in 2028 or whether they have no plans to do so."

"We have one mission right now, which is to make sure there actually is an election in 2028 where a Democrat has a reasonable chance of winning," he added.

‘Sunday Night in America' host Trey Gowdy and Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley react to a report detailing former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation into GOP politicians on ‘Hannity.'

EXCLUSIVE: Former special counsel Jack Smith allegedly sought the private, personal cellphone records of then-Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy as part of his investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots, Fox News Digital has learned.

Smith also sought the private phone records of now-former Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas.

JACK SMITH TRACKED PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS, CALLS OF NEARLY A DOZEN GOP SENATORS DURING J6 PROBE, FBI SAYS

Fox News Digital exclusively reviewed the document that FBI Director Kash Patel recently shared with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson containing the explosive revelations. Grassley and Johnson have been leading a joint investigation into Smith's "Arctic Frost" probe.

According to the document, Smith, on Jan. 24, 2023, allegedly sought the "toll records for the personal cell phones of U.S. Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (AT&T) and U.S. Representative Louie Gohmert (Verizon.)"

The information was included as part of a "Significant Case Notification" drafted by the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division on May 25, 2023.

"Jack Smith's radical and deranged investigation was never about finding the truth," former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told Fox News Digital. "It was a blatant weaponizing of the Justice Department to attack political opponents of the Biden administration. Perhaps no action underscores this point more than the illegal attempt to access the phone records of sitting members of the House and Senate — including the Speaker of the House." 

"His illegal targeting demands real accountability," McCarthy continued. "And I am confident Congress will hold hearings and access documents in its investigation into Jack Smith's own abuses." 

HAGERTY PRESSES VERIZON OVER FBI'S ACCESS TO HIS PHONE RECORDS DURING JACK SMITH PROBE

"At the same time, I will ask my own counsel to pursue all areas of redress so this does not happen to anyone else," McCarthy said. 

The revelations come after Fox News Digital exclusively reported in October that Smith and his "Arctic Frost" team investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riots were tracking the private communications and phone calls of nearly a dozen Republican senators as part of the probe, including Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and GOP Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.

An official told Fox News Digital that those records were collected in 2023 by Smith and his team after subpoenaing major telephone providers. 

Smith has called his decision to subpoena and track Republican lawmakers' phone records "entirely proper" and consistent with Justice Department policy.

"As described by various Senators, the toll data collection was narrowly tailored and limited to the four days from January 4, 2021 to January 7, 2021, with a focus on telephonic activity during the period immediately surrounding the January 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol," Smith's lawyers wrote in October to Grassley.

Grassley, R-Iowa, and Johnson, R-Wis., have been investigating the matter, and seeking answers from major telephone providers.

In AT&T's response to Grassley, it noted that Smith sought phone records for two members of Congress.

Fox News Digital has learned that AT&T informed Grassley's staff that one of the members was Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, but refused to disclose the second member.

The newly declassified document reviewed by Fox News Digital appears to reveal that the second member of Congress that Smith sought records from AT&T for was McCarthy, R-Calif. 

Fox News Digital obtained AT&T's response to Grassley, in which the company notes that Smith sent them a grand jury subpoena that included a request for phone records associated with two members of Congress.

"However, when AT&T raised questions with Special Counsel Smith's office concerning the legal basis for seeking records of members of Congress, the Special Counsel did not pursue the subpoena further, and no records were produced," AT&T told Grassley.

AT&T also stressed that the company "has not produced any records or other information to Special Counsel Jack Smith" relating to "any member of Congress."

"Jack Smith's Arctic Frost investigation looks more and more out of control with each passing day," Grassley told Fox News Digital. "Based on my oversight, it was a fishing expedition that swept up Republicans in and out of Congress, from top to bottom."

"Arctic Frost" was opened inside the bureau April 13, 2022. Smith was appointed as special counsel to take over the probe in November 2022. 

GOP SENATOR DEMANDS FBI REVEAL IF SURVEILLANCE WENT BEYOND JACK SMITH'S PHONE TRACKING

An FBI official told Fox News Digital that "Arctic Frost" is a "prohibited case," and that the review required FBI officials to go "above and beyond in order to deliver on this promise of transparency." The discovery is part of a broader ongoing review, Fox News Digital has learned.

Smith, after months of investigating, charged President Donald Trump in the U.S. District Court for Washington, D.C., in his 2020 election case, but after Trump was elected president, Smith sought to dismiss the case. Judge Tanya Chutkan granted that request.

Former Department of Government Efficiency leader Elon Musk threw his full support behind Rep. Byron Donalds's (R-FL) bid for Florida governor.

Donalds has already been endorsed by President Donald Trump, but Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) has yet to make an endorsement in the race, as there's been speculation that his wife, Casey DeSantis, is weighing her own run.

“Congratulations, Byron! You certainly have my full support,” Musk posted on X Wednesday night, replying to Donalds‘s February post announcing his run.

“I arrived in the Sunshine State at 17 years old on a Greyhound bus, with a trunk full of clothes and a dream. Now is the time to keep the best state in the country as the best state in the country. Tonight, I am proud to announce my candidacy to be the next governor of Florida,” Donalds added.

Musk adds to the long list of influential supporters to back Donalds's campaign ahead of the 2026 elections, including influential Republicans such as Trump, Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), Randy Fine (R-FL), Florida state Rep. Meg Weinberger, and Florida Commissioner of the City of Sweetwater Ian Vallecillo.

Donalds picked up the endorsement of 12 more sheriffs on Wednesday, bringing his total support of Florida's top law enforcement officers to 28.

“As Governor, he'll stand with the men and women on the front lines, defend our freedoms, and make sure Florida remains a state where law and order prevail. I'm proud to stand with Byron Donalds for Governor,” Baker County Sheriff Scotty Rhoden said in a statement the Donalds for Governor campaign shared with the Washington Examiner. 

Musk — the Tesla CEO worth $488 billion — was influential at the beginning of Trump's second administration, spearheading DOGE's fight to eliminate “waste, fraud, and abuse” during his volunteer role. 

Musk was also influential in the 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court elections, spending nearly $20 million in an attempt to elect conservative candidate Brad Schimel.

Donalds is running in a crowded primary field to replace termed-out DeSantis, featuring Florida lawmaker Paul Renner and Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett, with DeSantis ally James Fishback expected to announce his bid in the coming days.

Florida has not elected a Democrat to lead the state since 1994. The front-runner for the Democratic nomination is David Jolly, a former Republican congressman who believes “Republicans in Tallahassee have gone too far in dividing us.”

President Donald Trump signed a government funding bill Wednesday night, ending a record 43-day shutdown that caused financial stress for federal workers who went without paychecks, stranded scores of travelers at airports and generated long lines at some food banks.

President Donald Trump signed a government funding bill Wednesday night, ending a record 43-day shutdown that caused financial stress for federal workers who went without paychecks, stranded scores of travelers at airports and generated long lines at some food banks.

The signing ceremony came just hours after the House passed the measure on a mostly party-line vote of 222-209. The Senate had already passed the measure Monday.

The shutdown magnified partisan divisions in Washington as Trump took unprecedented unilateral actions — including canceling projects and trying to fire federal workers — to pressure Democrats into relenting on their demands.

Democrats wanted to extend an enhanced tax credit expiring at the end of the year that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. They refused to go along with a short-term spending bill that did not include that priority. But Republicans said that was a separate policy fight to be held at another time.

What else to know about the end of the government shutdown:








The Justice Department on Thursday sued to block new congressional district boundaries approved by California voters last week, joining a court battle that could help determine which party wins control of the U.S. House in 2026. 

The complaint filed in California federal court targets the new congressional map pushed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas backed by President Donald Trump. It sets the stage for a high-stakes legal and political fight between the Republican administration and the Democratic governor, who's seen as a likely 2028 presidential contender. 

“California's redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an emailed statement. “Governor Newsom's attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand.”

California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment changing the congressional boundaries to give Democrats a shot at winning five seats now held by Republicans in next year's midterm elections. 

The Trump administration is working to push out pay for federal workers that had been on hold because of the government shutdown by the middle of next week.

The money will go out in four separate tranches, depending on the agency, according to a senior administration official. The varied dates are because agencies are on different pay schedules and payroll providers.

The White House had pushed federal agencies to expedite backpay for employees, said the official, granted anonymity to discuss the administration's plans.

The schedule is as follows:--Nov. 15: Employees at the General Services Administration and Office of Personnel Management will be paid a “supercheck” that covers the period of Oct. 1 to Nov. 1--Nov. 16: Employees at the Departments of Energy, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs will be paid for the period from Oct. 1 to Nov. 1, as well as civilian employees at the Pentagon.--Nov. 17: Employees at the Departments of Education, State, Interior, and Transportation, as well as those at the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, National Science Foundation, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Social Security Administration will be paid for the period from Oct. 1 to Nov. 1.--Nov. 19: Employees from the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, Treasury and the Small Business Administration will be paid for the period from Oct. 1 to Nov. 15.

On Wednesday evening the House voted on a budget bill that ended the longest shutdown in U.S. history.

Voto Latino leaders said the House “chose to ignore the health crisis millions of Americans are facing” when it voted on a budget bill that they claim will jeopardize the health of Latino communities by failing to fund subsidies provided by the Affordable Care Act that make health coverage more accessible.

“Latinos are already left behind when it comes to accessing health care coverage,” Voto Latino leaders said in a statement. “With lawmakers choosing to turn a blind eye to this reality, these disparities will only grow, and families will be pushed to make difficult decisions when it comes to seeking medical attention.”

U.S. Sen. John Fetterman had what his office says was a “ventricular fibrillation flare-up” that caused him to feel light-headed and fall during an early morning walk Thursday. He was doing well and was hospitalized in Pittsburgh, his office said. He sustained minor injuries to his face and was under “routine observation” at the hospital, the office said.

Fetterman, who suffered a stroke in 2022, has disclosed that he was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and a heart condition called atrial fibrillation.

Cardiomyopathy can impede blood flow and potentially cause heartbeats so irregular they can be fatal. Atrial fibrillation can cause blood to pool inside a pocket of the heart, allowing clots to form. Clots then can break off, get stuck and cut off blood, causing a stroke.

Funding the government is the most basic responsibility of Congress, yet it's one that lawmakers increasingly struggle to meet.

The process for approving a budget and appropriating funding is broken, with Congress rarely able to pass the 12 annual appropriations bills by the end of a fiscal year. It last happened in 1997, according to the Pew Research Center, and has happened only four times in the modern era.

Staring down a funding deadline every Sept. 30, Congress has increasingly been forced to rely on temporary continuing resolutions — effectively keeping government funding at the same levels — while they work to finish full-year funding legislation. That's exactly what happened this week, as Congress passed three appropriations bills that last through Sept. 30, 2026. The rest of the government is funded at current levels through Jan. 30, creating a new deadline early next year to avoid a partial shutdown.

Several factors contribute to the broken process. Partisanship and polarization have made passing appropriations bills difficult. Congressional workweeks are shorter due to lawmakers mostly living outside of Washington. And the parties have deep disagreements about the size and scope of government programs that leaders often struggle to resolve.

Then there's the tactical element. In recent decades, both parties have grown comfortable withholding support for funding legislation and forcing a shutdown to try and extract concessions from the other side.

History suggests forcing a shutdown almost never works. But there seem to be few political repercussions for it, as voters move on quickly to other issues.

The federal government is back but it is unclear when and if Washington, D.C., will be reimbursed for the payments it made to programs for its more needy residents while the government was shut down. 

Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered that the thousands of recipients of SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and the WIC program receive their benefits during the shutdown. The city ultimately covered $18.5 million of the SNAP expense after the federal government made a partial payment of $8 million at the direction of a federal district judge.

Overall, it will be months before city officials know the full impact of the shutdown in terms of economics although at least budgetarily it will be a better outcome than 2024 when the city was unable to spend more than $1 billion of its own tax revenue on its budget because of action by the House.

This year the city retained its spending authority on the budget the council passed.

With the longest U.S. government shutdown over, state officials said Thursday they're working quickly to get full SNAP food benefits to millions of people, though it still could take up to a week for some to receive their delayed aid.

A back-and-forth series of court rulings and shifting policies from Trump's administration has led to a patchwork distribution of November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. While some states already had issued full SNAP benefits, about two-thirds of states had issued only partial benefits or none at all before the government shutdown ended late Wednesday, according to an Associated Press tally.

The federal food program serves about 42 million people, about 1 in 8 Americans, in lower-income households. They receive an average of around $190 monthly per person, though that doesn't necessarily cover the full cost of groceries for a regular month.

Lawyers for two of President Trump's foes who've been charged by the Justice Department asked a judge Thursday to dismiss the cases against them, saying the prosecutor who secured the indictments was illegally installed in the role.

U.S. District Cameron McGowan Currie didn't immediately rule from the bench but said she expects to decide by Thanksgiving on challenges to Lindsey Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

The requests are part of multiprong efforts by former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James to get their cases dismissed before trial.

At issue during Thursday's arguments are the complex constitutional and statutory rules governing the appointment of the nation's U.S. attorneys, who function as top federal prosecutors in Justice Department offices across the country.

Kimberly Guilfoyle, the first female U.S. ambassador to Greece and a close ally of President Trump, visited the head of Greece's Orthodox Church on Thursday, telling him he was the first person she called after being nominated to her new post.

Guilfoyle's visit to Archbishop Ieronymos II came just over a week after she took up her new position in Athens. A former California prosecutor and Fox News host who was once engaged to Donald Trump Jr, the 56-year-old presented her diplomatic credentials to Greece's president on Nov. 4.

“It's wonderful to be here and I'm just very grateful that President Trump has blessed me with the opportunity to serve the United States here in Greece, for the relationship that we have and for that growing and blossoming going forward,” Guilfoyle said during the meeting with the 87-year-old archbishop.

Ieronymos extended his thanks “to the president for the opportunity that he gave us today. May God bless these relations.”

Medicare telehealth waivers that allow millions of older adults to get virtual health care without leaving home were restored through Jan. 30 in the government funding bill, after lapsing during the 43-day shutdown.

Patients and caregivers reacted with relief — but called for more action.

“We are pleased that Congress has worked together to temporarily restore the telehealth funding, but we hope they can make this a permanent part of the healthcare system,” said Martha Swick, a full-time caregiver for her husband Bill, who uses the program for speech therapy to treat his degenerative brain disease.

The deal also restored funding through Jan. 30 for a Medicare program that allows some patients to receive hospital-level acute in-person care at home.

Federal workers deemed essential, including Capitol Police officers, TSA workers and air traffic controllers, had been forced to work without pay during the shutdown.

But Kevin Hassett, chair of the National Economic Council at the White House, said their checks should soon be on the way.

“I think that the payments will come probably come in the next week,” Hassett said. “Maybe even before.”

It's unclear whether the parties will find any common ground on health care before the December vote in the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he will not commit to bringing it up in his chamber.

Some Republicans have said they're open to extending the COVID-19 pandemic-era tax credits as premiums will soar for millions of people, but they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies. Some argue the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals rather than go directly to insurance companies.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Monday that she was supportive of extending the tax credits with changes, such as new income caps. Some Democrats have signaled they could be open to that idea.

The frustration and pressures generated by the shutdown was reflected when lawmakers debated the spending measure on the House floor.

Republicans said Democrats sought to use the pain generated by the shutdown to prevail in a policy dispute.

“They knew it would cause pain and they did it anyway,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said.

Democrats said Republicans raced to pass tax breaks earlier this year that they say mostly will benefit the wealthy. But the bill before the House on Wednesday “leaves families twisting in the wind with zero guarantee there will ever, ever be a vote to extend tax credits to help everyday people pay for their health care,” said Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts.

The shutdown created a cascade of troubles for many Americans. Throughout the shutdown, at least 670,000 federal employees were furloughed, while about 730,000 others were working without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.

The plight of the federal workers was among several pressure points, along with flight disruptions and cuts to food aid, that in the end ratcheted up the pressure on lawmakers to come to an agreement to fund the government.

Throughout the six-week shutdown, officials in President Trump's administration repeatedly used the federal workers as leverage to try to push Democrats to relent on their health care demands. The Republican president signaled that workers going unpaid wouldn't get back pay. He threatened and then followed through on firings in a federal workforce already reeling from layoffs earlier this year. A court then blocked the shutdown firings, adding to the uncertainty.

Jessica Sweet spent the federal government shutdown cutting back. To make ends meet, the Social Security claims specialist drank only one coffee a day, skipped meals, cut down on groceries and deferred paying some household bills. She racked up spending on her credit card buying gas to get to work.

With the longest shutdown ever coming to a close, Sweet and hundreds of thousands of other federal workers who missed paychecks will soon get some relief. But many are left feeling that their livelihoods served as political pawns in the fight between recalcitrant lawmakers in Washington and are asking themselves whether the battle was worth their sacrifices.

“It's very frustrating to go through something like this,” said Sweet, who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York. “It shakes the foundation of trust that we all place in our agencies and in the federal government to do the right thing.”

The Office of Personnel Management posted on X that federal workers are expected to be back to the grind on Thursday, with Trump signing a measure ending the record 43-day shutdown.

“Federal agencies in the Washington, DC area are open. Employees are expected to begin the workday on time. Normal operating procedures are in effect,” the OPM posting says.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Jessica Sweet spent the federal government shutdown cutting back. To make ends meet, the Social Security claims specialist drank only one coffee a day, skipped meals, cut down on groceries and deferred paying some household bills. She racked up spending on her credit card buying gas to get to work.

With the longest shutdown ever coming to a close, Sweet and hundreds of thousands of other federal workers who missed paychecks will soon get some relief. But many are left feeling that their livelihoods served as political pawns in the fight between recalcitrant lawmakers in Washington and are asking themselves whether the battle was worth their sacrifices. 

“It's very frustrating to go through something like this,” said Sweet, who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York. “It shakes the foundation of trust that we all place in our agencies and in the federal government to do the right thing.”

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Its end emerged when eight Democratic-aligned senators agreed to a deal to fund the government with no extension of the expiring subsidies.




The shutdown created a cascade of troubles for many Americans. Throughout the shutdown, at least 670,000 federal employees were furloughed, while about 730,000 others were working without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. 

The plight of the federal workers was among several pressure points, along with flight disruptions and cuts to food aid, that in the end ratcheted up the pressure on lawmakers to come to an agreement to fund the government. 

Throughout the six-week shutdown, officials in President Donald Trump's administration repeatedly used the federal workers as leverage to try to push Democrats to relent on their health care demands. The Republican president signaled that workers going unpaid wouldn't get back pay. He threatened and then followed through on firings in a federal workforce already reeling from layoffs earlier this year. A court then blocked the shutdown firings, adding to the uncertainty.

The deal that is bringing an end to the shutdown will reverse the dismissals that occurred since Oct. 1, while also ensuring back pay for furloughed federal workers the Trump administration had left in doubt. The bipartisan deal provides funding to reopen the government, including for SNAP food aid and other programs. 

But the whiplash of the past six weeks, coupled with the concern that the longest shutdown ever may not be the last they face, has shaken many in the workforce.

“Stress and hunger are great tactics for traumatizing people,” Sweet said. 

For Sweet, the feelings of frustration are only compounded by a feeling that she was betrayed by the Democratic-aligned senators who broke with the party on the health care subsidies.

She said that she understands that many workers were desperate for a paycheck. But she thought standing firm on the issue of the health care subsidies was worth her sacrifice.

“There are other federal workers who understood what we were holding the line for and are extremely unhappy that line was crossed and that trust was breached,” she said.

Adam Pelletier, a National Labor Relations Board field examiner who was furloughed Oct. 1, said he is glad the compromise includes rehiring laid-off workers, but “the agreement that was reached almost feels like the Charlie Brown cartoon where Lucy holds the football and pulls it out from them.”

Pelletier, a union leader for NLRBU local 3, had financially prepared for the shutdown back in March when it became clear that a funding agreement between Democrats and Republicans likely would not be reached. He says the shutdown has made him feel “like a pawn” because federal workers had no say over their own fate.

The federal workers who spoke to The Associated Press had one common message: that they were reeling but ready to get back to work. 

“This has been the worst time in my 20 years to be a federal employee,” said Elizabeth McPeak, a furloughed IRS employee in Pittsburgh who is National Treasury Employees Union Chapter 34 first vice president. She said colleagues had to beg their landlords to hold off on collecting rent payments and relied on food banks during the shutdown. 

“A month without pay,” McPeak said, “is a long time to go.”

            In the winter of 1944, as some of the bloodiest fighting in World War II ramped up in Europe, 19-year-old then-1st Sgt. Jefferson Wiggins, along with hundreds of other Black soldiers, were tasked with burying the dead in the southern Netherlands.
    


            What was once a fruit orchard would become the final resting place for thousands of fallen US service members. It was difficult, gruesome work, done in near-constant rain and snow with only pick axes and shovels. Years later, Wiggins would recall how soldiers under his command in the 960th Quartermaster Service Company cried as they lowered the bodies of men into their graves.
    


            The site, in the village of Margraten located in the southeastern part of the Netherlands, became one of the largest American military cemeteries in Europe. And for months, visitors to the cemetery, which is run by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), haven't been able to learn about the soldiers' work.
    


            In March, the small, little-known federal agency took down a display from the cemetery's visitor center that commemorates the contributions of Black soldiers like Wiggins, who ultimately reached the rank of first lieutenant and died in 2013, and highlights the discrimination they faced. Most Black soldiers were limited to non-combat roles during World War II.
    


            “It's not a matter of a panel that has my husband's name on it. That's not the issue,” Wiggins' widow, Janice, told CNN. “The issue is that these are a group of men who contributed to their country, who, like almost every soldier during World War II, went through great trauma and bore that for the rest of their lives.”
    


            Janice Wiggins, who learned of the display's removal in October from two Dutch filmmakers, said her late husband would “be disappointed, but not shocked.”
    


            “He wasn't naive about the world he lived in,” she added.
    


            The ABMC, which oversees 26 permanent US military cemeteries, told CNN in a statement that the panel in question was taken down following “an internal review of interpretive content” under the agency's previous secretary, Charles Djou, and there are currently four other displays highlighting individual African American servicemembers buried at the cemetery.
    


            Djou, a Biden appointee who says he was dismissed by President Donald Trump in April, told CNN in an email the panel's removal was “done via an internal agency review at the prompting of the Trump administration.” CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            The ABMC said, “The panel was initially added upon request by the former U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands.”
    


            “It was determined by the previous secretary, following the internal review in March, that while 1st Lt. Wiggins' quote represented the immense contributions of many African American service members during the creation of the site, portions of the panels were outside the scope of ABMC's commemorative mission. There was no external consultation or direction regarding its removal.”
    


            The panel, which was added to an exhibit at the cemetery's $6.7 million visitor center in 2024, was titled, “African American Servicemembers in WWII: Fighting on Two Fronts.” It described how Black service members, “despite the ongoing fight for civil rights at home during an era of racist policies” enlisted in every military branch and faced “the horrors of war.”
    


            Janice Wiggins pushed for a panel shortly after the center opened in 2023, when she learned that none of the information or exhibits included any mention of the African American soldiers who buried the dead there. She worked with the former US Ambassador to the Netherlands, Shefali Razdan Duggal, and Mieke Kirkels, a Dutch oral historian, and the panel was installed months later.
    


            Wiggins waited until the late 2000s to revisit the memories of his service, which he would recount to Kirkels for an oral history after learning that he was the last known Black member of his unit alive.
    


            The first person they buried was a young German girl, Wiggins recalled in the oral history rereleased in 2025. Her body had been mangled by machine gun fire; her head deformed by a grenade blast. As the Allied forces pressed on, more and more bodies of young American men arrived on trucks for Wiggins and his men to lay to rest. Many had been killed during airborne operations in the east or in the course of advances into German territory.
    


            “There was a permanent arrival of bodies, the whole day long. Sundays included, seven days a week,” Wiggins said. “I find it difficult, even now, to read in the paper that soldiers ‘gave their lives.' … All those boys in Margraten, their lives were taken away.”
    


            “And here we all were - this group of Black Americans having to deal with these bodies of White Americans,” he said. “The stark reality was we had to bury those soldiers although we couldn't sit in the same room with them when they were alive.”
    


            For Wiggins, remembering what he saw was a painful, but necessary act. Janice Wiggins said he would often tell her that “people should know.” The contributions of Black soldiers during the war had been frequently overlooked — and in some cases lost forever. A fire at the National Personnel Records Center in 1973 destroyed millions of files.
    


            “He never ever wanted the story to be about him. He saw his story as a vehicle,” she said.
    


            Her husband, a sharecropper's son who had lied about his age to enlist in the military, became a lifelong educator and civil rights activist. He was 87 when he died.
    


            Theo Bovens, a Dutch politician who leads the Black Liberators in the Netherlands project, told CNN that local and regional politicians have asked the ABMC to reinstall the panel, along with another that highlights Technician 4th Class George H. Pruitt, a Black soldier from Camden, New Jersey, who died while trying to save a fellow soldier who had fallen into a river in Germany.
    


            The ABMC told CNN on Monday that the Pruitt panel is “currently off display, though not out of rotation.” The part of the exhibit featuring Pruitt and other African American servicemembers at the cemetery, the agency said, has panels that were “designed to be removed and rotated.”
    


            Janice Wiggins told CNN that the “panels were never intended to be part of a traveling exhibit or rotation” and “were intended to be a permanent part of the Visitors Center exhibits.”
    


            The mayor of Eijsden-Margraten has formally asked the ABMC to reinstall the panels, insisting that the community values the contributions of Black American soldiers that helped liberate the Netherlands from the Nazis 80 years ago.
    


            The governing body of the Limburg Province said it hopes to make a direct appeal to US Ambassador to the Netherlands Joe Popolo Jr. who was confirmed in October.
    


            “The displayed panels depicted a history we must never forget, and from which we can learn a great deal—especially now, as global divisions are being increasingly magnified,” the body said.

Will JD Vance‘s vision set the GOP's course after Trump?

Over the past few weeks, the American right has been fiercely debating a drama that begins with Tucker Carlson hosting an antisemitic young influencer on his podcast, and ends with a very public breakdown at the Republican Party's premier think tank.

Is it a bit inside baseball? Yes. But it's worth understanding. The details tell us a lot about where the conservative movement is, and where it's going.

“Not to be too grandiose, but it's the Spanish Civil War,” Jonah Goldberg, editor of the center-right publication The Dispatch, told Today, Explained co-host Noel King. “It's previewing the bigger wars to come about what the right is about, who can be tolerated as part of the coalition, and who can't be.”

Goldberg spoke with King about the crackup at the Heritage Foundation, the characters involved, and how it's putting the maxim ‘no enemies to my right' to the test.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Who are the main characters in what has unfolded in the past two weeks or so?

One is an institution, the Heritage Foundation, a storied think tank in Washington that's over a half-century old. Second is the president of the Heritage Foundation, a guy named Kevin Roberts, who has moved it in a very populist, very Trump-aligned direction over the past few years. And then there's Tucker Carlson, a guy I've known for more than 30 years, used to be a colleague at Fox, who after being fired from Fox, has launched his own independent media thing on the web and is doing strange things. And then lastly, is this really horrible gargoyle of a human being named Nick Fuentes. (Sorry, I try very hard not to think about the guy.)

He's a leader of a group of mostly alienated, angry young men that in internet parlance or in social media parlance, people tend to call “Groypers.” He has made a real impact out there for saying the most horrendous things you can say in many respects. But he was one of the guys from the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. He does not dispute being called a neo-Nazi. And so maybe because I have the most Jewy name this side of Shlomo Abramowitz, you might not be surprised that I don't feel like I can be in the same coalition as someone like a Nick Fuentes.

And this is about coalitions. Ultimately, this became about who is in whose camp. Tell us what happened.

Tucker Carlson had Nick Fuentes on his web show, Tucker Carlson Tonight or whatever it's called. [Editor's note: Carlson interviewed Fuentes on The Tucker Carlson Show. Tucker Carlson Tonight was the name of Carlson's canceled Fox News show.] Very friendly, very softball interview where Carlson basically pushed back on none of Fuentes' past statements and current beliefs or anything like that. And it was appalling. It was particularly appalling because we know that Tucker can ask hard questions. He can grill people. When he disagreed with Ted Cruz about the bombing of Iran, he barely let Ted get a word in edgewise and was constantly quizzing him to knock him off his game.

But when he talks to a guy who says he loves Stalin and Hitler and thinks women really want to be raped and all of these sorts of things, he's like, Hmm, tell me more. You know, sort of channeling his old Barbara Walters or something like that. And so a lot of people were very cross about this at the Heritage Foundation, which advertises with Tucker Carlson. Tucker [was] the keynote speaker at their 50th anniversary gala [in 2023].

The Heritage Foundation got a lot of grief for its association with Tucker, and so Kevin Roberts came out and issued a video statement. Nobody disputes that the video statement was a complete frigging disaster. He said, “We will not disavow Tucker Carlson anyway. We will not cancel Tucker Carlson. We are joined at the hip with Tucker Carlson.” And then he said, “And besides, we're not going to cave into a quote ‘venomous' coalition that is representing other interests.” It was this serious dog whistle that suggested that string-pulling Machiavellian Jews were behind this [controversy], and we're not going to cave into it. That was definitely the way it was interpreted by a lot of people outside of Heritage and a lot of people inside Heritage.

The video utterly backfired and caused a whole firestorm of controversy. And [Roberts] had this whole very high-minded explanation about how we shouldn't cancel people. We should engage in their ideas, and we should confront them and argue in the marketplace of ideas — which all sounds great, except that's not what Tucker Carlson had done. What Tucker Carlson had done was basically just give a megaphone to a neo-Nazi.

Kevin Roberts had an all-hands meeting at the Heritage Foundation. A big chunk of it was dedicated to warning staffers that they'll be fired if any video or audio or quotes from this meeting leak. And almost before the meeting was over, the full video had been leaked. So everyone in my world has watched big chunks of it, if not all of it.

One of the things that the video revealed was that there are people at Heritage, young people at Heritage who are not neo-Nazis, but they liked Kevin Roberts' initial statement. They've got some issues with Israel; they've got some issues with people who defend Israel. And then there were other people who were like, “You guys are losing your minds. We cannot be associated with antisemites and crazy people.” Kevin Roberts did not resign, as many people wanted him to, and many people thought he was going to be fired. But he did basically throw his chief of staff under the bus.

Kevin Roberts's defense was basically that he is the right-wing Ron Burgundy. And if you put it in a teleprompter, he will read it. So it was not a profile-in-courage moment.

What does all of this mean? What is all of this about?

It's about a lot of different things. Part of it is just simply an argument about what kind of coalition you're going to have, but it's broader than that.

One of the things that the defenders of Tucker Carlson and the defenders of the Heritage Foundation will say often — with a little more paranoia than I think is warranted — is that this is really all a proxy war about JD Vance. I think that's overstated. It is not all a proxy war about JD Vance, but JD Vance does lurk in the background here, because Vance has blazed a path here where he defended young Republican officials who have these chats about how awesome Auschwitz jokes are and how Nazis are cool.

He also would not be vice president, but for the fact that Tucker Carlson lobbied extensively for him. And if Tucker becomes radioactive, that's bad for Vance. If this crowd that [Vance] has defended and considers part of his coalition is purged, that's bad for him. And so I do think that that's part of what's going on.

But I also think that, look: There are a lot of people who don't think that the right should be a popular front. Historically popular fronts are this thing [that are] more popular, more common on the left — which on the left [meant that] there used to be no enemies to the left. It was like: Don't shoot inside the tent. So what if we have Stalinists in our coalition? We're trying to stop the bad guys. That's the argument that is being used on the right right now, is that the right needs to become a popular front, needs to be a big tent. We need Groypers and Groyper-curious people to be part of our coalition, because they bring youth and passion and energy and yada, yada, yada.

I think it's all nonsense. But it's also hypocritical, because the very people like JD Vance and others who are trying to make the Republican coalition a safer place for these people say that we have to purge the neocons from the conservative movement — that we don't want to hear from the zombie Reaganite crowd. They have no problem silencing and trying to cancel members of the coalition they consider to be rivals. They just use the language of inclusiveness for some of the worst people in the world, because they think there's a political advantage to it.

It's going to be a fight that's going to unfold for a while, because Donald Trump — either for actuarial or constitutional reasons — is not going to be around forever. People are already trying to figure out what the post-Trump right looks like. And this is one of these early skirmishes in that longer-term battle.

            They've been showing up all over Evanston, a leafy suburb north of Chicago: suburban moms fresh from the school run and out to protect their community from what they see as unwelcome visitors.
    


            The strangers are federal officers, sent by the Department of Homeland Security in “Operation Midway Blitz” which was aimed at targeting “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago,” according to Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.
    


            But that doesn't ring true for many in the city that's home to Northwestern University and where 70% of its 80,000 or so residents have a bachelor's degree or higher, and where in August this year, a police newsletter said there had not been a single reported burglary that week.
    


            Cellphone videos posted to social media show what happens when unmarked SUVs roll into Evanston neighborhoods. If residents see federal agents inside, they honk their horns to alert others. Many locals have started wearing whistles to add to the warnings — three short blasts for a sighting, longer whistles if the officers try to detain anyone.
    


            Crowds gather — people come out of their houses, dog walkers pause on their routes, cyclists and drivers make detours — to protest what the agents are doing and remove any element of surprise.
    


            Demonstrators told CNN they just wanted to help people who might be in the US without documents but had committed no crime. Many of the mostly women we spoke to did not want to give their names or draw extra attention.
    


            But some said they had no option but to speak out against what they see as unfair crackdowns not just on immigrants but on the rights to free speech and protest.
    


            Emily Miller, a stay-at-home mom of three, had enough time for family, friends and hobbies while still being involved in causes she cared about.
    


            But the re-election of President Donald Trump in 2024 and then his administration's harsh policies against government agencies and on immigration gave her what she calls an “awakening” that she needed to do more.
    


            One night in January she was catching up and discussing politics with her friend and fellow mom Savanna Essig-Fox, who said she wanted to do something more tangible to show her opposition to the Trump administration, more than the canvassing and phone banks they had volunteered for during the election.
    


            And so, the Pink Poster Club was born.
    


            They printed and put up flyers — on bright pink paper — against Elon Musk's DOGE cuts, for women's rights and about the state supreme court election in nearby Wisconsin, gaining some attention and support.
    


            The administration's deportation agenda also kept hitting the headlines, with raids on workplaces and homes, thousands of people detained and families broken apart.
    


            When immigration patrols turned up on Evanston streets, questioning neighbors and workers Miller and Essig-Fox consider part of their community, their movement became supercharged.
    


            The women were not the targets of any immigration enforcement, and they planned to use that to their advantage, Essig-Fox said.
    


            “We have White skin, we were born here, there's a level of privilege we have. We have comfortable lives here in Evanston, there is a safety that we have and that privilege we can use to do some good,” she said.
    


            The women joined those who blow whistles when government agents are seen on their streets and document any action on their cellphones.
    


            Organizing posters and patrols and protests has taken them away from their family time, but they say even their elementary school-age children understand.
    


            “In order for me to be able to enjoy my kids and enjoy my other hobbies that I never do anymore, like reading or knitting, I can't just pretend something's not happening and go about my life,” Miller said. “In order for me to take a break to read and go out, I have to know that I'm also doing something purposeful.”
    


            And having masked agents coming out of unmarked cars and taking people off the streets has given her a clear and present purpose.
    


            “It's reminiscent of things that have happened in history that, if we follow the pattern, leads to darker treatment of people who don't look like me. I don't want my kids to live in a country where this happens, it's gross,” Miller said.
    


            “They do wish I were at home, but also they know this shouldn't be happening,” she added about her children.
    


            They've made some of their protests family-friendly, complete with hot cocoa and bubble blowers for the kids, and neither regrets their choices.
    


            Essig-Fox said: “My biggest thing as a mother is I want to show my kids how I believe they should live in this world. They should use their privilege, and they should stand up for people and be a good community member — that's what I feel like I'm doing. I just want to be a good community member.”
    


            The arrival of Border Patrol in Evanston as part of “Operation Midway Blitz” in greater Chicago, triggered similar feelings among their neighbors too, with many turning out to blow warning whistles when agents were seen and then filming any action agents took.
    


            Essig-Fox said there is a stark contrast between the agents, often masked and in tactical gear, and the residents who sometimes run out to record events without even putting their shoes on.
    


            “I do think we need to point that out constantly because the juxtaposition of the people who are being brave, civilians who are just coming out of their homes with nothing to protect themselves, no gear, no vests, no shoes sometimes, whistles and a phone, they are honestly being extremely brave because they're facing people who could kill them if they so choose.”
    


            She's not exaggerating. Evanston resident David Brooks had a gun pointed at his face as he recorded the aftermath of a crash when a Border Patrol SUV stopped suddenly and was hit by a car driving behind.
    


            One agent wearing a uniform with a Border Patrol vest who did not disclose his name or appear to have other identification singled Brooks out.
    


            “Keep back or I'ma shoot you,” the officer shouted, changing position so he could grab his pistol and hold it straight at Brooks' face.
    


            Brooks was part of a crowd that gathered around the two vehicles as agents dragged the woman driver out of the car that hit their SUV, handcuffed her and put her in their vehicle.
    


            Another woman was shoved onto the ground as she tried to record on her phone. A man who said he was just approaching to help was taken down by two agents, punched and had his head banged into the pavement. A masked officer also used pepper spray against the crowd.
    


            Videos show more people gathering around the scene, blowing whistles, chanting and recording on their phones, but not physically challenging the officers.
    


            “The crowd was annoying,” Brooks acknowledged to CNN. But, he added, “You don't beat people up because they're annoying you.”
    


            Brooks heard about the commotion on chat groups and cycled there from his home, knowing that his wife Amanda would likely be walking nearby.
    


            She was also part of the crowd, blowing her whistle, but they did not see each other.
    


‘It's like one day everyone left': How immigration crackdowns are reshaping America



            She told CNN her motivation was similar to other mothers in the area — aware that her family was less at risk because they are White, but determined to stand up for all members of her community.
    


            “I think we're trying to protect everybody. It's not just about stopping people from having their face dragged across the cement or strangled. It's about making sure that the kids can walk to school,” she said, adding they were no longer comfortable letting their tween son bike around the neighborhood for fear of what he or other children might come across.
    


            “They're having to adapt to a new normal that they've never experienced before, so we want to protect the kids in the community, we want to protect our neighbors who don't look like us but deserve the right to live their lives without fear.”
    


            Jennifer Moriarty became the second woman bundled into the Border Patrol SUV after she saw the vehicles hit each other near her home.
    


            “I jumped out of my car with other people, and they had that young lady face down on the ground, yanked her out of the car and just threw her on the ground,” she said. “I pulled out my cell phone and before I knew it, one of those agents put me on the ground, threw me on my back. And just stayed on top of me until he could get the handcuffs on me.”
    


            Video shows an officer in tactical gear astride Moriarty before she is put in the unmarked Chevrolet Tahoe. Later she can be seen yelling through an open backseat window.
    


            “We were kidnapped,” Moriarty, a 56-year-old lawyer said.
    


            She condemned the brutality of the officers and pointed out what she saw as their incompetence.
    


            “They put us in the vehicle, they didn't frisk anybody,” she told CNN. “They didn't arrest us. They didn't Mirandize us. I had access to my phone in the car. I was able to get a call off and dial a friend's number, and so she could hear everything that was happening.”
    


            She also hit record on the phone's camera, capturing two videos she shared with CNN.
    


            The detainees in the back of the car are not seat-belted, Moriarty said, as the agent tries to drive through a chanting crowd, tires squealing. The driver curses at those outside and inside the car. “You're going to get maced if you don't f**king listen,” he can be heard yelling to the detainees on the video, which also shows him holding a can of what appears to be irritant spray.
    


            The video shows blood on Moriarty's hands and the young man whose head was banged into the pavement with a facial injury.
    


‘Bunch of liars': Mayor of Evanston, IL slams DHS' account of violent arrest



            Moriarty said she was driven around with the others for a couple of hours, then transferred to another car by herself and driven around more. Moriarty said she was vocal, trying to shame the agents or educate them about history and the present.
    


            “Paul Revere rode a horse screaming ‘The British are coming!'” she said she told the agents. “All this community is doing is blowing a whistle and honking horns, letting them know that you're coming. There's nothing different about that. There's absolutely nothing different.”
    


            Moriarty and the other two people detained — all US citizens — ended up at an FBI office where they were questioned and released, she said. Moriarty said she was never arrested or charged.
    


            The confrontation on a suburban street near an elementary school and a middle school on October 31 has now been cited in a lawsuit arguing that federal immigration agents are violating protesters' First Amendment rights to free speech, using excessive force and making unreasonable seizures.
    


            In a post to X after the event, Tricia McLaughlin of DHS said the man detained along with Moriarty “assaulted and kicked Border Patrol agents. As he was being arrested, here, he aggressively grabbed the agent's genitals and wouldn't let go. The agent delivered several defensive strikes to free his genitals from the perp's grasp.”
    


            But that has been declared false by a judge hearing claims that federal actions led by Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino in and around Chicago are violating the Constitution.
    


            “Despite a statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Mr. Bovino indicating that this individual grabbed the agent's genitals, videos don't bear this out, nor would such force have been appropriate even if this had occurred,” said District Court Judge Sara Ellis as she ruled that federal agents had to comply with a temporary restraining order to protect the rights of protesters.
    


            Two days after the ruling limited the use of force by federal agents unless there was an immediate threat, agents were reported to have used flash-bang grenades and pepper spray against protesters around Chicago, in one case after they said shots were fired at them.
    


            CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security about the agent who pointed his gun and the allegations of kidnapping. DHS did not respond.
    


            Moriarty said she was never afraid, partly because of her race.
    


            “'I'm White, I'm lucky,” she said, echoing the words of the other mothers.
    


            “There's that White privilege that comes into play, but not everybody is going to get that chance.”
    


            As she spoke, almost a week after the event, her body told another part of the story: On her arms, the force used against her had left the white skin color she counted on to protect her black and blue.

            The government shutdown is over. But hundreds of thousands of federal workers are coming back after 43 days to anything but normalcy, employees from across the country told CNN.
    


            Flight delays and cancellations will linger as Air Traffic Controllers staff back up. Workers who haven't received a paycheck in weeks will still have to wait for back pay. Research grants will be delayed. Economic reports are likely to be scrapped. Six weeks of email and voicemails will have to be waded through.
    


            And in three months, they may have to contend with turbulence all over again: The agreement President Donald Trump signed into law Wednesday evening funds most of the government only through January.
    


            “There's no back to normal in this deal because all it does it kick the can until January 30,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit government organization.
    


            “It's a little like the federal workforce is going to return to their house after a hurricane and there's another storm on the horizon.”
    


            Federal workers said that the shutdown has been an exclamation point on top of months of chaos as the Trump administration has slashed jobs and, in some cases, entire agencies since the president took office in January. The administration sought to fire more federal workers when the shutdown hit, but the short-term funding deal halted those dismissals until the end of January.
    


            “It's going to be stressful for everybody,” said Yolanda Jacobs, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883 and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employee. “We can only begin to imagine how difficult it's going to be get everything functioning again, especially since we were already limping along in a lot of ways before the shutdown happened.”
    


            For the American public, the lingering effects of the shutdown could be felt for months or even years to come at the nation's airports. Meanwhile, those receiving government assistance like food stamps are eagerly awaiting the government to finally get funds out the door.
    


            Federal workers back on the clock Thursday will need to assess how to address more than six weeks of backlogs. Federal employees not deemed essential were furloughed throughout the shutdown.
    


            From food safety and NASA to education and the national parks, federal workforces were already short-staffed following widespread cuts from DOGE earlier this year, which employees told CNN will make it even harder to dig out from the under the shutdown.
    


            “This moment is going to look very different than in 2019 (after the last government shutdown) when these offices were fully staffed,” said an Education Department employee.
    


            A second Education employee told CNN that they were told only check their emails at approved times to look for “reduction in force” layoff notices — and to make sure their computers didn't lock down after 30 days.
    


            It was “heart wrenching” to see the emails piling up, the person said, including with desperate pleas from parents of disabled children who filed discrimination cases with the department's Office for Civil Rights. Another Education official estimated that, during the shutdown, there were more than 2,000 complaints filed with the office, which handles allegations of discrimination against students with disabilities.
    


            It will take days to get labs used to test food and prevent food-borne illnesses at the Food and Drug Administration back to full capacity at the agency's testing labs, said one worker at the agency's Human Foods Program.
    


            Besides having to catch up on equipment maintenance and quality checks, “it will take time to restart research along with broader policy planning,” the worker said.
    


            And at the Internal Revenue Service, backlogs in tax filings from those who filed for extensions will take “two to three months to catch up,” said Gibson Jones, president of the National Treasury Employees Union Local 98 in Memphis. “You're talking about more than 40 days of mail that no one touched. People who are expecting money back will also see a delay in processing those tax refunds.”
    


            A big focus at the National Park Service will be assessing any damage that occurred to parks during the shutdown, said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association.
    


            Many parks had law enforcement staffing during the shutdown, but there have been reports of graffiti and off-road vehicle damage in parks like Arches and Glen Canyon, as well as reports of illegal activities like base-jumping and flying drones in Yosemite, Brengel said. But there was a surge of volunteer support during the shutdown, she said, and many parks paid for custodial services like garbage removal with fee money — or volunteer groups stepped in to help.
    


            “Thankfully, many parks didn't get damaged,” Brengel said. “But this is unsustainable and everyone knows it.”
    


            At NASA's iconic Goddard Space Flight Center's main campus in Greenbelt, Maryland - home of the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes -  employees were alarmed as more than a dozen buildings on the campus were emptied and padlocked, with very little notice given, CNN recently reported.
    


            Some of the sources CNN recently spoke to said they fear the sudden moves are part of an effort by the Trump administration to quietly gut the Goddard campus during the shutdown — a claim a NASA spokesperson denied.
    


            “There will be many people who have no idea that this facility closure situation is going on,” a NASA engineer said. “I expect that will be a pretty crazy situation on top of just coming back.”
    


            When the roughly 1.4 million federal workers who have been furloughed or working without pay will receive their back pay may vary by agency. Many have missed two full paychecks and a partial one during the shutdown.
    


            In the past, it only took a few business days for workers to be paid, said Jacqueline Simon, policy director at the American Federation of Government Employees. But she was concerned that this year it could take longer because many human resources staffers at agencies were furloughed or have left amid the administration's downsizing efforts.
    


            Adding to the complexity is that federal workers are not all paid at the same time since the government uses multiple pay systems, said Stier of Partnership for Public Service.
    


            “It's a huge undertaking on top of a lot of other things that the federal employees are going to have to be doing,” he said, though it should take a matter of days, not weeks.
    


            But “until we get paid, everyone's going to still have those same financial stressors on them,” said Ben Emmel, who represents 2,400 Government Accountability Office employees as president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers Local 1921.
    


            The shutdown brought chaos to US airports, and the impact could linger well beyond the reopening of the government.
    


            The US air traffic control system is more than 3,000 controllers short of what's needed to fully staff towers and other facilities that guide planes throughout the country. The current workforce of 14,000 controllers not only had to deal with the regular staffing shortages but also more coworkers not showing up during the shutdown, all while not getting paid.
    


            All this put young controllers in a “very difficult position” during the shutdown, leading some to quit, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told reporters this week, while some older controllers chose to simply retire.
    


            Fifteen to 20 retirement-aged controllers have left per day, Duffy said, up from four in a typical day.
    


In May, the Department of Transportation said it would replace the decades-old Federal Aviation Administration infrastructure with a new air traffic control system for $31.5 billion, but the shutdown could hurt that effort as well.
    


            At a Wednesday press conference at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, Duffy said the software and upgrades the new system requires “would take longer than the three-year period,” originally promised.
    


            The shutdown wreaked havoc on the nation's safety net programs, most notably food stamps relied upon by nearly 42 million Americans to feed themselves and their families.
    


            Just when enrollees in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will receive their full benefits for November will depend on where they live. More than a dozen states started issuing full allotments to residents last week before the Supreme Court paused a court order requiring full funding for the program. Several other states began sending partial benefits last week based on an earlier court order. Other states have not yet distributed any of this month's aid.
    


            After the government reopens, many states could issue full SNAP benefits within three days, said Lexie Kuznick, director of policy and government relations for the American Public Human Services Association, which represents state, county and city agencies. Some, however, could take up to a week to do so.
    


            The spending agreement signed into law takes the threat of another lapse of SNAP off the table in January when another shutdown could occur: The bill funded several agencies, including the US Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, for the entire fiscal year.
    


            However, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, and Head Start could take longer to restart. They are run by the Department of Health and Human Services.
    


            It typically takes at least 30 days for the HHS to calculate states' allocations and get the money out the door for LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. And he fears it will take even longer this year since HHS laid off its LIHEAP staff in the spring.
    


            Federal grants for the roughly 140 Head Start programs – serving more than 65,000 children and families – that were affected by the shutdown could take up to two weeks to distribute, said Tommy Sheridan, deputy director at the National Head Start Association.
    


            The funding lapse forced 20 programs in 17 states and Puerto Rico to close. Other programs have been able to maintain their operations thanks for local and philanthropic support.
    


            Asked about the timeline for getting funds to LIHEAP and Head Start programs, an HHS spokesperson said that the agency will “work swiftly” to administer LIHEAP annual awards. Head Start recipients can expect to receive communications that will include a timeline for the release of federal funds.
    


            Economic data released by the government — which is used by business leaders and the Federal Reserve to assess the state of the US economy — has been suspended throughout the shutdown.
    


            Monthly employment reports for September and October haven't been released, and neither has the first estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy.
    


            Once the government reopens, statistical agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release updated schedules on data releases.
    


            But this is the first time there have been two delayed jobs reports. And it's likely that October's report will never be released, as data for the month was not collected, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday.
    


            “All of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policymakers at the Fed flying blind at a critical period,” Leavitt told reporters.
    


            Caitlin Lewis, who runs CivicMatch, which connects federal employees with jobs in state or local governments, said the shutdown has pushed many federal workers to the exits.
    


            There was a 74% spike in federal workers signing up for the platform during the first five weeks of the shutdown, she said, compared to the five weeks before the shutdown. Last week was one of the platform's busiest weeks in months.
    


            Overall, more than 12,000 federal employees have signed up this year.
    


            “People want to stick it out as long as they can. But this is the latest in a deep cycle of instability that is pushing public servants out of the government since the inauguration,” Lewis said.
    


            When the last government shutdown ended in 2019, a USDA employee returned to find dozens of emails from state agencies with policy questions, which gave her a newfound appreciation for her work and how much she is needed.
    


            But the stress of this year's record-long impasse has forced her to start looking for other jobs.
    


            “This has been the worst six weeks that I can remember,” said the staffer, who had planned a career with the government. “I cannot afford to go through this again, mentally or financially.”

Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) claimed on Wednesday that Democrats blocked his motion to bring the Jeffrey Epstein files to the floor. The congressman made the revelation in a video posted to his social media as he was leaving the Capitol late Wednesday afternoon.

“Just left the House floor, and I tried to do a UC, unanimous consent, tried to get the Epstein files, get it straight to the floor, cut out all this nonsense,” said Burchett. “And, you know, and the Democrats blocked it, oddly enough. Now, here they've had it for four years, and obviously, if there's something there about Trump, they would have released it. And now they're all ‘let's get it out, let's get it out.'”

“Well, I just made a motion to bring it straight to the daggum floor, and they blocked it,” he said. “They blocked it. So, this is politics. It has nothing to do with doing what's right. It's Washington, D.C. to a T.”

“They ought to be ashamed of themselves,” Burchett added. “But they're probably not.”

Burchett's comments about the Democrats blocking his motion came just hours after House Oversight Committee Democrats published emails between Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and author Michael Wolff. In the exchange, Epstein said that Trump “spent hours at my house” and “of course he knew about the girls.”

Burchett also spoke to Bloomberg TV about the Epstein files and whether Trump is mentioned in them. He dismissed such concerns and said the things that are being released are “little pieces” that fit narratives and are “out of context.” Burchett did not speak on the emails released earlier in the day but expressed overall skepticism about anything that would be released.

“The Democrats have had this thing for four years, and let's be honest, if there was something in there detrimental to President Trump, Joe Biden would have released it,” Burchett said in an interview with Bloomberg's Joe Mathieu. “He's the anti-Christ to the Democrats. They want to bury him as soon as they could.”

Burchett also said that Republicans “had it for nine months” and that he expressed frustration over the contents of the emails and files associated with Epstein. 

“I'm just tired of it. I'm tired of all the pontificating back and forth, what's in there, what isn't in there,” Burchett said. “I think what you're seeing right now is both sides are taking out little pieces that fit their narrative, out of context, maybe, or something that's been discharged, is not legitimate, maybe.”

He also blasted Democrats for trying to manipulate public opinion about the Epstein files. He claimed they were weaponizing the emails to humiliate Trump and influence public opinion, and doing all of this while being dishonest about their genuine concerns over Epstein's victims.

“I think that shows what's really going on in the Democratic Party. They're not concerned about the people that are involved,” Burchett said. “Some of them, clearly, they just hate Trump, and they think they're going to embarrass him. They'll release a few emails that are taken out of context or something that's not been verified, or worse, something that's been thrown out as negligible or that's inaccurate. And they'll take it as fact, and then you'll have to rehear all of that. And that's what it'll be. It'll be we'll hear that for the next however many years.” 

When asked if the president should be worried, Burchett said no.

“I don't think so. Like I said, if there was something in there on Trump, I'm sure Biden would've released it. He had those files for four daggum years,” Burchett said. “I've talked to legal experts, a guy back home, Teddy Davis, we've gone over this thing a thousand times, over the backwards and forwards, and things that could be in there and might not be in there.” 

“I don't have a lot of faith in what's in there and what isn't in there right now,” the congressman added. “I think they should have released the files a long time ago because right now it's just all politics.”

President Donald Trump is set to sign the government funding bill, ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.

The signing is scheduled to take place at 9:45 p.m.

The House voted 222-209 in favor of the bill, its last hurdle before reaching the White House. While earning criticism on both sides of the aisle, Trump praised the bill as a victory, while House Democrats were highly critical.

The late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein said in newly released emails that he advised Russia's permanent representative to the United Nations on how to deal with President Donald Trump.

The plethora of Epstein emails released by House Democrats on Wednesday included many that showed his vast international connections. Among these were connections with the Russian government, which Epstein said he helped advise about Trump.

“Churkin was great,” one email to former Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjorn Jagland read, referring to Vitaly Churkin, Russia's former chief diplomat to the United Nations. “He understood Trump after our conversations. It is not complex. He must be seen to get something. [It's] that simple.”

In the same email chain, Epstein urged Jagland to mention him when discussing the matter with Russian President Vladimir Putin and encourage Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to speak with him for further insight on Trump.

His exchanges regarding Russia and Trump were notable for illustrating the hostile relationship between the former friends, with Epstein repeatedly bashing Trump during his first term.

Larry Summers, the treasury secretary during the Clinton administration and economic adviser to the Obama administration, asked Epstein if the Russians “have stuff on Trump,” as he viewed the Helsinki Summit between Trump and Putin as “appalling even by his standards.”

“My email is full with similar comments. wow,” Epstein replied. “Im sure his view is that it went super well. he thinks he has charmed his adversary.. Admittedly he has no idea of the symbolism. He has no idea of most things.” 

He added that Trump's handling of the summit was “predictable.”

Epstein and Trump once counted each other as friends but had a falling out sometime in the mid-2000s. The emails reveal that the animosity between them was mutual in the years leading up to the financier's death.

Despite the falling out, Epstein's alleged contacts with the Russian government and other figures showed he was likely leveraging his former relationship with Trump to make contact with high-level officials.

The email that drew the most attention was one sent by Epstein to his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, in which he allegedly said the “dog that hasn't barked is trump … [victim name] spent hours at my house with him, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc.”

While the victim's name was redacted in the release, House Republicans quickly revealed that the victim in question was Virginia Giuffre, who had repeatedly denied any wrongdoing by Trump.

At a Wednesday White House briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails “prove absolutely nothing other than President Trump did nothing wrong.”

The record-breaking government shutdown is almost at an end after the House voted for a new spending deal late Wednesday night, sending the bill to President Donald Trump's desk after both Democrats and Republicans voted to reopen the government.

In a 222 to 209 vote, the House passed a short-term, Senate-passed continuing resolution to fund the government through the end of January. The bill was largely supported by the Republican conference, with a handful of Democrats joining them in voting for the bill. 

Six Democrats voted for the bill: Reps. Jared Golden (D-ME), Adam Gray (D-CA), Henry Cuellar (D-TX), Don Davis (D-NC), Tom Suozzi (D-NY), and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA). 

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Greg Steube (R-FL) were the sole Republicans who split with the party to vote against the measure.

This is the conclusion to a long shutdown saga that largely took place in the Senate, leading to a 43-day shutdown as Democrats dug in their heels to demand healthcare concessions in exchange for votes. This broke the record of the previous shutdown, which was 35 days under the first Trump administration.

Trump plans to sign the funding deal around 9:45 p.m., per the White House.

Wednesday's vote is the first the House has taken since Sept. 19, with the chamber coming off of a 54-day recess that Democrats have blasted as an “eight-week, paid vacation” for Republicans. The GOP, in turn, has argued that they “did their job” and they would not return to Washington until Senate Democrats voted to reopen the government.

Republicans almost unanimously supported the funding legislation, despite many in the caucus often voting against continuing resolutions as a way to fund the government. Conservative House Freedom Caucus, often the thorn in the side of the leadership, sent a memo saying the bill is a “complete and total win.”

But Johnson's continual proclamation of party unity over the course of the shutdown hit a snag on Tuesday night heading into Wednesday. Republicans became aware of a provision tucked into the spending deal that essentially allows senators to sue the U.S. government for accessing their data without their knowledge. 

The Senate provision was included after it was revealed that several GOP lawmakers' data were collected as part of a Biden-era investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots.

GOP members testifying before and sitting on the Rules Committee insisted they had no idea the provision was included, and many criticized the “optics” behind it. But had Republicans wanted to alter the bill to strip the provision, it would have to go back to the Senate for approval. 

So Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) promised a “standalone” bill on Wednesday that would repeal the provision, with a vote on the legislation to be on the “fast track suspension calendar” for next week. His statement came a half hour after Rep. John Rose (R-TN) introduced such a bill, who said “two wrongs don't make a right.”

But there was some rising anger toward Johnson for allowing the provision to go through.

“That does nothing to change the fact that certain senators will get paid an additional $500k of taxpayer money,” Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL) said responding to Johnson's announcement. “The Senate will never take up your ‘standalone' bill. This is precisely why you shouldn't let the Senate jam the House.”

Steube said leading up to the vote that he would be a “no” on the Jan. 31 CR, telling reporters that he's “not voting to give Lindsey Graham half a million dollars.”

Johnson spoke to the provision following the vote on Wednesday night, saying he was “very angry” and called Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) this morning to have a conversation about it. 

“I think that was way out of line,” Johnson said. “I don't think it was a smart thing to do. I don't think it was the right thing to do, and the House is going to reverse it.”

Johnson added he didn't ask for Thune to commit to bringing the stand-alone bill to the floor.

“I think he regretted the way it was done, and we had an honest conversation about that,” Johnson said.

Johnson gave his members a 36-hour notice to return to Washington late Monday after the Senate altered the stopgap bill the House first passed in September. The original spending deal expired on Nov. 21, which quickly became an unattainable goal after the shutdown spilled over into November and gave appropriators no time to negotiate on the 12 bills needed to fund the government. 

Senate Republicans were joined by seven Democrats and one independent, who caucuses with Democrats, to clear the 60-vote threshold to break the filibuster on Sunday evening. The chamber later passed the bill on Monday, sending it to the House for approval.

After 14 failed votes on the short-term bill previously passed by the House, the Senate's version extended the funding through Jan. 31 and included a “minibus” package of three appropriations bills that would fund the Veterans Affairs and Agriculture departments, among others. 

The CR notably does not include any extension of the Obamacare subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of this year — the main issue that Democrats have been fighting for, which caused backlash from voters and even some lawmakers who have argued that Senate Democrats went through the entire government shutdown to ultimately get nothing.

Johnson capitalized on this, taking a victory lap after the vote to reopen the government to call the shutdown “utterly pointless and foolish.”

“This outcome was totally foreseeable,” the speaker said, adding that “[Democrats] got nothing for their selfish political stunt here.”

“They didn't achieve anything with this at all,” he added.

House Democrats have repeatedly slammed the Senate-passed version, as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) introduced a discharge petition in an effort to force the speaker to hold a vote on a three year extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits set to expire at the end of this year. The petition would need 218 signatures, which is unlikely given the House Democratic caucus sits at 214. 

“The legislation that we will introduce in the context of a discharge petition will provide that level of certainty to working class Americans who are on the verge of seeing their premiums, co-pays, and deductibles skyrocket, in some cases, experiencing increases of $1,000 or $2,000 per year,” Jeffries told reporters Wednesday ahead of the vote. 

Senate Republicans promised to allow a vote next month on the expiring subsidies, with no guarantee that they can pass Congress or be signed into law. Johnson has not made any promises to bring up a bill to extend the subsidies and made clear last week that he was “not part of any negotiations.”

As another concession, Republicans have agreed to reverse thousands of planned layoffs that the White House announced on Oct. 1, the first day of the shutdown. 

The record-setting shutdown, which stoked partisanship, has succeeded in created a rift between Democratic and Republican leadership. Once calling each other their “good friends,” Johnson said Jeffries, along with Schumer, are “irredeemable at this point.” Jeffries said the Republicans holding daily press conferences, mainly Johnson and leadership, are “stone-cold extremist liars.” 

Tensions are also rising between the top four appropriators, also known as the “Four Corners.” The Appropriations Committee is one of the few on Capitol Hill where bipartisanship is not only encouraged but essential, particularly when passing all 12 bills out of committee onto the floor, where they often receive a bipartisan vote in favor of passage. 

The four corners are typically respectful and gracious of their counterparts on the other side of the aisle, but the talks leading up to the Sept. 19 vote and throughout the shutdown proved that Republicans and Democrats were on polar opposite sides.

There really is a “lack of trust,” House Appropriations ranking member Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) said, noting that during a typical appropriations process, all four corners sign off on the bills, but she did not. She particularly slammed Senate Appropriations chairwoman Susan Collins (R-ME), for the Senate's controversial lawsuit provision.

DeLauro added that her concern is, after these last few weeks proving to be more drudgery than progress, “we're going to be here in the same situation on Jan. 30.”

The hemp industry is bracing for layoffs, production reductions and billions in lost revenue after Congress passed a government funding bill late Wednesday containing a surprise provision that will ban nearly all hemp-derived consumer products.

Hemp, a derivative of the cannabis plant, was legalized in the 2018 Farm Bill for industrial uses like rope, textiles and seed. But the law's broad definition created a loophole in federal rules on THC — the psychoactive compound responsible for a high — experts said, allowing producers to extract psychoactive cannabinoids from federally legal hemp. Companies used that opening to flood the market with gummies, drinks and vapes capable of delivering a marijuana-like high.

The new ban, tucked into legislation ending the longest shutdown in history, outlaws products containing more than 0.4 milligrams of total THC per container. Industry executives said that threshold will wipe out 95% of the $28 billion hemp retail market when it takes effect in a year.

For reference, a single hemp gummy typically contains 2.5 to 10 milligrams of THC, according to the Journal of Cannabis Research.

"We have lost the battle this time," said Jonathan Miller, the U.S. Hemp Roundtable's general counsel. "In effect, this is a total, all out, complete ban on hemp products in the United States."

The new cap replaces the 2018 Farm Bill's definition of hemp, which was based on THC concentration and allowed products with less than 0.3% THC by weight instead of total amount.

"We have a year to figure this out but in the meantime you could see losses across the industry if we can't," Miller said.

More than 300,000 jobs tied to the hemp economy are at risk, according to Whitney Economics, a hemp and cannabis research firm, from farmers and extractors to manufacturers, logistics firms and retailers.

The ripple effects could hit land use, contracted acreage and equipment financing, as farmers who scaled up hemp cultivation after 2018 could suddenly face canceled or restructured contracts, said Michael Gorenstein, CEO of marijuana producer Cronos Group. States with the biggest hemp infrastructure like Kentucky, Texas and Utah are likely to face the steepest economic fallout, hemp executives said.

"There's a lot of the small retailers, small businesses and farmers that are relying on hemp sales to survive," Gorenstein told CNBC. "It's going to create a lot of pressure when they start losing business, losing jobs and losing crops."

The crackdown marks a dramatic reversal from 2018 when Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., championed hemp legalization to create a new national agricultural commodity and economic driver for Kentucky.

But after that bill passed, the absence of federal rules allowed a patchwork market to emerge, with widespread safety issues from mislabeled and untested products to items with potency rivaling recreational marijuana, according to government officials and industry experts.

McConnell and other Republicans argued the new restriction "restores the original intent" of the Farm Bill. Closing the loophole, McConnell has said, is key to protecting his agriculture-policy legacy before his retirement next year.

"This was his [McConnell's] signature law, the hemp law, and he wanted to correct it," Boris Jordan, CEO of cannabis company Curaleaf, told CNBC. "Usually the Senate will back a retiring senator, particularly someone as senior as him, as their last action. This was a request by him at the last minute."

But not all Republicans agree. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has sparred with his colleagues for months over hemp and blasted the provision as an overreach that is "killing jobs and crushing farmers," adding that "every hemp seed in the country will have to be destroyed."

"This is the most thoughtless, ignorant proposal to an industry that I've seen in a long, long time," Paul said after the ban was passed.

While leaders like Jordan said the legal market will sharply contract from a ban, they caution the consumer demand for hemp-derived THC will not. Studies have shown demand for marijuana and other THC-based products has continued rising in recent years as some consumers move away from alcohol and drink less overall.

Cannabis executives warned that rising popularity could drive billions in black-market sales, where products face no testing, no age restrictions and no tax compliance.

"What this ban is going to do is it's going to force all those little players right now into the illegal market," Jordan said. "Companies have got way too much money invested in this and the demand is still there and growing. They [companies] aren't just going to go away, they're just going to go into the illicit market and put more people at risk."

And as products move underground, law enforcement agencies could struggle to trace supply chains, Gorenstein said.

"Bad actors thrive when things disappear from the formal economy," Gorenstein said.

State and local governments could also lose out on millions in tax revenue tied to hemp sales, Gorenstein and Miller said. Several states use those funds to support addiction services, county budgets and public health programs.

Moving forward, industry leaders argue the only durable solution is federal standards, not prohibition. Many favor a model splitting responsibility between agencies: the Food and Drug Administration for oversight for product safety and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for taxation and distribution.

Executives have also compared the current environment to the early e-cigarette boom, when products like Juul offered fruity and candy-like cartridges that spread quickly, with uneven oversight, before the FDA intervened.

"Too many people have taken liberties that put the end user at risk," cannabis company Verano Holdings CEO George Archos told CNBC. "We like the tight regulation. We want the safety of the consumer being set in mind for every product that's being produced and that's what we hope is being accomplished."

In the meantime, the industry is preparing a full-court lobbying push aimed at replacing the ban with federal testing, labeling and age-restriction rules.

"We already have members of Congress introducing regulation bills. We are pledging our support and we are working on the grassroots to get citizens activated around the issue," Miller said. "We are activating across the sector."

Simultaneously, the Trump administration is "looking at" reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I drug — alongside heroin and LSD — to a Schedule III drug. The move would not legalize recreational marijuana, but it would make it easier to sell, advocates said.

"Big changes are expected across the board next year but what they will be could determine the future of investments and the industry," Gorenstein said.

Artificial intelligence startup Cursor on Thursday announced it has closed a $2.3 billion funding round at a $29.3 billion post-money valuation, nearly triple what it was worth as of its last raise in June.

Tune in at 4:30 p.m. ET as Cursor CEO Michael Truell joins "Closing Bell: Overtime" to discuss the funding round. Watch in real time on CNBC+ or the CNBC Pro stream.

Cursor built a popular AI coding tool that helps software developers generate, edit and review code. Its parent company, Anysphere, is an applied research lab that was founded in 2022.

Cursor is one of just a handful of AI startups, including OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machines, that are valued at over $10 billion.

Investors including Accel, Thrive Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, DST Global, Coatue, Nvidia and Google participated in its latest funding round, according to a blog post.

"This funding will allow us to invest deeply in our research and build Cursor's next magical moments," Cursor said.

Since the tool first launched in 2023, Cursor said it has crossed $1 billion in annualized revenue and swelled to more than 300 employees.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the company his "favorite enterprise AI service" in an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box" in October.

The company said its in-house models generate more code than "almost" any other large language models in the world.

The coding tool market has grown more crowded in recent months as it's proved to be a lucrative AI use case. Cursor competes with companies like OpenAI, Anthropic and Cognition, which acquired the AI coding startup Windsurf in July.

OpenAI approached Anysphere earlier this year about potentially purchasing Cursor, but the deal failed to gain traction, as CNBC previously reported. OpenAI was also briefly in talks to acquire Windsurf before ultimately introducing its own coding tool called Codex in May.

In September, Anthropic said its coding tool Claude Code has already generated more than $500 million in run-rate revenue for the company since its full launch in May. As of July, Windsurf was generating $82 million in annual recurring revenue, Cognition said in a blog post at the time.

"Internally, we often talk about how high the ceiling is for how great Cursor can become, and how much work still remains to get there," Cursor said.

WATCH: Every engineer is being turbocharged by AI, says Macroscope CEO Kayvon Beykpour

Verizon chairman Mark Bertolini said Thursday that the company's new CEO, former PayPal boss Dan Schulman, is working to revive Verizon from its period of share losses under former CEO Hans Vestberg.

Bertolini, who is also the Oscar Health CEO and who was named Verizon chairman last month, told CNBC's Becky Quick on "Squawk Box" that the company needs to "do something different" as it undergoes its leadership change.

"Verizon has gone from number one in market cap, bond ratings and market share to number three. And the network isn't as differentiated as it used to be, in large part because everybody's been spending money to put these 5G networks in place," Bertolini said. "So losing 30% share over the last eight years is an issue, and we have to do something different."

In October, the company announced Schulman would be replacing Vestberg, who had led the company since 2018. In a statement at the time, Schulman said Verizon was at a "critical juncture" and that he believed the company had a "clear opportunity to redefine our trajectory."

Schulman previously led PayPal through significant revenue growth and has served on Verizon's board of directors since 2018.

Vestberg is remaining on the the board of directors until the 2026 annual meeting and serving as a special advisor through Oct. 4, 2026.

Bertolini said Thursday that Schulman is evaluating underlying cost structures and other aspects of the company to ensure its success.

"We believe that once we have that plan in place, we'll have a good story," Bertolini said. "The Street reacted early on that there's going to be a price war; I think it's less about price war than the value of what we're offering to people through the product."

Bertolini added that Schulman will be revealing his plan for turning around the company "sooner rather than later."

"The board needed to act, and we acted," Bertolini said.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

President Donald Trump ended the longest government shutdown in U.S. history last night, signing into law a short-term funding bill passed by the House of Representatives earlier in the evening that funds the government through January.

Here's what to know:

Mickey Mouse may be joining Pluto in the dog house. Disney missed Wall Street's revenue estimates for the fiscal fourth quarter this morning, sending shares down more than 4% in premarket trading.

While the company's Disney+ streaming service grew, the entertainment giant was hampered by its linear TV business and its its theatrical film slate. But Disney's quarterly earnings came in higher than analysts anticipated.

"Overall we're leaving the year with a lot of momentum," Disney CFO Hugh Johnston told CNBC's "Squawk Box" this morning, referring to the company's streaming and experience businesses.

Mark your calendar: The Supreme Court said it will hear arguments on Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook on Jan. 21. The court in October allowed Cook to keep her job while the case plays out.

Meanwhile, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic announced yesterday that he will leave his position when his term expires in February. Bostic, the first Black and openly gay regional Fed president, said in a statement that he was proud of efforts "to turn the lofty goal of an economy that works for everyone into more of a reality."

As drug costs in the U.S. skyrocket, a growing industry of businesses called alternative funding programs are promising patients more affordable options for accessing specialty medications — in many cases by obtaining the drugs overseas.

Federal authorities are raising alarm about the legality of AFPs and the potential health risks for patients. Nicole Johnson, a special agent with the Department of Homeland Security, said AFPs are fulfilling prescriptions through "unverified" suppliers and "potentially illicit" online pharmacies.

In a new investigation, CNBC traced medications traveling into the U.S. via a supply chain that's not authorized by the drug companies that make them. The investigation shows how ubiquitous these companies — which contract with employer-sponsored health plans — are becoming.

Anthropic announced yesterday that it plans to spend $50 billion to build out infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence. As CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos notes, the move makes the technology company a major U.S. player in physical AI infrastructure. The project will start with custom data centers in Texas and New York and is expected to create 800 permanent jobs and more than 2,000 construction positions.

But there's growing political backlash to the AI industry's data centers, with voters angry over rising electricity prices. Abigail Spanberger, who won last week's governor race in Virginia, promised to make the industry pay "their fair share" of higher costs.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released more than 20,000 documents obtained from sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate yesterday, among which were emails referencing Trump. The president has denied knowing about Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls and young women and has never been charged with wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said the House would vote next week on releasing files related to Epstein.

The International Energy Agency's latest outlook signals that oil demand could keep growing through to the middle of the century, reflecting a sharp tonal shift from the world's energy watchdog and raising further questions about the future of fossil fuels.

In its flagship World Energy Outlook, the Paris-based agency on Wednesday laid out a scenario in which demand for oil climbs to 113 million barrels per day by 2050, up 13% from 2024 levels.

The IEA had previously estimated a peak in global fossil fuel demand before the end of this decade and said that, in order to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, there should be no new investments in coal, oil and gas projects.

The concept of peak oil refers to the point at which global crude production reaches its highest point, before subsequently entering an irreversible decline.

The IEA's end-of-decade peak oil forecast kick-started a long-running war of words with OPEC, an influential group of oil exporting countries, which accused the IEA of fearmongering and risking the destabilization of the global economy. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, meanwhile, labeled the IEA's peak oil demand assumption as "nonsensical."

The IEA's latest forecast of increasing oil demand was outlined in its "Current Policies Scenario" — one of a number of scenarios outlined by the IEA. This one assumes no new policies or regulations beyond those already in place.

The CPS was dropped five years ago amid energy market turmoil during the coronavirus pandemic, and its reintroduction follows pressure from the Trump administration.

Earlier this month, the IEA said that now that the world has passed through the pandemic and global energy crisis, "there is merit in revisiting the CPS."

The agency said increasing oil demand would be primarily driven by demand for petrochemical products and jet fuel, alongside a slowdown in the growth of electric vehicles.

Gregory Brew, an analyst at Eurasia Group's Energy, Climate and Resources team, said the IEA's retreat on peak oil demand signified "a major shift" from the group's position over the last five years.

"The justifications offered for the shift include policy changes in the U.S., where slow EV penetration indicates robust oil [consumption], but is also tied to expected increases in petrochemical and aviation fuel in East and Southeast Asia," Brew told CNBC by email.

"It's unlikely the agency is adjusting based on political pressure — though there has been some of that, with the Trump administration criticizing the group's supposed bias in favor of renewable energy — and the shift reflects a broader skepticism that oil demand is set to peak any time soon," he added.

In an apparent thawing of tensions between two major players in the energy industry, OPEC welcomed what it described as the IEA's "rendezvous with reality."

In a statement published on its website, OPEC said: "We hope that the IEA's World Energy Outlook represents a return to the fold of analysis grounded in energy realities and that we have passed the peak in the misguided notion of 'peak oil.'"

Alongside its CPS, the IEA also laid out projections under its so-called "Stated Policies Scenario" (STEPS), which reflects the prevailing direction of travel for the global energy system.

In this assumption, the IEA said it expects oil demand to peak at 102 million barrels per day around 2030, before gradually declining. Global electric car sales are much stronger under this scenario compared to the CPS.

The IEA said its multiple scenarios explore a range of consequences from various policy choices and should not be considered forecasts.

Grant Hauber, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), said the IEA's CPS appears to be the U.S. administration "capitulation" scenario, which sees some sort of flattening of current energy market trends.

"This leads to what almost appears to be a false dawn of LNG demand that could provide encouragement to those investing in the U.S. LNG export boom. CPS 'creates' enough global LNG demand to justify build-outs through 2035," Hauber said.

"However, one only need look at the STEPS scenario to see how fragile that outlook is. Demand-Supply matching evaporates quickly over that same timeframe leading to LNG surplus. This occurs even with STEPS' more moderated additions of renewables, efficiency and electrification measures," he added.

In all of the IEA's scenarios, the energy watchdog predicted that global temperatures will rise by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Scientists have repeatedly warned that global average temperatures must not increase by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the worst of the climate crisis.

This threshold is recognized as a crucial long-term target because tipping points become more likely beyond this level. Tipping points can lead to dramatic shifts or potentially irreversible changes to some of Earth's largest systems.

Extreme temperatures are fueled by the climate crisis, the chief driver of which is the burning of fossil fuels.

Lars Nitter Havro, head of energy macro at Rystad Energy, said the IEA's reintroduction of its CPS represents "a tonal shift," but shouldn't necessarily be seen as a "wholesale reversal" on peak oil.

TKO Group Holdings — the parent company of UFC and Zuffa Boxing — has signed a multiyear partnership with Polymarket to bring real-time prediction markets into live combat sports.

The deal makes UFC and Zuffa Boxing the first sports organizations to incorporate prediction market technology into live events. Polymarket will provide real-time data visualizations of fan sentiment and momentum during fights, offering an additional layer of engagement alongside traditional sports betting.

"What's exciting about our approach is you can buy and sell and you can trade just like a stock throughout the fight," Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan said Thursday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "You can buy and sell as momentum swings. We will start with that and we will take from there based on customer feedback."

The deal follows Polymarket's recent partnerships in the sports world, including collaborations with the NHL and PrizePicks, as the company continues to expand beyond politics and global events into live entertainment.

"By partnering with Shayne and his team at Polymarket, we're unlocking a new dimension of fan engagement," said Ariel Emanuel, executive chair and CEO of TKO, in a statement. "Integrating Polymarket with the UFC and Zuffa Boxing live experience will help fans interact with these events in real time, transforming passive viewership into active participation."

Beginning in 2026, all UFC and Zuffa Boxing events will stream exclusively in the U.S. on Paramount+.

Joby Aviation completed the first test flight of its hybrid defense aircraft, three months after the company teamed up with government contractor L3Harris on the project.

The successful launch occurred on Nov. 7, at Joby's facility in Marina, California, the company said on Thursday. Chairman Paul Sciarra told CNBC that the flight showcases Joby's ability to quicky move from "concept to demonstration" to meet growing military needs.

Joby and L3Harris first said they were collaborating on a military craft with autonomous or piloted capabilities in August.

The U.S. government is investing aggressively under the Trump Administration on new autonomous, artificial intelligence and defense technology to improve the military's capabilities. The president has also outlined plans for a $175 billion "Golden Dome" missile defense system.

"The defense landscape is really changing," Sciarra said, adding that it's playing out in conflicts like the war between Russia and Ukraine, "where commercial technologies are being rapidly deployed."

Joby, which is widely known for its electric vertical takeoff and landing aircrafts, or eVTOLs, is currently racing to get certified by Federal Aviation Administration to start flying commercially. The company's stock price has doubled this year.

Joby is betting big on Saudi Arabia as a major testing ground for its technology, signing an agreement this week to bring its air taxis to the Middle Eastern country.  The company is also working with the United Arab Emirates. 

The market has gotten a boost from an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in June to create an eVTOL pilot program.

Archer Aviation, which was named the official air taxi provider for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, has seen its stock surge 86% over the last year and Amazon-backed Beta Technologies debuted on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this month.

Sciarra said the aircrafts developed with L3Harris are currently geared toward defense companies, but commercial customers could benefit from the technology as Joby builds and tests it.

"We think there is great opportunity for a hybrid version of this aircraft in the commercial context that can compete with single aisle regional transport today," he said.

Joby plans to let government agencies and departments start testing the vehicles next year.

With ski season approaching, Uber wants to take you to the slopes.

The ride-hailing company on Thursday announced Uber Ski, which will allow users to book a ride to and from nearly 40 mountains in the U.S., Canada, Switzerland and France, according to a release. The services is available through March.

Uber is partnering with Vail Resorts to let riders book an Uber Reserve directly to the mountain resort company's various destinations. Users can buy an Epic Pass, which grants access to more than 90 ski and snowboarding resorts, directly on the app.

Riders can reserve an UberXL or UberXXL up to 90 days in advance, with the larger vehicles offering more trunk space to fit extra gear.

The launch is a part of a series of updates Uber is offering ahead of the holiday season.

Pradeep Parameswaran, Uber's global head of mobility, said that new features will help "people spend less time stressing about logistics and more time enjoying the moments that matter" during the festive months.

The company is also rolling out Uber Share at three airports as flight delays and cancellations continue to pile up across the country from the government shutdown. President Donald Trump late Wednesday signed into law a funding bill to end the longest shutdown of the federal government in U.S. history.

At John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in New York and Orlando International Airport in Florida, riders can use Uber Share to save up to 25% by pairing up with another traveler headed in the same direction.

Additionally, Uber released a new "Send a Ride" in-app feature that lets users cover the expense of someone else's ride by sending a voucher link that will be automatically applied to the person's next trip. The company already has a gifting option for its Uber Eats platform.

When using the Send a Gift feature, customers will be able to include a video that could be personalized or picked from a selection of celebrities, including Megan Thee Stallion, the Jonas Brothers and Tracee Ellis Ross.

Michael Burry of "The Big Short" fame has terminated his hedge fund's SEC registration, signaling that he'll no longer manage money for external clients.

Scion Asset Management was deregistered on Monday, according to regulatory disclosures. Burry's fund managed about $155 million for four accounts in late March, per its most recent Form ADV filing.

Burry posted a screenshot of Scion's terminated status in an X post on Wednesday evening. The contrarian investor foreshadowed the move in a previous post on October 30, his first since April 2023.

So, I bought 50,000 of these things for $1.84.Each of those things is 100 doodads. So I spent $9,200,000, Not $912,000,000. @CNBC @WSJ @FTEach of those doodads let me sell $PLTR at $50 in 2027. That was done last month. On to much better things Nov 25th. pic.twitter.com/9Voy3nwiTD

"Sometimes, we see bubbles," he wrote. "Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play."

In subsequent posts, he compared the artificial intelligence boom to the dot-com bubble, fueling fresh concerns that AI speculation has driven stock valuations to unsustainable levels, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 hitting record highs recently.

Burry shot to fame for predicting — and profiting from — the 2008 US housing market crash. His massive bet against the housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie "The Big Short."

The Scion boss rattled financial markets last week when his firm's third-quarter portfolio update revealed it owned bearish put options on two leading AI stocks, Nvidia and Palantir, as of September 30.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp and Burry traded barbs after the disclosure. Karp described Scion's bets as "batshit crazy" in a televised interview, prompting Burry to retort on X that he wasn't surprised Karp "cannot crack a simple 13F."

In his X post on Wednesday, Burry called out media outlets for reporting he'd bet $912 million against Palantir. He clarified that he'd purchased 50,000 put option contracts on Palantir stock, each covering 100 shares with a premium of $1.84 per share, for a total outlay of $9.2 million.

"That was done last month," he wrote. "On to much better things Nov 25th."

Burry has been teasing his next move and his "unchained" status for several days. 

As of Thursday morning, his X bio reads: "Official X account for 'The Big Short' Michael Burry, M.D., dubbed 'Cassandra' by Warren Buffett. Now unchained -??? launches Nov 25th, Stay Tuned!"

Burry made a similar move in 2008 after his big short paid off. He closed Scion Capital after facing intense pressure from clients, with some demanding their money back before the housing bubble finally burst. He relaunched it as Scion Asset Management in 2013, tightly controlling its number of external clients.

Burry is one of several high-profile investors who've closed their doors to outside capital. Doing so can release them from the pressures of answering to clients and being responsible for their money, and duties such as writing quarterly letters and talking them through key positions.

John Paulson, who along with Burry, was one of the few people to successfully short the housing bubble, converted his hedge fund into a family office in 2020.

Even when big-name investors cash out their clients, they can still be significant market players with their own money.

Billionaires David Tepper, who owns the Carolina Panthers and runs Appaloosa Management, and Stanley Druckenmiller, who worked with George Soros and runs Duquesne Capital, handed back external funds years ago but are still closely followed on Wall Street.

Similarly, Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors has continued to be an active stock picker and prominent commentator since converting his hedge fund into a family office in 2018.

The late Julian Robertson, who founded hedge fund Tiger Management, arguably grew more influential after he returned outside money and began focusing on seeding former employees and promising investors.

The so-called Tiger Cub funds have spawned a generation of billionaire investors such as Chase Coleman, Andreas Halvorsen, Philippe Laffont, and more.

Burry may be handing his clients their money back, but his social-media posts suggest he's not going anywhere — and may feel more liberated to say and do what he wants.

"Big Short" investor Michael Burry, known for his successful bets against the U.S. housing market in 2008, has deregistered his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management.

The Securities and Exchange Commission's database showed Scion's registration status as "terminated" as of November 10. Deregistering would imply the fund is not required to file reports with the regulator or any state.

Bets by Scion, which managed $155 million in assets as of March, have long been dissected for hints of looming bubbles and signs of market froth.

In a post on social media platform X on Wednesday, Burry said, "On to much better things Nov 25th." Scion Asset Management did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Burry has stepped up criticism of technology heavyweights, including Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, in recent weeks, questioning the cloud infrastructure boom and accusing major providers of using aggressive accounting to inflate profits from their massive hardware investments.

"Burry's decision feels less like 'calling it quits' and more like stepping away from a game he believes is fundamentally rigged," said Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management.

Burry has argued that as companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet-owned Google, Oracle and Meta pour billions into Nvidia chips and servers, they are also quietly stretching out depreciation schedules to make earnings look smoother.

Between 2026 and 2028, those accounting choices could understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported profits across the sector, he estimated.

"Don't count him out, just expect him to operate off the grid for a while. He may simply pivot to a family-office setup and run his own capital," said Schneller.

The investor's short position against subprime mortgage securities during the housing market crash was chronicled in Michael Lewis's book, "The Big Short", and its film adaptation.

His profile on X, titled "Cassandra Unchained," is seen as a nod to the Greek mythological figure cursed by Apollo to deliver true prophecies that no one would believe.

Investment advisers with assets under management of $100 million or more have to register with the SEC, and are primarily subject to federal regulation instead of state regulation.

Burry joins a cast of high-profile investors navigating a market that has become increasingly hostile to bearish views in recent years, thanks to unfettered optimism around technology and strong interest from retail investors.

Hindenburg Research shuttered earlier this year after a string of high-profile calls, including bets against India's Adani Group and U.S. electric-truck maker Nikola.

Veteran short seller Jim Chanos, best known for his bets against energy trader Enron months before the company's bankruptcy, has also sparred with Michael Saylor's bitcoin holding company Strategy.

Chanos has argued that Strategy's valuation premium was unjustified, a critique that drew a sharp response from Saylor.

U.S. Treasury yields held steady on Thursday as investors welcomed the end of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.

The 10-year Treasury yield rose almost 2 basis points to 4.098%. The 2-year note yield was also up nearly 2 basis points at 3.585%, while the 30-year bond yield climbed more than 2 basis points to 4.685%.

One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Late on Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed into law a funding bill to end the U.S. government shutdown, which lasted a total of 43 days. The measure was passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday night in a 222-209 vote.

"Republicans never wanted a shutdown," Trump said. "People were hurt so badly." He noted that more than 1 million federal workers were furloughed.

During the shutdown, key economic reports were delayed including the consumer price index, producer price index, and the non farm payrolls report.

These reports may never be released, said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday.

"The Democrats may have permanently damaged the Federal Statistical system with October CPI and jobs reports likely never being released," Leavitt said. "All of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policymakers at the Fed, flying blind at a critical period."

Short seller Andrew Left isn't shy about publicizing his bearish bets against the hottest stocks. Known as one of the more prominent GameStop shorts during the meme-stock mania of 2021, he recently revealed a short bet against Palantir, one of the top AI names this year.

Now, he's unpacking his bearish thesis on targets in the quantum space. Left this week told Business Insider about why he's short Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum, stocks that are up 78% and 214% respectively in 2025. 

Left helped popularize short-selling in the early 2000s, publicly sharing detailed reports unpacking his bearish views on troubled companies such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which he compared to an Enron-style fraud.

His bearish views on the quantum trade are mainly aimed at Rigetti, which he thinks is vulnerable to the high R&D costs associated with quantum development. Left's Citron Research was already bashing Rigetti as early as December of last year, when the stock was under $10 a share. It has since exploded higher, and Left is no more convinced that the stock is a buy.

"What have we learned about technology over the past four years?" he mused. "We've learned that it's expensive, that lead times mean everything, and that talent means everything."

Left said he once recommended Rigetti stock as a speculative play when it was trading at around $0.90 per share a few years ago, but after meeting with management, he said he's concerned about its quantum technology, specifically about its R&D spending and the stiff competition from tech titans that are investing in the space, primarily Google parent, Alphabet. 

Google has recently announced new developments that have been hailed as breakthroughs in the space, which could spell trouble for Rigetti and its similarly sized peers. 

"The commercialization of it was like the most uncertain thing you ever heard of," Left recalled of his meeting with Rigetti management. He also flagged that Rigetti insiders have been offloading shares in recent months. 

Rigetti did not respond to a request for comment. 

While Left made it clear he thinks most quantum stocks are overvalued, there is at least one that he is bullish on in the space: Churchill Capital Corp, the blank-check partner of quantum producer Infleqtion.

Left wrote in a post on X that he sees Infleqtion's business model of producing quantum technology that can be integrated into an ecosystem driven by tech giant Nvidia as a winning formula, while Rigetti's focus on building hardware that will compete with industry leaders is likely a mistake.

"Infleqtion has customers, revenue, and NVIDIA validation. Rigetti has dilution and press releases. The market hasn't priced the gap between execution and aspiration — yet," he wrote in a post in October.

The short-seller also dismissed the idea that the US government would be interested in an equity stake in any quantum company, adding that he doesn't see that as a likely scenario or a bullish indicator. Quantum stocks recently surged 

"Donald Trump's not taking US money and bailing out CEOs that sell stock," he stated. "That's not the government's way of doing things, especially not DJT."

Starbucks Workers United launched an open-ended strike in more than 40 cities Thursday on Red Cup Day, one of the chain's biggest sales days of the year.

The protest, which the union says involves more than 1,000 baristas in over 65 stores, comes after Workers United voted to authorize an open-ended strike after baristas and the coffee giant failed to reach a collective bargaining agreement.

The strike could hurt business during Starbucks' busy holiday season, which typically provides a sales boost and will be key to the chain's plan to turn around performance in the U.S. under new CEO Brian Niccol. Starbucks broke a nearly two-year streak of same-store sales declines in its most recently reported quarter. Past strikes have impacted less than 1% of its stores, the company said.

Starbucks said the work stoppage had limited effects on its key sales day as of late Thursday morning.

"The day is off to an incredible start - based on what we've seen this morning, we're on track to exceed our sales expectations for the day across company-operated coffeehouses in North America," Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CNBC on Thursday.

The union is pushing for improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges levied against Starbucks. The two parties have not been in active negotiations to reach a contract after talks between them fell apart late last year.

Starbucks and the union entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April. Both sides have pointed blame at the other for failure to reach a bargaining agreement, and say they're ready to negotiate.

Workers United, which began organizing at Starbucks in 2021, says it now represents more than 12,000 workers across more than 550 stores. The company last week told CNBC that the union only represents 9,500 workers at 550 cafes.

The baristas say they are prepared to escalate the work stoppage, threatening to make this "the largest, longest strike in company history if Starbucks fails to deliver a fair union contract and resolve unfair labor practice charges." It is seeking new proposals that address its top issues to finalize a contract.

"If Starbucks keeps stonewalling a fair contract and refusing to end union-busting, they'll see their business grind to a halt," Starbucks Workers United spokesperson Michelle Eisen, a former barista who spent 15 years at the company, said in a statement. "No contract, no coffee is more than a tagline — it's a pledge to interrupt Starbucks operations and profits until a fair union contract and an end to unfair labor practices are won. Starbucks knows where we stand."

In response to the strike vote results last week, Starbucks previously said it will be ready to serve customers across its nearly 18,000 company-operated and licensed stores this holiday season.

"Starbucks offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners. Workers United, which represents only 4% of our partners, chose to walk away from the bargaining table. We've asked them to return—many times. If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk. We believe we can move quickly to a reasonable deal," Anderson said in a statement Monday.

In a letter to workers addressing the strike authorization vote last week, Sara Kelly, chief partner officer at Starbucks, echoed the belief that the sides could reach an agreement swiftly.

"For months, we were at the bargaining table, working in good faith with Workers United and delegates from across the country to reach agreements that make sense for partners and for the long-term success of Starbucks," Kelly said. "We reached more than 30 tentative agreements on full contract articles."

"Our commitment to bargaining hasn't changed," she added. "Workers United walked away from the table but if they are ready to come back, we're ready to talk. We believe we can move quickly to a reasonable deal."

Back in August, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Waymo can't drive on highways because of the mix of sensors on the Alphabet company's robotaxis.

Waymo's fifth-generation autonomous driving platform has five lidars, six radar sensors, and 29 cameras.

It's this mix of lidar, radar, and cameras, Musk wrote on X, that leads to "sensor contention" in which the information from the lidar and radars "disagree" with the cameras.

"This sensor ambiguity causes increased, not decreased, risk," Musk wrote. "That's why Waymos can't drive on highways."

On Wednesday, the robotaxi company began providing paid trips on major freeways in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix for select users.

Business Insider demoed a freeway ride last week, taking the 101 freeway in California's Bay Area. The route cut the commute time by 17 minutes compared to a Waymo ride without freeway access, Business Insider found. There were no notable incidents.

Musk has long been vocal about his stance against lidar — a type of sensor that shoots laser light to measure the distance to objects. While Tesla uses lidar for internal testing, Musk has said that the sensor is an expensive "crutch" that could get in the way of effectively scaling robotaxis.

"Anyone relying on lidar is doomed," he said in 2019.

Musk, for his part, is not making up claims about sensors providing conflicting readings of the real-world environment.

Waymo employees themselves acknowledged in one 2022 research paper the need to address the "ambiguity" between the input from camera and radar sensors. However, that same paper explores a method that could mitigate — but not completely solve — the ambiguity in part by having the radar essentially double-check and refine the camera's distance estimates.

Musk and a Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

The Tesla CEO may be quick to dismiss Waymo's progress, but he has also given the company its flowers.

During Tesla's shareholder meeting on November 6, Musk thanked the company for "paving the path" for quicker regulatory approval around robotaxis. Today, replying to an X post from Google's chief scientist, Jeff Dean, about Waymo's new highway access, Musk wrote, simply: "Congrats."

BEIJING — Preliminary figures for China's biggest shopping event of the year indicated slower sales as consumers tie their purse strings tighter amid weak economic growth.

The Double 11 shopping festival this year recorded 1.695 trillion yuan (about $238 billion) in sales across all platforms, marking a 14.2% jump year on year, according to Chinese consumer research firm Syntun. That's slower than the 26.6% year on year growth last year.

Consumers were "more rational and willing to pay for real value, exhibiting a "tiered system based on needs" characteristic," according to a Google translation of the report.

Singles' Day, also known as Double 11, is China's biggest shopping event of the year and, in terms of value of goods sold, far exceeds that of Black Friday in the U.S.

But as China's economic growth has slowed, companies have increasingly extended the promotional period, and stopped reporting gross merchandise volume — an industry measure of sales over time.

China's top leaders last month signaled they will increase efforts to support consumption. Beijing has preferred to subsidize consumer purchases of targeted goods such as electronics, rather than handing out cash.

The country is expected to report 2.8% year-on-year growth in retail sales for October, according to a Reuters poll. That would be down from 3% growth in September.

Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps Western consumer brands sell online in China, estimated overall sales growth this year will be in the "high-single digits to low-double digits" versus in 2024.

Still, more than 10 flagship online stores selling from fashion to health products saw orders at least 30% above expectations, Cooke said.

"That's really rare for us," he added. "We wouldn't like to underestimate or overestimate our internal numbers."

During the sales period, e-commerce platforms received a boost from integrating artificial intelligence in their supply chain.

JD.com reported a record transaction value for this Singles' Day as of Tuesday midnight, without disclosing the amount. The consumer electronics-focused platform reported a nearly 60% increase in orders and over 40% growth in users placing orders.

The Chinese giant kicked off its promotions this year on Oct. 9, several days earlier than last year.

Alibaba in contrast is pushing its shopping event through Nov. 14 this year, after kicking off promotions on Oct. 15.

The two companies, along with Tiktok shop, ushered in 67 billion yuan solely on instant retail sale, a 138.4% year-on-year increase, according to data from Syntun.

In contrast, community group-buying, where consumers create groups to buy groceries in bulk, brought in 9 billion yuan – a 35.3% year-on-year decrease, the report showed.

Chinese smartphone and consumer electronics giant Xiaomi said that as of 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, it had sold 29 billion yuan worth of goods across online platforms and physical stores for the Singles' Day period.

Last year, Xiaomi started its campaign one day earlier and reported 31.9 billion yuan in sales.

Across all product categories, Syntun recorded that home appliances ranked first for 16.5% of total sales (266.8 billion yuan) followed by mobile phones and digital products (14.6% of total sales), and apparels (14%).

The Singles' Day numbers are a significant indicator of fourth-quarter spending trends that help consumer brands determine how to position for the next two quarters of the upcoming year, WPIC Marketing + Technologies' Cooke said.

Consumption trends during the sales period showed that growth may be uneven across categories.

The mother and baby category underperformed during the Singles' Day period, while pet products were in line with expectations, Cooke observed. Meanwhile, toys aimed at older audiences were "coming down to earth" after skyrocketing in popularity last year, he added.

Syntun's data showed that the mother and baby category ranked 9th place in sales, bringing in about 61.1 billion yuan, while pet food reached 9.4 billion yuan sales across four e-commerce platforms – Alibaba, JD.com, TikTok shop, and Kuaishou.

Syntun's report also showed that consumers were more focused on health, convenience and purchasing from brands that reflected their values.

This report is from this week's CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter, which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse. Subscribe here.

Rajat Mehta, scion of Mumbai-based Mehta Group, walked out of the listing ceremony of Billionbrains Garage Ventures or Groww, on Wednesday, feeling vindicated.

The company he backed in 2016 as an early-stage investor, at a valuation of roughly $1.3 million, debuted at $8.6 billion on the National Stock Exchange.

The 36-year-old felt a sense of pride after his father, Rakesh Mehta, told him, "Let's find the next Groww to invest."

Coming from a business family whose fortunes were built on advisory, wealth management and brokerage services, the Mehtas traditionally preferred the comfort of listed companies.

But it was the younger Mehta who pushed the family toward investing in unlisted assets and startups when he joined the business in 2013.

"The first startup I invested in went bust within three months," he recalled. "But I learnt from that and kept on investing." He has now invested in 35 startups, including some valued at over a billion dollars and are in the process of being listed.

The millennial is part of a broader shift among wealthy Indian families who are investing in startups.

India is on the cusp of an unprecedented intergenerational wealth transfer, with an estimated $1.5 trillion expected to change hands over the next decade, according to a report by Julius Baer and EY in June this year.

Between 2018 and 2024, the number of family offices in India rose more than 500% to over 300 from 45, the report said, citing a separate study. Another measure of rising wealth — the number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, or families with assets above $30 million — also increased to roughly 13,000 in the same period.

The true number of family offices in India could be five to 10 times higher, according to multiple wealth managers that I interviewed for this newsletter.

The next generation of these wealthy families is typically well educated, often with international degrees, and may be reluctant to pursue the traditional family business or remain unconvinced about their growth prospects, Vikrant Agarwal, managing partner of Delhi-based Proxima Capital Services, told me.

Many of the old, affluent families, especially those from smaller cities in India, still hold much of their wealth in physical assets like land and gold. Once those physical assets are converted into financial assets, the number of family offices in India will rise, said Shailesh Balachandran, founder of TriGen Wealth.

India's "new rich" are emerging from startup employees cashing in on stock options and returning nonresident Indians bringing back wealth, and a booming stock market. On the old money side, baby boomers are transferring larger pools of wealth to the next generation.

This transfer of wealth is also speeding up the shift from physical to financial assets, which are easier to distribute, said Balachandran, whose firm caters to family offices in cities like Erode, Salem, Coimbatore, Bangalore and Kochi.

The next generation is not solely focused on wealth preservation, but also creating more of it through high-risk investments that generate alpha, experts told me.

One young heir of a family office, which has made money in the textile business, wants to explore high-risk investments in the startup space, even though his father has never invested beyond safe-haven assets like real estate and bank deposits, said Balachandran, who added that some clients now want 20% or more of their portfolios allocated to startups.

Venture capital firms like Bengaluru-based Inflexor Ventures are benefiting from the shift. The firm plans to raise $150 million for its third fund targeting startups in artificial intelligence, robotics, space and automation.

Nearly half of the capital in its second fund came from Indian family offices, said Murali Krishna Gunturu, a partner at Inflexor Ventures, who expects similar participation this time.

In 2021, the year when 45 Indian startups became unicorns — valued over $1 billion — many family offices woke up to the benefits of investing in these companies, Gunturu said. He added that some family offices are now investing directly.

"Now, family offices are investing directly into startups adjacent to their businesses. Case in point is NoPo, an investment we made as a VC, which was suggested to us by one of the family offices," said Gunturu, referring to a startup manufacturing carbon nanotubes, which are used in various industries ranging from semiconductors to EV batteries and medical devices.

Millennials and Gen Z heirs also see startup investing as a new line of business, especially if the family business does not align with their interests.

When Indian quick commerce startup Zepto sought new funding last year, Indian family offices deployed $300 million in just four weeks, said Mehta, who was among the investors.

Other investments may deliver annual returns of 15%, but startup investments, he noted, offer the possibility of far larger gains.

"There is a belief that the youngsters feel that out of 10 startups, one will emerge and become substantially large, like a Zomato," said Balachandran, adding that some traditional listed companies took two decades to reach multi-trillion-Indian-rupee market capitalizations.

"Zomato achieved that within months of listing."

Praveen Jagwani, CEO of UTI International, said India and the U.S. have reached key concessions, paving the way for a trade deal.

Ramesh Swaminathan, Executive Director and CFO of Lupin, said India's weight-loss drug market could reach $1 billion. 

Duvvuri Subbarao, the former governor of the Reserve Bank of India and currently a senior fellow at the Yale Jackson School of Global Affairs, said India's domestic market will not be able to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs on growth.

India inflation cools more than expected in October. The headline inflation number was 0.25%, below estimates of a 0.48% rise and easing more than the 1.54% recorded in September.

Trump said tariffs on India may be reduced. He made the comments on Monday during the swearing-in ceremony of Sergio Gor, the U.S. Ambassador to India.

India's auto sales just had a blowout month. Total retail sales across all vehicle segments were up 40.5% from a year earlier, underscoring a sharp rebound in domestic consumption that could offset the impact of the slowdown in exports to the U.S.

If [India's] exports to U.S. are hit, it will create a disproportionate impact on jobs. It will create or increase inequality across people and regions. Another issue Trump's tariffs might create is China dumping those products to other markets where India competes with it. India will be competed out in those sectors.

— Duvvuri Subbarao, Former RBI Governor

The Nifty 50 index has risen 1.57% so far this week, and is set to break a two-week decline. The index has risen 9.87% for the year to date.

The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield ticked slightly higher to 6.5135%, nearly unchanged from last week.

Business Insider Edition 

Kenya has estimated that around 200 of its nationals are currently fighting in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, on the Russian side, and more could be drawn into the war.


        Last week, Kenya's President, William Ruto, brought attention to Kenyans engaged in a conflict in which the nation has no vested interest.
    


        The president then requested that the Ukrainian government secure the release of Kenyans currently held in Ukraine.
    


        His appeal came in response to mounting distress calls from Africans in Ukraine, who claim they are being recruited to join the Russia-Ukraine war on false grounds.
    


        In response, Ukraine warned that an estimated 1,400 people from three dozen African nations are fighting with Russian soldiers; some of them were tricked into joining.
    


        Andriy Sybiha, the foreign minister of Ukraine, asserted that Russia was pressuring Africans to sign "equivalent to ... a death sentence" and called on African nations to alert their people.
    


        However, Kenya's focus seemed to be on its people being lured to fight on the Ukrainian side, a focus that has now shifted to Russia.

        “I have requested President Zelensky to facilitate the release of any Kenyan in Ukrainian custody. I am grateful to His Excellency for acceding to my appeal,” Ruto said last week, after a phone call with Ukirane's head of state.
    


        "I had a productive conversation with the President of Kenya, William Ruto. I informed him about Russia's attacks on people and infrastructure, and I am grateful for his warm words of support.
    


        We are aware of all the fraudulent methods being used and will work more closely to put an end to them,” Zelenskyy stated.
    


        In light of Ukraine's warnings, as recently reported by Reuters, Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also acknowledged that Russia is recruiting Kenyans to fight.
    


        "Recruitment exercises in Russia have reportedly expanded to include African nationals, including Kenyans," a statement by the ministry read.
    


        "Over two hundred Kenyans may have joined the Russian military... recruitment networks are still active in both Kenya and Russia," the statement said.
    


        The ministry also disclosed that Kenya's embassy in Moscow has documented injuries among some of the recruiters, who were reportedly promised up to $18,000 to cover travel, lodging, and visa expenses.
    


        Around 21 Kenyans who were being prepped to join the war were rescued during a security raid in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, in September.

Business Insider Edition 

 South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has criticised US President Donald Trump for deciding to skip the upcoming G20 leaders' summit in Johannesburg, stating that boycott politics does not work and that the United States' absence is its own loss.


        South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has strongly criticised US President Donald Trump's decision to skip the G20 leaders' summit in Johannesburg, warning that “boycott politics doesn't work.”



        The announcement comes amid Trump's repeated and widely discredited claims that white South Africans, particularly Afrikaners, are being persecuted, allegations that Pretoria says have no basis in fact.
    


        Speaking outside parliament, Ramaphosa said the US's “absence is their loss” and stressed that the boycott would not prevent the summit from going ahead, according to BBC. He added that Washington was “giving up the very important role that they should be playing as the biggest economy in the world.”
    


        President Trump continues to employ genocide rhetoric to advance his wider geopolitical criticisms of South Africa, framing the country's recent engagement with China and Russia as a challenge to US interests, while using claims of Afrikaner persecution to justify Washington's disengagement.
    


        He asserted that “Afrikaners are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated,” adding that “no US government official will attend as long as these human rights abuses continue.”



        He also described South Africa's hosting of the G20 summit as a “total disgrace” and questioned the country's place in the forum.
    


        Although Trump initially planned to send Vice-President JD Vance in his stead, that decision was subsequently reversed.
    


        The summit, scheduled for 22–23 November 2025, marks the first time the G20 will be held on African soil. Each year, a member state hosts the summit and sets the agenda for global economic discussions, with the US due to assume the presidency next.
    


        Before President Ramaphosa's response, South Africa had already condemned Trump's remarks and his decision to withdraw US participation as “regrettable,” emphasising that claims of white genocide are “widely discredited and unsupported by reliable evidence.” The government also reaffirmed that no white farmers have had their land confiscated without compensation.
    


The boycott follows a reported confrontation between Ramaphosa and Trump in the Oval Office over these allegations, which have been consistently debunked by international observers, including some Afrikaner groups.
    


        The situation is further complicated by South Africa's growing role in BRICS, a platform whose broader objectives are seen by some as challenging the dominance of the US dollar.
    


        Trump's tough rhetoric on African governance has intensified in recent months. Last week, he threatened Nigeria with possible military action over alleged Christian persecution in the country's northern regions, a move that strained Abuja's diplomatic efforts in Washington.
    


        Meanwhile, senior US political figures have urged Trump to prioritise domestic economic issues over foreign policy disputes, warning that such rhetoric could undermine US engagement with Africa on trade, investment, and security matters.

New York Attorney General Letitia James joined a Condé Nast union rally on Wednesday, calling on the company to reinstate four staffers who were fired after a confrontation with the company's HR head.

"Let's be clear: New York is a union town," James said. "Let's also be clear: the right to organize is enshrined in our laws. And as the attorney general of the state of New York, it's my entire responsibility to ensure that the laws are enforced."

"Condé Nast, I'll see you in court," she said.

The gathering took place outside Condé Nast's headquarters in New York's 1 World Trade Center to protest the firing of four unionized staffers and the suspension of five other union members.

These staffers had confronted Condé Nast's HR chief, Stan Duncan, about the company's decision earlier this month to fold Teen Vogue into the Vogue flagship site and lay off several of its staffers. The episode was partially captured in a widely viewed video published by TheWrap.

Condé Nast said in an internal memo that it "took disciplinary action against employees who were engaged in harassing and intimidating conduct that interfered with our business operations." The company also said the actions violated its collective bargaining agreement with the union and that it had filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board.

"Most people recognize that the misconduct exhibited by union members last week wouldn't be acceptable in any workplace," a company spokesperson said. "Their employment was terminated with cause, as they were in violation of our company policies."

The Wednesday rally was organized by The NewsGuild of New York and Condé Nast Union, its unit representing around 500 people across about a dozen Condé Nast titles, including Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, and GQ, as well as Teen Vogue. The union also filed grievances with the company and charges with the National Labor Relations Board, demanding that the firings and disciplines be rescinded. (The NewsGuild also represents Business Insider employees.)

Some in attendance held signs that read "I Stand with the Fired Four" and said they were encouraged by the union solidarity.

Teen Vogue, which launched in 2003 as a print glossy and was scaled back to online only in 2017, has a history of political activism, and the union called the layoffs an attempt by the company to silence its cultural and political journalism.

Condé Nast said the Teen Vogue consolidation was part of a broader push to "expand the Vogue ecosystem" and said Teen Vogue would remain a distinct editorial property with its own identity and mission.

Condé Nast employees joined a companywide union in 2022 after some of its individual magazines unionized. In 2024, around 500 staged a one-day walkout to protest planned layoffs.

In a bid to become more familiar with how cryptocurrencies operate, The Czech National Bank announced on Thursday that it would invest $1 million in Bitcoin and a handful of dollar-backed stablecoins. The bank says the purchase, approved on October 30, 2025, will let it gain practical experience holding digital assets but that the cryptocurrency will be held apart from the country's international reserves. 

“The aim was to test decentralised Bitcoin from the central bank's perspective and to evaluate its potential role in diversifying our reserves,” said CNB Governor Aleš Michl in a statement.





The country's investment in Bitcoin comes during an up and down year for the digital currency. It reached an all-time high price of about $125,000 last month, but has dipped about 19% to its current price of about $101,000. 





The Czech Republic's central bank is the first to purchase Bitcoin directly, though a handful of other countries have already made owning crypto part of their economic policy.





Those include El Salvador, which in 2021 became the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender, and the small Himalayan nation of Bhutan, which is one of the world's largest sovereign holders of the digital currency. Kazakhstan, already a major player in Bitcoin mining, in September announced its plan to create a Bitcoin sovereign wealth found. 




In the United States, meanwhile, President Trump announced the creation of a strategic Bitcoin this year. The reserve will not see the U.S. purchasing Bitcoin directly, but instead it will supply the reserve by means of the proceeds of forfeitures and criminal seizures. 





The CNB said the amount it invested in digital assets will not increase and that they will present an assessment of the project to the public in about two or three years. 





The Czech Republic is a part of the European Union, but it uses its own currency called the koruna. The CNB said that it intends to keep its currency strong and has had internal discussions about the future of payments.





“Let's be more forward-thinking, more visionary,” Michl said in the statement. “It is realistic to expect that, in the future, it will be easy to use the koruna to buy tokenised Czech bonds and more besides – with one tap an espresso; with another an investment such as a bond or another asset that used to be the preserve of larger investors.”

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin says decentralized finance (DeFi) has reached a turning point, one where on-chain savings are not only viable but beginning to rival traditional banks.

Speaking in a pre-recorded address at a Dromos Labs event on Wednesday, Buterin said he's “encouraged” by how far DeFi on Ethereum has come in terms of security, maturity, and usability.

“We'll be seeing, I think, a growth in more and more cases of people, institutions, and all kinds of users around the world actually using this as their primary bank account,” he said. “DeFi as a form of savings is finally viable.”

Buterin's remarks reflect a broader evolution in the sector that he believes is shifting from speculation toward stability.

Ethereum-based DeFi was previously associated with high-risk lending, complex yield strategies, and frequent protocol exploits. But Buterin said the difference between 2025 and the early DeFi era of 2020 or 2019 is “night and day.”

Despite acknowledging recent breaches, including the multi-million-dollar Balancer hack earlier this month, he said smart contract security has improved substantially.

Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic noted that while crypto losses in 2025 technically “dwarf” last year's, much of that figure stems from the historic Bybit hack in February, rather than DeFi's structural weaknesses.

Buterin emphasized the “walkaway test,” a simple measure of DeFi safety ensuring users can always recover their funds independently.

He urged developers to keep Ethereum's founding principles at the core: open-source code, interoperability, and censorship resistance.

He also called on builders to design applications with both the Ethereum mainnet and Layer 2 networks in mind. With new tools such as Lighter, which has reached over 10,000 transactions per second, Buterin said scalability is improving on both L1 and L2.

“With the right kind of engineering, that level of scaling is open to anyone to build today,” he added.

Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem now processes over $1.9 trillion in transactions per quarter, with a $77 billion market and over 312 million active users as of mid-2025.

Average DeFi savings yields hover around 8.2%, compared with roughly 2.1% in traditional banking.

Although operational costs in DeFi remain lower, the sector still faces ongoing risks, including $1.1 billion in fraud and hacks reported in the first half of 2025.

By contrast, global banks manage about $370 trillion in assets and process $405 trillion per quarter, but their slow settlement times and higher fees make DeFi's permissionless structure increasingly attractive to users seeking autonomy and speed.

Buterin's optimism follows his September essay promoting “low-risk DeFi” as Ethereum's sustainable economic backbone, a form of decentralized banking that could support the network much like Google Search funds Google's ecosystem.

He argued that stablecoin lending and flatcoins pegged to inflation indices or currency baskets could stabilize Ethereum's economy while preserving its values.

Buterin wrote that blue-chip DeFi protocols like Aave, offering around 5% stablecoin yields, provide the low-risk finance Ethereum needs.

Earlier today, Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation published “The Trustless Manifesto,” warning developers against compromising decentralization for convenience.

The document criticized trends like centralized sequencers in Layer 2s and hosted RPC nodes, arguing that “decentralization is not destroyed by capture, but by convenience.”

It proposed three “laws” for trustless design: no critical secrets, no irreplaceable intermediaries, and no unverifiable results.

Meanwhile, Ethereum continues to strengthen its technical and institutional foundations. The network hosts over 75% of tokenized real-world assets and 58% of the global supply, with firms like BlackRock, Securitize, and Ondo Finance deploying tokenized Treasury products on-chain.

Its Layer 2 networks now secure more than $50 billion in value, while privacy and scaling work has accelerated through the Ethereum Foundation's new 47-member Privacy Cluster.

Sheryl Estrada is a senior writer at Fortune, where she covers the corporate finance industry, Wall Street, and corporate leadership. She also authors CFO Daily.

Good morning. Blockchain technology is gaining mainstream traction in the U.S., with clearer regulations emerging as a key driver of adoption.

To explore what that means for financial infrastructure, I sat down with Jeremy Fox-Geen, CFO of Circle Internet Group, a leading stablecoin issuer. “We are at the beginning of what can only be described as a global megatrend—the building of the internet financial system,” Fox-Geen told me.





That system, he explained, encompasses blockchains, digital assets, and the applications built upon them—technologies that promise “massive benefits to businesses and consumers all around the world,” he said. While blockchain is already transforming parts of the economy, he emphasized that we are still in the early stages of its impact.





Fox-Geen described Circle as a market-neutral infrastructure company: a platform that sits within the internet financial system's foundation—spanning blockchain, digital-asset, and application layers. “We're a platform that other companies choose to build upon,” he said.





Stablecoins, such as Circle's USD Coin (USDC), are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to and backed by the U.S. dollar or equivalent assets. In the U.S., the GENIUS Act has clarified how stablecoins are regulated, Fox-Geen noted. Regulatory certainty, he said, is “a major unlock” for large companies considering digital assets for corporate treasuries—and a driver of multi-year growth for Circle.




Key use cases for stablecoins include trading, settlement, dollarization, and cross-border payments. Circle's platform supports these use cases, aiming to reduce friction and cost in global financial transactions, Fox-Geen said.





Circle made its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5, marking the largest two-day post-IPO surge since 1980, Fortune reported. On Wednesday, the company reported its Q3 results: combined revenue and reserve income grew 66% year-over-year to $740 million, while net income rose 202% to $214 million. USDC circulation reached $73.7 billion, up 108% from a year earlier, and on-chain transaction volume jumped 580% to $9.6 trillion—evidence of its expanding real-world utility, Fox-Geen explained. JPMorgan has upgraded Circle's stock to “overweight” from “underweight” and increased its price target to $100 from $94, which helped rebound Circle shares in pre-market trading on Thursday.





Fox-Geen said that blockchain's transformation of the financial system is just beginning—comparable to the internet's evolution in the mid-1990s. “The disruption is underway, but the technologies are still maturing,” he said.





Banks, neobanks, payment firms, and capital markets participants are already integrating blockchain for trading, settlement, and supply-chain payments. “We're seeing use cases grow fastest where costs, frictions, and business needs are highest,” Fox-Geen added.





Fox-Geen has served as CFO of Circle since May 2021 and was previously CFO of iStar and Safehold. Before that, he was CFO for McKinsey & Company, North America, and held senior roles with PricewaterhouseCoopers and Citigroup.




Circle is now building the fourth generation of blockchains, he said, as well as Arc, a native Layer-1 blockchain optimized to bring economic activity to the internet.





To illustrate his thoughts on blockchain's promise, Fox-Geen posed this question:





“Why can't you send money to anyone in the world—instantly and for free—just like sending a photo or text message? When you put it like that, it's absurd that you can't.”





For CFOs and finance leaders exploring blockchain for the first time, his advice is pragmatic: fast follow.





“You don't have to be a pioneer,” he said. “Institutions will bring these benefits to you.”

"Record U.S. government shutdown is over—but Wall Street only has 10 weeks to relax before the next one could begin" is a Fortune report by Eleanor Pringle.


Pringle writes: "The U.S. government shutdown, the longest in history, has finally come to an end. An optimist might assume the funding deal will avert a similar crisis—perhaps until the next administration, or for a couple of years at least? Not so. The countdown is already on, and the clock is set to 78 days.


"Last night, President Donald Trump signed a funding bill to end the 43-day impasse on Capitol Hill. In it were funding provisions for departments including SNAP food aid, the Department of Agriculture, Congress, and veterans affairs through September next year. Unfortunately, the vast majority of federal departments only had their budgets approved until January 30." Read more here.


"AI and automation are already reshaping the future of work, but our collective choices will determine whether the disruption leads to decline or renewal. Deeper partnerships across government, academia, and industry will build a talent pipeline that is more innovative than ever before."

Bitcoin BTC$99,356.97 and the rest of the crypto market continued the trend of not just losing ground, but notably sliding the most during U.S. market hours.

Following a recent pattern, BTC had bounced to as high as $104,000 overnight but reversed course in early U.S. hours, plunging below $100,000 in the early afternoon hours on the east coast and now lower by 1.7% over the past 24 hours.

The retreat came amid a steep broad decline in risk assets as investors come to grips with the idea that the Fed — at the moment — doesn't appear intent on cutting rates in December. The Nasdaq is down 2% and S&P 500 1.3%.

Crypto-linked equities were hit hard once more, especially miners with heavy AI infrastructure and data center exposure. Bitdeer (BTDR) plunged 19% and Bitfarms (BITF) dropped 13%, while Cipher Mining (CIFR) and IREN lost over 10%. The rest of the crypto equity sector also saw steep losses: Galaxy (GLXY), Bullish (BLSH), Gemini (GEMI) and Robinhood (HOOD) were all down 7%-8%.

The pullback underscores a trend that's defined crypto markets in recent weeks: persistent weakness during U.S. hours, coinciding with cooling expectations of a December rate cut from the Federal Reserve.

"Crypto is closely linked to macro-economics now more than anytime in the past," said Paul Howard, senior director at trading firm Wincent.

With markets now pricing in roughly 50/50 odds for a 25 basis points rate cut next month, Howard expects BTC to stay muted near current levels for the remainder of the year.

"My sense is with just six weeks left, we've seen the all-time highs for 2025," he said. "From here, we likely get a steady ascension over the course of the coming year — volatility acknowledged."

Investors love to decry government deficits, but often lost in that attitude is the asset-boosting liquidity sloshing around in markets thanks to those deficits. 

The government shutdown — to the extent it even temporarily narrowed or reversed those deficits — is appearing to have the exact opposite effect on markets. Market-watcher Mel Mattison noted that the federal government actually ran a $198 billion fiscal surplus in September. The October data is coming later today and likely to show an even greater surplus given much of D.C. was shut down for the entire month.

"We have had one of the driest periods for fiscal liquidity in months if not years," said Mattison on Thursday. The good news, according to Mattison? 

"The flood gates are about to open," he said. "The [Trump administration] is going to unleash a tsunami of fiscal largess in coming quarters. Mid-terms must be defended."

The next couple of weeks could remain choppy, Mattison continued, but as liquidity returns, so should upward price action.

UPDATE (Nov. 13, 17:05 UTC): Updates bitcoin price falling below $100,000.

MetaMask may have just joined the multichain train, but the new non-custodial Web3 wallet Best Wallet (BEST) has been built for that purpose from the very beginning. Since launching last year, it has positioned itself as a truly multichain-ready wallet, already connecting users across dozens of networks.

Armed with $17 million in presale funding, Best Wallet is now preparing to launch its native token, BEST, which is way ahead of MetaMask's own. This means one wallet has already surpassed MetaMask on two major fronts: multichain capability and ecosystem tokenization.

And because of the native token, Best Wallet also unlocks several user advantages that MetaMask can't yet match, such as competitive swap rates, higher staking yields, and the upcoming rollout of gas token-free transactions.

However, with only 15 days remaining in the presale, the window to buy BEST before it is listed on exchanges is closing fast. For a wallet that's already overtaken MetaMask in innovation and functionality, the launch of its native token could easily draw in crowds of traders across major exchanges.

After years of being known as an Ethereum-only wallet, MetaMask has finally taken a major step toward true interoperability. The wallet recently rolled out multichain accounts, allowing users to manage both EVM and non-EVM addresses, including Ethereum, Solana, and soon Bitcoin.

This marks a major shift for MetaMask, which previously required users to create separate wallets for each network. With this update, users can now switch seamlessly between blockchains, making cross-network activity simpler and more efficient.

The upgrade is being celebrated as a long-awaited evolution for MetaMask and reflects the broader trend in crypto toward cross-chain accessibility and user convenience.

But while MetaMask is only now catching up to the multichain movement, Best Wallet has been engineered for it since launch. Users with Bitcoin, Solana, or other non-EVM addresses can already manage their assets directly within the Best Wallet app.

What truly separates Best Wallet, however, is that it pairs this multichain accessibility with industry-leading security architecture. As a non-custodial wallet, it employs Fireblocks' MPC-CMP technology, which divides private keys into encrypted shards stored across independent entities, eliminating any single point of failure. 

On top of that, two-factor authentication (2FA) and biometric verification further protect user accounts, while the upcoming Advanced Anti-Fraud Protection system will proactively identify and block malicious activity.

In short, Best Wallet doesn't just enable multichain access; it also makes cross-chain interoperability secure.

As mentioned earlier, another area where Best Wallet has already overtaken MetaMask is in launching its own native token.

Back in September, Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin hinted that a MetaMask token could arrive “sooner than expected,” suggesting it would play a role in decentralizing aspects of the MetaMask platform. But so far, no official release date has been announced.

In contrast, Best Wallet is already nearing the end of the BEST token presale with just 15 days remaining before early access closes, and unlike the still-theoretical MetaMask token, BEST comes with a clearly defined purpose.

BEST powers the entire Best Wallet ecosystem. It unlocks lower transaction costs, which will become even more relevant when the platform launches its upcoming derivatives trading feature, complementing its in-app decentralized exchange (DEX).

Soon, gas token–free transactions will also be introduced. This means users won't need to hold each network's native token (such as ETH or BNB) to pay for gas fees, but instead, transactions can be settled directly using BEST, making cross-chain activity more straightforward and cost-efficient.

Additionally, BEST will play a central role in the platform's upcoming rewards hub, as well as in reducing transaction costs for Best Card – a soon-to-launch debit card that connects the wallet to real-world payments, allowing users to make purchases directly using their crypto holdings.

And finally, one key feature that explains why Best Wallet has quickly become one of the most used applications in Web3, boasting over 500,000 registered users, with 50% active monthly, is its Upcoming Tokens feature.

This built-in tool helps users discover the most promising new crypto projects before their tokens launch on exchanges, giving early investors a rare opportunity to secure tokens at presale prices – just as they can now with BEST itself.

Market maker Citadel Securities is increasing its presence in the crypto industry, investing in crypto startups and building a market making team. Sister firm, hedge fund Citadel, is much quieter on its own crypto strategy but, based on recent hires, it has an appreciation for talent in the space.

Kevin Nassery joined Citadel to lead its security risk and compliance for the Americas. He spent the last two years as VP of security for blockchain infrastructure firm RISC Zero. The firm provides 'zero-knowledge' infrastructure that can turn C++ or Rust code into cryptographic records (proofs) usable across different blockchains. 

Before that, Nassery was also chief information security officer at Gemini, a crypto exchange led by the Winklevoss twins. He succeeded David Damato in the role, who now also works at Citadel as its chief information security officer. Hiring tech executives then hiring their replacements seems to be a bit of a trend at Citadel.

If Citadel is warming to crypto at a similar rate to Citadel Securities, it has come a long way from when Ken Griffin called the excitement around crypto 'a Jihadist call against the dollar' back in 2021. Last month, Citadel Securities reportedly co-led a fundraise for infrastructure firm Ripple at a $40bn, while both Citadel and Griffin himself were revealed to own shares in Solana treasury firm Defi Dev Corp.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and prominent developers have published the “Trustless Manifesto“, a sweeping declaration demanding that blockchain systems prioritize mathematical verification over intermediary trust.

The document arrives amid mounting criticism that Ethereum's ecosystem has drifted toward centralization, despite public commitments to decentralization.

Just last month, former core developers revealed that a small group of insiders effectively controls project success and protocol direction.

The manifesto asserts that trustlessness, where system correctness relies solely on mathematics and consensus rather than the goodwill of intermediaries.

“Ethereum was not created to make finance efficient or apps convenient,” the authors write. “It was created to set people free.“

The document establishes strict criteria for trustless design:

Self-sovereignty, where users authorize their own actions

Verifiability through public data

Censorship resistance within reasonable timeframes

Operator replaceability without approval

Practical accessibility beyond technical experts

Transparent incentive structures.

Removing any requirement causes systems to “drift from protocol to platform—from neutral ground to private property,” according to the text.

The manifesto applies three laws prohibiting critical secrets held by single actors, indispensable intermediaries that users cannot realistically replace, and unverifiable outcomes lacking public reproducibility.

“These laws are harsh,” the authors acknowledge. “They limit what we can build easily—but they are the only guarantee that what we build belongs to everyone.“

Beyond theoretical frameworks, the document warns that centralization already permeates Ethereum's infrastructure through hosted RPCs serving as defaults, AWS-GCP-Cloudflare dependency creating single points of failure, and centralized sequencing in many rollups.

“Decentralization erodes not through capture, but through convenience,” the manifesto states, comparing the trajectory to email's evolution, where spam filters and blocklists made self-hosted servers practically impossible despite remaining theoretically open.

The manifesto's release follows bombshell revelations from former Geth lead developer Péter Szilágyi, who published a May 2024 letter exposing how five to ten people around Buterin maintain “complete indirect control” over Ethereum's direction through attention allocation, donations, investments, and researcher assignments.

Projects no longer conduct public offerings but instead secure backing from the same insiders, creating what Szilágyi called a “ruling elite” where success requires convincing “the correct 5-10 people around Vitalik—or even him—to commit.“

Separately, Szilágyi revealed he earned just $625,000 over six years managing Ethereum's primary execution client with zero benefits or raises, describing Foundation employment as “a bad financial decision” that created “a perfect breeding ground for perverse incentives, conflicts of interests, and eventual protocol capture.“

He warned the Foundation “set the protocol up for capture” by underpaying contributors who cared about principles, forcing them to seek compensation elsewhere, while those remaining felt like “useful fools” watching big players reshape the protocol.

Sentiments at the time summarize the dynamic as “we're happy you built an empire for us, now move aside and let the people who can make us money take the lead,” according to Szilágyi.

Separate warnings also emerged during the same time when Ethereum core developer “Fede's intern” cautioned that venture capital firm Paradigm's influence “within Ethereum could become a relevant tail risk for the ecosystem.”

Paradigm manages $12.7 billion and has positioned itself across multiple fronts, including hiring top researchers, funding critical open-source libraries like Reth, and launching Tempo.

Tempo is a competing layer-1 blockchain that has raised $500 million at a $5 billion valuation from traditional finance firms, including Greenoaks, Thrive, Stripe, and Sequoia.

The concerns intensified following the departure of longtime Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist to Tempo, where Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang serves as CEO while retaining his role at the venture firm.

“When corporations gain too much legibility and influence over open source projects, priorities start to drift away from the community's long term vision and toward corporate incentives,” the developer warned, noting Paradigm's failed FTX investment led them to “remove most references to crypto and pivot heavily toward AI.”

Crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments has announced plans to go public.

In a Thursday statement, the firm said it had filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed initial public offering of its stock on the New York Stock Exchange.

The firm added it would trade under the ticker "GRAY."

"The proposed offering is subject to market conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed or as to the actual size or other terms of the offering," a statement from Grayscale read. 

Grayscale Investments first signaled plans in July that it was hoping to go public by filing a draft registration statement with the SEC. The firm operates popular spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the United States, along with trusts for a variety of other assets.

The firm manages around $35 billion in assets, making it one of the biggest crypto asset managers, and is a unit of Digital Currency Group. 

Grayscale made headlines in 2023 when a federal judge decided to overturn the SEC's decision to block the firm from converting its Bitcoin trust into a spot ETF—a win for the digital asset space that subsequently led to the 2024 approval of the hugely popular crypto funds. 

A number of top crypto companies have gone public this year—or announced plans to do so. Crypto exchange Gemini, stablecoin issuer Circle, and institutional investor platform Bullish all debuted on U.S. stock exchanges in 2025.

China has intensified its campaign against stablecoins, warning that they pose a threat to global financial stability. The People's Bank of China has called them a source of financial risk, citing money laundering and weak oversight. The crackdown has left many wondering what comes next for borderless payments. 

While regulators are moving in one direction, investors are looking elsewhere, and a new name in the cross-border payment industry, Digitap ($TAP), is quietly becoming one of the most talked-about crypto presales this November.



Stablecoins should make global payments easier. They promise instant transfers and low fees, connecting the traditional banking world with the crypto world. Today, their combined market value is approximately $300 billion, and they process trillions of dollars in transactions annually. But China's central bank now says that success comes at a cost.

Governor Pan Gongsheng stated that stablecoins amplify weaknesses in the global system and fail to meet basic standards such as anti-money laundering and customer verification. He also warned that they undermine smaller economies by relying heavily on the U.S. dollar.

China's move adds to growing international pressure. From Washington to Brussels, regulators are demanding stricter rules. Stablecoins remain convenient, but they are also becoming a target for manipulation. Investors who once relied on them for cross-border transfers are starting to explore alternatives that can match their speed and reach without the same regulatory headaches.



That search for a next-generation solution has put Digitap in the spotlight. The project combines real-world spending, global accessibility, and privacy in one platform. At the center of it all is the Digitap Card, a Visa co-branded product that allows users to pay with cryptocurrency just as easily as with cash. It connects to Apple Pay and Google Pay, so purchases are as simple as tapping a phone.

New users can set up an account and receive a virtual card in minutes, with no mandatory KYC. Transactions stay private, and funds are held in regulated offshore accounts for extra security. 

The app brings all balances together, crypto and fiat, into one wallet, automatically converting assets at the best available rate. Transfers are nearly instant and cost less than 1%.

Digitap's approach solves what stablecoins currently struggle with: it delivers fast, compliant payments while giving users complete control, privacy, and security over their money.

Digitap's growth is already reflected in its ongoing presale. Investors have purchased more than 110 million $TAP tokens, raising $1.75 million to date. The token's current price is $0.097, with the next stage moving to $0.0313 and a launch price of $0.14.

The $TAP token is built on Ethereum with a fixed supply of two billion. It uses a deflationary system that automatically buys back and burns tokens, reducing circulation as the platform expands. Staking rewards of up to 124% APR are available to early participants, while post-launch staking will offer up to 100% APR from a pre-allocated pool.

This mix of scarcity, yield, and real utility is rare in early-stage crypto projects. For many investors watching the market for the best crypto to buy now, Digitap stands out as a presale that already delivers a working product.

China's stablecoin crackdown highlights the fragility of private digital currencies that rely on centralized issuers and shifting regulations. Digitap represents the other side of that story — a platform that turns those same goals into something sustainable. Its real-time transactions, sub-1% fees, and deflationary token model position it as a credible alternative for both crypto users and global freelancers.

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a malicious Chrome extension that poses as a legitimate Ethereum wallet but harbors functionality to exfiltrate users' seed phrases.

The name of the extension is "Safery: Ethereum Wallet," with the threat actor describing it as a "secure wallet for managing Ethereum cryptocurrency with flexible settings." It was uploaded to the Chrome Web Store on September 29, 2025, and was updated as recently as November 12. It's still available for download as of writing.

"Marketed as a simple, secure Ethereum (ETH) wallet, it contains a backdoor that exfiltrates seed phrases by encoding them into Sui addresses and broadcasting microtransactions from a threat actor-controlled Sui wallet," Socket security researcher Kirill Boychenko said.

Specifically, the malware present within the browser add-on is designed to steal wallet mnemonic phrases by encoding them as fake Sui wallet addresses and then using micro-transactions to send 0.000001 SUI to those wallets from a hard-coded threat actor-controlled wallet.

The end goal of the malware is to smuggle the seed phrase inside normal looking blockchain transactions without the need for setting up a command-and-control (C2) server to receive the information. Once the transactions are complete, the threat actor can decode the recipient addresses to reconstruct the original seed phrase and ultimately drain assets from it.

"This extension steals wallet seed phrases by encoding them as fake Sui addresses and sending micro-transactions to them from an attacker-controlled wallet, allowing the attacker to monitor the blockchain, decode the addresses back to seed phrases, and drain victims' funds," Koi Security notes in an analysis.

To counter the risk posed by the threat, users are advised to stick to trusted wallet extensions. Defenders are recommended to scan extensions for mnemonic encoders, synthetic address generators, and hard-coded seed phrases, as well as block those that write on the chain during wallet import or creation.

"This technique lets threat actors switch chains and RPC endpoints with little effort, so detections that rely on domains, URLs, or specific extension IDs will miss it," Boychenko said. "Treat unexpected blockchain RPC calls from the browser as high signal, especially when the product claims to be single chain."

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced that it conducted the first live transaction using its wholesale CBDC (wCBDC). This involved using the wCBDC for overnight interbank lending with DBS, OCBC and UOB participating in the test. The pilot transaction also marks the launch of the SGD testnet.

Plans for the wholesale CBDC were announced last year in order to support the settlement of tokenized assets. In addition to the wholesale CBDC, the SGD testnet supports atomic settlement of cash and securities and programmable transactions.

While MAS announced plans for the distributed ledger SGD testnet a year ago, it also ran  wholesale CBDC tests in 2023. At that time the wCBDC was used as part of tokenized deposit trials. MAS was amongst the first central banks to conduct extensive CBDC research, both retail and wholesale as part of Project Ubin, which commenced nine years ago.

Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are falling, but altcoin ETFs are rising, with investors and even small traders looking for undervalued altcoins with growth potential. For example, Uniswap became a trending topic this week, on news that it will update its economic model, and the price surged 50%. But the top altcoin pick for 2026 is DeepSnitch AI.

This artificial intelligence project is still in presale, but its network is officially live! Users can already try the product, and this has boosted the numbers, with the presale raised over $500,000 and the price surging 50%, triggering FOMO. With a real AI product and a presale on fire, DeepSnitch AI is a promising low-cap crypto project with 100x potential.

Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF trading in the US registered its second consecutive week of losses with $1.17 billion in outflows. According to CoinShares, this would be one of the worst weeks of the year, but that's not necessarily bad news.

On the other hand, altcoin funds registered positive numbers, with Solana receiving $118 million last week and already totaling $2.1 billion in nine weeks. Other altcoins like XRP ($28.2 million) and HBAR ($26.8 million) also received investments, increasing their balance.

This is a sign that investors are not necessarily worried about the current market situation or about the price of Bitcoin falling to retest $105,000. In fact, it shows that with BTC trading sideways, they are looking for assets that offer better upside opportunities, like promising low-cap crypto projects and presales.

DeepSnitch AI is still in presale, but its team has been demonstrating its commitment to the project every week. The latest major update was the launch of the network, allowing early and new investors to test the technology.

This is a bullish step, proving that this project is not just a promise, but a real technology that will help traders in their daily lives. DeepSnitch AI will bring five AI agents that will monitor several on-chain activities, such as market news, trending coins, whale moves, insider wallets, liquid pools, rug pulls, and more.

All this on-chain information will be processed and sent in real time, directly to users' Telegram channels. This will allow traders to receive high-level information in real time, enabling them to make better decisions about buying, selling, or investing. Such information can not only help make money but can also save portfolios.

That's why DeepSnitch AI is being considered one of the most promising low-cap crypto projects. Your presale is still in stage 2, which means you can still get a cheap price for one of the top altcoin picks for 2026. Currently, the price is $0.02244, and the total funding is over $520,000. All of this makes DSNT the best altcoin to invest in right now. 

Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap Foundation announced that they have joined forces to create a new governance proposal called “UNIfication.” The news was released on November 10th by Hayden Adams (Uniswap CEO).

The major change involves the DEX's economic model, as part of the fees from swaps and operations on Unichain (Uniswap's L2) will now be used to fuel a token burning mechanism. Considering the volume and history to date, this could burn millions of tokens every month.

The proposal also mentions the merger of the Uniswap Labs and Uniswap Foundation teams, making them a single team under a unified strategy, with a total focus on the protocol's growth. It also creates an annual fund of 20 million UNI tokens to be used for expansion and new developments.

The market reacted very well to the news, with UNI rising over 50% in the week, reaching a price of $8.60 on November 11th. Considering this is just the news and all this implementation is still pending, millions of tokens are expected to be burned in the next year, making Uniswap a top altcoin pick for 2026.

Solana has been the best-performing altcoin in the ETF market for the past nine weeks. While even the Bitcoin ETF has seen strong inflows, Solana has had nine positive weeks, with inflows totaling $2.1 billion, attracting investors who are swapping BTC for SOL in search of diversification and better upside.

On November 11th, banking giant SoFi became the first bank in the US to allow customers to buy SOL directly from their banking account. This is extremely bullish, considering that SoFi Bank has over 12 million customers, and all these users will be able to buy and hold SOL within the banking app.

While President Trump announced that he will pay $2,000 in global tariff dividends to every American citizen, it's possible to imagine that these 12 million SoFi customers will receive this money and could use part of it to invest in Solana. In this scenario, it's easy to imagine SOL being a top altcoin pick for 2026.

SOL has been breaking records with its ETF. Uniswap has proposed a positive shift in its tokenomics, which could burn millions of UNI tokens next year. These two altcoins look very promising for 2026. However, if you are looking for the biggest undervalued altcoin with growth potential, you should look at DeepSnitch AI.

This project is still in presale, but has much more upside. Now that the network is live, early investors are proving the real potential of its technology, while seeing their investments rise by 50%. The price is rising quickly and has already jumped to $0.02244, but you can still get a cheap price considering it's an AI project designed to rise 100x in the long run.

1. Why is DeepSnitch AI considered the best altcoin to invest in now? 

DeepSnitch AI combines artificial intelligence with on-chain monitoring to help traders make smarter decisions. Its network is already live, the presale has raised over $500,000, and its price has surged 50%, proving it's a promising low-cap crypto project with 100x potential. 

2. What is the top altcoin pick for 2026? 

Investors point to DeepSnitch AI, Uniswap, and Solana as the top altcoin picks for 2026. These projects combine innovation, strong fundamentals, and community support for long-term growth potential. But DeepSnitch AI has more upside.

3. Why did Uniswap's price pump 50% recently? 

Uniswap's price soared after announcing its “UNIfication” proposal, merging its teams and introducing a token-burning mechanism. This move could burn millions of UNI tokens each month, making investors optimistic about its long-term value and performance.

The crypto market continued to establish fresh levels of support on Thursday, with bitcoin BTC$99,356.97 trading around $103,000 while ether ETH$3,234.92 rose less than 1% to $3,500.

The average crypto relative strength index (RSI) remains in neutral territory while the Fear and Greed index is printing 25/100, indicating negative sentiment across the market.

There was slightly more action in the altcoin market. AERO slid 18% in the past 24 hours following an announcement of a merger with Velodrome, while STRK and FET also made double-digit moves to the downside.

XRP led gains among the biggest cryptocurrencies, rising by 3.5% following a flurry of activity on the options market.

The market is in need of a catalyst before confirming a potential downtrend from October's record high, or a potential bottoming around $98,000. The dollar remains relatively strong at around 99.8; a break above 100 would put pressure on risk assets like the crypto sector.

Oops, something went wrong

Two altcoins are on a tear, with one outperforming the other significantly, following a Binance listing announcement that sparked a buying frenzy.

Listing announcements on popular exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase tend to inspire strong moves from involved altcoins.

Binance is preparing to list two new tokens, Lorenzo Protocol (BANK) and Meteora (MET), with the market already taking notice of the announcement.

Ahead of the official listing at 14:00 UTC (barely 4 hours from now), BANK has surged over 60%, while MET is up nearly 10%.

The sudden moves reflect strong speculative interest even before trading opens on the world's largest exchange. It is a typical reaction to such announcements, as traders anticipate increased liquidity.

Recently, the Clearpool (CPOOL) price surged to surpass its two-month high following the announcement of an Upbit listing.

Meanwhile, it is worth noting that BANK's move outperforming MET likely links to a recent development for the Meteora token. The Coinbase exchange listed MET and aPriori (APR), enabling spot trading for both assets as of October 23.

While the move fueled a 93% surge in APR, MET was quick to correct, falling by 15%, likely due to existing criticism and FUD stemming from its airdrop allocation.

BeInCrypto reported that wallets associated with TRUMP meme-coin insiders collectively received about $4.2 million in MET tokens during the airdrop, which were later transferred to OKX.

Moreover, Meteora founder Benjamin Chow is named in a class-action lawsuit alleging misconduct linked to earlier meme-coin projects such as LIBRA and MELANIA.

Meanwhile, for BANK, the price surge likely reflects early accumulation from traders anticipating a liquidity-driven breakout once Binance spot trading opens. Notably, 63 million BANK tokens will be allocated for future marketing campaigns, which could potentially boost visibility and short-term momentum.

The above FUD notwithstanding, Binance's listing announcement came with key insights for users.

Binance confirmed that spot trading for BANK/USDT, BANK/USDC, BANK/TRY, MET/USDT, MET/USDC, and MET/TRY pairs will open at 14:00 (UTC).

Users can already deposit their tokens, while withdrawals will open on November 14 at 14:00 UTC.

Both assets will carry the Seed Tag, a label used for newly introduced and therefore highly volatile projects.

Binance reminded users that they must complete the Seed Tag quiz every 90 days to access trading. This will ensure that traders understand the potential risks associated with new listings.

Both BANK and METR were previously featured on the Binance Alpha Market, a pre-listing token selection pool. Once spot trading begins, the tokens will be delisted from Alpha, and users' balances will be automatically transferred to Spot Accounts within 24 hours.

Spot Algo Orders will be enabled immediately upon listing, with Trading Bots and Spot Copy Trading set to activate within 24 hours.

Binance also clarified that once listed on Spot, trading volumes for BANK and METR on Alpha will no longer count toward Alpha Points.

Binance cautioned that both BANK and METR are relatively new and high-risk tokens, likely to experience substantial price volatility. Therefore, traders should DYOR (do your own research) before trading and apply strong risk management.

Crock NFTs were introduced with an early-bird discount and an account-based minting limit, designed to encourage broader participation among users. The mint price began at 100 USDT per NFT and increased incrementally each day until reaching the current price of 500 USDT. Initially, each account could mint up to five NFTs; this limit has now been lifted following the price reaching its cap. Holders who acquired five NFTs at the initial discounted rate received approximately $85 worth of Solana (SOL) from the first airdrop, offsetting a portion of their initial cost.

Crock Dentist NFTs Generate Ongoing Rewards

Crock Dentist NFTs function as access keys to recurring airdrops linked to the performance of the Crock Dentist game, developed by Whale Originals. A portion of the game's turnover—generated through a 3% house edge (with a 97% return-to-player rate)—funds a distribution pool. This pool is periodically allocated to NFT holders via airdrops in Solana (SOL), and in future distributions, $WHALE tokens. Each NFT represents an entitlement to 0.1% of the total distribution pool, based on a fully minted collection, with holders of multiple NFTs receiving proportional allocations.

The first airdrop was conducted prior to the full minting of the collection, resulting in a distribution per NFT approximately three times higher than standard. Based on current game turnover, the upcoming airdrop is projected to exceed the value of the previous one. Airdrops are automatically sent to compatible wallets at randomized intervals, with no action required from holders beyond maintaining NFT ownership.

Weekend Campaign Details

With minting activity accelerating and aftermarket data reflecting increased demand for larger allocations, the removal of per-account minting limits addresses a frequently raised community request. The current mint price remains at 500 USDT per NFT, with this rate scheduled to revert to its standard level on Tuesday, November 18, 2025.

Transparency and Real-Time Tracking

Whale.io continues to provide full visibility into game performance through live dashboards on its platform, showing game turnover, wager volume, and projected airdrop sizes. Collection's Treasury and Royalty wallets remain publicly accessible for on-chain verification of minting, trading, and airdrops activities.

Crock Dentist remains active, with NFT minting currently available exclusively through whale.io during the ongoing campaign. Updates on campaign developments, airdrop distribution estimates, and participation guidelines are shared regularly via the official X account, @WhaleGames_en. The $WHALE token, which will feature in upcoming airdrops, serves multiple functions within the platform, including gameplay access, battlepass rewards, and future staking features. Additional utility for $WHALE is expected following the Token Generation Event (TGE).

The crypto market is in flux as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) face increased volatility in November 2025, but one emerging presale ICO project, Blazpay, continues to rise. The project has surpassed $1.3 million in its ongoing Phase 3 presale, positioning itself as one of the most promising AI crypto coins to buy before 2026.

Blazpay's AI-integrated ecosystem combines multichain interoperability, unified financial services, and smart automation, offering more than just a token. It's a functional DeFi infrastructure. This has made it a standout among the top presale tokens of 2025 and a key contender for investors wondering which crypto will explode next.

Phase 3 of the Blazpay presale ICO is entering its final 24 hours, with over 173 million out of 201.89 million tokens already sold, marking around 85% completion. Each BLAZ token is currently priced at $0.0094, but this rate won't last long, as the next phase will increase the price to $0.01175 once the countdown ends.

The presale remains live on blazpay.com, supporting seamless purchases through ETH, USDT, SOL, BNB, and BTC. With just one day left before Phase 4 begins, investor demand is accelerating rapidly, pushing Blazpay to the forefront of 2025's best presale tokens and creating growing anticipation around what could be one of the year's most talked-about AI-integrated crypto launches.

Blazpay differentiates itself from traditional crypto presales by integrating AI across multiple functionalities. Its BlazAI engine powers smart trading automation, predictive analytics, and AI-based risk management tools.

This AI-driven model transforms how presale tokens deliver value creating real-world use cases across decentralized finance (DeFi), staking, NFT management, and fiat conversions. For investors exploring AI crypto coins to buy, Blazpay offers a mix of scalability and innovation that sets it apart from static token projects.

Blazpay's platform is designed around unified financial services that simplify how users interact with decentralized finance. Instead of switching between multiple platforms or wallets, users can manage all their crypto activities from trading and payments to staking and asset management within a single, interconnected ecosystem. This unified structure enhances efficiency, accessibility, and transparency, creating a seamless financial experience across different blockchains.

Adding to this, Blazpay's conversational AI support introduces an intelligent layer of interaction. Users can engage with the platform through natural, chat-based assistance that helps with navigation, transaction queries, and real-time insights. This AI-driven interface not only makes complex crypto functions easier to use but also brings personalization and automation to the forefront, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized technology.

Blazpay's referral structure further enhances user participation by offering transparent, instantly withdrawable rewards. Instead of relying on delayed token-based bonuses, users can earn directly in USDT through verified transactions.

This approach promotes community-driven growth and positions Blazpay as one of the most inclusive AI crypto coins to buy this year. The combination of accessibility, verified security, and real utility continues to attract both new and experienced investors seeking which crypto will explode next.

Bitcoin is currently trading near $105,325, with recent resistance at around $107,482. The asset's short-term outlook remains volatile, with analysts warning that if support near $100,000 fails, Bitcoin could test lower levels around $74,000.

Recent data from November 11, 2025, shows Bitcoin briefly hitting $107,500 before retracing, signaling intensified market fluctuations. Experts project a trading range between $105,616 and $131,208 for the month, with volatility expected to persist into December.



Ethereum, currently priced near $3,447, has also seen volatility throughout the month. However, anticipation around the upcoming Fusaka mainnet upgrade in December 2025 has fueled optimism. The upgrade aims to improve Layer 2 scalability and reduce transaction costs, reinforcing Ethereum's long-term strength.

Despite near-term uncertainty, forecasts indicate potential growth toward $5,200 by late 2025. Still, compared to innovative presale ICO projects like Blazpay, both Bitcoin and Ethereum show slower expansion potential due to market maturity.

Joining the Blazpay presale ICO is simple:

As Phase 3 nears its end, new participants have only a limited window before the Phase 4 price increase.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum maintain their dominance, 2025 marks a shift toward intelligent ecosystems, and Blazpay is at the forefront. Its combination of multichain flexibility, AI integration, and real-world usability makes it one of the top AI crypto coins to buy before the next major market breakout.

Investors seeking innovation-driven growth rather than speculative hype are turning toward presale ICO projects like Blazpay, which merge AI-driven tools with practical blockchain utilities. With its robust architecture and growing adoption, Blazpay could easily become a central name in discussions around which crypto will explode in 2025.

Blazpay's presale momentum reflects more than just investor interest; it signals a shift in what defines success in modern crypto projects. By focusing on AI integration, multichain operations, and community inclusivity, Blazpay stands apart from traditional token offerings.

As Bitcoin and Ethereum experience volatility, Blazpay continues to demonstrate consistency, innovation, and transparent progress. With Phase 4 approaching and over $1.3 million raised, this presale ICO could shape the next era of decentralized finance and emerge as one of 2025's defining AI crypto coins to buy.

ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 769

WASHINGTON — US President Donald Trump said his $300 million White House ballroom will be paid for “100% by me and some friends of mine.”

The White House released a list of 37 donors, including crypto billionaires, charitable organizations, sports team owners, powerful financiers, tech and tobacco giants, media companies, longtime supporters of Republican causes, and several of the president's neighbors in Palm Beach, Florida.

Among them were two prominent Israeli-linked donors — close Trump ally and GOP megadonor Miriam Adelson and Israeli-American businessman and financier Isaac Perlmutter.

Adelson and her Adelson Family Foundation, which focuses on strengthening Israel and the Jewish people, are long-time allies of Trump.

While speaking in the Knesset during a visit to Israel last month, Trump gave Adelson — who was in attendance — a shoutout, noting her role in pushing for him to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital in 2017. He added that she and her late husband Sheldon made more trips to the White House than anyone else.

“Look at her sitting there so innocently. She's got $60 billion in the bank,” Trump joked about the majority owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

Perlmutter's contribution came through his Laura & Isaac Perlmutter Foundation. The nonprofit based in Lake Worth Beach, near Palm Beach, focuses on promoting health care, social justice, the arts and community initiatives.

Perlmutter, former chair of Marvel Entertainment, and his wife Laura have donated to Trump's presidential campaigns and affiliated PACs in the past.

Other notable contributors include tech giants Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft — each of which also donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration. Their executives have met repeatedly with Trump in recent months as the administration emphasizes domestic manufacturing and AI development.

Palantir Technologies, co-founded by Peter Thiel, was also said to be contributing, having secured lucrative federal contracts under the Trump administration.

Additionally, major crypto firms, including Coinbase, Ripple and Tether, were featured among the donors, underscoring the industry's close alignment with Trump as his administration rolls back digital asset regulations and welcomes key crypto figures into advisory roles.

The list also includes large corporations from other sectors — such as Lockheed Martin and Booz Allen Hamilton, two major defense contractors; Caterpillar and NextEra Energy, industrial and energy giants; and Union Pacific, the freight rail company whose proposed $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, which would be the largest-ever rail merger, Trump has endorsed.

Individual donors include Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, oil magnate Harold Hamm, and Palm Beach entrepreneurs Edward and Shari Glazer, co-owners of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The list released by the White House is incomplete. Among others, it doesn't include Carrier Group, which offered to donate an HVAC system for the ballroom, and artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia, whose CEO, Jensen Huang, publicly discussed its donation.

The White House hasn't said how much each donor is giving, and almost none was willing to divulge that. Very few commented on their contributions when contacted by The Associated Press.

A senior White House official said the list has grown since it was first released in October, but some companies don't want to be publicly named until required to do so by financial disclosure regulations. No foreign individuals or entities were among the donors, according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.

Decentralized derivatives platform Hyperliquid suffered a $4.9 million loss Wednesday after a carefully orchestrated manipulation of the POPCAT token, according to data shared by blockchain sleuth Lookonchain.

The attacker withdrew $3 million in USDC from centralized exchange OKX, splitting it across 19 wallets to create a massive leveraged long position valued between $20 million and $30 million in POPCAT. 

The attacker then placed $20 million buy order near $0.21, pulling in liquidity and pushing prices higher. Once the position was sufficiently inflated, the attacker abruptly pulled the buy orders, causing a crash in POPCAT prices, which led to cascading liquidations of leveraged positions, including the attacker's own $3 million collateral, which was gone in seconds.

Hyperliquid's community-owned liquidity vault (HLP), which acts as a safety net for liquidations, had to absorb the remaining losses after collateral was exhausted, leading to a bad debt of $4.9 million, deepening the impact on the leading perpetual focused decentralized exchange. 

CoinDesk reached out to Hyperliquid for comment via X. 

One market participant described the episode as "peak degen warfare."

"Someone torched 3M just to nuke liquidity and drag HLP into a 5M loss. Classic manufactured demand illusion followed by a flush. Nothing magical here. Just an attacker exploiting thin depth and automated LP absorption," the participant said on X.

LINCOLN, Neb. (WOWT) - Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen signed a charter Wednesday allowing a Norfolk-based company to become a digital asset bank, “the first of its kind in the United States.”

The charter subjects Telcoin to state regulation and backs its cryptocurrency “predominantly” with federal bonds or FDIC-insured Nebraska banks. The move turns Telcoin turning them into “stablecoins,” known as eUSD as they're tied to the U.S. dollar, in an effort to increase public confidence in — and use of — digital wallets by providing an alternative to other popular yet more volatile forms of digital currency. 

“For Nebraskans, stablecoins — a version of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a steady value — may soon be another payment option alongside checks, debit cards, and digital wallets," Wednesday's release from the governor states. 

“Our message to the industry is simple: Nebraska is open for your business.”

Kelly Lammers, director of the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance, noted that the “special-purpose bank” had come together under state law. In the application advanced by Lammers in February, Telcoin said it had begun the filing process on October 2023 — two years after the Nebraska Financial Innovation Act, put forward by then-State Sen. Mike Flood, went into effect.

“This special purpose bank is designed under Nebraska law to ensure the payment is always good,” Lammers said in Wednesday's release.

Paul Neuner, founder and CEO of Telcoin, applauded state officials, calling the charter a “milestone.”

“This charter is a milestone in the history of banking, but it also demonstrates that rural communities can play a part in emerging technologies — Norfolk, Nebraska can be at the center of the internet of money.”

“We're very thankful to Governor Pillen, Congressman Flood, Director Lammers and his team for having the vision to see that this is about more than cryptocurrency. It's about the technology of money, payments, and banking — financial technology innovation right here in Nebraska,” he said in Wednesday's release.

After a failed heist ended with a broken Stone of Destiny, 34 fragments were gifted to various individuals. Sally Foster tracked down some of the missing fragments.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When four Scottish Nationalist students swiped the Stone of Destiny from Westminster Abbey on Christmas morning in 1950, the clandestine removal didn't exactly go off without a hitch. At some point during the removal, the legendary sculpture—used in inauguration and coronation events for Scottish monarchs since medieval times, and for monarchs of England and the broader United Kingdom since King Edward I stole the stone from Scotland in 1296—fractured, splitting in two (there was no prosecution of the students, who wanted to return the stone to its original home).

A repair at the time, overseen by stonemason and politician Robert Gray, created a collection of fragments that Gray then gifted out to family, friends, and influential figures. A new study published in The Antiquaries Journal has tracked some of those fragments, telling their stories for the first time. 

Sally Foster, a University of Stirling professor and cultural heritage expert, traced the history of the stone after the theft, following how Gray numbered and authenticated the 34 fragments before the stone was left for authorities to collect in April of 1951 at Arbroath Abbey. 

Only one fragment was officially recognized before Foster started her research, but she was able to trail other pieces to politicians and others living on different continents. 

“Since my findings started to emerge, many members of the public have contacted me with their family's knowledge of credible stone fragments, often accompanied by supporting evidence,” she said in a statement, “but there are many gaps yet to fill.”

The first documented use of Stone of Destiny (also called the Stone of Scone) was the inauguration of the Scottish King Alexander III in 1249, though it is thought to have been used to crown rulers in Scotland since as far back as the 9th century. In 1296, Edward I of England took the stone from Scotland and brought it back to England, where it was given to Westminster Abbey and eventually incorporated into the famous Coronation Chair. 

With such a storied history, it should be no surprise that its Christmas Day theft in 1950 caused an uproar.

“This is not just any stone,” Foster said. “When Scottish Nationalists manhandled it out of the Coronation Chair and secreted it away from London's Westminster Abbey on Christmas morning 1950, this caused the English-Scottish border to be closed for the first time in 400 years, because, since the 14th century, nearly all English, later British, monarchs sat over the stone during their coronation in an act that symbolized the subjugation of the Scots.” 

But the story of the stone, which has been long and politically charged, has a relatively happy ending. The stone was returned to Scotland in 1996, though it will make the trip to England every so often for continued use in coronations (the current King Charles, for instance, used the stone in his coronation). As of 2024, the stone has been moved to a permanent home in the Perth Museum. 

And that new home has opened up the opportunity for new scientific studies including, according to Foster, “the existence and significance of a diverse, dispersed body of small fragments of the stone [which] has been overlooked.” 

The only previously known fragment and its accompanying letter—a piece that was at one time gifted to Alex Salmond—is owned (as of 2018) by Historic Environment Scotland. 

Many of the others who originally received fragments were Scottish nationalist politicians—perhaps unsurprising, given the politically charged history of the stone. The list of original recipients, Foster said, includes Winnie Ewing (who wore a locket containing a chip when interviewed on television in 1967) and Margo MacDonald (another leading politician). 

And that list goes on. Gray also gave one of the pieces to a visiting Australian tourist, and upon her death in 1967, her family donated the fragment and letter to Queensland Museum. Foster said that Canadian journalist Dick Sanburn placed his fragment behind his desk. One fragment became part of a silver brooch, and another was stored in a Bluebell matchbox, locked in a safe at a family home in Bannockburn before being buried with its owner. 

“With the likely perception of the fragments as being stolen property,” Foster said, “few people opted to brazenly flaunt and taunt with their possession, except for some politicians. Families cared for them, emotionally and physically, and we can also trace the progression of fragments to valued heirlooms.” 

Foster sees the stone's fragments as an opportunity. “The stone and its considerable fragmentation evoke specific procedural and curatorial issues that invite wider reflection on the nature and role of fragments, and about private collections and their afterlives,” she wrote in the study. 

Along the way, Foster devised her own theory on the origin story of the mysterious “xxxv” inscription, which was added in modern times to the underside of the stone. “I believe Gray, having gathered the 34 fragments, applied the ‘xxxv' as part of his finishing touches to the stone's repair—the fragments plus the sone equals 35,” Foster said, adding he likely used Roman numerals since they are easier to etch. “He had the rare and almost unique opportunity to access the underside of the stone, he had the means, he had the sense of humor, and the number 35 would only have been meaningful and significant to him.”

The glue-induced recall only affects vehicles with the dealer-installed lightbar option.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Late last month, Tesla voluntarily recalled 6,197 Cybertrucks, claiming that the use of an incorrect surface primer increased the risk for the available off-road lightbar to fall off. As you might imagine, if a lightbar becomes unattached, it essentially becomes a projectile headed towards those in a Cybertruck's vicinity.

The Cybertruck was marketed as a fairly capable off-roader from the outset. That said, even armed with electronic locking differentials and a suite of off-road modes, it's not going to outclass anything like a Ford F-150 Raptor or Ram TRX. But Tesla did offer a dealer-installed lightbar to improve your visibility when the Sun goes down. We couldn't find the option in the configurator, but we did spot it in the online service manual. 

As you see above, the lightbar is glued to the top section of the windshield. Parsing through the service manual, Tesla suggests prepping the underside of the lightbar for adhesion using a primer. For most applications outside of the automotive industry, primer is generally used to give you a better-than-surface-level adhesion between two objects. For instance, primer is often used to join PVC joints together. The purple primer is used at the start to clean and soften the material by initiating a chemical reaction that melts the outer layer. A solvent cement is then applied to further melt the material and complete the bonding process. It's a bit like soldering metals together instead of welding them. 

But according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), it appears that Tesla may have used an incorrect primer, which could be the catalyst for these lightbar detaching results.

Tesla's plan to fix this will involve an additional redundancy that keeps the lightbar connected to the vehicle even after the glue fails. For context, as listed by NHTSA:

“Tesla Service will inspect the light bar and install an additional mechanical attachment or replace the light bar using tape to adhere the light bar to the windshield as well as an additional mechanical attachment as necessary, free of charge.” NHTSA also states that all 6,197 owner letters are expected to be mailed on December 26, 2025. However, it's unclear when owners will be able to get their vehicles into a service center for the fix they need. If the Cybertruck's previous glue recall is anything to go by, it could be a matter of months.

The break up of the supercontinent Nuna transformed the Earth's surface, creating shallow marine habitats that may have given rise to eukaryotic life.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

For the past three decades, scientists have been bad-mouthing a sizable chunk of Earth's history (roughly 1.8 billion years ago to 800 million years ago) by giving it nicknames like the “Barren Billion,” the “Boring Billion,” or the Earth's “Middle Ages.” At first glance, the monikers may be warranted—compared to more dynamic eons in Earth's history, this “boring” stretch (which includes the Statherian, Mesoproterozoic, and early Tonian periods) is characterized by relatively stable tectonics, an invariable climate, and generally uneventful progress in biological evolution.

But within the past decade, studies have been challenging this dull perception. 

“For a long time, the boring billion was commonly thought to be remarkably unremarkable,” Timothy Lyons, a geochemist at the University of California Riverside, told Science News in 2015. “But it's a critical chapter in the history of life on Earth, and there are basic questions we don't understand.”

Now, a new study, published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters, adds even more evidence to that assertion. The paper focuses on the break up of the supercontinent called Nuna (there have been many supercontinents, of which the famous Pangea is only the latest). According to the Dietmar Müller, the lead author of the study from the University of Sydney, the tectonics of the Boring Billion helped set the stage for eukaryotic life—a.k.a you, me, and every other complex organism alive on the planet today. 

To explore the interwoven dynamics of plate tectonics, the global carbon cycle, ocean chemistry, and how all of those factors relate to the rise of eukaryotic life, the team developed a model that simulated 1.8 billion years of moving plate boundaries and continental margins. They also modeled the carbon exchange between the mantle, oceans, and atmosphere.

“Our work reveals that deep Earth processes, specifically the breakup of the ancient supercontinent Nuna, set off a chain of events that reduced volcanic carbon dioxide emissions and expanded the shallow marine habitats where early eukaryotes evolved,” Müller said in a press statement. “Our approach shows how plate tectonics has helped shape the habitability of the Earth.”

During the Boring Billion, the Earth's landmasses actually broke apart and reformed twice, creating the supercontinents Nuna and Rodinia. Around 1.46 billion years ago, Nuna began fragmenting, which resulted in an explosion of shallow continental shelves. Although there wasn't a lot of oxygen to go around, these shallow, temperate seas likely provided the ideal conditions for complex life to take hold. Decreased volcanic outgassing and increased carbon storage in the ocean crust only improved these conditions. 

“We think these vast continental shelves and shallow seas were crucial ecological incubators,” Juraj Farkaš, a co-author of the study from the University of Adelaide, said in a press statement. “They provided tectonically and geochemically stable marine environments with presumably elevated levels of nutrients and oxygen, which in turn were critical for more complex lifeforms to evolve and diversify on our planet.”

Another study from the University of Arizona last year showed how complex life required significantly more energy and oxygen than single-celled protists. It could be possible that the Boring Billion was a tedious-yet-necessary geologic period for the planet to develop the right environment for complex life to flourish. 

Maybe the “Boring Billion” isn't so boring after all.

An international team of researchers has identified a previously unknown Neanderthal site on the southern edge of the Iberian Peninsula, located along Portugal's Algarve coast. The findings, published in the journal Scientific Reports by Nature Publishing Group, describe the earliest evidence of Neanderthal hominids in Portugal. This discovery marks an important step forward in understanding how early humans occupied the Atlantic coastline of the Iberian Peninsula during the Pleistocene.

The project is directed by Carlos Neto de Carvalho, a geologist and palaeontologist at IDL-University of Lisbon and scientific coordinator of the Naturtejo UNESCO Global Geopark, with contributions from Fernando Muñiz Guinea, a professor in the Department of Crystallography, Mineralogy and Agricultural Chemistry at the University of Seville. Researchers from institutions in Portugal, Spain, Gibraltar, Italy, Denmark and China also took part. Neto de Carvalho and Muñiz describe the work as an "interdisciplinary study on the ecological and behavioral analysis of the fossilized footprint record in southern Portugal."

Early Neanderthal footprints discovered on the Algarve coast

The earliest Neanderthal footprints known from Portugal were found in two Algarve locations: Praia do Monte Clérigo, where the geological layers date to about 78,000 years ago, and Praia do Telheiro, dated to roughly 82,000 years. At Monte Clérigo, researchers identified 5 trackways and 26 individual footprints created by adults and by children slightly over a year old on the slope of what was once a coastal dune. Praia do Telheiro revealed a single footprint attributed to either a teenager or an adult woman, found near fossilized bird tracks that are typical of rocky and coastal habitats.

Why footprints offer unique scientific insight

Neanderthal footprints preserve information that other archaeological remains, such as bones or tools, often cannot provide. Imprinted in sediments or sedimentary rock, they record a specific moment of activity and confirm the exact location where an individual stood or moved. Artifacts, in contrast, may be displaced or left behind long after their original use.

"Footprints record a specific moment, almost instantaneously, allowing us to reconstruct what was happening; for example, a group walk, a chase, a flight, or presence in a particular landscape. The footprints show how Neanderthals used space, how they explored coastal environments, forests, dunes or riverbanks, something that is difficult to infer solely from artifacts," explain Neto de Carvalho and Muñiz.

Reconstructing group behavior, movement and social structure

By studying the size and arrangement of the footprints, researchers can estimate how many individuals were present, the range of ages represented (children, adolescents, adults) and even potential task division within the group (e.g. a hunting party). Footprints left by infants and very young children, which are typically rare in the archaeological record, add valuable information about family groups and social organization. As the authors note, "footprints offer a unique and dynamic window into everyday behavior: a snapshot of life tens of thousands of years ago."

The trackways also show how Neanderthals moved through different types of terrain, revealing decisions about route selection, proximity to their base camp and possible hunting strategies. In one case, human footprints appear alongside deer tracks created at the same time, supporting the idea of pursuit or ambush activity within the dune environment.

Insights into Neanderthal diet along the Iberian coast

In addition to the footprint analysis, the researchers used ecological network analysis based on mathematical network theory to compare data from this site with other coastal archaeological locations in the Iberian Peninsula. These comparisons show that the Neanderthal diet in these regions relied heavily on deer, horses and hares, along with marine and coastal foods, pointing to a wide-ranging and adaptable approach to gathering resources.

These results reveal that Neanderthals living along the Atlantic coast were more flexible and environmentally skilled than previously understood. The study offers a detailed look at their mobility, behavior and social interactions, highlighting a level of ecological and cognitive adaptability that adds new depth to the story of Neanderthal life.

Rapidly proliferating cells require large amounts of nucleotides, making nucleotide metabolism a widely exploited therapeutic target against cancer, autoinflammatory disorders and viral infections. However, regulation of nucleotide metabolism remains incompletely understood. Here, we reveal regulators of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Using uridine-sensitized CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we show that coenzyme Q (CoQ) is dispensable for pyrimidine synthesis, in the presence of the demethoxy-CoQ intermediate as alternative electron acceptor. We further report that the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase NUDT5 directly binds PPAT, the rate-limiting enzyme in purine synthesis, which inhibits its activity and preserves the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) pool. In the absence of NUDT5, hyperactive purine synthesis exhausts the PRPP pool at the expense of pyrimidine synthesis, which promotes resistance to purine and pyrimidine nucleobase analogues. Of note, the interaction between NUDT5 and PPAT is disrupted by PRPP, highlighting an intricate allosteric regulation. Overall, our findings reveal a fundamental mechanism of nucleotide balance and position NUDT5 as a regulator of nucleobase analogue metabolism.

Pyrimidines and purines are the building blocks of life, and their cellular availability relies on two principal pathways: salvage of nucleosides and nucleobases from dietary uptake and nucleic acid turnover, and de novo synthesis from substrates such as amino acids and sugars. The latter pathway is especially crucial in rapidly proliferating cells, which must meet increased demands for nucleotides to sustain DNA replication and cell growth1,2,3. Pyrimidine de novo synthesis involves the sequential action of three key enzymes (Fig. 1a) starting with the multifunctional protein CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II, aspartate transcarbamylase and dihydroorotase). It is followed by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), localized in the mitochondria, whose activity canonically relies on electron transfer to CoQ (ubiquinone), participating in the mitochondrial electron transport chain4,5,6. The final enzyme, uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS), acts in the cytosol to link the pyrimidine ring with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form uridine monophosphate (UMP), the precursor of all pyrimidine nucleotides. In contrast, de novo biosynthesis of purines is initiated directly on the PRPP backbone through a ten-step pathway beginning with the amidophosphoribosyltransferase PPAT (Fig. 1a). Mutations in the genes required for nucleotide biosynthesis lead to rare genetic disorders that, in the case of pyrimidine deficiency, can be treated by oral supplementation with uridine, the main substrate for pyrimidine salvage7,8,9.

Precise regulation of nucleotide biosynthesis is vital for maintaining nucleotide balance and cellular homeostasis. CAD and PPAT, as the first commitment steps of their respective pathways, are rate-limiting enzymes and are strictly regulated to control de novo nucleotide synthesis4,10,11,12,13,14. Cancer cells, characterized by rapid proliferation, rely on these pathways to maintain their enhanced metabolic needs, and both cancer and immune cells can catabolize nucleosides when glucose is scarce15,16,17,18,19,20, making nucleotide metabolism a prime target for therapeutic intervention. Nucleotide analogues mimic endogenous nucleotides, thereby disrupting DNA replication and RNA stability, and are widely used in therapies against cancer, autoimmunity and viral infections1,21. However, despite the clinical success of over 20 US Food and Drug Administration-approved analogues for treating malignancies such as leukaemia and pancreatic cancer, autoinflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, or for blocking viral replication, resistance frequently arises due to genetic instability and competition with endogenous substrates22,23,24. These limitations underscore the need to identify new regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic targets within nucleotide metabolism to overcome resistance and improve treatment outcomes.

Here, we leverage the convergence of pyrimidine de novo synthesis and salvage pathways to design a uridine-sensitized CRISPR-Cas9 screening method to identify regulators of pyrimidine de novo synthesis. We reveal that a CoQ precursor can functionally replace CoQ for pyrimidine de novo synthesis and identify a non-catalytic role for the ADP-pyrophosphatase NUDT5 in nucleotide metabolism. We demonstrate that NUDT5 maintains PRPP levels essential for pyrimidine synthesis and mediates nucleobase analogue toxicity by inhibiting PPAT through PRPP-sensitive protein–protein interaction. Our results highlight NUDT5 as a critical and physiological node in ensuring balanced nucleotide production, thereby sensitizing cells to nucleotide analogue therapies.

To discover genes involved in pyrimidine metabolism, we sought to exploit the dependency on nucleoside salvage exhibited when de novo synthesis is impaired25,26,27. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to deplete the three key enzymes required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis (CAD, DHODH and UMPS) in K562 myelogenous leukaemia cells, which resulted in a strong reduction in proliferation (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). We next supplemented uridine to the cell culture medium and found that it was sufficient to restore proliferation in cells genetically depleted for, or treated with inhibitors of, any of the three key enzymes (Fig. 1b,c). This contrasted with supplementation of cytidine or thymidine, two downstream pyrimidine nucleosides and with the intermediate orotate, which rescued only CAD and DHODH depletion, but not UMPS (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1b).

Having confirmed dependency on uridine salvage, we next conducted a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 depletion screen comparing cell proliferation in the presence or absence of supplemental uridine (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d and Supplementary Table 1). We applied two analytical methods, a z-score-based approach28 and the Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 Knockout (MAGeCK) algorithm29, both of which highlighted the three key enzymes of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis as the top differentially essential genes in the absence of uridine, while salvage enzymes (UCK1 and UCK2) were dispensable (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). We confirmed these findings by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)30,31 using both Gene Ontology (GO; Biological Processes)32,33 or a curated set of mitochondrial pathways (MitoPathways)34 gene sets (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 1f,g and Supplementary Table 1). These analyses further identified requirement for CoQ biosynthesis and its downstream electron acceptors, complexes III and IV (CIII and CIV) of the respiratory chain, an expected result as CoQ is the canonical electron acceptor for DHODH4,5,6 and is linked to the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Fig. 1a). CoQ synthesis within the mitochondria relies on eight known catalytic enzymes, as well as accessory factors that may facilitate substrate access35. Among the known enzymes catalysing steps in CoQ synthesis tested in our screen, only COQ7 did not score significantly (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 1). Of note, our screen also highlighted other factors not previously linked to pyrimidine biosynthesis, and by prioritizing genes with high scores using both analytical methods we selected for further investigation genes encoding the ADP-sugar pyrophosphatase (NUDT5), the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP1-b catalytic subunit (PPP1CB) and one of its regulatory subunits (PPP1R18), the catalytic subunit of N-terminal acetyltransferase C (NatC) complex (NAA30), an importin (IPO5) and two genes encoding poorly characterized proteins (SPICE1 and C19orf53) (Supplementary Table 1).

Using CRISPR-Cas9, we individually depleted each of these genes, all three de novo pyrimidine synthesis enzymes, and five CoQ biosynthetic enzymes involved in CoQ head group maturation, including COQ7, in K562 cells. We used targeted metabolomics to analyse the levels of carbamoyl-aspartate, dihydroorotate and orotate, the three intermediates of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis (Fig. 1a), as we reasoned that changes in their abundance would indicate the biosynthetic steps affected in these cells. In validation of this approach, we found altered levels of pyrimidine precursors in cells depleted for each of the three enzymes of de novo pyrimidine synthesis, with metabolomes characterized by (1) a profound decrease in all intermediates following CAD depletion; (2) accumulation of carbamoyl-aspartate and dihydroorotate, but decreased orotate following DHODH depletion; or (3) accumulation of all three intermediates following UMPS depletion; in all conditions with a significant decrease in pyrimidine nucleotides, yet with a milder effect after UMPS depletion, possibly illustrating lower sgRNA efficiency, compensatory pathways or traces of nucleotide precursors in the dialysed FBS (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1h). We found that the amplitude of changes in these intermediates were several orders of magnitude larger than changes observed in proliferation rates (Fig. 1b), indicating that measurement of pyrimidine intermediates by metabolomics represents a more sensitive method for assessing defects in pyrimidine synthesis. We next analysed the metabolic profiles of our genes of interest and found that most fall into one of three major categories: PPP1CB, its binding partner PPP1R18 and, to a lesser degree, IPO5 resembled depletion of CAD; COQ2, COQ3, COQ5 and COQ6, as well as NAA30 resembled depletion of DHODH; and NUDT5 resembled depletion of UMPS, illustrated by the accumulation of all three intermediates. COQ7, SPICE1 and C19orf53 showed no significant effects (Fig. 1f). Therefore, our targeted metabolomics approach validated most of the genes highlighted in our screen and assigned genes to discrete steps in de novo pyrimidine synthesis.

CoQ is the canonical electron acceptor for several enzymes on the inner mitochondrial membrane, including DHODH and the respiratory chain (Fig. 2a). Thus, depletion of CoQ biosynthetic enzymes is expected to block both pyrimidine de novo synthesis and respiration30,35,36. Our screen effectively revealed and validated central genes in the CoQ biosynthesis pathway, with the notable exception of COQ7 (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 1), which is required for conversion of the CoQ precursor demethoxy-coenzyme Q (DMQ) into demethyl-coenzyme Q (DMeQ), the final intermediate of CoQ biosynthesis37,38 (Fig. 2a). Given the role of CoQ in DHODH function, the observation that COQ7 is dispensable for pyrimidine synthesis was unexpected. To investigate this anomaly, we generated K562 single-cell knockout (KO) clones (COQ7KO) and measured the levels of human DMQ (DMQ10) using lipidomics (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2a). As expected, we found that while DMQ10 levels were very low in control cells and in cells depleted of four other COQ enzymes, it accumulated strongly in the absence of COQ7 (Fig. 2b), showing that the conversion of DMQ10 could not proceed without COQ7. Similarly, we confirmed lower CoQ10 levels across COQ KOs, including COQ7 depletion (Fig. 2b), resulting in impaired respiration and failure to thrive in galactose medium, indicating an inability to perform oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. 2b). However, while uridine supplementation could partially rescue the growth defects of COQ2- and COQ3-depleted cells, as expected from the additional roles of CoQ in cellular metabolism, COQ7 depletion had no visible effect on uridine-dependent growth and pyrimidine synthesis (Figs. 1f and 2e,f and Extended Data Fig. 2c). Thus, while mature CoQ seems strictly necessary for OXPHOS, we found through our advanced validation of the screen that pyrimidine synthesis is still possible in the absence of its electron acceptor CoQ in COQ7-depleted human cells, which accumulate high levels of the DMQ precursor.

To further investigate the dispensability of CoQ for pyrimidine synthesis, we used AlphaFold 3 to predict CoQ binding to DHODH. Similar to experimentally obtained structures of DHODH with the inhibitory quinone analogue brequinar39, our model predicted multiple interactions between CoQ and the quinone-binding pocket of DHODH, but none formed between the methoxy group in position six of CoQ, which is absent in DMQ (Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 2d). Accordingly, DMQ docking in DHODH led to a similar model, suggesting that DHODH may accommodate both CoQ and DMQ (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 2d). Following reduction by enzymes such as DHODH, CoQ is normally oxidized by CIII and electrons are transferred through CIV to the final acceptor, oxygen. Notably, we observed residual CIII-dependent (antimycin A-sensitive) respiration in COQ7-depleted cells (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2e), indicating functional reduction of oxygen despite the absence of mature CoQ. In addition, blocking CIII activity with antimycin A induced uridine auxotrophy in COQ7KO cells (Extended Data Fig. 2f), showing requirement of CIII for pyrimidine synthesis even in the absence of CoQ. Together, our results indicate that CoQ is dispensible for pyrimidine synthesis and suggest that DMQ accumulation following COQ7 depletion, while unable to support CI–II-mediated respiration, can functionally substitute CoQ to efficiently support electron transfer from DHODH to CIII, thus driving pyrimidine synthesis (Fig. 2i).

The top hit from our screen, apart from the three de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes, was NUDT5 (NUDIX5) (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1e), encoding for a member of the NUDIX (nucleoside diphosphate linked to moiety-X) hydrolase family. NUDT5 cleaves ADP-ribose to form ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) and AMP or ATP, depending on phosphate availability, and was also reported to cleave oxidized guanylate nucleotides at high pH40,41,42 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We validated that uridine supplementation promotes the growth of NUDT5-depleted cells, including at physiological levels found in human plasma-like medium (HPLM)43 (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c), and, to gain a broader understanding of the influence of NUDT5 on cell metabolism, we performed an expanded targeted metabolomics analysis on NUDT5-depleted K562 cells in which we observed significant accumulation of the intermediates of de novo pyrimidine synthesis and decrease of mature pyrimidines (Fig. 3a,b, Extended Data Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 2). In contrast, we found an accumulation of both mature purines and their intermediates, validated both in cell pellets and secreted into the medium, indicating nucleotide imbalance (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 3d–f). We confirmed depleted pyrimidines alongside elevated purines in three additional cell lines depleted of NUDT5 (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h), including the breast cancer line MCF7, in which earlier work on NUDT5 was performed41,42,44.

To extend our investigation, we generated NUDT5KO K562 single-cell clones (Extended Data Fig. 3i), in which we confirmed altered pyrimidine and purine metabolism using both targeted metabolomics and orthogonal biochemical assays (Fig. 3e). In addition, we measured ADP-ribose and R5P, two main metabolites of the NUDT5 reaction, but found no differences in their abundance, indicating that ADP-ribose catabolism from NUDT5 does not participate significantly to these pools at steady state (Fig. 3e). Having observed a similar phenotype upon either UMPS or NUDT5 depletion (Fig. 1f), we next analysed the ribose donor PRPP and found that its levels were significantly decreased in NUDT5-depleted cells (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 3h). This observation explains the decreased pyrimidine synthesis seen upon NUDT5 depletion, but was in part unexpected, as PRPP is also the precursor to purine synthesis, which we found elevated (Fig. 3a–c).

We next tested whether the catalytic activity of NUDT5 was required for its function in nucleotide metabolism and expressed a wild-type (WT) or a catalytically inactive mutant (E112Q)42,45 of NUDT5 in NUDT5KO cells (Extended Data Fig. 3j). We found that both the WT or mutant NUDT5 could rescue the levels of PRPP and pyrimidine synthesis intermediates to baseline (Fig. 3f), suggesting that NUDT5 catalytic activity is not essential for its effect on pyrimidine synthesis. Similarly, a nanomolar NUDT5 catalytic inhibitor (TH5427 (ref. 46)) had no effect on pyrimidine intermediates nor PRPP (Extended Data Fig. 3k,l). To further validate our observations, we used uniformly labelled 13C-glucose, as glucose is the main precursor to PRPP (Fig. 3g). We found that the incorporation of ribose (m + 5) was attenuated in pyrimidines and elevated in adenylate purines in NUDT5-depleted cells (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 3m). Reintroduction of NUDT5 WT and E112Q cDNAs in these cells restored nucleotide synthesis to baseline levels (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 3m). Unlabelled (m + 0) levels of nucleotides were also affected by NUDT5 depletion, as expected as pyrimidine synthesis is a linear pathway in which baseline and pulse-labelled nucleotide abundance depend both on the same biosynthesis and degradation rates (Supplementary Table 3). Together, our results indicate that whereas PRPP and mature pyrimidine pools are low in NUDT5-depleted cells, purine synthesis seems to function at a higher rate, suggesting preferential mobilization of the PRPP pool towards purines, with a detrimental effect on pyrimidine synthesis. Of note, the role of NUDT5 in maintaining nucleotide balance seems to be independent of its catalytic activity.

Having excluded an enzymatic mechanism through which NUDT5 affects pyrimidine synthesis, we investigated changes in the proteome that occur upon NUDT5 depletion. However, no substantial changes were observed in the abundance of enzymes involved in purine, pyrimidine or PRPP synthesis (Extended Data Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 4). We then immunoprecipitated Flag-tagged NUDT5 and investigated its binding partners by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 4). We found a number of NUDT5-interacting proteins, including cytoskeletal elements, and notably PPAT, the rate-limiting and first committed enzyme required for de novo purine biosynthesis12 (Fig. 3c). An interaction between NUDT5 and PPAT has previously been reported in proteome-scale protein–protein interaction studies47,48,49. Because both NUDT5 and PPAT migrate at the same sizes as the immunoglobulins used for immunoprecipitation, we confirmed the interaction using either of NUDT5–Flag WT, its catalytic inactive E112Q mutant or PPAT–Flag as bait (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 4b).

NUDT5 binding promotes formation of the large low-activity PPAT form.

Source data

PPAT and UMPS both consume and potentially compete for PRPP, a metabolite we found to be critically low in NUDT5-depleted cells (Fig. 4c). To determine whether PPAT may be at the origin of the pyrimidine deficiency seen in these cells, we sought to simultaneously deplete PPAT and NUDT5 in an epistasis genetic experiment. However, similar to uridine dependency when pyrimidine de novo synthesis is compromised (Fig. 1b), PPAT-depleted cells become dependent on purine salvage, and we therefore supplemented these with inosine (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Of note, we found that PPAT depletion was sufficient to restore carbamoyl-aspartate, dihydroorotate and orotate to WT levels in NUDT5KO cells (Fig. 4d,e). Our observations indicate a contribution for PPAT to the pyrimidine phenotype and position PPAT downstream of NUDT5.

Seminal work from the 1970s identified the presence of PPAT in two interconvertible forms, consisting of a larger and partially inactive ~300-kDa form, and a smaller active form. We thus further investigated the NUDT5–PPAT interaction using native gel electrophoresis in K562 cells, where we predominantly observed the large ~300-kDa form with low enzymatic activity50,51,52 (Fig. 4f). Notably, this large PPAT oligomer co-migrated with NUDT5, which was also present independently as a dimer42, thus allowing us to confirm the interaction between the two endogenous proteins (Fig. 4f); however, when NUDT5 was depleted, the PPAT complex dissociated (Fig. 4f), forming smaller oligomers consistent with the active form50,51,52, and suggesting the interaction is inhibitory for PPAT, as hinted to by our genetic experiment (Fig. 4e). We next aimed to model the NUDT5–PPAT complex, but no experimental structure of human PPAT currently exists, likely due to its labile iron-sulfur cluster and sensitivity to oxygen that have hindered its recombinant production53. We thus used AlphaFold 3 (ref. 54) to predict the structure of a human PPAT monomer (57 kDa) and tetramer (228 kDa), both of which exhibited strong similarities to experimentally determined bacterial PPAT homologue purF55,56 (Extended Data Fig. 5a). We then predicted the structure of an NUDT5 dimer, also highly consistent with experimentally determined structures57 (Extended Data Fig. 5b). When we added one or two NUDT5 dimers to the PPAT tetramer, we found that these can cap either side of the PPAT barrel (Fig. 4g, Extended Data Fig. 5c and Supplementary Video 1). The predicted interaction interfaces consisted of NUDT5 residues RTLHY70–74, unique to NUDT5 and located outside the conserved NUDIX motif (97–118), which interacts with two PPAT molecules, associated with residues TQLDVPH25–31 on one and PNMRL360–364 on the other (Fig. 4g), all of which are conserved across vertebrates (Extended Data Fig. 5d). To determine the validity of the AlphaFold 3 model, we next mutated NUDT5 residues 70–74 to alanines and reintroduced the corresponding cDNA into NUDT5KO cells (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Of note, we found that NUDT5-(A)70–74 was unable to rescue the formation of the NUDT5–PPAT complex, consistent with the AlphaFold 3 predictions (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 5c), nor levels of pyrimidine precursors (Fig. 4i), and showing that NUDT5 must physically interact with PPAT to support pyrimidine synthesis.

We next investigated whether the NUDT5–PPAT interaction could itself be regulated. Besides its role as a substrate, PRPP is an established allosteric activator of PPAT that influences its oligomerization, as addition of PRPP to cell lysates is sufficient to convert PPAT's large form in its active smaller form50,51,52,58. Notably, and consistent with these reports, we found that PRPP was sufficient to disrupt the interaction between NUDT5 and PPAT across immunoprecipitations in 293T, K562 or HeLa cells (Fig. 4j and Extended Data Fig. 5f). Furthermore, we observed that PRPP could induce formation of smaller PPAT oligomers in native gel electrophoresis that were similar to those seen in NUDT5KO cells (Fig. 4k). Quantifying this interaction, we found that PRPP could disrupt the PPAT oligomer in K562 cells at a half-maximal concentration (IC50) of 0.1 mM, falling within the reported range of intracellular PRPP in pathophysiological conditions59,60 (Extended Data Fig. 5g). We further confirmed the existence of the NUDT5–PPAT complex across ten cell lines and six post-mitotic mouse organs, where we found on average ~33% of NUDT5 associated to PPAT, with cell type- and organ-specific variability (Fig. 4l and Extended Data Fig. 5h,i). Notably, in all cases we found that PRPP was able to disrupt the interaction of the two proteins.

Together, our genetic and biochemical observations demonstrate that NUDT5 interacts with PPAT to promote the formation of a high-molecular weight, low-activity PPAT form that can be disrupted by the allosteric activator PRPP, and that in NUDT5-depleted cells, constitutively active PPAT in its low-molecular weight form consumes the endogenous PRPP pool to synthesize purines, at the expense of pyrimidine synthesis (Fig. 4m).

Having seen nucleotide imbalance and a strong effect on the PRPP pool in NUDT5KO cells, we next tested whether NUDT5 could affect the sensitivity of cells to nucleobase analogues, which require PRPP for their conversion into toxic nucleotide analogues23,61,62,63,64. This hypothesis is consistent with the results of two high-throughput screens that identified a role for NUDT5 in 6-thioguanine (6-TG) resistance65,66, although in both cases the mechanism of resistance remained unclear. We first determined the IC50 of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a pyrimidine nucleobase analogue primarily metabolized by TYMP, but that can also be metabolized by UMPS61,62,63,67, and observed that NUDT5KO cells were an order of magnitude more resistant to 5-FU than their corresponding WT counterparts (Fig. 4n). In contrast, sensitivity to 5-fluorouridine, the nucleosidic form of 5-FU that does not require PRPP for processing, was unchanged. We extended these observations to four other clinically used purine and pyrimidine analogues and again observed that while NUDT5KO cells remained equally sensitive to all tested nucleotide and nucleoside analogues, they were consistently more resistant to nucleobase analogues that rely on PRPP, irrespective of whether the molecules were purine- or pyrimidine-based (Fig. 4n). We observed a similar trend in cells lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)68 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Together, our findings indicate that the role of NUDT5 in nucleotide regulation has strong implications for nucleobase analogue therapy.

By combining uridine sensitization and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we discovered factors required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Our approach successfully recovered CAD, DHODH and UMPS as the most important, and also highlighted a previously unidentified role for several other genes. We extensively validated such factors using metabolomics and lipidomics, assigning genes to specific steps in pyrimidine synthesis. This included all three canonical enzymes of pyrimidine synthesis, the phosphatase-related genes PPP1CB and PPP1R18 whose depletion resembles that of CAD; genes of CoQ synthesis (COQ2-3-5-6) and N-terminal acetylation (NAA30), all of which resemble DHODH depletion; and the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase NUDT5 whose depletion resembles that of UMPS. We investigated NUDT5 in detail and, based on metabolic profiles, speculate that the other genes not previously linked to pyrimidine synthesis might act by regulating the activity, or the stability, of the enzymes involved in nucleotide metabolism and CoQ synthesis.

Our findings challenge the presumed indispensability of CoQ for pyrimidine synthesis. Given the relationship between DHODH and CoQ, recovery of catalytic factors of CoQ biosynthesis was an expected result, but, notably, we found that pyrimidine synthesis persists in COQ7-depleted cells, despite marked CoQ deficiency. Supporting this observation, the COQ7 accessory factor, COQ9 (refs. 69,70), did not score in our screen. While COQ4 was not included in the Brunello CRISPR library used in this study65, accessory factors (COQ8A, COQ8B, COQ10A and COQ10B), showed no uridine dependency phenotype, confirming limited or redundant functions. The dispensability of COQ7 was unexpected and, based on the accumulation of DMQ and its molecular resemblance to CoQ (Fig. 2), we propose that DMQ may functionally substitute as an electron acceptor for DHODH. Our model is supported by the residual CIII-dependent respiration we observed upon COQ7 depletion (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2), as reported previously71, which indicates continued electron transfer in the absence of CoQ. Recent research has highlighted rhodoquinone as an alternative electron carrier able to maintain pyrimidine synthesis in the absence of CoQ72. Therefore, DMQ may play a similar role as it is interesting to note that CoQ, DMQ and rhodoquinone differ only by a single chemical group on the same position of the polar head group. In contrast, however, while rhodoquinone can also maintain OXPHOS72, we found that COQ7 loss severely impairs respiration (Fig. 2), indicating limited ability of DMQ to function as an electron acceptor from CI–II. We propose that while DMQ can maintain pyrimidine synthesis through electron transfer to CIII and ultimately oxygen, it is insufficient to maintain electron transfers for mitochondrial CI–CII. While additional work, notably using chemically synthesized DMQ, will be required to validate electron transfer from DHODH to DMQ, our results hint at structural differences in CoQ binding sites and may pave the way for increasingly specific DHODH inhibitors.

Through genetic screening and metabolomics, we identified NUDT5 as a mediator of nucleotide balance. We validated the effect of NUDT5 depletion on uridine-dependent growth, but found that the effect size was mild compared with the metabolic phenotype, although in both cases it reached significance (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 3b). Several technical reasons may explain this observation, including cellular adaptation, differences between pooled screen assays and individual cell lines, or traces of nucleotide precursors in dialysed FBS. It is also possible that the depletion of nucleotides might need to reach a certain threshold before presenting a strong effect on growth. Furthermore, and similar to the partial rescue of COQ2- and COQ3-depleted cells with uridine (Fig. 2e), uridine supplementation can only rescue the pyrimidine synthesis aspect of the phenotype, and in the case of NUDT5, it will not affect the potentially deleterious accumulation of purines and nucleotide imbalance, nor the other aspects of NUDT5 function that are not related to pyrimidine synthesis, such as DNA repair42,73, highlighting the limitations of growth assays. The difference in amplitude with the canonical enzymes of pyrimidine synthesis is coherent with our model of NUDT5 being a regulator, rather than a catalytic step, in nucleotide metabolism.

NUDT5 belongs to the NUDIX family of proteins that comprises 22 enzymes in human which are poorly conserved but share a NUDIX domain, 13 of which we detected through proteomics of K562 cells (Supplementary Table 4). This family was initially described as sanitation proteins, able to clear oxidized or otherwise modified nucleotides74, but more detailed characterization has revealed a broader role as pyrophosphatases affecting a range of substrates41,75. We now show that NUDT5 is an inhibitory binding partner to the rate-limiting purine enzyme PPAT, binds PPAT outside its conserved NUDIX domain, acts independently of its catalytic activity and that its loss promotes purine biosynthesis, depleting the endogenous PRPP pool, and thus impairing pyrimidine de novo synthesis. Of note, while PRPP also acts as an allosteric activator for PPAT50,51,52,58, our findings expand the view of PPAT regulation by identifying NUDT5 and showing that its binding is sensitive to PRPP treatment. Further research, possibly including detailed structural analysis or in vitro binding assays using purified proteins, will be needed to clarify the interplay between NUDT5- and PRPP-mediated PPAT regulation and investigate their full impact on nucleotide synthesis and macromolecular structures such as the purinosome76. Furthermore, nutrient availability, already known to affect PRPP levels and nucleotide synthesis77,78, may represent a driving factor behind this fundamental regulatory mechanism and will merit further investigation.

Our findings also position NUDT5 in the context of nucleotide analogue toxicity, including in cancer, autoinflammatory disorder, and antiviral therapies, a notion supported by other recent reports, notably those identifying germline NUDT5 genetic variants associated with 6-TG resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia79,80,81,82. Based on our results, two models could explain the resistance of NUDT5-depleted cells to nucleobase analogues: (1) the limited PRPP pool that would hinder conversion of nucleobase analogues into toxic nucleotides, and (2) competition with endogenous purines, in the case of purine analogues only. While both models are not mutually exclusive, we favour the central role of PRPP, given our experimental and CCLE data on the resistance of NUDT5-depleted cells not only to purine, but also to pyrimidine nucleobase analogues.

Our work highlights the power of nucleoside-sensitized genetic screens to identify genes involved in nucleotide metabolism and human disease. We expect that our approach can be extended to investigate other pathways of nucleotide metabolism, for example by screening in inosine-containing conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Together, our findings are highly relevant to understanding the limitations, and improving the effectiveness, of nucleotide analogue-based therapies.

All animal experiments were approved by the Swiss Cantonal authorities (VD3788) and all relevant ethical regulations were followed. Animals were male C57BL/6J mice aged 12–13 weeks provided with standard laboratory chow (Safe 150) and water ad libitum, and with a standard 12-h light–dark cycle. Sex was not considered in the study design.

K562 (ATCC, CCL-243), 293T (ATCC, CRL-3216), MCF7 (ATCC, HTB-22), HeLa (ATCC, CCL-2) and U2OS (ATCC, HTB-96) cells were maintained in DMEM–GlutaMAX (Gibco, 31966021) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, A5256701) and 100 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin (BioConcept, 4-01F00-H). UACC-257 (a gift from D. Fisher), Jurkat (ATCC, TIB-152), THP1 (ATCC, TIB-202), U937 (ATCC, CRL-1593.2) and LCL (Coriell, GM12878) cells were maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS (Gibco A5256701) and 100 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin (BioConcept, 4-01F00-H). UACC-257 cells were reauthenticated by STR profiling at ATCC in 2020. K562, 293T, HeLa and U2OS were acquired from ATCC less than 4 years before submission of the manuscript and were not reauthenticated. Other cell lines were not reauthenticated. All cells were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were periodically tested to ensure the absence of Mycoplasma.

Gene-specific single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were selected from the two best scoring sequences from the CRISPR-Cas9 screen and cloned into lentiCRISPR v2 vector (Addgene, 52961). The negative control (sgCtrl) was generated using guides targeting OR2M4 and OR11A1 that are not expressed in K562. For gene-specific complementary DNA rescue, sgRNA-resistant gene sequences were cloned into pLV-EF1a-IRES-Puro vector (Addgene, 85132). Flag-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the same vector was used as a control (Addgene, 201636). The list of sgRNA and cDNA sequences used for cloning can be found in Supplementary Table 5. Reagent requests should be addressed to the corresponding author.

Individual cloned sgRNA plasmids were electroporated into K562 cells alongside GFP using the Cell Line Nucleofector kit V (Lonza, VCA-1003) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the T-016 program. Cells were grown for 48 h then stained with Zombie Violet (BioLegend, 423114) and fluorescence-activated single-cell sorting (FACS) was used to sort GFP+ Zombie− cells into flat-bottom 96-well plates at one cell per well. Cells were grown for 12 days and wells with single colonies were selected for based on brightfield microscopy. Single-cell clones were expanded over 5 weeks and KOs were verified by immunoblot and by sequencing genomic DNA (gDNA), extracted using the QIAamp DNA kit (QIAGEN, 51304) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Lentiviruses were produced from 293T cells after transfection with a cDNA expressing plasmid, or with two plasmids containing sgRNAs to the control or target genes, as previously described83. Supernatant was collected 72 h following transfection, filtered through 0.45 µm and stored at −72 °C. For infections, cells at 0.5 × 106 cells per ml with 10 µg ml−1 Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, TR-1003) were grown in a 1:1 ratio medium to virus supernatant for 24 h. Selection was performed with 2 µg ml−1 puromycin (InvivoGen, ant-pr-1) over 48 h. Cells were maintained in standard cell culture medium for 5 additional days before analysis or further experiments. Gene KO or rescue were confirmed by immunoblot and cDNA rescue with NUDT5 WT or E112Q mutant were further verified by sequencing gDNA extracted using the QIAamp DNA kit (QIAGEN, 51304), according to the manufacturer's protocol.

K562 cells were seeded at 0.05 × 106 cells per ml in black flat-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific, 137101) for analysis by Prestoblue, or in flat-bottom 12-well plates for analysis by cell count. To compare glucose and galactose conditions, the test medium consisted of DMEM (Gibco, 11966-025) with 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 11360070), 2 mM glutamine (BioConcept, 5-10K00-H), 0.2 mM uridine, 10% dialysed FBS (dFBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, F0392) and 100 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin (BioConcept, 4-01F00-H) supplemented with 25 mM glucose or galactose. The base test medium for other assays consisted of DMEM (Gibco, 31966021) with 10% dFBS (Sigma-Aldrich, F0392) and 100 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin (BioConcept, 4-01F00-H). This was supplemented as indicated in figure legends with metabolites, small molecule inhibitors or volumetric equivalents of water or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Drugs purchased from MedChemExpress were sparfosic acid trisodium (HY-112732B), pyrazofurin (HY-122502), 5-fluorouridine (HY-107856), clofarabine (HY-A0005), fludarabine-phosphate (HY-B0028), and gemcitabine (HY-17026), and from Sigma-Aldrich were antimycin A (A8674), 5-FU (F6627) and 6-thioguanine (A4882). Cells were grown for 5–7 days under test conditions and proliferation was determined either using the Prestoblue dye (Invitrogen, A13262) and measuring fluorescence (ex/em 560/590 nm) with the BioTek Synergy Plate Reader (Agilent Technologies) after 1.5 h incubation at 37 °C. Background values were subtracted from Prestoblue data before analysis. For cell counts, cells were counted after 5–7 days using trypan blue-based cell counting (Vi-cell Blu counter, Beckman Coulter) and only live cells were considered.

Cells were collected, washed in PBS and lysed by 10 min incubation on ice in RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and 1% NP-40) with 1:100 protease inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, 87786) and 1:500 nuclease (Thermo Scientific, 88702). Protein concentration was quantified using DC Protein Assay kit II (Bio-Rad, 5000112). Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE on Novex Tris-Glycine Mini Protein Gels (Invitrogen, XP08160BOX and XP10200BOX) and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a wet transfer chamber with buffer consisting of 0.302% (w/v) Tris base, 1.44% (w/v) glycine and 20% ethanol in water. Transfer was verified by Ponceau S Staining Solution (Thermo Scientific, A40000278).

Immunoblotting was performed with 5% milk or 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, A9647) in TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl) with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS–Tween) and 1:500 to 1:1,000 primary antibodies or 1:5,000 secondary antibodies (LI-COR, 102673-330, 102673-328 or 102673-408). Washes were performed in TBS–Tween. Membranes were imaged by fluorescence detection at 700 and 800 nm with an Odyssey CLx Imager (LI-COR). For incubation with additional antibodies, membranes were incubated 15 min in mild stripping buffer (15% (w/v) glycine, 1% Tween-20 and 0.1% SDS, in water at pH 2.2), washed in water and reblocked. Primary antibodies were actin (Sigma-Aldrich, A3853, diluted 1:1,000), CAD (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA057266, diluted 1:500), COQ7 (Proteintech, 15083-1-AP, diluted 1:500), DHODH (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA010123, diluted 1:500), Flag M2 (Addgene, 194502-rAb, diluted 1:1,000), NUDT5 (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA019827, diluted 1:500), PPAT (Proteintech, 15401-1-AP, diluted 1:500) and UMPS (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA036178, diluted 1:500). The protein signal was quantified using Image Studio Software v.4.0 (LI-COR).

Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening was performed in K562 cells using the Brunello lentiviral library65 as previously described84. In brief, K562 cells were infected in duplicate at 500 cells per sgRNA with a multiplicity of infection of 0.3 in the presence of 10 µg ml−1 Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, TR-1003). After 24 h, cells were selected with 2 µg ml−1 puromycin (InvivoGen, ant-pr-1) for 48 h. On day 7 post-infection an aliquot was frozen for comparative analysis. At this time, cells were plated at 105 cells per ml (equivalent to 1,000 cells per sgRNA) in DMEM–GlutaMAX (Gibco, 31966021) with 10% dFBS (Sigma-Aldrich, F0392), 100 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin (BioConcept, 4-01F00-H) and either 200 µM uridine or volumetric equivalent in sterile water. Cells were passaged every 3 days for 3 weeks and 1,000 cells per sgRNA were collected on day 28 post-infection (21 days following medium switch). Genomic DNA was extracted using NucleoSpin Blood XL kit (Machery-Nagel, 740954.20), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Barcode sequencing, mapping and read counts were performed by the Genome Perturbation Platform (Broad Institute).

For steady-state experiments, cells were maintained in exponential phase and grown for at least 4 days in DMEM–GlutaMAX (Gibco, 31966021) with 10% dFBS (Sigma-Aldrich, F0392) and 100 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin (BioConcept, 4-01F00-H). PPAT KO cells were further supplemented with 200 µM inosine. Treatment with 10 µM TH5427 (Tocris Bioscience, 6534) or DMSO was carried out over the last 36 h. Before collection, 107 cells per replicate were transferred to fresh medium for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected, washed with PBS and centrifuged for 1 min at 2,000g at 4 °C. Supernatant was discarded and nitrogen vapour was used to displace ambient air. Pellets were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

For tracer analysis, cells were first maintained in exponential phase for 7 days in DMEM–GlutaMAX (Gibco, 31966021) with 10% dFBS (Sigma-Aldrich, F0392) and 100 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin (BioConcept, 4-01F00-H). Before collection, cells were washed with PBS and seeded at 2 × 106 per ml in no-glucose DMEM (Gibco, 11966-025) with 10% dFBS (Sigma-Aldrich, F0392), 100 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin (BioConcept, 4-01F00-H), 1 mM pyruvate (Gibco, 11360039) and 25 mM U-13C-glucose (Omicron Biochemicals, GLC-082) for 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected, washed with PBS and centrifuged for 1 min at 2,000g at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and nitrogen vapour was used to displace ambient air. Pellets were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Cells were grown for 4 days in DMEM–GlutaMAX (Gibco, 31966021) with 10% dFBS (Sigma-Aldrich, F0392) and 100 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin (BioConcept, 4-01F00-H). Before collection, cells were seeded at 1 × 107 per ml in fresh medium and were incubated alongside a flask of medium alone for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and supernatant was collected, centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000g at 4 °C and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Metabolites were extracted using successive freeze–thaw in methanol. Cell pellets were first resuspended in 200 µl of pre-cooled 100% (v/v) methanol containing 1 µM of 13C-labelled 4-hydroxybenzoic acid as an internal control and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. After brief thawing, samples were centrifuged 5 min at 8,000g and supernatant was collected. This process was repeated twice on the remaining pellet first with 200 µl 100% (v/v) methanol and then with 100 µl 100% (v/v) water, pooling the supernatants for a final concentration of 80% (v/v) methanol. Pooled supernatants were dried under vacuum, reconstituted in 50 µl of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile:water and moved into amber glass vials for analysis.

Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis was performed using a Thermo Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system coupled to a Thermo Exploris 240 Orbitrap mass spectrometer. For LC separation, a Vanquish binary pump system (Thermo Scientific) was used with a Waters Atlantis Premier BEH Z-HILIC column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7-µm particle size) held at 35 °C under 300 μl min−1 flow rate. Mobile phase A consisted of 5:95 (v/v) acetonitrile:water with 5 mM ammonium acetate (Sigma Millipore) and 200 µl l−1 25% ammonium solution (Sigma Millipore). Mobile phase B consisted of 95:5 (v/v) acetonitrile:water. Descriptions of all targeted metabolomics LC methods containing times and percentages of mobile phases are given in Supplementary Table 6. Then, 1 µl of sample was injected by a Vanquish Split Sampler HT autosampler (Thermo Scientific) while the autosampler temperature was kept at 4 °C. The samples were ionized by a heated electrospray ionization (ESI) source kept at a vaporizer temperature of either 350 °C or 200 °C depending on the LC method used. Sheath gas was set to 50 units, auxiliary gas to 8 units, sweep gas to 1 unit, and the spray voltage was set to 2,500 V using negative mode. The inlet ion transfer tube temperature was kept at 325 °C with a 70% RF lens. The identity and retention time of targeted metabolites was first validated using commercial standards when available or unique MS2 fragments from a metabolite library (mzcloud.org) when not. Quantification of experimental samples was performed using either parallel reaction monitoring with a higher-energy collisional dissociation (30%, 40% and 50%), targeting selected ion fragments generated from the fragmentation of the hydrogen loss (H−) ion or targeted single-ion monitoring. A full list of the reported precursor and fragment ions is given in Supplementary Table 6. Peak integration was performed using TraceFinder v.5.1 (Thermo Scientific).

This method was used to analyse metabolites in Figs. 1, 3 and 4 and Extended Data Figs. 1, 2 and 3f,h,k,m with ‘h' specified as ‘method 2'.

Frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice, then 150 mM KCl (50 µl) was added to each sample, followed by ice-cold methanol (600 µl) with 1 µM CoQ8 as internal standard (Avanti Polar Lipids). The samples were vortexed 10 min at 4 °C to lyse the cells. Ice-cold petroleum ether (400 µl) was added to extract the lipids, and the samples were vortexed again for 3 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged 3 min at 1,000g at 21 °C and the top petroleum ether layer was collected in a new tube. The petroleum ether extraction was repeated a second time, with the petroleum ether layer from the second extraction combined with that from the first. The extracted lipids were dried under argon before being resuspended in isopropanol (40 µl) and transferred to an amber glass vial (Supelco, QSertVial, 12 × 32 mm, 0.3 ml).

LC–MS analysis was performed using a Thermo Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system coupled to a Thermo Exploris 240 Orbitrap mass spectrometer. For LC separation, a Vanquish binary pump system (Thermo Scientific) was used with a Waters Acquity CSH C18 column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7-µm particle size) held at 35 °C under 300 μl min−1 flow rate. Mobile phase A consisted of 5 mM ammonium acetate in 70:30 (v/v) acetonitrile:water with 125 μl l−1 acetic acid. Mobile phase B consisted of 5 mM ammonium acetate in 90:10 (v/v) isopropanol:acetonitrile with the same additive. For each sample run, mobile phase B was initially held at 2% for 2 min and then increased to 30% over 3 min. Mobile phase B was further increased to 50% over 1 min and 85% over 14 min and then raised to 99% over 1 min and held for 4 min. The column was re-equilibrated for 5 min at 2% B before the next injection. Five microliters of the sample were injected by a Vanquish Split Sampler HT autosampler (Thermo Scientific), while the autosampler temperature was kept at 4 °C. The samples were ionized by a heated ESI source kept at a vaporizer temperature of 350 °C. Sheath gas was set to 50 units, auxiliary gas to 8 units, sweep gas to 1 unit, and the spray voltage was set to 3,500 V for positive mode and 2,500 V for negative mode. The inlet ion transfer tube temperature was kept at 325 °C with a 70% RF lens. For targeted analysis, the mass spectrometer was operated in a parallel reaction-monitoring mode with polarity switching acquiring scheduled, targeted scans to CoQ10 H+ adduct (m/z 863.6912), CoQ10 NH4+ adduct (m/z 880.7177), CoQ8 H+ adduct (m/z 727.566), CoQ8 NH4+ adduct (m/z 744.5935) and CoQ intermediates: DMQ10 H+ adduct (m/z 833.6806), DMQ10 NH4+ adduct (m/z 850.7072) and PPHB10 H− adduct (m/z 817.6504). MS acquisition parameters included a resolution of 45,000, HCD collision energy (45% for positive mode and 60% for negative mode) and 3-s dynamic exclusion. Automatic gain control targets were set to standard mode. The resulting CoQ intermediate data were processed using TraceFinder v.5.1 (Thermo Scientific). Raw intensity values were normalized to the CoQ8 internal standard.

Cell pellets were extracted with 80% (v/v) methanol, sonicated and homogenized with ceramic beads (Precellys Cryolys). Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000g at 4 °C and the supernatant was evaporated to dryness. Dried extracts were reconstituted in methanol according to total protein content as measured by a BCA assay. Samples were analysed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS), using the Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer (6495 iFunnel, Agilent Technologies) and dynamic multiple-reaction monitoring (dMRM) acquisition mode, following previously described methods85,86. Two complementary liquid chromatography modes coupled to positive and negative electrospray ionization MS, respectively, were used to maximize the metabolome coverage87.

Raw UHPLC–MS/MS data were processed using the MassHunter Quantitative Analysis software v.B.07.00 (Agilent Technologies). Extracted ion chromatogram areas for MRM transitions were used for relative quantification. The data, consisting of peak areas of detected metabolites across all samples, were processed and filtered depending on the coefficient of variation (CV) evaluated across quality control samples that were analysed periodically throughout the batch. Peaks with analytical variability above CV of 30% were discarded.

This method was used to analyse metabolites in Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3d,e,h, with ‘h' specified as ‘method 1'.

Cells were collected, washed with PBS and lysed by 10 min incubation on ice in 1× Native Buffer (NativePAGE Sample Prep kit, Invitrogen, BN2008), 1% digitonin (Invitrogen, BN2006), 1:100 protease inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, 87786), 1:500 nuclease (Thermo Scientific, 88702) and 10 mM individual metabolites as indicated.

Frozen mouse tissue was homogenized (gentleMACS Octo Dissociator, Miltenyi Biotec) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1% NP-40, 1:100 protease inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, 87786) and 1:500 nuclease (Thermo Scientific, 88702) then centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000g. Supernatant was diluted in the same buffer and 10 mM metabolites were added as indicated.

Samples with metabolite supplementation were incubated 1–16 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 g at 4 °C and the supernatant was saved. Protein concentration was quantified using DC Protein Assay kit II (Bio-Rad, 5000112). Proteins were separated on a 4–16% native gel (Invitrogen, BN1004BOX) with 1× anode buffer (NativePAGE Running Buffer kit, Invitrogen, BN2007) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a wet transfer chamber and buffer consisting of 0.302% (w/v) Tris base, 1.44% (w/v) glycine, 20% ethanol and 0.05% (w/v) SDS in water. Transfer was verified by Ponceau S Staining Solution (Thermo Scientific, A40000278). Membranes were incubated 5 min in 8% acetic acid and washed with water before proceeding to immunoblotting.

For standard respirometry, cells were seeded at 125,000 cells per well in Seahorse XF DMEM (Agilent Technologies, 103575-100) supplemented with 25 mM glucose and 2 mM glutamine, centrifuged for 1 min at 100g and incubated 1 h at 37 °C. The oxygen consumption rate was measured by the Agilent Seahorse XFe96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent Technologies) using the program XF Cell MitoStress Test and successive treatment with 2 µM oligomycin A (Tocris, 4110), 1.5 µM CCCP (Sigma-Aldrich, C2759) and 1.6 µM antimycin A (Sigma-Aldrich, A8674). To determine antimycin A-dependent respiration, COQ7 clones were instead seeded at 250,000 cells per well and tested with a single injection of antimycin at final concentration 1.6 µM. Data were analysed using Seahorse Wave Desktop Software (Agilent Technologies).

The 293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged NUDT5, NUDT5 mutants, PPAT or GFP as control using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668019) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HeLa or K562 cells were infected as described above to stably overexpress Flag-tagged PPAT or GFP. Cells were grown to 80% confluency, collected by scraping, washed with PBS and lysed by a 15–30-min incubation on ice in IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 1% NP-40) with 1:100 protease inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, 87786) and 10 mM metabolites as indicated. Lysates were spun for 10 min at 20,000g at 4 °C and supernatants were transferred to new tubes. A 1% volume was kept aside for inputs. Anti-Flag M2 magnetic beads (Millipore, M8823) were washed in IP buffer and incubated 1–16 h with samples at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Beads were washed five times in IP buffer and changed twice to new tubes. Then, 0.1 mg ml−1 3×Flag peptide (Sigma-Aldrich, F4799) in TBS was added to beads in two steps and each time incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation; the supernatant was saved on ice. Then, 100 µl trichloroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, T9159) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000g at 4 °C, the supernatant was discarded and pellets were washed in −20 °C acetone. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000g, the supernatant was discarded and pellets were heated at 55 °C until dry. The pellets were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer for analysis by SDS–PAGE or MS.

Cells were cultured 5 days in DMEM–GlutaMAX (Gibco, 31966021) with 10% dFBS (Sigma-Aldrich, F0392) and 100 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin (BioConcept, 4-01F00-H). A total of 5 × 106 cells were collected and washed with PBS, and pellets were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein extraction, library construction and analyses, and sample analyses were all carried out as described previously88, with minor changes. In brief, proteins were extracted using a modified iST method and dried by centrifugal evaporation. Then, a fraction of each of the eight samples were pooled for library construction and were fractionated by off-line basic reversed-phase fractionation (bRP). Dried bRP fractions were redissolved in 30 µl 2% acetonitrile with 0.5% TFA and 6 µl was injected for LC–MS/MS analysis. LC–MS/MS analyses were carried out on a TIMS-TOF Pro mass spectrometer (Bruker) interfaced through a nanospray ion source to an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Dionex) using data-dependent acquisition for library construction and data-independent acquisition for sample analysis, and analysed using Spectronaut v.17.5 (Biognosys), as previously reported88. In total, 99,738 precursors (7,076 protein groups) were quantified in all samples.

Samples were immunoprecipitated as described above. Digestion was carried out using the SP3 method89 with magnetic Sera-Mag Speedbeads (Cytiva, 45152105050250). Proteins were alkylated with 32 mM idoacetamine for 45 min at 21 °C in the dark. Beads were added at a ratio 10:1 (w/w) to samples and proteins were precipitated on beads with ethanol at a final concentration of 60%. After three washes with 80% ethanol, beads were digested in 50 µl of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate with 1 µg trypsin (Promega V5073) and incubated 1 h at 37 °C. The same amount of trypsin was added to samples for an additional 1 h incubation. Supernatant was then recovered, transferred to new tubes, acidified with formic acid at 0.5% final concentration and dried by centrifugal evaporation. To remove traces of SDS, two sample volumes of isopropanol containing 1% TFA were added to the digests and samples were desalted on a strong cation exchange plate (Oasis MCX, Waters) by centrifugation. Digests were washed with 1% TFA in isopropanol then 0.1% formic acid with 2% acetonitrile. Peptides were eluted in 200 µl of 80% acetonitrile, 19% water and 1% (v/v) ammonia, and dried by centrifugal evaporation. Samples were then analysed using LC–MS/MS analyses were carried out on a TIMS-TOF Pro mass spectrometer (Bruker) interfaced through a nanospray ion source to an EvoSep One liquid chromatography system (EvoSep), as described previously90.

Cells were collected, washed in PBS and seeded at 106 cells per ml in white flat-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific, 136101). Cellular ADP and ATP levels were measured using the ADP/ATP Ratio Assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, MAK135) according to the manufacturer's protocol with a BioTek Plate Reader (Agilent Technologies).

Cells were collected, washed with PBS and lysed by a 10-min incubation on ice in Assay Buffer (Abcam, ab155900) at 2 × 107 cells per ml. (Hypo)xanthine concentration was measured using the fluorometric protocol of the Xanthine/Hypoxanthine Assay kit (Abcam, ab155900) in black flat-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific, 137101). Fluorescence was measured at ex/em 535/587 nm with the BioTek Synergy Plate Reader (Agilent Technologies).

For analysis by z-score, sgRNA read count data were processed using an approach previously described28. In brief, data were normalized to reads per million and transformed to log2 space. A log2 fold change for each sgRNA in each medium condition was determined relative to the mean day 7 control read count (before medium switch). The mean log2 fold change was calculated across sgRNAs for each gene and results were averaged across two infection replicates. Low-expression genes (transcripts per million (TPM) < 1 in DepMap 24Q2 dataset68) were used to define the mean and s.d. of a null distribution for each medium condition and z-scores for each gene were defined based on this distribution. These low-expression genes and their corresponding sgRNA were excluded from further analyses. sgRNA read count data from day 28 (day 21 post-infection) were used as input for MAGeCK (v.0.5.9.2)29 with default parameters and using the medium condition supplemented with uridine as the reference.

GSEA was performed using GSEA30,31 v.4.2.2 on genes ranked according to ∆Z = Z−uridine – Z+uridine or by gene log2 fold change as calculated by MAGeCK. Enrichment was performed against the GO Biological Processes database c5.go.bp.v2023.2.Hs.symbols or against the MitoPathways database34 without collapse. For analysis using the GO database, maximum size exclusion was set to 50 and minimum to 2. For analysis using the MitoPathways database, minimum size exclusion was set to 15. All other parameters were kept as default. The top 50 negatively enriched pathways were manually annotated for their relationship to either pyrimidine biosynthesis or CoQ metabolism.

Metabolites were mapped to their KEGG91 IDs using MetaboAnalyst v.6.0 ‘Compound ID Conversion' tool (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/). Metabolites that were not successfully found were mapped manually where possible and were otherwise excluded. KEGG pathway identifiers for metabolism pathways were taken from their website (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html on 24 October 2024), excluding the subsections ‘Xenobiotics degradation and metabolism' and ‘Chemical structure transformation maps'. The list of metabolites for each pathway was obtained using the KEGGREST v.1.44.1 package (https://bioconductor.org/packages/KEGGREST) in R v.4.4.1. These data were used to generate a metabolite database and four additional pathways were added manually, delimiting mature purines or pyrimidines from the intermediate metabolites of their respective de novo synthesis pathways. Metabolite set enrichment analysis was performed using GSEA30,31 v.4.2.2 on metabolites ranked according to their log2 fold change (sgNUDT5/sgCtrl) in abundance. Enrichment was performed against the custom database described above without collapse. Maximum size exclusion was set to 500 and minimum to 3, all other parameters were kept as default.

Analyses were conducted with the Perseus software package (v.1.6.15.0)92. Standard protein contaminants were removed according to an established analytical pipeline (available at the Protein Analysis Facility and using the software package above), data were log2-transformed and only proteins quantified in at least four samples of one group were kept. Missing values were imputed based on normal distribution using Perseus default parameters. Student's t-tests were carried out and the log2 fold change over control samples (sgCtrl) was calculated.

Analyses were carried out using an in-house developed software tool (available on https://github.com/UNIL-PAF/taram-backend). Standard protein contaminants were removed according to an established analytical pipeline (available at the Protein Analysis Facility and on GitHub, detailed above), data were log2-transformed and only proteins quantified in at least two samples of one group were kept, resulting in 2,949 protein groups. Missing values were imputed based on a normal distribution with a width of 0.3 s.d., downshifted by 1.8 s.d. relative to the mean. Student's t-tests were carried out and the log2 fold change over control samples (GFP–3×Flag) was calculated. Data were filtered to exclude proteins that had not been reliably detected in both NUDT5–Flag replicate samples. Remaining data were queried against the Contaminant Repository for Affinity Purification (CRAPome) database H. sapiens Single Step Epitope tag AP-MS93, and proteins with an average spectral score >2.5 were excluded as common IP–MS contaminants.

Protein structures and interactions were modelled using AlphaFold Server54, and the highest confidence prediction was selected. AlphaFold 3 was used to model docking of metabolites to protein complexes. ChimeraX v.1.10 was used to view predicted models and to calculate hydrogen bonds.

Gene expression (OmicsExpressionProteinCodingGenesTPMLogp1.csv, v.24Q4) and drug treatment (Repurposing_Public_24Q2_Extended_Primary_Data_Matrix.csv) datasets were obtained from the CCLE Dependency Map portal94. For each of the analysed drugs, drug perturbation scores were correlated with gene expression scores across cell lines. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated using R v.4.5.0. For thioguanine, drugs named ‘thioguanine' and ‘tioguanine' were combined by taking the mean of their drug perturbation scores for each cell line. All 559 cell lines with gene expression scores and drug perturbation scores for the analysed drugs were included.

Statistical analyses as described in the figure legends were performed using Prism v.10 (GraphPad Software) and exact P values are shown where P < 0.05. All data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. and all Student's t-tests were two-sided. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications15,88,90. Samples were not randomized and not randomly assigned to experimental groups. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments, as data blinding is generally not considered relevant to cell culture experiments. Representative immunoblots and native gels are representative of a minimum of three independent replicates. Validation of coimmunoprecipitation in other cell lines was performed once. No data were excluded.

Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) remains one of the most critical challenges in drug development, causing patient safety concerns, clinical trial failures and drug withdrawals. We introduce ToxPredictor, a toxicogenomics framework combining RNA-seq data from primary human hepatocytes with pharmacokinetic data to predict dose-resolved DILI risks and safety margins. At its core is DILImap, an RNA-seq library tailored for DILI research, comprising 300 compounds at multiple concentrations. ToxPredictor achieves 88% sensitivity at 100% specificity in blind validation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. It flagged recent phase III clinical failures, including Evobrutinib, TAK-875, and BMS-986142, overlooked by animal studies. Beyond prediction, ToxPredictor provides mechanistic insights into hepatotoxic pathways, enabling early de-risking and actionable safety decisions. Unlike single-endpoint readouts—even from 3D models—transcriptomics offers a multi-dimensional system-level view of hepatocyte responses, capable of detecting diverse DILI mechanisms not captured by conventional assays. Scalable, actionable, and integrated into a broader AI/ML drug discovery platform, this work establishes toxicogenomics as a promising tool for developing safer therapeutics and addressing one of the most pressing challenges in toxicology.

Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) presents a poorly understood late-stage challenge in drug development, costing an estimated $350 million annually per pharmaceutical company1. Its rarity and unpredictability in clinical populations, often less than 1 in 10,000 persons, hinder detection in clinical studies, masking its severity until post-market exposure. Animal models fail to identify about half of the pharmaceuticals that exhibit clinical DILI2. This makes DILI a leading cause of drug candidate failure and market withdrawal, impeding the development of new therapies3.

DILI arises from complex, multifactorial mechanisms, involving dose-dependent intrinsic mechanisms and with current methods unpredictable idiosyncratic reactions4,5 influenced by genetic predisposition, environment, and individual health status6. DILI involves various cellular disruptions including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, bile acid imbalance, inhibition of specific enzymes or transporters, and reactive metabolites formation7,8. However, the precise mechanisms and contributing factors are not fully delineated4 and the lack of biomarkers hampers early detection9. Pre-clinical methods, such as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, offer low specificity and binary predictions lacking mechanistic insights10,11. In vitro models use diverse cell sources (e.g., HepG2, THLE, HepaRG cells, primary human hepatocytes) with endpoints ranging from cytotoxicity markers (e.g., LDH, ATP) to mechanistic assessments using high-content imaging (HCI) and multi-parametric strategies. 3D liver models aim to better mimic human tissue characteristics and in vivo responses12. However, despite improved physiological relevance, these models remain constrained by low-dimensional readouts—typically a limited panel of markers such as ATP levels, LDH release, or imaging-based features—which fail to capture the full spectrum of molecular responses and often miss the mechanistic cause. This gap continues to result in late-stage drug withdrawals and clinical failures, highlighting the urgent need for more comprehensive and predictive DILI models9.

Inspired by the idea of viewing cells as complex systems, we adopt a machine learning-driven toxicogenomics approach to analyze how DILI-associated compounds alter gene expression, identifying early gene signatures indicative of liver injury. Encompassing the interplay of pathways in response to toxic compounds, we aim to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying DILI. Utilizing resources like DILIrank13 and LiverTox14 for drug categorization into DILI positives and negatives, we employed the TG-GATES15 microarray database for an initial proof-of-concept, enabling us to accurately predict DILI with 62% sensitivity and 92% specificity in blind validation. Building on this initial success, we created DILImap, a purpose-built and significantly expanded transcriptomic library designed to capture a broader spectrum of DILI mechanisms. DILImap features full-transcriptome RNA-seq data from 300 compounds profiled at multiple concentrations in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs), making it, to the best of our knowledge, the largest toxicogenomics dataset available for DILI modeling.

ToxPredictor, our random forest-based machine learning model trained on DILImap, achieves 88% sensitivity (29/33 DILI positives) at 100% specificity (14/14 DILI negatives) in blind validation. It outperforms 20+ pre-clinical models in a head-to-head comparisons, including mechanistic assays16,17,18,19,20,21, cytotoxicity markers22,23,24,25,26,27, physicochemical properties28, bioactivation29, BSEP30 approaches, and the latest in-silico models31,32,33, effectively identifying DILI risks in drugs previously overlooked by traditional models. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first pre-clinical model to flag DILI risks in high-profile clinical failures, such as Evobrutinib, TAK-875 and BMS-986142, all recently withdrawn in phase III trials due to liver injury despite clean preclinical profiles. The model provides dose-resolved predictions and mechanistic insights, demonstrating its utility for prioritizing safer drug candidates.

Beyond generalization to unseen compounds, the model has a distinct edge in its mechanistic breadth. The model leverages the full transcriptomic landscape to detect DILI-related mechanisms such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, immune activation, and metabolic perturbation—often well before cell death. These advantages are particularly evident when compared to high-content 3D liver assays26,34,35,36, which, while physiologically relevant, are typically constrained to low-dimensional viability or imaging endpoints. In head-to-head comparisons, our model uniquely identifies non-cytotoxic risks missed by 3D assays. This systems-level resolution enables more comprehensive and unbiased detection of toxic liabilities across diverse compound classes.

This work, integral to a broader AI/ML drug discovery platform, aims at enhancing predictive power and operational efficiency in drug development. It showcases that the shift from a single-target to a systems-level perspective holds great promise and positions machine learning in toxicogenomics as significant enhancement to existing methods. To advance the field and foster collaborative innovation, we have made our open-source model and validation data publicly available at dilimap.org, providing a powerful tool for de-risking drug candidates and setting the stage for a paradigm shift in safety evaluations.

We have created DILImap, a comprehensive RNA-seq library tailored for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) modeling, encompassing 300 compounds tested at four concentrations. As the most extensive toxicogenomics resource to date, DILImap includes a curated selection of DILI-positive and DILI-negative compounds that span a wide range of known DILI mechanisms, including well-documented liver-injuring drugs and idiosyncratic compounds with no characteristic signature (Fig. 1A).

A We created DILImap, the largest toxicogenomics dataset to date, encompassing RNA-seq profiles from 300 compounds tested at multiple concentrations in primary human hepatocytes. Compounds span a range of DILI mechanisms, idiosyncratic effects, and non-DILI controls, ensuring broad mechanistic coverage. This resource forms the foundation for training our DILI model. B ToxPredictor, our machine learning model trained on the DILImap, learns pathway signatures indicative of DILI risk. C ToxPredictor de-risks new drug candidates by estimating DILI risk and safety margins. In blind validation, it achieved 88% sensitivity (29/33 DILIs detected) and 100% specificity (all 14 non-DILI compounds accurately classified). This framework sets the stage for a paradigm shift in safety evaluations.

All compounds were screened in sandwich-cultured primary human hepatocytes (PHHs), the gold standard and most physiologically relevant in vitro model for liver toxicity, which preserve key hepatic functions such as metabolic activity and bile canaliculi formation37,38. Each compound was tested in triplicate across six concentrations using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) cell viability assays. RNA-seq profiling was performed at four selected doses, spanning the pharmacologically relevant range from therapeutic plasma Cmax to the highest tolerated non-cytotoxic dose just below the IC₁₀ threshold (Supplementary Fig. S1).

We selected a 24-hour post-exposure time point, based on the trade-off between signal strength and cellular viability: earlier time points (e.g., 2 h or 8 h) yield weaker transcriptional responses39, while longer incubations risk hepatocyte de-differentiation and RNA degradation40. This strategy allowed us to capture early transcriptional responses without compromising RNA integrity. Marker analysis confirmed retention of hepatocyte identity at 24 hours. We further ensured data quality by including only wells with sufficient total RNA counts and low mitochondrial RNA content, indicating viable, transcriptionally active cells. This streamlined workflow—including automated solubility testing, viability screening, and IC₁₀-based dose selection—enabled us to profile 300 compounds in four months, including 110 drugs tested preclinically for the first time as part of a systematic benchmark (Supplementary Fig. S2; Methods). To support comprehensive benchmarking, we provide detailed annotations for each compound, including clinical DILI labels13, DILI mechanisms14, molecular information41, consensus plasma Cmax from various studies10,19,20,23,24,25,28,42,43, and DILI classification results from over 20 pre-clinical studies (Supplementary Data S1–S4).

Compounds were categorized based on DILIrank13 and LiverTox14 as follows (Supplementary Fig. S3):

Withdrawn DILI: withdrawals or clinical trial failures due to DILI (Most-DILI-Concern; withdrawn).

Known DILI: compounds with well-established clinical DILI risk (Most-DILI-Concern or LiverTox score A).

Likely DILI: drugs with documented liver injury cases (Most-DILI-Concern or LiverTox score A/B).

Idiosyncratic DILI: rare cases without clear dose–response (LiverTox score C/D, <12 case reports).

Unlikely DILI: discordant or weak evidence across databases (Less-DILI-concern, but LiverTox score E).

No DILI: compounds with no documented hepatotoxicity (No-DILI-Concern; LiverTox score E).

Withdrawn, Known, and Likely DILI serve as positive controls; No DILI as negative controls; while Idiosyncratic and Unlikely DILI, due to their label ambiguity, are excluded from training and reserved for downstream testing.

The training dataset includes 249 compounds (111 DILI + , 52 DILI-, 17 unlikely DILI, 69 idiosyncratic DILI) for cross-validation. For blind validation, a separate experiment was conducted using an independent set of 51 compounds (33 DILI + , 14 DILI-, and 4 with unknown labels, including real-world clinical failures). This carefully curated dataset provides a robust foundation for predictive modeling and mechanistic insights into DILI.

ToxPredictor, a machine learning model trained on our DILImap library, predicts DILI risk from pathway-level transcriptional signatures. These signatures are derived through enrichment analysis (WikiPathways44, FDR-adjusted p-values) of genes differentially expressed between compound- vs. DMSO-treated samples using DESeq245, computed for each dose of every compound in DILImap (Fig. 1B; see Methods).

For model training, we used only compounds with unambiguous DILI labels, resulting in a high-confidence training set of 111 DILI+ (Withdrawn, Known, Likely) and 52 DILI− (No DILI), while the remaining training data were held out to assess model robustness. To ensure high-confidence DILI labels, we further restricted training to drug concentrations tested at more than 20x of their clinical Cmax to reduce the risk of false-negative labeling for DILI+ compounds that may appear safe at lower doses. For 5-fold cross-validation, we applied stratified, compound-level splitting to ensure that all doses and replicates of a given compound were held out together in each fold, mimicking real-world generalization to unseen compounds. From 193 tested configurations across eight model classes, we selected a Random Forest classifier for its strong validation AUC, minimal overfitting, and highest consistency across folds. These properties, combined with its interpretability, motivated its choice over more complex boosting and deep learning models (Supplementary Fig. S4).

The final model is an ensemble of 30 Random Forest models (ensemble members) trained on different cross-validation splits, which together enhance generalization and prediction stability. The ensemble size was chosen based on empirical benchmarking that showed stable test AUC and consistency between models (Supplementary Fig. S5). By estimating DILI probabilities across dose levels, ToxPredictor enables calculation of drug safety margins, defined as the ratio between the first predicted DILI dose (i.e., the lowest dose with predicted probability >0.7) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at therapeutic levels. This provides a transcriptomics-based surrogate of the clinical therapeutic window. A safety margin threshold of 80 provides an actionable classification into high- and low-risk compounds. The probability threshold of 0.7 and margin of safety (MOS) cutoff of 80 were both optimized on held-out training data to reach performance plateaus while minimizing false positives. Our selected MOS threshold of 80, while on the higher end of literature-reported ranges (10–100)17,23,28,34,36, reflects the greater sensitivity of transcriptomic assays compared to cytotoxicity or mechanistic readouts. Since transcriptional changes often occur at lower doses—before overt toxicity—a higher cutoff is needed to avoid false positives and maintain high specificity in a transcriptome-based model (Supplementary Fig. S5). Among available exposure measures, we used total Cmax instead of free Cmax due to its broader availability across compounds. Both measures showed comparable predictive performance, with total Cmax performing slightly better, possibly due to more robust consensus values derived from a greater number of studies (Supplementary Fig. S6).

All model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and threshold optimization were performed exclusively on the training data. For final evaluation, we used a fully independent blind-validation set of 51 compounds (33 DILI + , 14 DILI − , and 4 unknowns), profiled in a separate experiment using separate plates and sequencing runs. This set was withheld from all stages of model development. Compound selection for the validation study was finalized prior to training and intentionally enriched for withdrawals and recent clinical failures. The four unknowns represent compounds currently in clinical use or trials without confirmed DILI liability (Supplementary Table S1).

In blind validation, the model achieved 88% sensitivity, correctly identifying 29 of the 33 DILI+ compounds, and 100% specificity, with all 14 DILI− compounds correctly classified as safe (Fig. 1C).

These results represent a substantial improvement over our initial proof-of-concept model trained on TG-GATES microarray data, which achieved 62% sensitivity and 92% specificity. Leveraging our DILImap library, ToxPredictor substantially improved both sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 100% on the same validation set (Fig. 2A). In cross-validation of the entire library, the model identified 110 out of 144 DILIs—surpassing the previous 62 out of 144 with TG-GATES—and misclassified only 8 out of 66 non-DILIs (Fig. 2B, Suppl. Figure S7). This enhancement is attributed to DILImap's larger dataset with broader mechanistic coverage and the higher resolution of RNA-seq over microarrays, enabling better gene detection and a wider quantitative range for expression level changes compared to microarrays46. Notably, post-market withdrawals, missed in both pre-clinical models and clinical trials, were most confidently flagged by our model as high DILI risk.

A Compounds are grouped into four categories based on DILI potential: No DILI (n = 14), likely DILI (n = 15), known DILI (n = 4), and withdrawn due to DILI (n = 14). Each data point represents the safety margin of an individual compound. Boxplots show the median (center line), interquartile range (box), and data within 1.5 × interquartile range (whiskers). The safety margin—calculated as the ratio of the first toxic dose to the therapeutic maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)—effectively separates DILI-positive from non-DILI compounds in blind validation using a safety margin threshold of 80 (dashed line). The model demonstrated 88% sensitivity and 100% specificity in identifying DILI-positive and non-DILI compounds, respectively. B Cross-validation of the entire DILImap library confirms the model's robust performance across the entire dataset (No DILI: n = 52; likely DILI: n = 73; known DILI: n = 25; withdrawn: n = 13). These results highlight the ability of transcriptomics-based modeling to improve DILI detection beyond traditional methods, offering enhanced sensitivity for withdrawn and known high-risk compounds while maintaining high specificity for non-DILI controls.

Our DILI safety margin and classification is derived from three parameters: Cmax (baseline concentration), cell viability assays (indicating cell death), and transcriptomics (based on differential pathways). To assess each parameter's contribution, we assessed their ability to classify DILI cases independently. Out of 144 DILIs, 29 were detected solely based on plasma Cmax (>25 μM) and 42 through the LDH cytotoxicity assay (safety margin <80), both at ≥90% specificity. Combining our transcriptomics-based model with Cmax and LDH data was most effective, identifying 110 out of 142 DILIs (safety margin <80), underscoring the added value of toxicogenomics in DILI detection beyond mere cell death (Supplementary Fig. S8). ToxPredictor achieved a ROCAUC of 0.82 in cross-validation, compared to 0.66 for viability alone. In blind validation, it achieved a ROCAUC of 0.96, compared to 0.65 for using viability alone (Supplementary Fig. S9).

Our model highlights distinct DILI profiles among closely related COX-2 inhibitor non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and imparts unique mechanistic insights linking predictions to mechanisms such as hepatocellular injury, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. For instance, Valdecoxib, used for cancer pain, shows no DILI risk (Fig. 3A), while Sulindac, an arthritis treatment with rare but established idiosyncratic DILI cases, and Lumiracoxib, withdrawn due to severe liver failures, are flagged as DILI risks with safety margins below the classification threshold of 80 (Fig. 3B).

A Valdecoxib, deemed safe, is predicted no DILI risk across all dose levels, with a margin of safety (MOS) greater than 300. B Sulindac, associated with idiosyncratic DILI, and Lumiracoxib, withdrawn from the market due to severe liver failure, are both flagged as high-risk by the model with MOS values of 31 and 1, respectively. C The predictions are driven by pathways implicated in DILI. Differential pathway signatures highlight key mechanisms underlying DILI risk, include oxidative stress, drug metabolism, receptor-mediated signaling, fat and cholesterol synthesis, and bile acid regulation. Pathway enrichment was performed using Enrichr (gseapy), based on a Fisher's exact test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction. Color intensity reflects –log10 adjusted p-values. D Dose-resolved DILI risk probabilities illustrate how increasing dosages impact the likelihood of liver injury. Dots indicate mean predictions and blue shaded confidence intervals represent the standard deviations across ensemble models. These predictions align closely with clinical outcomes, demonstrating its utility in DILI risk stratification, pathway-based mechanistic understanding, and guiding safer drug development.

Crucially, it highlights the pathways implicated in DILI, encompassing direct contributors like oxidative stress leading to cell injury, as well as indirect factors such as disturbances in fatty acid metabolism, which can be particularly relevant to explain idiosyncratic effects (Suppl. Table S2). Sulindac, for example, is linked to disruptions in fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol biosynthesis, aligning with recent studies connecting it to hepatic steatosis47. By pinpointing these pathways, the model provides mechanistic insights into idiosyncratic DILI, offering an understanding previously thought unpredictable (Fig. 3C).

The model assesses DILI risks in a dose-resolved manner, revealing how dosage impacts liver injury likelihood. A key demonstration is its accurate prediction of Sulindac's DILI risk, despite it being believed to be unpredictable in a dose-resolved manner48. These results highlight the model's ability to deliver actionable predictions and enable targeted optimization of drug safety profiles by focusing on critical pathways (Fig. 3D).

DILI arises from disruptions in diverse pathways. Our model highlights pathways with high predictive value (AUC ≈ 0.8) strongly associated with DILI risk, including amino acid metabolism (toxic metabolite buildup causing oxidative stress and liver injury), fatty acid biosynthesis (disruptions leading to lipid accumulation and hepatocyte damage), tryptophan metabolism (toxic intermediates driving oxidative stress and inflammation) and ferroptosis (iron-dependent oxidative stress leading to lipid peroxide accumulation)49,50,51,52,53. Additionally, pathway activations highly correlated with predicted DILI risk include nuclear receptor signaling (e.g., PXR/CAR/FXR), one-carbon metabolism, and bile acid regulation—highlighting transcriptional reprogramming and metabolic stress as key contributors to hepatotoxicity54,55,56 (Fig. 4A). When compounds are ranked by predicted DILI probabilities, a clear gradient of pathway activation emerges, revealing distinct enrichment patterns for these biological processes. This correlation reinforces the direct mechanistic relevance and interpretability of the model's predictions and highlights these pathways as potential drivers of DILI (Fig. 4B).

A Pathways are ranked by their ability to distinguish DILI vs. non-DILI compounds, measured by AUC. To quantify the strength of association between pathway dysregulation and predicted DILI risk, we show the Spearman correlation between pathway activation scores and DILI probability across compounds. This highlights transcriptional and metabolic stress pathways—such as nuclear receptor signaling, one-carbon metabolism, and bile acid regulation—as key contributors to DILI risk. B Compounds are ordered by their DILI risk probability, showing a correlation between DILI risk and the activation of pathways associated with liver injury. Pathway enrichment was performed using Enrichr (gseapy), based on a Fisher's exact test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction. The most affected pathways include those critical to drug metabolism, oxidative stress and lipid homeostasis. Key pathways include Cytochrome P450 Oxidation, NRF2-ARE regulation for oxidative stress response, and Fatty Acid Beta-Oxidation, highlighting the interplay between detoxification, mitochondrial function, and energy metabolism. Additionally, nuclear receptor pathways such as Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) and Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein (SREBP) signaling reveal disruptions in lipid and bile acid regulation. C Differential gene signatures were computed with DESeq2 using the Wald test, with Benjamini–Hochberg correction. Values are shown as –log10 adjusted p-values multiplied by the sign of the log-fold change. Top 100 genes most frequently upregulated in DILI cases include those related to drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP51A1, UGT1A8, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3), drug transport (e.g., SLC3A2), stress response (e.g., TXNRD1, SRXN1, GLRX, GLRX3, GCLM, HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, HSPE1), and lipid metabolism (e.g., PLIN2, INSIG1, SREBF1, SCD, LPIN2, FADS2). Less commonly studied but significant genes include those involved in inflammation (e.g., GDF15, TNFRSF12A, S100A10, LITAF), autophagosome formation (e.g., MAP1LC3B, SQSTM1), and mitochondrial function (e.g., VDAC2, RAN, CHCHD10). D Top 100 genes most frequently downregulated in DILI cases include those involved in drug metabolism and detoxification (e.g., CYP4A11, CYP2E1, AKR1C4, GSTA1, GSTA2, UGT2B10, UGT2B15), drug transport (e.g., SLC10A1, SLC22A1, SLC22A7, SLC38A3, SLC27A5), and protein processing (e.g., ALB, AHSG, TTR, APOA1, APOE). Genes associated with amino acid metabolism and mitochondrial function (e.g., MAT1A, ARG1, CPS1, HMGCS2, ACAA1, ACAA2, ECHS1) also show significant downregulation. Key oxidative stress regulators and redox enzyme (e.g., CAT, ABAT, GNMT, and DHTKD1) are also reduced. Pathways related to lipid metabolism (e.g., CIDEB, ACSM2A, ACSM2B, ACSM5) and coagulation or inflammatory responses (e.g., SERPINF2, SERPINC1, SERPINA6, SERPINA10, FGB, FGG, FGA) are prominently affected. Notable genes with less established links to DILI but showing significant downregulation include ITIH4, PGLYRP2, BHMT, and GUCA2B, which could represent novel mechanisms or pathways contributing to the progression of liver injury. The changes in gene expression reflect early cellular alterations that may lead to DILI and highlight the complexity of DILI mechanisms, which encompass multiple aspects of liver function.

To identify genes most significant for DILI, we determined the frequency at which each gene was differentially up- or downregulated across DILI drugs in our library, using an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05. This analysis focused on the concentrations at which toxic effects were first predicted, aiming to uncover early upstream regulators potentially driving DILI. Most frequently up-regulated genes were associated with drug metabolism, transport, stress response, and lipid metabolism. Novel genes linked to inflammation, autophagy, and mitochondrial dysfunction were also implicated (Fig. 4C). Frequently down-regulated genes include those critical for liver functions such as drug metabolism, transport, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, mitochondrial function, coagulation and inflammatory responses. Altered expression of these genes may serve as early indicators of liver injury and reflect DILI's multifaceted mechanisms (Fig. 4D).

Establishing that the DILI pathways and genes identified by our model are specific to liver toxicity rather than general toxicity is inherently challenging. However, the model's precision is evident in its accurate classification of non-DILI compounds with known toxicities in other systems, such as Valdecoxib (cardiovascular toxicity), Bupropion (neurologic and cardiovascular toxicity), and Warfarin (hematologic toxicity)57,58,59, indicating the model's ability to distinguish liver-specific toxicity from other forms of organ damage.

Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, despite their promise in oncology and autoimmune diseases, have faced clinical holds due to liver injury. Recent examples include Evobrutinib, BMS-986142, and Orelabrutinib, all of which were withdrawn or put on hold in phase III in 2023 due to DILI cases.

We validated ToxPredictor on four clinical failures: Evobrutinib, BMS-986142, Orelabrutinib, and TAK-875 (type 2 diabetes drug), along with two investigational BTK inhibitors (Rilzabrutinib, Remibrutinib) and two FDA-approved JAK inhibitors (Tofacitinib, Upadacitinib) as negative controls. DILI risk probabilities were assessed at four concentrations and margins of safety (MOS) estimated to classify compounds as high (MOS ≤ 2.5), mid-high (MOS ≤ 12.5), medium (MOS ≤ 80), or low risk (MOS > 80). All clinical failures were flagged as high or medium-high risk with low MOS values, particularly TAK-875, Evobrutinib, and BMS-986142, consistent with their phase III withdrawals. The investigational drugs were classified as medium risk (MOS = 14) and low risk (MOS = 101), which have not yet been linked to DILI in clinical studies yet, while the DILI-negative JAK inhibitors were classified as low risk. These results align closely with their clinical safety profiles (Fig. 5A).

A. ToxPredictor provides outputs including the first DILI concentration, safety margin, and corresponding risk classification. Clinical validation confirms that drugs labeled as high risk by the model, such as TAK-875, Evobrutinib, and BMS-986142, were recently withdrawn and halted in Phase III trials due to DILI. Conversely, low-risk drugs such as Tofacitinib and Upadacitinib, as classified by the model, exhibit no DILI association. B Model-derived DILI risk likelihood curves for representative compounds are plotted against hypothetical Cmax values. These curves delineate dose regimes associated with low, medium, mid-high and high DILI risk, enabling dose recommendations within the low-risk range. Risk classification is determined based on the actual efficacious Cmax of each compound: Evobrutinib is classified as high risk, Rilzabrutinib as medium risk (recommended dose <100 mg q.d.), and Remibrutinib as low risk (recommended dose <155 mg q.d.). This demonstrates the model's utility in guiding dose selection to minimize DILI risk.

ToxPredictor provides dose-dependent DILI risk curves derived from empirical DILI likelihoods across various hypothetical Cmax values, enabling safe dosing recommendations (see Methods). For instance, Rilzabrutinib is categorized as low risk at doses below 100 mg q.d., which is lower than its efficacious dose of 400 mg. In contrast, Remibrutinib's efficacious dose of 100 mg falls within the recommended low-risk range of <155 mg q.d. These findings highlight ToxPredictor's value in informing safe dosing strategies, making it a valuable tool for de-risking new drug candidates (Fig. 5B).

We benchmark our model along two key axes: predictive performance and scalability. Predictive performance, measured by balanced accuracy, reflects the model's ability to distinguish DILI-positive from DILI-negative compounds. Scalability captures both technical throughput and biological breadth—the capacity to generalize across diverse chemistries and mechanisms, including previously uncharacterized ones (Fig. 6A).

A Balanced accuracy versus scale (number of DILI + /− compounds) across published preclinical models. ToxPredictor achieves the highest performance among both in vitro and in silico methods, outperforming high-content imaging, cytotoxicity, bioactivation-based and structure-based models, demonstrating robust performance even when scaled to hundreds of compounds. B Head-to-head comparison on overlapping compounds shows consistent performance gains over other studies. Models with >80% specificity (marked with *) support credible preclinical de-risking. Results highlight transcriptomics-based toxicogenomics as a leading strategy for mechanistically informed, scalable DILI prediction.

Our model outperforms a wide range of pre-clinical DILI models, including mechanistic assays16,17,18,19,20,21, cytotoxicity markers22,23,24,25,26,27, physicochemical properties28, bioactivation29 and BSEP30 approaches. In a head-to-head comparison across matched compound sets, it identified 46 out of 66 DILI cases versus the 27 out of 66 identified by Xu et al.17 HCI assay (49/66 vs 27/66); it shows superior performance over Garside et al.20 HCI assay (37/46 vs 29/46 DILIs), Vorrink et al.26 cytotoxicity assay using CD spheroids (37/43 vs 30/43 DILIs), Sakatis et al.29 bioactivation endpoint GSH adduct (47/65 vs 25/65) as well as their combined assay integrating covalent binding and dose (47/65 vs 32/65). When compared to Kohonen et al.'s transcriptomics-based cytotoxicity model60, our approach showed improved sensitivity (26/36 vs. 16/36 DILIs). These comparisons, all at 100% specificity evaluated on the same compounds, underscore the added value of our systems-level, mechanism-agnostic readout (Fig. 6B; Supplementary Table S3).

Structure-based in silico models such as TxGemma31, DILIGeNN32 and DILIPredictor33 underperform in vitro-based approaches in our benchmark. To assess real-world generalizability, we evaluated them on 314 independent compounds (45 DILI + , 269 DILI − ) primarily annotated via LiverTox (scores A/B as DILI + , E as DILI − ); TxGemma was also tested on an expanded set (143 DILI + , 536 DILI − ). All showed limited specificity: DILIGeNN (84% sensitivity, 28% specificity), DILIPredictor (80% sensitivity, 29% specificity), and TxGemma-27B (57% sensitivity, 37% specificity). These findings are slightly below the balanced accuracy of 0.59 reported by Seal et al. (2024)33 for DILIPredictor. On a benchmark subset of unseen compounds overlapping with DILImap (n = 97), TxGemma reached 63% sensitivity (39/62) and 57% specificity (20/35), while our model achieved 76% sensitivity (47/62) and 86% specificity (30/35). Similarly, DILIGeNN showed perfect sensitivity (5/5) at moderate specificity (2/3), while our model reached 100% on both (5/5 and 3/3). DILIPredictor reached complete sensitivity (23/23) but at the expense of poor specificity (1/7), while ToxPredictor maintained high sensitivity (20/23) at markedly higher specificity (5/7). Low specificity is a key limitation of structure-based models, which lack biological context and tend to over-call toxicity. This results in false positives for commonly prescribed drugs with no risk of hepatotoxicity, such as biotin (flagged DILI+ by DILIPredictor), vitamin D (flagged DILI+ by DILIGeNN), and pemetrexed (flagged DILI+ by all three models). Moreover, they provide only binary outputs, without dose or mechanistic insight. In contrast, transcriptomics enables dose-resolved predictions, mechanistic interpretability, and safety margin estimation—critical for evaluating toxic liabilities and guiding follow-up experiments (Supplementary Fig. S10; Supplementary Data S4).

3D liver systems offer important physiological context. High-content imaging in 3D models, such as those by Walker et al.34 and Ewart et al.35, achieves similar performance on small, curated panels (Walker: 23/27 vs. 23/27; Ewart: 11/14 vs. 13/14). However, their limited scalability constrains their utility to a broader range of DILI mechanisms. They may perform well on narrow, curated panels, but struggle with unknown mechanisms or mechanisms not captured by the low-dimensional endpoint, as shown in the following comparison. To explore the unique capabilities of 2D transcriptomics vs 3D cytotoxicity assays, we conducted direct compound-level comparisons with larger 3D screening studies: Vorrink et al.26 and Fäs et al.36 In Vorrink et al. 3D cytotoxicity uniquely detected 3 compounds (Fialuridine, Methotrexate, Trazodone), all linked to cytotoxic effects that result in acute cell death. Conversely, our model uniquely flagged 10 compounds—including fluconazole, phenytoin, and zileuton—associated with immune activation, metabolic stress, or enzyme modulation, which are not readily captured by viability endpoints. A similar pattern emerged in the Fäs et al. study: 3D cytotoxicity exclusively identified 4 compounds (e.g., Haloperidol, Fialuridine) whose toxicities depend on structural or metabolic context. Our model uniquely identified 5 compounds (e.g., Cimetidine, Fluconazole, Ximelagatran) marked by subtle transcriptional responses rather than overt cell death. These comparisons highlight a key limitation of fixed single-endpoint models: while effective in narrow contexts, they struggle with broader chemical and mechanistic diversity. Our transcriptomic approach, by contrast, offers systems-level resolution that generalizes across DILI pathways—not only detecting known cytotoxic responses but also uncovering less immediate, non-lethal mechanisms often missed by traditional assays (Supplementary Data S4).

As a result of its unbiased modeling, our approach shows improved detection of idiosyncratic compounds—a class of toxicities that often escape detection in targeted or phenotypically narrow assays. These compounds, many of which are associated with extremely rare clinical incidence (<12 case reports), present a significant challenge for preclinical screening. Our model identified 29 out of 65 of those cases (44%) the highest detection rate among all evaluated models, while maintaining a specificity of 88% (Supplementary Fig. S11A).

Next, we analyzed how combining toxicogenomics with orthogonal assays further enhances detection. The three most effective combinations include pairing our model with Walker et al.'s 3D-based HCI assay34 to improve DILI detection from 23/27 to 26/27 cases, pairing with Persson et al.'s 2D-based HCI assay19 to improve DILI detection from 28/37 to 30/37 cases, and pairing with Sakatis et al. GSH depletion assay29 to increase detection from 47/65 to 53/65. Such strategic combinations could raise balanced accuracy to as high as 98% (Supplementary Fig. S11B).

Based on these insights, we propose a tiered de-risking funnel strategy that begins with straightforward endpoints, such as PK data (e.g., Cmax <25 μM) and cytotoxicity assays, to flag overt hepatotoxicity. For candidates showing no early toxicity signals, toxicogenomics provides the most comprehensive and unbiased assessment of DILI risk—capturing both known and novel mechanisms. For a select few advanced candidates, with sufficient resources, applying toxicogenomics in advanced 3D liver models may offer the most accurate prediction of in vivo responses. This strategy ensures a resource-efficient and mechanistically broad DILI risk assessment in drug development.

Our toxicogenomics approach offers a comprehensive and unbiased perspective on cellular responses, providing rich information for a nuanced understanding of liver toxicity, including idiosyncratic reactions with unknown mechanisms. By shifting from single-target analyses to a systems-level viewpoint, we demonstrate that applying machine learning to toxicogenomics holds great promise as a significant enhancement over existing toxicology methods. It enables dose-specific predictions and safety margins, moving beyond binary DILI/No-DILI assessments. Its extensive mechanistic coverage presents a substantial advantage over current pre-clinical models. By creating a comprehensive toxicogenomics library specifically designed for DILI research, we achieved notable improvements in predicting DILI risks compared to state-of-the-art methods. The high sensitivity (88%) and specificity (100%) obtained in blind validation, along with the identification of DILI in withdrawn drugs and clinical failures overlooked in animal and clinical studies, underscore its practical utility in early drug development phases. We consider this an important step forward in predictive toxicology, positioning our approach as a significant advancement in the field. The scalability and adaptability of our method, a central component of a larger AI/ML platform, are designed to enhance the predictive power and efficiency of drug development pipelines.

While our approach represents a meaningful step forward, it is important to acknowledge the inherent limitations of our method. First, the multifactorial nature of DILI, involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, means even the most advanced models cannot capture the full spectrum of potential mechanisms. Our approach, though comprehensive, does not account for all interindividual variability or rare genetic predispositions contributing to DILI risk. Second, the predictive power of our model is constrained by the completeness of the DILImap library. Gaps in the database, particularly in relation to poorly documented idiosyncratic reactions, can limit the model's accuracy. Third, our reliance on a 2D hepatocyte culture system may fail to replicate the complex interactions between hepatocytes and other cell types or tissues that can drive certain DILI mechanisms. Fourth, the exposure timepoint of 24 hours limit the detection of delayed or immune-mediated toxicities. Fifth, as with any preclinical model, the ultimate test of its utility lies in its ability to predict clinical outcomes, a domain where uncertainties and unpredicted variables can significantly impact performance.

Looking ahead, toxicogenomics holds tremendous promise for advancing our understanding and prediction of DILI. Integrating RNA-seq with advanced 3D culture systems—such as spheroids and liver-on-chip platforms—may enable longer drug exposures and the inclusion of non-parenchymal cells like Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells. These co-culture models are essential for capturing immune activation, inflammation, and fibrosis—hallmarks of idiosyncratic and chronic DILI that hepatocyte monocultures cannot recapitulate. As long 3D models rely on high-content imaging or cytotoxicity endpoints that capture specific phenotypic responses they remain limited in mechanistic scope and scalability. Their performance is often demonstrated on small, curated compound sets with known mechanisms, which may not translate to broader chemical space. In contrast, transcriptomics provides a scalable, unbiased readout capable of detecting diverse DILI mechanisms, including those not captured by existing assays. As RNA-seq becomes more feasible in physiologically relevant 3D systems, we anticipate a powerful synergy—combining the mechanistic breadth of transcriptomics with the physiological relevance of 3D models. Our work lays the foundation for such integration, demonstrating that transcriptomics alone can robustly capture DILI risk across a wide range of mechanisms.

Combining RNA-seq data with structural information of molecules could enable a deeper understanding of the interactions between drugs and cellular components, facilitating more accurate predictions of toxicity. Using early estimates as surrogate for plasma Cmax, such as target activity, could help derive safety margins earlier in the drug discovery process. The development of multivariate models that include DILI regulatory networks represents another exciting frontier. Such models can incorporate the complex interplay of genes, proteins, and metabolic pathways involved in DILI. Furthermore, exploring additional data types, such as chromatin accessibility, proteomics, or metabolomics, could yield further insights into DILI mechanisms.

As these advanced models and datasets become integrated into the early stages of drug development, we anticipate a decrease in liver-related adverse events, improved efficiency in drug development, significant cost savings, and, most importantly, enhanced patient safety. The ongoing evolution of toxicogenomics approaches, bolstered by advancements in computational machine learning methods and multi-omics technologies, marks an important step toward more predictive drug safety evaluation—one that has the potential to support the development of safer therapeutics and improved patient outcomes.

We employed a systematic, high-throughput approach using cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) to study transcriptional changes underlying drug-induced liver injury (DILI).

Cryopreserved PHHs were obtained from LifeNet Health (Virginia Beach, VA, USA) under standard provider agreements. LifeNet Health procured tissues under informed donor consent and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval in accordance with U.S. regulations. Cellarity did not create any new cell lines for this publication.

Cryopreserved PHHs were selected for high viability (>95%), long-term plateability (10–15 days), compatibility with 96-well formats, and Grade A quality. Donor 1917277-01, a 37-year-old Caucasian female (BMI 26), was used. Hepatocytes were cultured in collagen I-coated 96-well plates and maintained in a sandwich configuration (collagen base with a 100 μg/mL Matrigel overlay) to preserve hepatocyte function. Cells were matured for three days with daily media changes before compound treatment. After 24 h of treatment, cells were either assayed for viability (LDH/ATP) or lysed for RNA extraction and sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S1A).

Human hepatocyte thawing media, human hepatocyte culture media, HHCM supplement, human hepatocyte plating media, HHPM supplement (LifeNet Health) and Pen/Strep (Gibco) were thawed and filtered before plating. PHHs were counted using a Luna-FL Cell Counter and Acridine Orange/Propidium Iodide Stain (Logo Bio). Cells were plated at a cell density of 0.5 million cells / mL in collagen I-coated 96-well plates (Gibco). Cells were left to attach in the incubator for 6 hours and then replaced with maintenance medium (LifeNet Health). The next day, cells were overlayed with a thin coat of Matrigel and left to incubate for an additional day with a daily media change to allow for full maturation of cells. On Day 3, cells were treated with compounds at multiple concentrations for 24 h and then were either taken down for either viability testing (LDH and ATP readouts) or lysed for RNA sequencing.

The objective of this experiment was to screen 300 compounds to create a hepatotoxicity intervention library for building a predictive DILI model. PHHs were first screened for maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in six-point log curves (0.01 μM to 1 mM, Figure. S1B). MTD was defined as the highest concentration before observing >10% cell death in the LDH assay. RNA sequencing was conducted on cells treated with compound concentrations ranging from Cmax to MTD to evaluate the safety margin between therapeutic and toxic doses.

All compounds were purchased from MedChemExpress (MCE). Compound preparation was performed in-house. Compound dissolution was prepared manually fresh on the day of compound treatment to avoid freeze/thaw cycles. In a previous DMSO tolerance test, 0.5% of DMSO in compound was dictated as the ideal concentration. Compound dissolution with DMSO started at a highest concentration of 1000 µM. If compounds were not solubilized at the 200x stock, dissolution was attempted at 100x and 50x concentrations. The compounds were added to a barcoded plate and transferred to the Hamilton MicroLab Star liquid handler for titration (Fig. S1B). The plate layout for titration varied between toxicity screens and RNA sequencing runs (Fig. S1C). Automation was used to prepare compound dilution and compound treatment.

As primary viability assay, we employed the non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay from Promega, which utilizes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a marker for cell death. For reagent preparation, we thawed LDH buffer at 4 °C overnight and used it to reconstitute the LDH substrate bottles by adding 12 mL, which were then stored at –20 °C. We utilized designated untreated cells to establish the 100% lysate positive control, against which we normalized all subsequently treated cells for % viability calculations. To these designated cell wells, we added 10x Lysis buffer in a 1:10 volume ratio. We then mixed 50 μL of the collected sample with 50 μL of LDH substrate in a flat-bottom tissue culture plate. Plates were covered by and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Following the incubation, we added 50 μL of thawed Stop solution and used a SpectraMax i3x plate reader with absorbance settings at 490 nm to read the plate.

Another orthogonal viability assay that was utilized for toxicity screening was CellTiter-Glo (CTG) Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) which determined the ATP content within the wells. The CTG viability assay is a terminal endpoint due to the lysis of cells. To prepare the reagent, the CTG buffer and substrate were thawed at room temperature and 10 mL of the buffer was resuspended in the substrate and stored at –20 °C freezer. CTG aliquots were thawed the day of the takedown, and DPBS (Gibco) was added to CTG substrate at a 1:1 ratio. Following the removal of the contents of the culture plate, 100 uL of CTG and PBS mix was added across all the wells of the plate. Following the lysis, plates were covered with aluminum foil and set on an orbital shaker for 2 min at 400 rpm. Following the 2 min, the plates remained covered and were left at room temperature for 10 minutes. The plates were then read on the SpectraMax i3x using the luminescence and Standard Opaque settings.

RLT buffer (Qiagen) and 2-mercaptoethanol (Thermofisher Scientific) were prepared to create a RLT + 1% BME reagent. 140 uL of lysis buffer was added across all wells of the plate using a multichannel pipette. After ensuring the cells were lysed under a microscope, the 140 uL of lysate was transferred to an Eppendorf twin.tec 96-well PCR plate (Fisher Scientific) and placed into a −80 °C freezer.

Total RNA was prepared from cell lysates in 96-well plates using a QIAcube HT robotic workstation (Qiagen) in conjunction with RNeasy 96 QIAcube HT kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. SMART-Seq DE3 libraries were prepared from total RNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, for each row of the plate, polyadenylated mRNA was selected using uniquely barcoded oligo(dT) primers. First strand cDNA was generated via reverse transcription; double-stranded cDNA was created via template switching with limited cycles of PCR amplification. Each row of samples was then pooled and subjected to transposon-based fragmentation using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). Libraries were then PCR amplified using unique combinations of Illumina P5 and P7 barcodes and mixed in equimolar pools prior to sequencing. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 using custom read lengths of 89 bp (Read1) and 26 bp (Read2).

Cmax values were compiled from multiple resources, and the median of these values was used to derive a consensus total Cmax. The following resources contributed to computing the consensus Cmax: Drug information from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), Porceddu et al. (2012), Khetani et al. (2013), Persson et al. (2013), Aleo et al. (2014), Garside et al. (2014), Gustafsson et al. (2014), Chen et al. (2014), Shah et al. (2015), Camenisch et al. (2019), Dixit et al. (2019), Aleo et al. (2020), Williams et al. (2020), and Smit et al. (2020). For compounds where no studies provided reliable Cmax estimates or where estimates varied significantly across studies, additional manual annotations were performed by searching PubChem and relevant clinical studies.

DILIrank and LiverTox serve as key resources for categorizing drugs as DILI positive or negative. DILIrank, developed by the FDA, classifies over 1000 drugs into four levels of DILI concern — most, less, no concern, and undetermined — based on historical liver injury data. LiverTox, created by the NIDDK, is an exhaustive online database with detailed information on these drugs, including their clinical manifestations, mechanisms of action and likelihood of causing DILI. It also offers a system to assess the likelihood of DILI, from well-known cases to idiosyncratic drugs without a characteristic signature to drugs considered safe. These categorizations serve as DILI endpoints for the development and refinement of our model. Compounds were systematically categorized based on DILIrank and LiverTox into the following categories:

Withdrawn DILI: Market withdrawals and clinical failures due to DILI (Most-DILI-Concern; e.g., Troglitazone).

Known DILI: Compounds with well-established DILI risk (Most-DILI-Concern in DILIrank or LiverTox score A; e.g., Isoniazid at therapeutic doses, Acetaminophen at overdose levels).

Likely DILI: Compounds with documented cases of DILI in specific contexts (Most-DILI-Concern or LiverTox score A/B; e.g., Progesterone).

Idiosyncratic DILI: Rare, unpredictable DILI without clear dose-response (LiverTox score C/D; <12 case reports).

Unlikely DILI: Discordantly labeled safe in LiverTox (score E) but Less-DILI-concern in DILIrank.

No DILI: Compounds with no clinical or preclinical documented evidence of DILI (No-DILI-Concern in DILIrank; LiverTox score E).

The categories Withdrawn DILI, Known DILI, and Likely DILI serve as positive controls and No DILI as negative control. Our models were trained to differentiate between positive and negative control compounds. The categories Unlikely DILI and Idiosyncratic DILI, due to their label ambiguity, were excluded from model training and reserved for downstream testing.

In the training data, DILI positives include the highest concentrations and those above 20x Cmax, while DILI negatives include the lowest concentrations and those below 80x Cmax. This approach ensures unambiguous labeling while minimizing bias from overdose signatures in negatives and inactive signatures in positives. Using these categorizations, our model was trained to distinguish between 177 positive and 93 negative control data points. An additional set of 70 compounds known for their idiosyncratic effects, each linked to fewer than 12 case reports, were exclusively used for testing. Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity, characterized by its unpredictability and lack of dose-response or temporal patterns, often leads to drug withdrawals despite thorough clinical testing. An independent in-house experiment was conducted for blind validation, comprising 46 compounds: 32 DILI positives and 14 negatives. This included well-established DILI positives/negatives and a real-world set with 4 recent clinical failures.

Human toxicogenomics benefits from resources such as TG-GATES, CMap and L1000. CMap and L1000 catalogue genomic responses in in vitro cell lines, primarily cancer lines, and can be used to study cytotoxicity, however, their utility for DILI is limited as our initial efforts showed poor predictive performance likely due to the lack of physiologically relevant cell types and relevant range of concentrations. In contrast, TG-GATES provides a rich microarray database tailored for DILI research, including data from primary human hepatocytes (PHH) exposed to 158 compounds. Our initial proof-of-concept, utilizing TG-GATES data, yielded meaningful predictions. In a rigorously designed in-house pilot experiment involving 46 compounds for blind validation, our model demonstrated a 62% sensitivity in accurately identifying DILI positives and an 92% specificity for negative control compounds, demonstrating the potential of toxicogenomics in identifying DILI risks during drug development.

We have created DILImap, our RNA-seq library encompassing 300 compounds, to improve the predictive power and mechanistic coverage of our ML model. We applied stringent quality control metrics and filtering criteria to retain only high-quality RNA-seq samples:

Total RNA counts > mean −2.5 standard deviations (~700,000 counts).

Mitochondrial RNA fraction <9%.

Correlation between replicates >0.99.

In addition to these technical filters, we performed a hepatocyte fidelity check: each sample was assessed for expression of liver-specific marker genes and the preservation of a hepatocyte-like transcriptional profile.

Samples passing all QC filters were used to compute compound-specific differential expression signatures. We used DESeq2, a standard RNA-seq analysis tool, which models read counts using a negative binomial distribution. DESeq2 adjusts for library size differences and estimates gene-specific dispersion, enabling accurate detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

For each compound-dose combination, we compared treated samples against matched DMSO controls from the same plate. This plate-specific normalization controls for potential batch effects and ensures that the derived signatures reflect treatment-specific transcriptional responses.

Pathway enrichment analysis is a statistical approach used to identify whether specific biological pathways are significantly enriched with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in RNA-seq data. The significance of this enrichment is assessed using p-values, which indicate the likelihood that the observed enrichment occurred by chance. In our analysis, we utilized the widely adopted hypergeometric test to compute p-values. This test calculates the probability of observing the number of DEGs in a given pathway, considering the total number of genes in the pathway and the overall number of DEGs in the dataset. To derive pathway signatures from p-values, we applied a -log10 transformation of the adjusted p-value, or False Discovery Rate (FDR). The FDR accounts for multiple testing, controlling the proportion of false positives in the analysis. The resulting -log10(FDR) scores serve as the input to our model, providing a robust representation of pathway enrichment.

To develop ToxPredictor, we evaluated a range of machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Hist Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, LGBM Classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Each model was evaluated using a 5-fold stratified compound-level cross-validation strategy, ensuring that all samples from a single compound were held out together in each fold to prevent data leakage. This compound-level splitting reflects a realistic generalization scenario for novel compound prediction.

We optimized hyperparameters using grid search, assessing performance across the following metrics:

Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC): Measures the overall ability to distinguish DILI from No-DILI compounds.

Precision: Fraction of predicted DILI compounds that are truly DILI-positive, relevant for minimizing false positives.

Recall: Fraction of true DILI compounds that are correctly identified, reflecting the model's ability to avoid false negatives.

Inter-fold correlation: Quantifies agreement in predicted probabilities between models trained on different splits.

Monotonic dose response: Assesses whether increasing doses of a compound correspond to increasing predicted DILI risk.

Model selection strategy

Generalizability: prioritize high validation AUC with low train–validation gap to avoid overfitting → Best models had AUC ≥ 0.74 (RF, HistGB, LGBM, XGB); RF showed the lowest gap (~0.09 vs. 0.16–0.20 for GBMs).

Stability: require high inter-fold correlation for consistent predictions across folds → RF achieved 0.98–1.0, higher than GBMs (0.8–0.9).

Clinical utility: balance precision (reduce false positives) and recall (reduce false negatives) → RF performance was comparable to other top models.

Interpretability: prefer simpler, easier-to-interpret models at similar performance → RF is more interpretable than boosting methods.

Final choice: Random Forest was selected as the most balanced and robust model, combining strong validation AUC, minimal overfitting, high stability, and interpretability. Although XGBoost and LightGBM reached similar AUCs, they showed greater overfitting (train-validation AUC gap) and lower stability (inter-fold correlation). These characteristics along with its ability to handle non-linear relationships, its robustness to noise, and its suitability for datasets of moderate size, make Random Forest the most robust choice for generalization to unseen compounds.

The optimal hyperparameters were:

n_estimators = 100, max_depth = 2, min_samples_split = 2, min_samples_leaf = 1

This combination of performance and robustness established Random Forest as the base model for ToxPredictor.

To ensure predictive robustness, we employed a 30-model Random Forest ensemble using bootstrap aggregation (bagging). Each model was trained on a unique bootstrap sample from the training data, ensuring diversity in training instances and mitigating overfitting. We selected 30 folds to strike a balance between accuracy and ensemble stability. In our benchmarks, ensembles with 30 independent learners consistently achieved smooth, reproducible predictions and stable dose-responses. All fold models used the hyperparameters optimized during cross-validation. At prediction time on unseen compounds, model outputs are averaged with equal weighting, producing a consensus decision that mitigated individual model variance, ensuring robust performance by combining the strengths of each base learner, leading to stable and reliable classification of DILI vs. No-DILI. In blind validation, where predictions were made on compounds not seen during training or model selection, the ensemble demonstrated high AUC, dose consistency, and biological plausibility, confirming its utility for real-world DILI risk assessment.

ToxPredictor outputs a predicted DILI probability, defined as the average prediction across the 30 Random Forest models in the ensemble. This probability reflects the model's confidence that a compound induces liver injury, based on its pathway perturbation profile. To enable binary classification for downstream evaluation and decision-making, we defined a DILI risk threshold of 0.7. Compound-dose pairs with predicted probabilities ≥0.7 are considered DILI-positive, while those <0.7 are considered DILI-negative. This threshold was empirically selected to maximize the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity in our benchmark datasets, ensuring robust identification of true DILI compounds while minimizing false positives.

ToxPredictor computes a Margin of Safety (MOS) for each compound, defined as the ratio between the first DILI dose and its maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at therapeutic levels. The first DILI dose is the lowest dose at which a compound crosses the 0.7 DILI probability threshold, indicating transcriptional evidence of hepatotoxicity. We use total Cmax values rather than free (unbound) Cmax, as both approaches yield comparable predictive performance, but total Cmax offers broader availability across clinical data sources and aligns with common reporting in literature.

For validation and benchmarking, to classify a compound as DILI, we selected a Margin of Safety (MOS) threshold of 80, determined empirically from the training set. This value reflects an optimized trade-off between sensitivity and specificity—minimizing false positives while reaching a performance plateau that captures the majority of true DILI liabilities. Importantly, this threshold is consistent with values commonly used in the literature, where MOS cutoffs typically range from 10 to 100 depending on context, placing our choice within accepted toxicological standards.

To identify and prioritize features and pathways relevant to DILI risk prediction, feature importance within the Random Forest ensemble was assessed using statistical significance, impurity reduction, permutation importance, and direct discriminative power, ensuring a comprehensive and biologically meaningful selection of key predictors of DILI risk:

Statistical Significance: Features were prioritized if they demonstrated at least one significant differential occurrence across compounds, with a p-value threshold of 0.001.

Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI): A standard metric for tree-based models that quantifies the reduction in impurity (e.g., Gini impurity) achieved by splits on specific features. The MDI values were averaged across all trees in the ensemble, providing a robust measure of a feature's overall predictive contribution. Features with higher MDI scores were deemed more important for the model's decision-making.

Permutation Importance: The values of each feature were shuffled individually, and the resulting change in model performance, specifically the Area Under the Curve (AUC), was measured. A greater reduction in AUC indicated a higher importance of the feature, offering additional insight into the features that most strongly influence the model's predictions.

Discriminative Power (AUC): Each feature's ability to distinguish between DILI and no-DILI categories was evaluated directly by calculating its individual AUC score, ensuring that features with strong discriminative capabilities were prioritized.

Spearman correlation: Correlation of pathway signatures with predicted DILI risk.

Empirical cumulative DILI likelihoods are calculated to inform dose recommendations that minimize the risk of DILI. For each compound, safety margins are computed at varying hypothetical Cmax values as the ratio of the model-predicted first DILI dose to the corresponding Cmax. For each safety margin, two cumulative percentages are derived: (1) the percentage of DILI compounds with safety margins above the given value, which increases monotonically from 0 to 1 as Cmax increases, and (2) the percentage of non-DILI compounds with safety margins below the same value, which decreases monotonically from 1 to 0. The empirical cumulative DILI likelihood at each safety margin is calculated as the difference between these two percentages, effectively representing the relative enrichment of DILI compounds compared to non-DILI compounds at or above a given margin. This approach captures the overall relationship between safety margins and DILI likelihood across the dataset, rather than focusing on isolated points, thereby enabling robust differentiation between high-risk and low-risk compounds. The resulting cumulative risk profiles provide a quantitative framework to guide dose selection.

We benchmarked ToxPredictor against three state-of-the-art structure-based models: DILIGeNN, a graph neural network trained on molecular graphs; DILIPredictor, a random forest ensemble model that integrates chemical structure, physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic parameters and predicted proxy-DILI data; and TxGemma, a generalist large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on biomedical tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). The evaluation aimed to assess the predictive performance of each approach on overlapping and unseen compounds using balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

A Random Forest model trained on nine proxy-DILI labels (e.g., mitochondrial toxicity, BSEP inhibition) in conjunction with chemical structural features derived from SMILES strings of 1111 DILI compounds. We reproduced the model from its public repository, converting the Poetry environment to Conda (via poetry2conda) and using scikit-learn v1.2.0 to match the pretrained model version. As compound names were not provided, we standardized SMILES and generated InChIKeys (non-isotopic, non-stereochemical layer) to identify 483 unseen compounds; 6 failed at inference, 6 more were deduplicated, resulting in 471 (98 DILI + , 373 DILI − ). This approach may still introduce limited data leakage if SMILES differ from those used during training. For benchmarking against other in-silico chemistry models, we focused on 314 compounds identified as unseen by both DILIGeNN and DILIPredictor, to provide a more conservative evaluation set that helps reduce the risk of data leakage; particularly important for DILIPredictor, which lacked compound identifiers and used a final model re-trained on the test set. For benchmarking against ToxPredicor, we took the overlap of the 471 compounds with DILImap yielding 30 compounds (23 DILI + , 7 DILI − ).

A graph neural network (GNN) trained on molecular graphs derived from SMILES strings of 1167 DILI compounds. We benchmarked the best-performing GraphSAGE models obtained after sequential warm starts, and used the recommended custom molecular graph representations of SMILES for each compound. To identify unseen compounds, we cross-referenced compound names, SMILES and InChIKeys (non-isotopic, non-stereochemical layer), and identified 349 unseen compounds; 18 failed inference, yielding a final evaluation set of 331 compounds (47 DILI + , 284 DILI-). Of these, 8 (5 DILI + , 3 DILI − ) overlapped with DILImap and were used for benchmarking. Final predictions were based on the mean probability and majority vote across four GraphSAGE models. In addition, we benchmarked DILIGeNN against DILIPredictor on 314 shared unseen compounds (45 DILI + , 269 DILI-) to evaluate real-world performance of in silico models across a broader evaluation set.

A suite of generalist large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned from Gemma-2 (2B, 9B, 27B parameters) on biomedical tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). For DILI classification, models were trained on 475 compounds (325 train, 54 validation, 96 test). To avoid data leakage, we used SMILES and InChIKeys to select 715 unseen compounds (178 DILI + , 537 DILI-); however, note that data leakage could not be fully ruled out. Of these, 97 compounds (69 DILI + , 35 DILI-) overlapped with DILImap and were used for benchmarking. TxGemma models were deployed on Google Cloud Vertex AI using the official cookbook (https://github.com/google-gemini/gemma-cookbook/tree/main/TxGemma) with recommended prompts. The 27B achieved the best performance and was used for comparison with ToxPredictor; AUROC was not computed due to the model only providing DILI label outputs rather than prediction probability outputs. Performance improvements may be possible with additional fine-tuning and prompt engineering.

The study used NumPy, pandas, and SciPy for computation, AnnData for single-cell data handling, scikit-learn = 1.4.0 for machine learning, and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization. Dask enabled scalable computing and quilt3 managed dataset access. DESeq2 supported differential expression and gseapy pathway enrichment. XGBoost and LightGBM were used for model comparison to select the optimal base model for ToxPredictor. Benchmarking against in-silico methods employed PyTorch Geometric for graph modeling, Captum for interpretability, and RDKit for cheminformatics.

Biophysical neuron models provide insights into cellular mechanisms underlying neural computations. A central challenge has been to identify parameters of detailed biophysical models such that they match physiological measurements or perform computational tasks. Here we describe a framework for simulating biophysical models in neuroscience—Jaxley—which addresses this challenge. By making use of automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration, Jaxley enables optimizing large-scale biophysical models with gradient descent. Jaxley can learn biophysical neuron models to match voltage or two-photon calcium recordings, sometimes orders of magnitude more efficiently than previous methods. Jaxley also makes it possible to train biophysical neuron models to perform computational tasks. We train a recurrent neural network to perform working memory tasks, and a network of morphologically detailed neurons with 100,000 parameters to solve a computer vision task. Jaxley improves the ability to build large-scale data- or task-constrained biophysical models, creating opportunities for investigating the mechanisms underlying neural computations across multiple scales.

Computational models are used to devise hypotheses about neural systems and to design experiments to investigate them. When building such models, a central question is how much detail they should include: Models of neural systems range from simple rate-based point neuron models to morphologically detailed biophysical neuron models. The latter provide fine-grained mechanistic explanations of cellular processes underlying neural activity, typically described as systems of ordinary differential equations1,2,3.

However, it has been highly challenging for neuroscientists to create biophysical models that can explain physiological measurements3,4,5 or that can perform computational tasks6,7. It is hardly ever possible to directly measure all relevant properties of the system with sufficient precision to constrain all parameters directly, necessitating the use of inference or fitting approaches to optimize free model parameters. However, finding the right parameters for even a single-neuron model with only a few parameters can be difficult5,8, and large-scale morphologically detailed biophysical network models may have thousands of free parameters governing the behavior of ion channels (for example, maximal conductance), synapses (for example, synaptic conductance or time constant) or neural morphologies (for example, radius or branch length).

Recently, in many domains of science such as particle physics, geoscience and quantum chemistry, differentiable, GPU-accelerated simulators have enabled parameter inference for even complicated models using automatic differentiation techniques9,10,11. Such differentiable simulators make it possible to train simulators with gradient descent methods from deep learning: Backpropagation of error (‘backprop') makes the computational cost of computing the gradient of the model with respect to the parameters independent of the number of parameters, making it possible to efficiently fit large models. In addition, GPU acceleration allows computing the gradient for many inputs (or model configurations) in parallel, which allows fitting simulations to large datasets.

Numerical solvers for biophysical models in neuroscience are used extensively, and several software packages exist, in particular the commonly used Neuron simulation environment12. Yet, none of these simulators allows performing backprop, and currently used simulation engines are primarily CPU-based, with GPU functionality only added post hoc13,14,15. As a consequence, state-of-the-art methods for parameter estimation in biophysical neuron models are based on gradient-free approaches such as genetic algorithms8,16 or simulation-based inference17, which do not scale to models with many parameters.

Inspired by the capabilities of deep learning to adjust millions (or even billions) of parameters given large datasets, we here propose to optimize biophysical parameters with gradient descent. To this end, we developed Jaxley, a toolbox for biophysical simulation which, unlike previous simulation toolboxes for biophysical models, can compute the gradient with backprop. In addition, Jaxley leverages GPU acceleration to speed up training. We apply Jaxley to a series of tasks, ranging from fitting physiological data (that is, match experimental recordings such as voltage or calcium measurements8,18) to solving computational tasks7,19 (Fig. 1a). We show that gradient descent can be orders of magnitude more efficient than gradient-free methods, and that it enables training biophysical networks with 100,000 parameters. This unlocks possibilities for data-driven and large-scale biophysical simulations in neuroscience.

Inset is a zoom-in view of the peak of the action potential. Scale bars, 3 ms and 30 mV. e, Left: time to run 10,000 simulations with Neuron on a CPU and with Jaxley on a GPU. Right: Simulation time (top) for the CA1 neuron shown in d and for a point neuron, as a function of the number of simulations.

Jaxley is a Python toolbox for simulation and training of biophysical neuron models. Jaxley implements numerical routines required for efficiently simulating biophysically detailed neural systems, so-called implicit Euler solvers, in the deep learning Python framework JAX20. The automatic differentiation capabilities of JAX enable Jaxley to use backprop to efficiently compute the gradient with respect to any biophysical parameter, including ion channel, synaptic or morphological parameters (Fig. 1b).

For computational speed, Jaxley implements differential equations such that networks, parameter sets or input stimuli can be processed in parallel on GPUs, providing speedups for datasets (via stimulus parallelization) or for parameter sweeps (via parameter parallelization)13,15. Jaxley further speeds up simulation and training with just-in-time compilation (Fig. 1c).

Training biophysical models with gradient descent leads to instabilities resulting from parameters having different scales, networks having a large computation graph21 and loss surfaces being non-convex. Jaxley implements methods that have been developed to overcome these specific issues in deep neural networks (Extended Data Fig. 1). For example, it implements parameter transformations, multilevel checkpointing22 and optimizers for non-convex loss surfaces (for example, Polyak gradient descent23). Furthermore, we designed Jaxley with a user-friendly interface, allowing neuroscientists to build biophysical models (for example, for inserting recordings, stimuli and channels into various branches or cells, or implementing different connectivity structures such as sparse or dense connectivity) and to use automatic differentiation and GPU parallelization. In a dedicated library open to the community, it also implements a growing set of ion channel and synapse models. Jaxley is fully written in Python, which will make it easy for the community to use and to add functionality to it. Jaxley is openly available at https://github.com/jaxleyverse/jaxley/.

We benchmarked the accuracy, speed and scalability of Jaxley for simulation of biophysical models. First, we evaluated the accuracy of Jaxley by creating biophysically detailed multicompartment models of a CA1 pyramidal cell in the rat hippocampus24,25 and of four layer 5 neurons in the mouse visual area from the Allen Cell Types Database26. Every model contained sodium, potassium and leak channels in all branches. We stimulated the soma and recorded the voltage at three locations across the dendritic tree. Jaxley matched the voltages of the Neuron simulator at sub-millisecond and sub-millivolt resolution (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2).

Next, we evaluated the simulation speed of Jaxley on CPUs and GPUs. We simulated the above-described CA1 cell and a single-compartment model for 20 ms. On a GPU, Jaxley was much faster for large systems or many parallel simulations, with a speedup of around two orders of magnitude (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 1). For single-compartment neurons, Jaxley could parallelize the simulation of up to 1 million neurons, thereby allowing fast parameter sweeps. On a CPU, Jaxley was at least as fast as Neuron.

We then evaluated the computational cost of computing the gradient with Jaxley. For backpropagation, the forward pass must be stored in-memory, which can easily correspond to terabytes of data for large neural systems. To overcome this, Jaxley implements multilevel checkpointing22, which reduces memory usage by strategically saving and recomputing intermediate states of the system of differential equations. We found that depending on the simulation device (CPU/GPU/TPU), the number of simulations, the simulated time and the loss function, computing the gradient was between 3 and 20 times more expensive than running the simulation itself (Fig. 1e).

Finally, we show that in addition to parallelizing across parameters (or across stimuli), Jaxley can parallelize across branches or compartments in a network. We built a network consisting of 2,000 morphologically detailed neurons with Hodgkin–Huxley dynamics, connected by 1 million biophysical synapses (3.92 million differential equation states in total; Fig. 1f). On a single A100 GPU, Jaxley computed 200 ms (that is, 8,000 steps at Δt = 0.025 ms) of simulated time in 21 s. We then used backprop to compute the gradient with respect to all membrane and synaptic conductances in this network (3.2 million parameters in total), which took 144 s. Estimating the gradient with finite differences—as would be required for packages that do not support backprop—would take more than 2 years (3.2 million forward passes, 21 s each). With simplified morphologies, Jaxley can scale backprop to networks with many millions of synapses on a single GPU (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Having demonstrated the accuracy and speed of Jaxley, we applied it to a series of tasks that demonstrate how Jaxley opens up opportunities for building task-driven or data-driven biophysically detailed neuroscience models in a range of scenarios. As a first proof-of-principle, we applied Jaxley to fit single-neuron models with few parameters. We built a biophysical neuron model based on a reconstruction of a layer 5 pyramidal cell (L5PC) (Fig. 2a). The model had nine different channels in the apical and basal dendrites, the soma and the axon16, with a total of 19 free parameters. We learned these parameters from a synthetic somatic voltage recording given a somatic step-current stimulus with a known set of ground-truth parameters (Fig. 2b).

We used gradient descent to identify parameter sets that minimize the mean absolute error to summary statistics of the voltage trace. Because gradient descent requires differentiable summary statistics, but commonly used summary statistics of intracellular recordings—such as spike count—can be discrete or non-differentiable, we used the mean and standard deviation of the voltage in two time windows17. Starting from randomly initialized parameters, gradient descent required only nine steps (median across ten runs) to find models whose voltage traces are visually similar to the observation (Fig. 2b). A state-of-the-art indicator-based genetic algorithm (IBEA)16 required similarly many iterations, although each iteration of the genetic algorithm used ten simulations. As a consequence, gradient descent required almost ten times fewer simulations than the genetic algorithm, and, despite the additional cost of backpropagation, found good parameter sets in less runtime than the genetic algorithm on a CPU (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4a).

We then used gradient descent to identify parameters that match patch-clamp recordings of four cells from the Allen Cell Types Database26. We inserted the same set of ion channels, but, to account for the diversity and complexity of the experimental recordings, we made six additional parameters trainable and used a loss function based on dynamic time warping (DTW). To lower the fitting time caused by the length of the recordings (1 s versus 100 ms in the synthetic experiments), we initially fitted only the first 200 ms of these traces and then added an additional step to fit the entire trace.

We first used gradient descent with a low computational budget (ten runs with ten iterations each; loss in Extended Data Fig. 4b) and found that the resulting traces roughly matched the firing rate of experimental recordings, but did not yet match other features such as spike frequency adaptation (Extended Data Fig. 5). To improve the fits, we used the ability of Jaxley to parallelize several fitting runs. We parallelized 1,000 gradient descent runs on a GPU and found parameter sets whose voltage traces closely resembled experimental recordings (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 5). Using Jaxley, we also parallelized a genetic algorithm on a GPU and found that the resulting fits were of similar quality (Extended Data Fig. 5). Overall, these results demonstrate the ability of gradient descent to fit biophysical models to intracellular recordings, being competitive with state-of-the-art genetic algorithms even on tasks for which those have been extensively optimized.

How does gradient descent scale to models with large numbers of parameters? We demonstrate here that, in contrast to genetic algorithms, gradient descent can optimize a single-neuron model with 1,390 parameters.

We used the above-described model of an L5PC. Unlike in the above experiments, we fit the maximal conductance of ion channels in every branch in the morphology, thereby allowing us to model effects of nonuniform conductance profiles27. This increased the number of free parameters to 1,390. To generate a synthetic recording, we assigned a different maximal conductance to each branch (sampled from a Gaussian process), depending on the distance from the soma (Fig. 2e). We recorded the voltage at every branch of the model in response to a 5-ms step-current input (Fig. 2f). Experimentally, such data could be obtained, for example, through voltage imaging.

We used gradient descent to identify parameters that match this recording, with a regularizer that penalizes the difference between parameter values in neighboring branches27. Despite the large number of parameters, gradient descent found a parameter set whose voltage response closely matched the observed voltage throughout the dendritic tree (Fig. 2g). To understand how much the whole-cell voltage recording constrains the parameters, we used Bayesian inference (implemented with gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) to infer an ensemble of parameter sets all of which match the observed voltage (Extended Data Fig. 6). The resulting ensemble revealed regions along the dendritic tree at which the conductance profile was strongly constrained by the data (for example, the transient sodium channel, Fig. 2h, around 400 μm), but it also revealed conductance profiles that were only weakly constrained by the data (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 6)2. Finally, we compared our method with an indicator-based genetic algorithm8 and, as expected, we found that access to gradients leads to better convergence: While gradient descent converged to values of low loss within 100 iterations, the genetic algorithm had two orders of magnitude higher loss even after 500 iterations (Fig. 2i).

Next, we trained a single-neuron model to solve a nonlinear pattern separation task on its dendritic tree. While it has been demonstrated extensively that single-neuron models respond nonlinearly to inputs28, it has so far been difficult to train biophysically detailed neurons on a particular task. Here, we show that stochastic gradient descent enables training single-neuron models with dendritic nonlinearities to perform nonlinear computations.

We defined a simple morphology consisting of a soma and two dendrites, and inserted sodium, potassium and leak channels into all neurites of the cell. We then learned ion channel densities as well as length, radius and axial resistivity of every compartment (72 parameters in total) for the neuron to have low somatic voltage (−70 mV), when both dendrites were stimulated with step currents of intermediate strength, and high somatic voltage (35 mV) when one of the dendrites was stimulated strongly and the other one weakly (Fig. 2j). Therefore, the two classes were not linearly separable, requiring the neuron to perform a nonlinear computation.

After training the parameters with gradient descent, we found that the cell indeed learned to perform this task and spiked only when one dendrite was stimulated strongly (Fig. 2k), effectively having a nonlinear decision surface (Fig. 2l). We again compared gradient descent to an indicator-based genetic algorithm and found that gradient descent finds regions of lower loss more quickly than genetic algorithms (Fig. 2m).

Overall, these results show that gradient descent performs better than gradient-free methods in models with many parameters, opening up possibilities for studying at scale biophysical mechanisms throughout the full neuronal morphology.

So far, we have learned parameters of single-neuron models using small datasets consisting of few stimulus–response pairs. Many models of neural systems, however, consist of multiple neurons, and datasets can contain thousands of stimulus–response pairs7,29,30. Using a network model of the mouse retina, we demonstrate that Jaxley can simultaneously infer cell-level and network-level parameters, such that model simulations match large-scale datasets.

We consider transient Off alpha retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the mouse retina, which show compartmentalized calcium signals in their dendrites in response to visual stimulation18. To understand the mechanistic underpinning of this behavior, we built a hybrid model with statistical and mechanistic components: We modeled photoreceptors as a convolution with a Gaussian filter, bipolar cells as point neurons with a nonlinearity and an RGC as a morphologically detailed biophysical neuron, with six different ion channels distributed across its soma and dendritic tree (Fig. 3a). To model the fluorescence signal of the calcium indicator, we convolved the intracellular calcium (from the calcium channel of the model) with a calcium kernel (Fig. 3b).

Using Jaxley, we trained the hybrid model to predict dendritic calcium on 15,000 pairs of checkerboard noise stimuli and calcium recordings. We learned synaptic conductances from the bipolar cells onto the RGC (287 synaptic parameters), as well as cellular RGC parameters (320 cell parameters). After training, we evaluated the trained model on a held-out test dataset. The model had a positive Pearson correlation coefficient with the experimental recording on 146 of 147 recording sites, with an average correlation of 0.25, and a maximum of 0.51 (Fig. 3c).

Next, we tested whether the trained model also reproduced the compartmentalized structure of calcium responses, which has been experimentally measured18. We stimulated the model at a distal branch and recorded the model calcium response across all branches of the cell. We found that the calcium signal in response to local stimulation did not propagate through the entire cell (Fig. 3d). In addition, the model receptive fields did not cover the entire cell and were roughly centered around the recording locations (Fig. 3e). This demonstrated a compartmentalized response of the model and qualitatively matched the receptive fields obtained from experimental measurements18.

The mechanistic components of the model, including the anatomical structure, provide an inductive bias. Therefore, we investigated whether this inductive bias of the hybrid model could lead to better generalization to new data, especially when training data are scarce. We trained a linear model, a two-layer perceptron and the hybrid model on reduced datasets of recordings and compared their performance on a held-out test set (Fig. 3f). While the linear model and the perceptron performed better than the hybrid model on training data, the hybrid model performed better on held-out test data, when little training data were available. These results indicate that the inductive bias brought by the hybrid model effectively can limit the amount of overfitting in the model, suggesting that hybrid components could be used as regularizers for deep neural network models of neural systems31.

Our results demonstrate that gradient descent enables fitting networks of biophysical neurons to large calcium datasets and allows simultaneous learning of cell-level and network-level parameters.

To understand how computations are implemented in neural circuits, computational neuroscientists aim to train models to perform tasks7,19. In particular, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used to form hypotheses about population dynamics underlying cognition. Typically, such RNNs consist of point neurons with rate-based or simplified spiking dynamics, which prevents studying the contribution of channel dynamics or cellular processes. We here show how Jaxley makes it possible to train biophysical models of neuronal networks to perform such tasks.

We implemented in Jaxley an RNN consisting of Hodgkin–Huxley-type neurons with a simplified apical and basal dendrite, with each neuron equipped with a variety of voltage-gated ion channels4. We sparsely connected the recurrent network with conductance-based synapses and obtained the outputs from passive readout units (Fig. 4a).

Two stimuli separated by a delay (for two of four input patterns), raster plots of the trained network activity, and readout neuron prediction.

We first investigated the dynamics in this biophysical RNN before training. As with rate-based RNNs, these dynamics were strongly dependent on a global scaling factor (called ‘gain') of all recurrent synaptic maximal conductances32. Our RNN transitioned from a stable to a chaotic regime when the gain was increased, with an intermediate region, where networks displayed regular firing (Fig. 4b). The ability of Jaxley to perform automatic differentiation allowed us to quantify the stability of networks by numerically computing Lyapunov exponents33 (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 2).

We then trained the biophysical RNN to perform two working memory tasks, starting with a perceptual decision-making task requiring evidence integration over time34. We built a network of 20 recurrent neurons and stimulated each recurrent neuron with a noisy time series with either positive or negative mean value (Fig. 4d). We trained input weights, recurrent weights and readout weights (109 parameters) such that the network learned to differentiate between positive and negative stimuli during a response period after 500 ms. Despite the long time horizon of this task (500 ms, corresponding to 20,000 time steps of the simulation), gradient descent found parameters such that the RNN was able to perform the task (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 3), with the voltage in the readout neurons differentiating the input means with 99.9% accuracy across 1,000 trials. To solve this evidence integration task, some input, recurrent and output weights were pushed toward zero and the remaining weights were pushed toward their positive and negative constraints during training (Fig. 4e).

We also evaluated the generalization abilities of the trained biophysical RNN. We varied the mean value of the positive and negative stimuli and found that the relationship between average response and stimulus mean closely resembled the well-known sigmoidal psychometric curve of decision-making, where the network more often failed when the stimulus had a lower signal-to-noise ratio (Fig. 4f). In addition, the trained RNN generalized to evidence integration tasks of longer durations (Extended Data Fig. 7).

We next used the RNN to solve a more challenging working memory task, a delayed-match-to-sample task, where the RNN had to maintain information over an extended period of time19,35. We trained the RNN to classify patterns, consisting of two step-current inputs with a delay between them, into matching (same identity of the inputs) or non-matching (different identity of the inputs; Fig. 4g). We used curriculum learning to solve this task. By training input, recurrent and readout weights, as well as synaptic time constants of a network with 50 recurrent neurons (542 parameters), we found parameter sets that solved the task and correctly classified all four patterns (Fig. 4g). We then inspected the population dynamics of the trained biophysical RNN and found that the network used a form of transient coding to solve the task (Extended Data Fig. 8).

Overall, these results demonstrate that gradient descent allows training RNNs with biophysical detail to solve working memory tasks. This will allow a more quantitative investigation of the role of cellular mechanisms contributing to behavioral and cognitive computations.

Finally, we show that gradient descent enables training of large biophysical models with thousands of cellular-level and network-level parameters on machine learning-scale datasets to solve classical computer vision tasks such as image recognition.

We implemented a feedforward biophysical network model in Jaxley and trained it to solve the classical MNIST task, without artificial nonlinearities such as ReLU activations. The network had three layers: The input and output layers consisted of neurons with ball-and-stick morphologies and the hidden layer consisted of 64 morphologically detailed models obtained from reconstructions of CA1 cells (Fig. 5a)15,24. The network was interconnected by biophysical synapses. We trained sodium, potassium and leak conductances of every branch in the circuit (55,000 parameters), as well as all synaptic weights (51,000 parameters).

Biophys., biophysical.

We simulated the network for 10 ms, as this was the time it took for the stimulus to propagate through the network. After training with stochastic gradient descent, upon being stimulated with a ‘0' digit, the softmax of the voltages of the output neurons indicated a high probability for the digit ‘0' (Fig. 5b). The network achieved an accuracy of 94.2% on a held-out test dataset, which is higher than a linear classifier, demonstrating that the biophysical network used its nonlinearities to improve classification performance. The biophysical network, however, performed slightly worse than a multilayer perceptron with ReLU nonlinearities, suggesting either that the spike/no-spike nonlinearities are more difficult to train than ReLU nonlinearities, or that the (binary) spike/no-spike representations lead to lower bandwidth than graded ReLU activations (Fig. 5c). After training, the biophysical network also developed interpretable hidden-layer tuning (Extended Data Fig. 9).

How do the learned parameters of the biophysical network contribute to its ability to classify MNIST digits? Surprisingly, we found that the ranges of the trained synaptic parameters were roughly similar to the ranges of the untrained network and that the membrane channel conductances were roughly centered around their initial value (Fig. 5d). This does not mean that the learned values of these parameters do not contribute to the learned network dynamics: While the ranges of parameters did not change substantially, individual parameters could vary largely (Extended Data Fig. 10). Furthermore, resetting subsets of parameters to their initial value reduced classification performance, sometimes to chance-level accuracy (10%; Fig. 5e). This indicates that biophysical simulations built purely from the aggregate statistics of measured parameter values could not be sufficient for the models to develop the ability to perform tasks4.

Finally, efficient access to gradients not only allows training biophysical models to match physiological data or perform a task, but also opens up possibilities to perform new kinds of analyses, such as evaluating adversarial robustness. We stimulated the biophysical network with an image showing a ‘6', and then altered minimally the image with gradient descent such that the network would classify it as a ‘4' (Fig. 5f). While the biophysical network classified the initial image as a ‘6' with high confidence, the perturbed image was classified as a ‘4'. We compared the adversarial robustness of the biophysical network to a trained multilayer perceptron. We found that the two networks are similarly vulnerable to adversarial attacks (Fig. 5g), in contrast to previous studies suggesting that biophysical networks could largely improve adversarial robustness15.

Overall, these results demonstrate that the ability of Jaxley to perform backprop in biophysical models can be used to train large-scale networks at full biophysical detail. In particular, backprop overcomes virtually any computational limit on the number of parameters of biophysical networks that can be included in the optimization.

Backprop and computational frameworks that provide efficient, scalable and easy-to-use implementations have been key to advances in deep learning. They have made it possible to efficiently optimize even very big systems with gradient descent. However, for biophysical neuron models, currently used tools12,36,37,38 cannot perform automatic differentiation (comparison to other toolboxes in Supplementary Note 1). We here presented Jaxley, a computational framework for differentiable simulation of neuroscience models with biophysical detail. Jaxley can perform automatic differentiation through its differential equation solver, thereby enabling backprop to compute the gradient with respect to virtually any biophysical parameter.

We expect that Jaxley will enable a range of new investigations in neuroscience: First, it will make it possible to efficiently optimize detailed single-cell models. This will allow insights into cellular properties across cell types and their relationship with, for example, transcriptomic measurements39,40,41, as well as into the contribution of dendritic processing to neural computations28.

Second, it will facilitate creating large-scale biophysical network models. Such network models4 have so far primarily been built in a bottom-up fashion. Jaxley opens up possibilities to train thousands of parameters with gradient descent, allowing the tuning of large biophysical networks as a whole.

Third, in addition to training such models, Jaxley will also enable numerous other applications, such as gradient-based Bayesian inference, the analysis of stability via Lyapunov exponents, adversarial attacks, the computation of maximally excitable stimuli or the design of optimally discriminative experiments.

A central challenge in training biophysical models to perform computational tasks will be to bridge the timescales between biophysical mechanisms (milliseconds) and behavior (seconds). We showed that it is possible to fit data of up to 1 s in length, but optimizing models on tasks that require backpropagating gradients along even longer simulations is challenging. In addition, the loss landscape of biophysical models can be highly non-convex, which could trap optimization in local minima42. Gradient descent also requires the definition of a single loss function to be optimized, which can cause challenges when different tasks or features of experimental data are captured best by different parameter sets43. To investigate how gradient-based optimization could accommodate such scenarios, we have designed Jaxley such that it can be combined with any scheme for updating parameters. For example, for some tasks and training paradigms, forward mode automatic differentiation44 or evolutionary algorithms16,21 have been reported to perform similarly to (or sometimes even better than) backprop. Jaxley directly supports GPU-accelerated implementations of either of these algorithms, opening up possibilities to develop new methods for training of biophysical neural systems. By building upon the framework JAX20, Jaxley will further benefit from advances in the deep learning community at scaling and training large simulations. Finally, as the parameter space grows, there will typically be a wide range of solutions that match experimental recordings, and a single ‘best' fit might not be representative of the full solution space in the presence of parameter degeneracy2. To address such situations, Jaxley could be combined with methods that aim to identify the full space of data-compatible models, such as Bayesian inference17, or its parallelization capabilities could be exploited for parameter scans2.

New experimental tools allow scientists to measure connectivity, morphology, genetic identity and activity of neural circuits at increasing levels of detail and scale. Jaxley is a powerful tool that can integrate measurements of connectivity and morphology into biophysical simulations, while allowing the resulting networks to be fitted to data or computational tasks—just like deep neural networks. This will enable investigations of the biophysical basis of neural computation at unprecedented scales.

We used an implicit Euler solver for the voltage equations, and an exponential Euler solver for the gates (Supplementary Note 2). We simulated voltage at internal nodes and, similar to Neuron, also simulated terminal nodes at branch points. To solve the tridiagonal system of equations of every branch, we used the algorithm presented by Stone45.

We used the following tools to improve training accuracy and robustness. First, we used parameter transformations that ensure that optimization of bounded parameters can be performed in unconstrained space and that biophysical parameters are on the same scale. In particular, we used an inverse sigmoid transformation \(T(\theta )=-\log (\frac{1}{(\theta -l)/(u-l)}-1)\), where l is the lower bound and u is the upper bound. Second, we used a variant of Polyak stochastic gradient descent23, which computes the step as \({\rm{step}}=\gamma \frac{\nabla {\mathcal{L}}}{| | \nabla {\mathcal{L}}| {| }^{\beta }}\). This optimizer overcomes large variations of the gradient between steps. We used values of β ∈ [0.8, 0.99]. In some applications, we further multiplied the gradient with the loss value \({\mathcal{L}}\) (ref. 23), such that the optimizer automatically reduced the learning rate toward the end of training. Third, when necessary, we used different optimizers for different types of parameters. This affects the Polyak gradient descent optimizer because it normalizes by the gradient norm. Fourth, we performed multilevel checkpointing to reduce the memory requirements of backpropagation through time. Fifth, when we observed vanishing or exploding gradients, we performed truncated backpropagation through time. We used this only for the hybrid mechanistic/statistical model of the retina. When performed, we interrupted gradient computation every 50 ms. All of these tools are implemented in Jaxley. We provide an overview of training schemes for all examples in Supplementary Note 3.

Jaxley can be combined with any parameter optimization or learning method. The ability to evaluate the gradient with backprop opens possibilities for training biophysical systems with gradient descent or with gradient-based reinforcement learning methods, but Jaxley can also be efficiently combined with gradient-free parameter optimization methods (for example, genetic algorithms, Bayesian optimization, gradient-free reinforcement learning approaches or biologically plausible learning rules such as Hebbian learning). In these cases, Jaxley can parallelize forward simulations whose output can inform the gradient-free update rule.

We used two types of sodium, five types of potassium, two types of calcium and a hyperpolarization-activated channel and inserted them in soma, basal and apical dendrites, and axon, following Van Geit et al.16.

We optimized 19 parameters. These were the same parameters as used by Van Geit et al.16, but our model did not contain a persistent sodium channel in the axon. We used the same parameter search bounds as Van Geit et al.16 for fitting the L5PC to synthetic data (Fig. 2b), but we enforced that somatic potassium existed (lower bound 0.25 S cm−2). For the experimental recordings from the Allen Cell Types Database, we used slightly larger bounds for three of the parameters to increase the flexibility of the model: We used bounds of [0, 6] S cm−2 (instead of [0, 4] S cm−2) for somatic and axonal sodium channels and a lower bound of 1 ms for the delay of the calcium buffer (instead of 20 ms). In addition, we made the following six parameters trainable: To account for the fact that channel models were built upon measurements from other cells, we allowed a fivefold variation of the time constant of the high-voltage-activated and low-voltage-activated calcium channels and the M channel, and we introduced a parameter that can shift the activation curve of the somatic sodium channel by up to 10 mV to the left. In addition, to account for ion channels typically being selective to more than a single ion, we allowed the potassium reversal potential to vary within [−100, −70] mV and the sodium reversal potential to vary within [40, 60] mV. To fit recordings from the Allen Cell Types Database (IDs 485574832, 488683425, 480353286 and 473601979), we modified the leak conductance to 10−4 for all cells, the leak reversal potential to −88, −88, −95 and −95 mV and capacitance to 6, 2, 6 and 2.5 μF cm−2, respectively.

Optimizing parameters of biophysical models with gradient descent requires that the loss function, and therefore also the summary statistics, are differentiable. This is not the case for typically used features such as spike count, which led us to defining different loss functions.

For the synthetic data (Fig. 2b), we split the voltage trace into two windows and used the mean and standard deviation of these two windows as summary statistics. This led to a total of four summary statistics. To standardize the data, we divided the mean voltages by 8.0 and standard deviations by 4.0. We used a mean absolute error loss on the standardized summary statistics.

To fit data from the Allen Cell Types Database, we used AllenSDK to download morphologies and electrophysiology. We used a loss function based on DTW. Unlike the standard Euclidean (pointwise) distance, which can overly penalize minor temporal misalignment of fast events such as action potentials, DTW actively aligns the two signals in time before measuring their pointwise differences. This alignment emphasizes the geometric similarity between time series rather than strict temporal correspondence, which we found to work well for fitting spiking voltage traces. Because the standard DTW discrepancy is not fully differentiable, we use the soft DTW discrepancy46. For efficient computation on GPUs, we use a custom implementation of soft DTW discrepancy in JAX. We preprocessed the raw voltage traces by applying a sliding window maximum reduction with a window size of 50 time steps and a stride of 30 time steps (each time step is 0.025 ms). We rescaled both the observations and simulations to the unit interval using the same scaling factors. We used the cost function c(xi, yi) = ∣xi − yi∣ + ∣i − j∣, where i and j are time points and x and y are voltage traces.

For the synthetic data, we used our variant of Polyak gradient descent with γ = 1/3 and β = 0.8. We trained for ten optimization steps. We also ran the genetic algorithm (IBEA-DEAP as implemented in the BluePyOpt package, version 1.14.11)16 for ten iterations, with ten simulations per iteration.

For models based on the Allen Cell Types Database, we fitted the first 200 ms of the trace with a loss based on dynamic time warping (see above) and Polyak gradient descent with γ = 5 × 10−4 and β = 0.99. For the fits with large computational budget (Fig. 2d), we parallelized 1,000 gradient descent runs on a GPU and trained for 50 steps. After training, we simulated the final 1,000 parameter sets for 1,150 ms and selected the best parameter set as the one minimizing the error across the following five features: overall spike count, and spike amplitude and spike timing of the first two spikes (spike amplitude was multiplied with a weight of 1/3 for computing the total error). We followed the same procedure for the genetic algorithm (first fit 200 ms with dynamic time warping and then selected the best set from the final population). We ran the genetic algorithm with 1,000 offspring (which we also parallelized on GPU) for 50 generations. For the fits with reduced computational budget (Extended Data Fig. 5), we followed the same procedure and used the same hyperparameters, but we used only ten gradient descent runs and trained only for ten steps.

We used the same ion channels as for the task of fitting electrophysiology traces. To generate the observation, we sampled from a Gaussian process the conductance profiles as a function of the Euclidean distance from the soma. We did this for the maximal conductances of all active ion channels in the apical dendrite (three active mechanisms) and the axon (seven active mechanisms).

For the active mechanisms in the apical dendrite and the axon, we defined one parameter per branch in the cell and initialized parameters randomly and independently from each other. We used a single parameter for each mechanism in the soma and basal dendrite. This resulted in a total of 1,390 parameters. Parameters had the same lower and upper bounds as for the L5PC described above.

We used a mean absolute error loss function between the observed voltages and the simulated voltages, evaluated at every fifth time step between 1 ms and 5 ms of simulation time. We used our custom optimizer with β = 0.8, momentum of 0.9 and learning rate of 0.1. We trained the system for 500 iterations. We regularized the optimization such that neighboring branches had similar conductance values. In particular, we added to the loss the term \(\lambda \cdot \mathop{\sum }\nolimits_{b = 1}^{{\rm{branches}}}{({\overline{g}}_{b}-{\rm{parent}}({\overline{g}}_{b}))}^{2}\), with regularization strength λ = 0.001.

To perform Bayesian inference over the parameters, we used a uniform prior over the free parameters with equivalent bounds as with the original training procedure. We also incorporated the same regularizer into the prior distribution.

We sampled from the posterior distribution with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which leverages the available gradient to efficiently sample from high-dimensional distributions. We initialized 200 chains with samples from the prior distribution. Each chain was run for 500 iterations in parallel on a single NVIDIA GeForce A100 GPU. For each iteration, we performed five integration steps for the Hamiltonian dynamics with a step size of 0.01, leading to an average acceptance rate of ≈65%. The last sample of each chain was used as a posterior sample. We used the BlackJAX47 implementation of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

To visualize the learned conductance profile, we discretized distance from soma into 11 bins and grouped all parameters within each bin. We then calculated histograms for each of the bins and generated a spline interpolation of all quantile lines (Fig. 2h).

The model contained sodium, potassium and leak channels in all branches, with dynamics following the default implementation of the Neuron package12.

We trained sodium, potassium, and leak maximal conductances, as well as radius, length, and axial resistivity of every compartment in the model. Parameters were initialized randomly within uniform bounds. The bounds were [0.05, 1.1] for sodium, [0.01, 0.3] for potassium and [0.0001, 0.001] for leak, all in S cm−2. The bounds for the radius were [0.1, 5.0] μm, [1, 20] μm per compartment for the length and [500, 5,500] Ωcm for the axial resistivity.

We used a mean absolute error loss function between the simulated voltages after 3 ms of simulated time and the class label (35 mV or −70 mV). We used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01, and a batch size of 1. We trained the system for 200 epochs. One iteration of gradient descent took 1.7 ms on an Apple MacBook Pro CPU.

Ran et al.18 presented images of 15 × 20 pixels to a mouse retina. Each pixel had a size of 30 × 30 μm. Each image was presented for 200 ms, and a total of 1,500 images were presented. The images were centered on recording fields of the calcium activity. We used the first 1,024 images of these as the training dataset. In total, 15 recording fields were made for the Off alpha cell used in our work, leading to a total of 1,024 × 15 training data points. Within each recording field, Ran et al.18 defined a variable number of regions of interest, within which the calcium activity was recorded. In total, the data contained 232 regions of interest.

To denoise the calcium data, we low-pass filtered the raw calcium data with a Butterworth filter and a cutoff frequency of 7 Hz. We z-scored the resulting signal, with a different mean and standard deviation for each region of interest. Next, we generated a single label for each image. We did this by performing a linear regression from the image onto delayed calcium signals, and then used the calcium value at the delay, which was most predictive (that is, had the highest Pearson correlation between the linear regression prediction and data). This led us to a delay of 1.8 s. As the label, we used the low-pass filtered calcium value after this delay (starting from image onset). We followed Ran et al.18 to compute receptive fields. We used automatic smoothness detection48 with 20 iterations of evidence optimization. We standardized all receptive fields to range from 0 to 1 and, for contours, thresholded the receptive fields at a value of 0.6.

We modeled photoreceptors as a spatial linear Gaussian filter. The filter had a standard deviation of 50 μm. We modeled bipolar cells as point neurons with a nonlinearity. The point neurons were spaced on a hexagonal grid with a distance between neurons of 40 μm. The nonlinearity was taken from values measured by Schwartz et al.29. We connected every bipolar cell onto every branch of the RGC that was within 20 μm of the bipolar cell. Within every branch of the RGC, the synapse was made to the compartment that had the minimal Euclidean distance to the bipolar cell.

We computed the calcium activity of the model as the intracellular calcium value of the compartment that was the closest to the experimental recording site. We convolved this value with a double-exponential kernel to model dynamics of the calcium indicator. We used a rise time of 5 ms and decay time of 100 ms.

Our model of the RGC contained six ion channels, which were developed based on measurements from the RGCs in cats49. The channels were a sodium channel, a leak channel, a delayed-rectifier potassium channel, a transient potassium channel, a calcium-dependent potassium channel and a calcium channel. The model had all of these channels in every compartment of the model.

We initialized all membrane conductances at previously published values49, except for sodium conductances, which we initialized at 0.15 S cm−2 in the soma and 0.05 S cm−2 in the dendrite. We sampled the initial synaptic strengths randomly within 0 and 0.1 nS, and then divided the synaptic conductance by the number of postsynaptic connections that a bipolar cell makes (such that, in expectation, every bipolar cell has the same impact on the RGC). We initialized the axial resistivity of every compartment at 5,000 Ωcm. Finally, we initialized the radius of every dendritic compartment at 0.2 μm. We kept the diameter of the soma constant at 10 μm.

We trained the following set of parameters: One value for each maximal conductance in the soma (six parameters), one value for each maximal conductance in the dendrites, shared across all dendrites (six parameters), one value for each branch radius (147 parameters), one value for the axial resistivity of each branch (147 parameters) and one value for each synaptic conductance from the bipolar cells onto the RGCs (250 parameters). In total, the model had 556 parameters.

We used the following bounds for optimization: For somatic conductances, we used [0.05, 0.5] for sodium, [0.01, 0.1] for potassium, [10−5, 10−3] for leak, [0.01, 0.1] for transient potassium, [2 × 10−5, 2 × 10−4] for calcium-dependent potassium and [0.002, 0.003] for calcium. All membrane conductance units are S cm−2. For dendritic conductances, we used the same bounds apart from the lower bound of 0 for sodium. For the branch radii, we used bounds of [0.1, 1.0] μm (ref. 18). For the axial resistivities, we used [100, 10,000] Ωcm. For the synaptic conductances, we used [0.0, 0.2] nS.

We trained the model with Polyak stochastic gradient descent with momentum. We considered every kind of parameter (somatic conductance, dendritic conductance, radii, axial resistivities and synaptic conductances) as separate parameters (which influences the computation of the gradient norm in Polyak stochastic gradient descent). We trained the model for ten epochs with a learning rate of 0.01 and a momentum of 0.5. We used β = 0.99 to compute the norm in Polyak stochastic gradient descent. We used a batch size of 256 and used two-level checkpointing to reduce the memory of backpropagation. To avoid vanishing or exploding gradients, we truncated the gradient in time. Specifically, we reset the gradient to 0 after 50, 100 and 150 ms of simulations.

We trained the model with mean absolute error loss between the experimentally measured (low-pass filtered) calcium value and the model-predicted calcium value after 200 ms. Recording sites for which no recording was available in the data were masked out in the loss computation.

To evaluate the inductive bias of the hybrid model, we trained several such models, each on a reduced dataset. We reduced the dataset by using only a subset of stimulus–recording pairs from one scan field. We repeated this procedure over seven scan fields and five sizes of stimulus–recording pairs, namely 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512. We trained each model with stochastic gradient descent as described above. To ensure that the gradient is stochastic, we used batch sizes of 4, 4, 8, 16 and 32 for the five dataset sizes, respectively. We performed early stopping based on a validation set that contained 25% of the training dataset and evaluated performance on 512 test data points. To avoid exceedingly long training times, we trained for at most 100 steps.

For the artificial neural network, we used a multilayer perceptron with three hidden layers of [100, 100, 50] units and with ReLU activation functions.

All recurrent units used the same ion channels as for the task involving the L5PC, analogously inserted in soma, basal and apical dendrites. The two readout neurons were passive. The synapses were conductance based, as described by Abbott and Marder50.

The recurrent units were connected with a probability of 0.2 by synapses from the soma of the presynaptic neurons to the apical dendrites of the postsynaptic neurons. All recurrent units had synapses onto the two readout neurons. Around 50% of recurrent units had inhibitory outgoing synapses, created by setting their synaptic reversal potential to −75 mV, and the other half were excitatory with a synaptic reversal potential of 0 mV.

The RNNs in Fig. 4b had 50 units with an 80% excitatory/20% inhibitory split, and a connection probability of 0.2.

We trained the maximal synaptic conductances and the weights of the stimulus input to each neuron in the network. We used bounds of [−0.2, 0.2] for the input weights and [0, \(3\max (g)\)] for the maximal synaptic conductances. In total, the model had 109 trainable parameters.

Initial values for the maximum synaptic conductances were drawn from a standard normal distribution scaled by an initial gain g such that the bulk of the eigenspectrum of the synaptic weights lay in a circle on the complex plane with radius g (after multiplying inhibitory synapse weights by −1). We presented inputs by stimulating neurons at their basal dendrites. We set g = 5.0π/5 × 103, which is close to the transition point between stable and chaotic dynamics. For recurrent connections, we set the rate constant for transmitter–receptor dissociation rate (the k_ parameter2), that influences the synaptic time constants, to 1/1.0 ms. For connections to the rate-based readout neurons, we used slower synapses, with k_ set to 1/40 ms. All recurrent units received stimulus input scaled by random initial weights drawn from \({\mathcal{N}}(0,0.1)\).

Stimuli were generated by sampling values from normal distributions and then low-pass filtering them with a maximum frequency cutoff of 2,500 Hz. For training, we sampled values from \({\mathcal{N}}({\mu }_{-},0.05)\) and \({\mathcal{N}}({\mu }_{+},0.05)\), where \({\mu }_{-} \sim {\mathcal{N}}(-0.005,0.0002)\) and \({\mu }_{+} \sim {\mathcal{N}}(0.005,0.0002)\).

We used a batch size of four, three levels of checkpointing, the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01, 2,000 gradient steps and gradient normalization with β = 0.8. We sampled new training data at every gradient step. Sweeps were used to inform the choice of hyperparameters. We used a cross-entropy loss function with logits calculated as the mean readout activities in the last 20 ms of stimulus presentation. The training time was 7 h on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4116 CPU @ 2.10 GHz.

We used the same channel mechanisms, compartments and synapses as in the evidence integration task. We used a network of 50 units, with a recurrent connectivity probability of 0.05, and all units connecting to the readout neurons. Approximately 80% and 20% of the neurons had excitatory and inhibitory outgoing connections, respectively.

We trained the maximal synaptic conductances, constrained to the range [0, ∞), using a SoftPlus function. We also trained the weights of the stimulus input to each neuron in the network, restricted to the range [0, 4], as well as k_ restricted to [0.05, 2]. This resulted in 459 parameters.

We set g = 5.0π/5 × 103. We set the k_ parameter of recurrently connected neurons to 1, and to 0.1 for the slower synapses onto the readout neurons. The connection probability from input to (the basal dendrite of) recurrent units was 0.1, with initial weights drawn from \({{\mathcal{U}}}_{[0,1]}\).

Stimuli consisted of square pulses with additive Gaussian noise sampled from \({\mathcal{N}}(0,0.001)\). The onset period was 20 ms, and the stimulus and response durations were 50 ms. The delay period changed throughout the training procedure. Initial delay durations were drawn uniformly from \({{\mathcal{U}}}_{[50,150]}\). The average delay duration was increased in steps of 100 ms, whenever the network got at least 95% accuracy on a single batch, until \({{\mathcal{U}}}_{[450,550]}\) was reached.

We used a batch size of 64, two levels of checkpointing and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, which was exponentially decayed to 0.0001 over 1,000 epochs. We used a cross-entropy loss function for each time step, computed during the response period of the task. The training time was around 10 h on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090.

We quantified the stability of recurrent networks by the maximal Lyapunov exponent. To obtain the maximal Lyapunov exponent, we discretized our model to obtain xt+1 = f(xt), where xt contains voltages and gating variables at time t, and f is one step of the solver. We used the following numerical algorithm to approximate \({\lambda }_{\max }({{\bf{x}}}_{0})\)33: First, we generated an initial state x0 and initial unit norm vector q0. After discarding initial transients for 4 s of simulation, we let the system xt+1 = f(xt) and \({{\bf{q}}}_{t+1}=D{\bf{f}}{| }_{{{\bf{x}}}_{t}}{{\bf{q}}}_{t}\) (where D denotes the Jacobian) evolve for T = 2.4 × 105 time steps (a further 6 s). Note that qt+1 can be efficiently computed using Jacobian vector products in JAX20. At every time step we computed rt = ∥qt∥ and renormalized: \({{\bf{q}}}_{t}\leftarrow \frac{{{\bf{q}}}_{t}}{{r}_{t}}\). The maximal Lyapunov exponent was then given by \(\frac{1}{T}\mathop{\sum }\nolimits_{1}^{T}\log \parallel {r}_{t}\parallel\).

The first layer consisted of 28 × 28 neurons, each stimulated by a step current whose amplitude was proportional to a pixel value. Each neuron in the first layer had a ball-and-stick morphology: Each cell consisted of four compartments, where one compartment (the soma) had a radius of 10 μm and all other compartments had a radius of 1 μm and a length of 10 μm. The input and hidden layer contained sodium, potassium and leak channels in all branches, with dynamics following the default implementation of the Neuron package12. The output layer consisted of ten neurons with ball-and-stick morphologies (such as the input layer neurons) and with leak dynamics. We used conductance-based synapses as described by Abbott and Marder50. The layers of the network were densely connected.

We optimized sodium, potassium and leak maximal conductances of every branch in the network (55,000 parameters) and all synaptic conductances (51,000 parameters). We used the following bounds for the parameters: [0.05, 0.5] for sodium, [0.01, 0.1] for potassium, [0.0001, 0.001] for leak, [−5 / 282 / 25, 5 / 282 / 25] for synapses from the input to the hidden layer and [−5 / 64 / 25 / 2, 5 / 64 / 25 / 2] for synapses from the hidden layer to the output layer. We initialized sodium maximal conductances at 0.12 S cm−2, potassium at 0.036 S cm−2 and leak at 0.0003 S cm−2. We initialized synaptic conductances as samples from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 / 282 / 25 for the first layer and a standard deviation of 1 / 64 / 25 / 2 for the second layer. We set the synaptic rate constant for transmitter–receptor dissociation to k− = 1/4.

We used a batch size of 16 and cross-entropy loss based on the values (v + 65)/3, where v is the somatic voltage of the output neurons after 10 ms of simulation. We used a cosine learning rate schedule and trained the network for seven epochs. Each gradient step took 25 s on a V100 GPU.

To perform the adversarial attacks, we performed optimization of the input with gradient descent. We normalized every gradient step and used a learning rate of 5.0. We used bounds of [0, 1] for all pixel values during optimization. We used a cross-entropy loss function. We chose the target label for the adversarial attack randomly, but ensured that the target label is not the true label. We computed accuracy based on 128 adversarial attacks.

(a) Histogram of two biophysical parameters (rows, random samples within optimization bounds) before (left) and after (right) parameter transformations. The transformation is designed such that the parameters are unconstrained and of the same scale. (b) Illustrative loss surface and update step made by our variant of Polyak gradient descent. (c) We use different optimizers for different kinds of parameters. (d) Illustration of multi-level checkpointing. We use checkpointing to overcome memory limitations of backpropagation of error. Multi-level checkpointing requires multiple forward passes per gradient computation, but typically reduces memory requirements. (e) Illustration of truncated backpropagation through time. Truncated backpropagation through time allows to overcome vanishing or exploding gradients at the cost of providing only an approximate gradient.

Top: Spike time at three recording sites (somatic, proximal, distal) for input stimuli of 10 different amplitudes, ranging from 0.2 nA to 1.1 nA (individual dots). Columns are different morphologies from the Allen Cell Types Database. Bottom: Same as top, for spike amplitude.

The networks consist of 12k neurons, each with three branches and Hodgkin–Huxley dynamics. Networks were connected densely within clusters and sparsely between clusters via tanh-synapses, for a total of 25.4 million synapses. Jaxley can simulate networks of this complexity on a single A100 GPU (activity on the right) and also compute the gradient with respect to more than 25 million parameters (all sodium, potassium, leak, and synaptic conductances) with backpropagation. For this example, we used the average activity of twelve randomly selected neurons at the last timepoint to compute the loss.

(a) L5PC model. Number of simulations and runtime required to achieve a loss smaller than 0.55 when fitting the L5PC to synthetic recordings, with genetic algorithm (GA) and gradient descent (GD). Averaged across ten runs with 10 iterations each. (b) Allen Cell Types models. Loss over the number of iterations for the median of ten genetic algorithms, each run with ten simulations per iterations (black) and the minimal loss across ten gradient descent runs (blue). Ten gradient descent runs require the same number of simulations as a single run of the genetic algorithm. Across all four morphologies, gradient descent identifies parameter sets with lower loss than the genetic algorithm, but we note that computing the gradient incurs additional computational cost.

Gradient descent and the genetic algorithm were run for fifty iterations and with 1,000 simulations per step (in parallel on GPU). The gradient descent fit with reduced budget (light blue) was run for ten iterations and ten simulations per step. Scalebars: 200 ms and 30 mV.

We used Jaxley with gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte–Carlo to infer the posterior distribution over membrane conductances of a layer 5 pyramidal cell. Blue lines are 90 % confidence intervals, black line is the ground truth that was used to generate the synthetic observation.

Evidence integration task performance on three seconds of stimulus with positive integral (left) and negative integral (right). We used the same network parameters as in Fig. 4.

Long-term dynamics of the network from Fig. 4 trained to perform the delayed-match-to-sample task. The figure shows the dynamics of the full state of the model (including ion concentrations), projected into principal component space, after briefly presenting either stimulus. We first smoothed each dynamic variable with a Hann window of 40 ms, and normalised, before computing the principal components.

Left: Before training, the two shown cells were untuned, but they developed tuning to specific digits (ON-tuning for digit ‘1' for ID 13 and OFF-tuning for digit ‘0' for ID 36) after training. Right: Hidden layer tuning of all neurons after training. We evaluated the fraction of images in the dataset for which each hidden neuron spiked.

Purple dots highlight the five most changed synaptic conductances. Especially for the first layer, synaptic conductances changed strongly during training. In both layers, parameters were significantly correlated to their initial value (p < 10−8, two-sided t-test).

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and heterogeneous disorder of complex etiology. Studying more homogeneous groups stratified according to clinical characteristics, such as age of onset, can improve the identification of the underlying genetic causes and lead to more targeted treatment strategies. We leveraged Nordic biobanks with longitudinal health registries to investigate differences in the genetic architectures of early-onset (eoMDD; n = 46,708 cases) and late-onset (loMDD; n = 37,168 cases) MDD. We identified 12 genomic loci for eoMDD and two for loMDD. Overall, the two MDD subtypes correlated moderately (genetic correlation, rg = 0.58) and differed in their genetic correlations with related traits. These findings suggest that eoMDD and loMDD have partially distinct genetic signatures, with a specific developmental brain signature for eoMDD. Importantly, we demonstrate that polygenic risk scores (PRS) for eoMDD predict suicide attempts within the first 10 years after the initial diagnosis: the absolute risk for suicide attempt was 26% in the top PRS decile, compared to 12% and 20% in the bottom decile and the intermediate group, respectively. Taken together, our findings can inform precision psychiatry approaches for MDD.

Like other complex disorders such as type 2 diabetes1 and epilepsy2, the clinical heterogeneity observed in major depressive disorder (MDD) probably stems from the underlying etiological heterogeneity3,4,5. Recent advances in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of MDD, facilitated by large samples from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium6,7, 23andMe8, Million Veteran Program9 and global biobanks10,11,12,13, have yielded substantial progress in identifying MDD-associated genetic variants, and evidence of genetic differences between various clinical subtypes has emerged3,7,13. Despite these efforts, the quest for subtype-specific genetic loci in MDD has been slow, limiting our understanding of its complex etiology.

In this study, we investigate an important source of MDD heterogeneity, that is, age at onset (AAO), by stratifying individuals into early-onset MDD (eoMDD) and late-onset MDD (loMDD) and conducting a large GWAS meta-analysis of the two subtypes in the ongoing Nordic TRYGGVE collaboration14,15 (Fig. 1). eoMDD is associated with severe outcomes, including psychotic symptoms, suicidal behavior and comorbidities with other mental disorders and somatic diseases16,17, whereas loMDD tends to manifest with cognitive decline and increased cardiovascular disease risk18. Previous attempts to stratify MDD according to AAO have been hindered by methodological challenges, including large variations in AAO across samples, recall bias and relatively small sample sizes17. To address these challenges, we leveraged the Nordic biobanks and harmonized longitudinal health registries to stratify MDD cases based on age at first MDD diagnosis15. Previous research suggested that age at first diagnosis could be a useful proxy for AAO, given the high genetic correlation (rg = 0.95) between the two phenotypes16.

EMR, electronic medical record.

Following harmonization of phenotypic definitions of MDD and age at first diagnosis across nine cohorts from five Nordic countries (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway and Sweden; Methods), we identified 151,582 MDD cases, including 46,708 eoMDD cases with age at first diagnosis of less than 25 years (approximating the 25th percentile of an AAO distribution ≤ 20–21 (ref. 19; Methods)) and 37,168 loMDD cases with age at first diagnosis of 50 years or older (approximating the 75th percentile of an AAO distribution ≥ 44–45 years; Methods) (Table 1)19. We conducted harmonized GWAS analyses on eoMDD and loMDD using singularity containers20 in each cohort and then performed meta-analyses. After phenotype harmonization, we observed high genetic correlations (rg = 0.7–0.9) among the largest Nordic cohorts (the Integrative Psychiatric Research Consortium (iPSYCH), the Estonian Biobank (EstBB), FinnGen) (Supplementary Fig. 1). To assess generalizability outside the Nordic cohorts, we also analyzed UK Biobank (UKB) data, which relies on self-reported age at first diagnosis, and conducted GWAS of eoMDD and loMDD with the same age cutoffs (Supplementary Fig. 1). However, considering the major differences in samples and phenotypes, we conducted primary analyses based on Nordic cohorts of individuals with European ancestry, with the UKB as a comparison cohort for the identified loci.

We identified 12 genome-wide significant loci for eoMDD and two other loci for loMDD (P < 5 × 10−8) (Fig. 2). These loci were also captured in the GWAS of all cases with MDD, where we identified 80 significant loci (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Nearly all of these MDD loci have been reported in previous MDD GWAS13 (Supplementary Table 3), demonstrating the validity of our harmonized phenotypes and GWAS. For the 17 significant genes identified in the eoMDD analysis, BPTF21, PAX522, SDK123 and SORCS324 are involved in neurodevelopment or synaptic signaling (Supplementary Table 2). For loMDD, we identified four significant genes, with BSN implicated in synaptic neurotransmitter activity25 (Supplementary Table 2). Top loci were only partly replicated in the UKB, with only one locus on chromosome 9 showing nominal significance (P < 0.05); however, for the genome-wide significant loci in either sample, the correlation in their effect sizes was substantial (r = 0.84 for eoMDD; Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 3–5).

The dashed line indicates the one-sided Bonferroni-corrected P threshold, set at P = 0.05/102 = 0.0005. d, Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability \(\left({h}_{{\rm{SNP}}}^{2}\right)\) across a range of population prevalence estimates, with the labeled dashed lines indicating the point estimate of the population prevalence. e, Genetic overlap between broad MDD, eoMDD and loMDD, with the upper triangle containing the standard errors and the diagonal containing estimates of polygenicity from SBayesS. * For loMDD, the algorithm did not converge, making the polygenicity estimate unreliable, although it was consistently higher than for eoMDD across successful runs.

By integrating GWAS findings on psychiatric disorders with tissue-specific open chromatin marks from the RoadMap Epigenomics Project26, previous research implicated gene regulation during fetal neurodevelopment27. We tested the specific hypothesis that the GWAS of eoMDD would be enriched at regulatory chromatin marks active in fetal brains. Indeed, we found that eoMDD genetic signals were significantly enriched in fetal brain tissues, whereas no enrichment was detected in adult brains (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 6a), suggesting a role of early brain development in the risk of eoMDD. For loMDD, we only detected enrichment of one epigenetic marker in male fetal tissues. We did not identify significant enrichment in Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) brain tissues28 or human adult brain cell types29, potentially because of the relatively low statistical power in these subtype-specific GWAS (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 6b,c).

The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability \(\left({h}_{{\rm{SNP}}}^{2}\right)\) estimates for eoMDD were higher than for loMDD at a range of population prevalences (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 7). Assuming a population prevalence of 6.2% (Methods), the \({h}_{{\rm{SNP}}}^{2}\) for eoMDD was estimated at 11.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 9.9–12.5%; liability scale), which was almost twice as high as that of loMDD at 6% (95% CI = 4.3–6.3%) at a prevalence of 3.2% (Supplementary Table 7). We also conducted a case–case GWAS directly comparing eoMDD with loMDD; however, this comparison showed a small \({h}_{{\rm{SNP}}}^{2}\) (2%, s.e. = 0.74%). Interestingly, analyses of the genetic architecture using SBayesS30 estimated that the polygenicity (that is, the proportion of SNPs with nonzero effects) in eoMDD (4%, posterior s.e. = 0.7%) was much lower than our GWAS of all MDD cases (7%, posterior s.e. = 0.5%) (Fig. 2e) and the estimate reported in the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium MDD GWAS (6%)6, suggesting that fewer causal variants underpin eoMDD.

The two MDD subtypes correlated moderately (rg = 0.58, s.e. = 0.04) (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 8) and showed differences in their genetic correlations with other traits (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 8). eoMDD had the highest rg with suicide attempt (rg = 0.89, s.e. = 0.05), which was more than twice the rg between loMDD and suicide attempt (rg = 0.42, s.e. = 0.05) (comparison with rg in all MDD in Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 8). Similarly, substantial differences were found in their rg with posttraumatic stress disorder, childhood maltreatment, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. For somatic and lifestyle phenotypes, the overlap with eoMDD was significantly stronger for heart failure and body mass index (Supplementary Table 8). Given the rg between the two MDD subtypes, we further investigated the independent genetic effects of each subtype while conditioning on the other using genomic structural equation modeling (SEM) (Fig. 3b). In this way, the unique overlap between each subtype and the other traits could be evaluated, giving insight into how much of the overlap with the other trait was driven by overlap with the other subtype. After controlling for loMDD, the genetic associations of eoMDD with other traits remained similar, except that the negative rg between eoMDD and educational attainment was attenuated (Supplementary Table 9). On the other hand, after accounting for the genetic overlap with eoMDD, the genetic associations of loMDD were substantially reduced for many traits (for example, suicide attempt and suicide death), suggesting that the observed rg between loMDD and these traits were driven by the shared genetics with eoMDD. Overall, eoMDD had stronger genetic overlaps with psychiatric and general health traits than loMDD, with the most notable difference in their genetic correlations with suicide attempt.

The error bars represent the 95% CIs. P values for the associations are reported in Supplementary Table 8. b, Results from genomic SEM linear regression, where the outcomes are regressed on eoMDD (GWAS n = 153,532) while controlling for overlap with loMDD (GWAS n = 158,588), and vice versa. The single asterisks denotes a significant difference between eoMDD and loMDD at P < 0.05. The error bars represent the 95% CIs.

We further investigated these relationships using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) (Fig. 4). Considering the clear timing difference in the MDD subtypes, we were primarily interested in the role of eoMDD as a risk factor for general health outcomes, while providing the estimates of loMDD as a comparison, and the role of general health traits with loMDD as an outcome. Of note, eoMDD showed a significantly larger effect on suicide attempt than loMDD (eoMDD β = 0.61, s.e. = 0.057; loMDD β = 0.28, s.e. = 0.052), while the magnitude of effects on suicide death was more comparable between the two subtypes (eoMDD β = 0.64, s.e. = 0.20; loMDD β = 0.55, s.e. = 0.21). For educational attainment, our results were consistent with a previous report that suggested lower educational attainment as a putatively causal risk factor for MDD7, in particular for loMDD (β = −0.23, s.e. = 0.049; the effect on eoMDD was pleiotropic); furthermore, we showed that eoMDD had a putatively causal effect on lower educational attainment (β = −0.09, s.e. = 0.026). Similarly, our results that both subtypes had a small putatively causal effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) were in line with previous findings considering MDD as a whole31; there was evidence suggesting that heart failure was putatively causal for loMDD. Results from sensitivity analyses were consistent with these main findings (Supplementary Table 10).

The error bars represent the 95% CIs. b, Effects with MDD as the outcome (ordered according to the effect size in a). Included in both a and b are the number of instrument SNPs used in the analysis (‘SNPs'), the percentage variance explained by the instrument SNPs in the exposure (‘% R2') and the instrument strength (‘F'). We only tested plausible relationships (in line with time ordering), with improbable relationships, for example, suicide death as a risk factor for MDD, excluded from the figure. If the MR-Egger sensitivity analysis had a significant intercept (triangles), this indicates that the MR estimate was pleiotropic and should not be interpreted. Estimates with an asterisk were significant after correction for multiple testing (exact P values are reported in Supplementary Table 10). The error bars represent the 95% CIs.

To investigate whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) for eoMDD and loMDD were associated with clinical indicators or severe outcomes, we generated PRS using leave-one-out (LOO) GWAS summary statistics and tested PRS associations with these outcomes extracted from longitudinal health registry data in each cohort. In the meta-analysis and across individual cohorts, the eoMDD PRS explained a greater proportion of the phenotypic variance compared to the loMDD PRS for all outcomes of interest (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 11). In particular, a 1 s.d. increase in eoMDD PRS was associated with an increased risk of early-onset (odds ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.13–1.4, P = 1.8 × 10−5) and lifetime risk of MDD (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.17–1.31, P = 1.16 × 10−13) compared to the loMDD PRS for early (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.08–1.17, P = 3.9 × 10−9) and lifetime risk of MDD (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.07–1.19, P = 1.4 × 10−5). Similarly, compared to the loMDD PRS, the eoMDD PRS was more strongly associated with other outcomes of interest; differences in estimates for eoMDD and loMDD PRS were particularly pronounced for hospitalization and diagnostic conversion to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

To understand how genetic predispositions underlying the two subtypes are associated with comorbidities, we conducted a PRS-based phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) using the EstBB medical records from both primary and specialist care (1,428 International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code-based diagnosis). After correction for multiple testing (Bonferroni correction, P threshold of 0.05/1,428), we identified both shared and unique associations with either subtype (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 8a,b). Notably, the eoMDD PRS showed unique associations with psychiatric conditions such as conduct disorder (ICD-10 code: F91) and schizotypal disorder (F21), suicide attempt/intentional self-harm (X78) and problems related to negative life events in childhood (Z61), or other problems related to upbringing (Z62). In contrast, the loMDD PRS was more notably associated with mental and behavioral disorders because of the use of sedatives or hypnotics (F13) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (F42) (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 12).

Prompted by our findings of the strong genetic link between eoMDD and suicide attempt, we investigated whether the eoMDD PRS predicts the risk of suicide attempt using self-report surveys and medical records from EstBB. We stratified individuals with eoMDD into three subgroups based on the eoMDD PRS (top and bottom deciles, and middle 80%). First, we observed a dose–response relationship between eoMDD PRS strata and the mean scores of the self-reported Paykel Suicide Scale32, that is, the higher eoMDD PRS, and the higher symptoms of suicide thoughts and attempts (mean symptoms scores = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.79–0.91; 1.05 (1.03–1.07), 1.22 (1.15–1.29) for the bottom, middle and top PRS strata, respectively) (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 13a). Next, we estimated the hazard risk ratio (HRR) and the absolute risk for suicide attempt treated in primary or specialist care within a 10-year period since the first recorded MDD diagnosis. Compared with the middle PRS group, individuals in the lowest PRS decile had a significantly lower HRR for suicide attempt of 0.57 (95% CI = 0.49–0.68, P = 1.34 × 10−10), while those in the highest PRS decile had an increased risk (HRR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.00–1.28, P = 0.058). Furthermore, individuals with the lowest PRS showed a consistently low absolute risk of suicide attempt over time after the first MDD diagnosis (12% cumulative incidence over a 10-year period), while there were no major differences in absolute risk between the middle and highest PRS group until 5.5 years, with the 10-year cumulative incidence at 20% and 26%, respectively (Fig. 5e).

Previous research showed that the incidence of suicide attempts is particularly pronounced during adolescence and young adulthood33. Early identification of individuals at heightened risk for suicide is of major clinical importance. This period of high incidence of suicide attempts coincides with the risk for eoMDD, making it particularly relevant to perform risk prediction of suicide attempts in this subgroup. Together with our findings suggesting that eoMDD is putatively causal for suicide attempts, these results underscore the potential use of eoMDD PRS in stratifying the risk of suicide attempt among individuals with eoMDD (Supplementary Table 13b) and warrant further investigation of its relevance for suicide prevention33.

MDD genomics has achieved tremendous progress, from zero significant associations in 2013 to 697 associations in 2025 for the MDD case–control phenotype6,7,34. In this study, we explored the strategy of going beyond case–control to target specific phenotypic subgroups, aiming to reduce genetic heterogeneity in MDD. Our harmonized healthcare data and analyses across countries improved analytical power and identified differential genetic signals in AAO-based subtypes. A similar approach can be extended to other clinical characteristics, such as vegetative symptoms, psychotic features and disability, to further target clinically relevant subtypes of MDD3,5,35,36. These findings may have important implications for guiding targeted treatment and prevention in psychiatry.

To conduct a large GWAS of AAO-based MDD subtypes with consistent phenotypes, we identified nine cohorts across five Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Estonia), and a comparison cohort from a non-Nordic country (the UK: UKB). Many of these cohorts are large biobanks linked with lifetime medical records in national patient registers, including iPSYCH, FinnGen, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), the UKB and the EstBB (cohort details in Supplementary Methods). This study was approved by the Swedish ethical review authority (case no. 2023-03073), and each cohort was approved by the relevant institutional review boards.

We expanded our previous effort of harmonizing the register-based phenotypes of MDD, age at first diagnosis and its outcomes in the three Scandinavian countries to other Nordic countries with similar registers15. Using national patient registers, we first extracted information on patient diagnoses of MDD using ICD-10 code F32 (depressive episode) or F33 (recurrent depressive episodes), with the exclusion criteria of a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia (ICD-10 codes: F30/F31/F32/F33, F20/F23.1/F23.2/F25) (Supplementary Table 14), resulting in a total combined number of MDD cases in the Nordic countries of n = 151,582. Our previous research revealed a high genetic correlation (rg ≈ 0.95) between AAO and age at first diagnosis for MDD16, and that onset on average predates first diagnosis by 5 years16. Therefore, we derived the age at first diagnosis for the MDD patient population and used that as a proxy for AAO for the definition of eoMDD and loMDD. The cutoffs were chosen based on careful review of the literature and the empirical registry data from Sweden. Previous meta-analysis reported that the median AAO for depressive disorder is around age 30, with the 25th and 75th percentile at age 21 and 44, respectively15,19; our Swedish registry data showed that for age at first MDD specialist diagnosis, the 25th and 75th percentile were at age 25 and 45, respectively15. Thus, we considered individuals with their first psychiatric specialist treatment contact for MDD at or before age 25 (approximate to the 25th percentile of the AAO distribution at age 20–21) as cases with eoMDD (n = 46,708); cases with loMDD were those with their first specialist treatment contact for MDD at or after age 50 (approximate to the 25th percentile of the AAO distribution at age 44–45; n = 37,168). Controls were individuals without a registered diagnosis of MDD, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Because of the differences in cohort design, controls were matched to cases for the population-based cohorts of EstBB, FinnGen, MoBa and UKB. The Danish and Swedish cohorts, which used case–cohort and case–control designs, did not require control matching.

To ensure transparent and reproducible analyses of data across sites, we developed software containers and accompanying codes for data processing and analyses (for example, GWAS, PRS, LDSC) and distributed the containers across the study sites. Briefly, the primary software tools and dependencies were installed in virtual machines based on the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Linux operating system via Docker (https://docker.com) and containerized using the Singularity Image File format (https://sylabs.io) for distribution20. All source codes and files are publicly available via GitHub and released under the GNU General Public License (GPL v.3.0). Tools released under other licenses retain their original licenses.

GWAS of individuals with European ancestries was conducted in each cohort using the REGENIE software package37 available in the software containers20. Analyses were adjusted for the first ten principal components (PCs), age and sex. Summary statistics from each cohort were included in a fixed-effects meta-analysis in METAL38 with the ‘SCHEME STDERR' command using the inverse variance weight of the corresponding standard errors for all phenotypes studied, resulting in 151,582 cases and 362,873 controls for all MDD, 46,708 cases and 106,824 controls for eoMDD, and 37,168 cases and 121,420 controls for loMDD. Additional variant filtering was applied: INFO score > 0.8, minor allele frequency ≥ 1% and n > 10,000. After this filtering, the numbers of markers for the final METAL analyses were 8,910,578 for broad MDD, 8,848,589 for eoMDD and 8,820,060 for loMDD. Genome-wide significance was set at P < 5 × 10−8. Genome-wide loci were identified based on genome-wide significant SNPs using PLINK (--clump command). A gene list was then created based on which genes physically overlapped the loci from the previous step (Supplementary Table 2). An additional case–case GWAS was performed comparing eoMDD cases to loMDD cases using the EstBB and FinnGen cohorts, as they include both eoMDD and loMDD cases in their biobanks. A total of 32,060 samples from FinnGen and 23,447 samples from EstBB were meta-analyzed using METAL; heritability \(\left({h}_{{\rm{SNP}}}^{2}\right)\) was estimated using LDSC39,40.

We used MAGMA41 v.1.08 to test the aggregate association of variants by assigning SNPs to genes. Gene boundaries were expanded by 35 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream to allow for the inclusions of promoters and cis-enhancers. We used the updated deep whole-genome sequencing of the 1000 Genomes Project (European subset) as reference data42, downloaded from http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/working/20220422_3202_phased_SNV_INDEL_SV/.

We used stratified LDSC39 to perform tissue-type and cell-type analysis, estimating the enrichment of SNP heritability in a set of genome annotations. We downloaded precomputed LDSC scores from https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/_details/broad-alkesgroup-public-requester-pays/LDSCORE/LDSC_SEG_ldscores/biorxiv/Roadmap_1000Gv3.tgz, containing data on 396 annotations of epigenetic marks from the ROADMAP project, restricting to the 102 annotations relating to the brain. For the gene expression data, we followed our previous protocol43, first aggregating gene expression across genes to get the average expression per gene in each cell type. We then defined cell-type specificity by dividing the expression of a gene in a cell type by its total expression across all cell types. For each cell type, we considered the top decile of specifically expressed genes as typifying that cell type, and computed LDSC scores for that annotation. In addition to the ROADMAP annotations, we also tested the enrichment of SNP-based heritability (one-sided) in human tissues (37 human tissues from GTEx28) and brain cell types using the latest human single-nucleus transcriptomic data (31 major human brain cell types from ref. 29). We applied a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing in each annotation and trait (for example, in the analysis of ROADMAP data, significance was set at P < 0.05/102 for each trait).

We used LDSC to estimate SNP-based heritability and genetic correlation40. To convert the SNP-based heritability to the liability scale, we calculated the sample prevalence of cases in the meta-analysis; for population prevalence, we used a lifetime estimate of diagnosed MDD of 16% (ref. 44). To obtain corresponding estimates for eoMDD and loMDD, we estimated the proportion of cases with MDD who had an early-onset or a late-onset diagnosis in the largest population samples (EstBB and FinnGen) and took that as a percentage of the whole MDD prevalence estimate, resulting in a population estimate of 6.2% for eoMDD and 3.2% for loMDD. Acknowledging that these estimates are approximations, we provided SNP heritability estimates for a range of prevalence estimates (±50% around the point estimates).

To estimate genetic correlations with other traits, we used phenotypes from publicly available summary statistics, selecting important psychiatric disorders and key health determinants and outcomes, including suicide, body mass index, educational attainment, substance use, mortality and cardiovascular disease (GWAS sources in Supplementary Table 15).

Using SBayesS30, we confirmed the LDSC estimates of SNP-based heritability and further estimated the parameter of polygenicity, that is, the proportion of SNPs with nonzero effects, and negative selection. We used the precomputed LD Matrix from UKB participants (‘ukbEURu_imp_v3_HM3_n50k.chisq10'), which is available from the software authors. We ran four chains in parallel to estimate the convergence across starting parameters (--num-chains 4), with each run consisting of 25,000 iterations (--chain-length 25,000), with 5,000 iterations considered as burn-in iterations (--burn-in 5,000).

We used genomic SEM to compare the extent to which genetic liability to eoMDD versus loMDD overlaps with genetic liability to other phenotypes45. Genomic SEM is an extension of SEM whereby GWAS summary statistics are used to capture the ‘observed' traits in the model so that the genetic architecture underlying the multivariate relationships between traits can be modeled. Genomic SEM relies on LDSC to estimate genetic correlations and is robust to any amount of sample overlap. We modeled the association of the MDD subtypes with other related phenotypes that have been well studied in the literature, including a range of psychiatric disorders, important health determinants, CVD and mortality (Supplementary Table 15). First, we compared the size and significance of the genetic correlations of the two subtypes (eoMDD and loMDD) with the other phenotypes. Next, we assessed the subtype-specific contribution to the other phenotypes by controlling for the other subtype (for example, we investigated the relationship between eoMDD and suicide attempt after controlling for loMDD). Thus, the unique contribution of each can be gauged while controlling for their shared variance. The genetic overlap between eoMDD and loMDD was moderate; therefore, the concern for strong bias through multicollinearity was limited.

Following the analyses of genetic overlap, we used MR to assess whether the MDD subtypes were causally associated with selected health outcomes (risk factors, mortality and CVD; Supplementary Table 15). We did not include psychiatric outcomes because of the high likelihood of pleiotropy. Assuming that alleles are randomly distributed in the population (in a manner akin to experimental randomization), MR uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to capture a trait (‘exposure'). If the genetic variants are robust, non-pleiotropic instruments for the exposure and there is no direct association with the outcome or an unmeasured confounder, this provides support for a potential causal effect of the exposure. We conducted main and sensitivity analyses as implemented in the TwoSampleMR R package46 and computed the IVW statistic to estimate these associations. For interpretation, we focused on effect consistency across tests, rather than P values. Still, to give an indication of the extent of the multiple testing burden, we report significance according to false discovery rate-corrected P values (Benjamini–Hochberg method). We present several sensitivity analyses that correct for potential violations of the MR assumptions. Weighted median and mode analyses are more robust to invalid instruments and correct for outliers47. The MR-Egger analysis was used to assess any remaining pleiotropy (intercept) and adjust for such effects. The MR-Egger estimate is often underpowered, but it is still informative to check whether the effect is in the same direction as the other sensitivity analyses48. From the same TwoSampleMR package, it is possible to estimate the amount of heterogeneity (Q) in the SNP effects, and estimate the instrument strength F. We added a sensitivity analysis from the MR-PRESSO R package49, which has a different and more powerful way to adjust for the effects of outliers and is aimed at correcting for pleiotropy. Finally, we assessed the ‘no measurement error' assumption by deriving the I2 statistic and applied a SIMEX correction on the MR-Egger estimate if I2 was between 0.6 and 0.8 (we did not present the MR-Egger estimate when the I2 fell below the 0.6 cutoff50). Although we were not able to remove potential sample overlap from the analyses (LOO analyses would leave the exposure GWAS underpowered), this should not be a large threat to the validity of our results. The extent of bias stemming from sample overlap is limited if the sample size of the source GWAS is large, the overlap is small and the heritability of the investigated traits is high51. As shown in Supplementary Table 15, the amount of sample overlap was limited in most cases and present only for a subset of traits.

The aim of the MR analyses was to contrast causal associations between eoMDD and loMDD. However, there was overlap in the instrument sets for both traits. Although only one SNP is present in both sets, many had LD partners in common. Therefore, we performed another sensitivity analysis using a single instrument SNP for each trait. We selected the genome-wide significant SNP that had the largest P value for the other trait (filtering on a minor allele frequency > 0.10). For eoMDD, we used rs7622302 residing in the DAG1 gene on chromosome 3, with P = 0.98 for loMDD. This instrument explained 2.8% of the variance (R2) in eoMDD. For loMDD, we used rs3777421 in the IGF2R gene on chromosome 6, with P = 0.87 for eoMDD. This SNP explained 2.7% variance in loMDD. Although power was expected to be lower in these single-SNP analyses, pleiotropy was also reduced; instrument strength was still sufficient (F = 30.7 for eoMDD and F = 30.1 for loMDD) and the contrast between eoMDD and loMDD was maximized.

PRS were calculated using LDpred252, which addresses some limitations of LDpred53. Briefly, LDpred2 is a Bayesian method that uses the LD structure in the genome combined with priors regarding the genetic architecture of a trait (SNP heritability and fraction of causal SNPs (hyperparameter p)) to compute PRS. We used the ‘auto' method of LDpred2 that maximizes the predictive performance of the PRS by testing a range of the fraction of causal SNPs. For our analyses, we used LD matrices provided by the authors of LDpred252, which were generated from the UKB samples (European ancestry) with 1.1 million HapMap3 SNPs. The LDpred2 calculations relied on the bigsnpr R library54 and were implemented in a set of custom R scripts55.

Individual-level PRS in each cohort were computed using the LOO GWAS summary statistics on MDD subtypes and tested for associations with clinical characteristics or MDD-related outcomes (Supplementary Table 16) in logistic regression models adjusted for at least ten PCs (cohort-dependent), sex and birth year. For the outcomes that were available in all target samples, we performed fixed-effects meta-analysis using the R package metafor56.

To investigate the genetic comorbidity of eoMDD and loMDD, we conducted a PRS PheWAS using logistic regression models, using the EstBB electronic health record (EHR) data. Analyses were performed in R (v.4.3). For each ICD-10 code with at least 50 cases (n = 1,151) present in the EstBB EHR, two models were constructed—eoMDD PRS and loMDD PRS as the predictor. These models used the normalized PRS (either eoMDD or loMDD) and a binary outcome variable indicating the presence or absence of the ICD-10 code. The EHR data encompassed both primary and secondary/inpatient care data through linkage to the Estonian central e-health database, covering the time from 2004 to 2022.

The models included sex, year of birth and the first ten genetic PCs as covariates. To account for multiple testing, we applied Bonferroni correction, resulting in a conservative P threshold of 0.05/1,151. ORs (with 95% CIs), the number of cases per ICD-10 code and the P values for both eoMDD and loMDD models are provided in Supplementary Table 12 and Supplementary Figure 8a,b.

To evaluate the effect of the eoMDD PRS on self-reported suicidality, we used data from the EstBB Mental Health Online Survey57. Self-reported suicidality was assessed using the Paykel Suicide Scale, which includes five items assessing self-reported suicidal thoughts and attempts32. A total of 58,732 individuals who had an MDD diagnosis were present in the EHRs (F32 or F33 codes) and responded to the Paykel Suicide Scale. For this analysis, the first four questions were scored on a scale from 0 to 4 (0 indicating the participant had never felt or experienced this, and 4 indicating the participant felt or experienced it often). The fifth question had binary responses (no/yes) corresponding to values of 0 or 2. The total score of the five items was used for the analysis; the distribution according to eoMDD PRS group is provided in Supplementary Table 13a. The mean values and standard deviations of these sums were then computed for three groups based on eoMDD PRS deciles (1st, 2nd to 9th, 10th). Analyses were conducted using R (v.4.3).

To estimate the absolute risk of EHR-based suicide attempt over 10 years after the first diagnosis of MDD, stratified according to eoMDD PRS, we used a Cox proportional-hazards model58, using data from the EstBB (results in Supplementary Table 13). Sex and year of birth were included as covariates. The analysis included a cohort of 10,539 individuals diagnosed with MDD (first diagnosis date in 2000 or later, identified by the ICD-10 codes F32 or F33, before or at the age of 25). Participants' birth years ranged from 1974 to 2004, with a mean birth year of 1990.

We calculated the absolute risk (with 95% CIs) of suicide attempt after the first episode of depression for three groups based on eoMDD polygenic risk score deciles: the 1st decile, the 2nd to 9th deciles and the 10th decile. The risk of suicide attempt was assessed over a 10-year period (3,650 days) after the initial MDD diagnosis. ICD-10 codes X60-X84 and Y87 from the Estonian EHRs were used to identify suicide attempts. The absolute risk was presented as 1 minus the survival probability. All analyses were conducted using R v.4.3, with the ggsurvfit (v.1.0.0)58 and survival (v.3.5.7) packages59.

A newly identified carnivorous reptile may look like a dinosaur at first glance, but researchers have confirmed that it was actually an early relative of modern crocodiles.

The species is named Tainrakuasuchus bellator, a title partly inspired by the Latin word for "warrior" or "fighter." This armored animal lived 240 million years ago, during a time just before dinosaurs appeared.

As a member of the Pseudosuchia (the precursors of modern crocodiles and alligators), it belonged to a dominant group of predators that thrived in the Triassic Period.

Size, Hunting Skills, and Early Ecosystem Role

Details of the discovery appear in the peer-reviewed Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. According to the study, the creature measured about 2.4m in length and weighed around 60kg.

Its long neck and agile body allowed it to strike quickly at prey. Once it closed in, it used slender jaws filled with sharp, recurved teeth to secure its target and prevent escape.

"This animal was an active predator, but despite its relatively large size, it was far from the largest hunter of its time with the same ecosystem home to giants as big as seven meters long," explains lead author Dr. Rodrigo Temp Müller, who led the paleontology team at the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria in Brazil.

"Pseudosuchia were a diverse group of animals capable of tackling robust prey, as well as small hunters specialized in catching swift animals.

"Although its appearance superficially resembles that of a dinosaur, Tainrakuasuchus bellator does not belong to that group. One of the clearest ways for us to distinguish it from dinosaurs lies in the structure of the pelvis where the characteristics of its hip and femur joints are very different."

A Glimpse Into Pre-Dinosaur Biodiversity

Dr. Müller notes: "Tainrakuasuchus bellator's discovery represents the complexity of the ecosystem at the time, with different pseudosuchia species -- varying in sizes and hunting strategies -- occupying specific ecological niches.

"Its discovery helps illuminate a key moment in the history of life, the period that preceded the rise of the dinosaurs."

The fossils were uncovered during a May 2025 excavation in the municipality of Dona Francisca in southern Brazil. The team found a partial skeleton encased in rock that included portions of the lower jaw, vertebrae, and pelvic girdle.

Analysis of the bones revealed details about the animal's behavior and confirmed that Tainrakuasuchus bellator was protected by bony plates called osteoderms, which are also found in today's crocodiles.

Although its limbs were not preserved, the researchers believe it moved on all fours, similar to related species.

Meaning Behind the Name

The name 'Tainrakuasuchus' blends the Guarani words tain ("tooth") and rakua ("pointed") with the Greek suchus ("crocodile"), referring to its sharp teeth.

The second part, 'bellator,' comes from the Latin word for "warrior" or "fighter" and, according to the authors, "honors the people of Rio Grande do Sul, symbolizing their strength, resilience, and fighting spirit, especially in light of the recent floods that have affected the state."

Rare Fossil With Links Across Ancient Pangaea

Dr. Müller describes the find as "extremely rare" and says it provides more evidence of the ancient connection between Brazil and Africa during the Triassic Period -- when the world's landmasses were joined into the supercontinent Pangaea.

"Despite the diversity of pseudosuchians, they remain poorly understood, as fossils of some their lineages are extremely rare in the fossil record," Dr. Müller says.

"The fossils we found underwent a meticulous preparation process in the laboratory, during which the surrounding rock was carefully removed.

"Once the anatomical details were revealed, we were delighted and really excited to reveal that the specimen represented a species previously unknown to science.

"What we uncovered was a species that belongs to a predator closely related to one (Mandasuchus tanyauchen) found in Tanzania.

"This connection between animals from South America and Africa can be understood in light of the Triassic Period's paleogeography.

"At that time, the continents were still united, which allowed the free dispersal of organisms across regions that are now separated by oceans. As a result, the faunas of Brazil and Africa shared several common elements, reflecting an intertwined evolutionary and ecological history.

"Tainrakuasuchus bellator would have lived in a region bordering a vast, arid desert -- the same setting as where the first dinosaurs emerged.

"It shows that, in what is now southern Brazil, reptiles had already formed diverse communities adapted to various survival strategies. Moreover, this discovery reveals that such diversity was not an isolated phenomenon."

Cisco plans to acquire NeuralFabric, a Seattle-area startup founded by a group of Microsoft veterans that makes back-end software for companies to build and run their own generative AI models. Financial terms were not disclosed.

The Silicon Valley enterprise tech mainstay said the deal will bolster its AI Canvas initiative, a generative UI and collaboration environment announced earlier this year. 

In its announcement Thursday morning, Cisco highlighted NeuralFabric's expertise in distributed systems, model training, and flexible deployment as a complement to its existing AI assistant, cybersecurity models, and data fabric strategy.

DJ Sampath, senior vice president for AI software and platforms, said in the announcement that the startup has “cracked a crucial part of this puzzle” by building technology that lets companies develop their own domain-specific small language models using proprietary data across cloud or on-premises environments.

NeuralFabric, based in Redmond, was founded in 2023 by former Microsoft Azure engineering veteran Weijie Lin (CEO), longtime Microsoft executive John deVadoss, AI entrepreneur Jesus Rodriguez (president), and cloud and security veteran Mark Baciak (CTO), with former Microsoft director Drew Gude (chief revenue officer) also listed as an early exec.

The startup employs about nine people, according to LinkedIn. Cisco said the acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of its 2026 fiscal year (by the end of January), after which NeuralFabric's team will join the company's AI Software and Platform organization.

NeuralFabric had raised at least $5 million in funding as of February 2024 announcement. PitchBook lists investors including Collab+Currency, CMT Digital, and New Form Capital.

Stewart Rhodes announced last week that he is relaunching the Oath Keepers, his anti-government militia which virtually disappeared after dozens of its members—including Rhodes—were arrested for their roles in the January 6 attack on the Capitol.

Rhodes, speaking to the Gateway Pundit this week, says that he sees the relaunched group as playing a role in combating what he labeled an “insurrection by the left” on the streets of US cities. “Right now, under federal statutes, president Trump can call us up as the militia if he sees it necessary, especially for three purposes: to repel invasions, to suppress insurrections, and to execute the laws of the union,” Rhodes said.

But in the days since Rhodes announced their return, experts, former members, and online chatter suggest there is little to no interest in restarting what was, at one point, one of the largest militias in America with a leaked database listing 38,000 supposed members in 2021. This hasn't stopped Rhodes from asking potential new members and supporters to send money in support of the cause.

But even former Oath Keepers are uninterested. Janet Arroyo, who ran an Oath Keepers chapter in Chino Valley, Arizona, with her husband Jim Arroyo prior to the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, says they have not heard from Rhodes in six years and had no plans to rejoin his group.

“He hasn't reached out during his incarceration, nor since being released,” says Arroyo. “No hard feelings, but we are doing what we do and don't spend a lot of time wondering what he's up to. The dumb DC stunt has scared a lot of great patriots into hiding. My guess is he won't be successful.”

Another former Oath Keeper, Jessica Watkins, an army veteran who was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison for her role in the Capitol attack, says she hadn't even heard about the relaunch when WIRED contacted her this week. “I have not heard of a relaunch, but most J6ers I know are trying to rebuild their lives,” says Watkins, who added that even if she wanted to rejoin, she would be unable to do so as she had her sentence commuted rather than being pardoned. “Felons are not allowed to be in the Oath Keepers or work with them.”

Kelly Meggs, who headed up the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers and was convicted of seditious conspiracy for his part in the attack on the Capitol, says he won't be joining the relaunched Oath Keepers, as he is concerned about being targeted again when Democrats return to power. “I am more worried about the future,” says Meggs. “I think four and five years from now, eight years from now, 12 years from now, whenever it is, anyone that is a member of these organizations stands at risk of what I went through.”

Meggs said he would be interested in taking part in any work the Oath Keepers were carrying out in response to natural disasters, but he won't be on the streets defending cities from the perceived threat from antifa. “I am not going to be an active member,” says Meggs. “If they're doing a big march somewhere, I won't be there.”

A review of social media platforms and right-wing message boards shows a decided lack of discussion about the new group over the last week, but Meggs says it's happening in “one-on-one conversations.”

“This just feels like the latest desperate attempt by Rhodes to cling to relevance,” says Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. “There's no real appetite for the Oath Keepers in 2025. Why would any young anti-government extremist trust a failed insurrectionist who got all of his followers arrested?”

Rhodes did not respond to WIRED's requests for comment.

Rhodes founded the Oath Keepers in 2009 as a reaction to a conspiracy theory that the Obama administration was seeking to trigger economic collapse and impose martial law on American citizens. The group largely operated out of the limelight until 2017 when they began to provide security at Trump events, culminating with dozens of members taking part in the attack on the Capitol. Rhodes was convicted in 2023 of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to 18 years in jail, with the judge at the time saying Rhodes presented “an ongoing threat and a peril to this country and to the republic and to the very fabric of this democracy.”

In January, Rhodes had his sentence commuted to “time served” by Trump, but did not receive a full pardon like hundreds of other insurrectionists, which means his conviction still stands.

Rhodes first floated the idea of restarting the Oath Keepers in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, claiming his group would have been able to prevent the TPUSA founder's death if it had been operating.

Rhodes then announced his relaunch in an interview nearly two weeks ago with the far-right outlet The New American, which is owned by a subsidiary of the John Birch Society, a right-wing advocacy group. In the interview, Rhodes said he was waiting for Trump to issue him a full pardon before restarting the Oath Keepers, but added that recent events have forced him to act.

And despite the inspiration for the group's founding, Rhodes now appears to be fully on board with the idea of a US president deploying troops against their own citizens.

“The National Guard is part of the militia, which is why it's completely lawful for [Trump] to use the National Guard as he has, and he should do more of that, I think, across the country,” Rhodes told the Gateway Pundit.

On November 3, Rhodes launched a new website where people can sign up to become a member of the newly reformed Oath Keepers. Yearly memberships cost $100—though previous lifetime memberships of the original group will be honored, according to the website.

Those seeking to join are asked to send checks or money orders made out to Rhodes' legal name—Elmer Stewart Rhodes—and send them to an address in Texas, where Rhodes lives. Rhodes has also launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise a “modest goal of $75,000,” the campaign claims, to support the new group. A week after it launched, the campaign has barely broken the $1,000 mark, with just 16 donations. The majority of the money raised came from two $200 donations, one of which came from an individual who identified themself as the Gateway Pundit's Jim Hoft.

The website appears to still be a work in progress and features a blank “About” page. Among the “classes” listed on the site is a “Never Surrender” event in Texas scheduled to take place next week. However, according to social media posts, this event appears to be actually being run by the Young Republicans of Houston rather than the Oath Keepers. At the time of publication, the website for purchasing tickets for the event says “online sales are currently paused.”

It is unclear how many people have actually signed up for the new group, and in his interview with The New American, Rhodes said that the number of people currently involved was “classified.”

Amazon is rebranding its ambitious effort to expand global access to high-speed internet: Project Kuiper will now be known as Amazon Leo.

The Seattle-based tech giant announced Thursday that it was renaming its satellite broadband project in the midst of deploying the equipment that will help power it all.

Leo is a nod to “low Earth orbit,” where Amazon has so far launched more than 150 satellites as part of a constellation that will eventually include more than 3,200.

In a blog post, Amazon said the 7-year-old Project Kuiper began “with a handful of engineers and a few designs on paper” and like most early Amazon projects “the program needed a code name.” The team was inspired by the Kuiper Belt, a ring of asteroids in the outer solar system.

A new website for Amazon Leo proclaims “a new era of internet is coming,” as Amazon says its satellites can help serve “billions of people on the planet who lack high-speed internet access, and millions of businesses, governments, and other organizations operating in places without reliable connectivity.”

Amazon said it will begin rolling out service once it's added more coverage and capacity to the network. Details about pricing and availability haven't been announced.

Early customers and partners include JetBlue, which in September became the first airline to sign on with Leo, promising faster and more reliable inflight Wi-Fi. L3Harris, DIRECTV Latin America, Sky Brasil, and NBN Co., Australia's National Broadband Network operator, are also signed up to deploy the service.

During a test in September, executives touted data transmission speeds from the constellation in excess of a gigabit per second.

Amazon's primary satellite manufacturing facility is in Kirkland, Wash., with some of the components produced at Leo's headquarters in nearby Redmond. Amazon also has a $140 million, 100,000-square-foot payload processing facility at Kennedy Space Center that prepares satellites for upcoming launches.

Amazon's multibillion-dollar bid to catch up with SpaceX's Starlink constellation began in earnest in April with the launch of the first 27 satellites.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy posted on X about the name change and said projects such as Echo and Kindle also had code names early on. And Amazon Devices & Services leader Panos Panay said that he was “psyched for what's ahead” in his own post on X.

Pretty much every Amazon project starts with a code name. Echo was “Doppler,” our first Kindle was “Fiona,” and our EC2 network device project was “Blackfoot,” after the penguins our AWS team saw while doing the work in Cape Town.For our satellite network, it was “Project… pic.twitter.com/hJO6kJ9C8y

Meta is overhauling Facebook Marketplace with new collaborative tools, social features, an improved checkout experience, and Meta AI integrations, the company announced Thursday.

Marketplace is getting a new “collections” feature that lets users create groups of listings and invite friends to join. Users can get started by saving a listing, starting a new collection, and then choosing whether to make it public or private. They can then add friends to their collection and share updates through Feed, Messenger, WhatsApp, and more. 

Meta's also testing collaborative buying, which means users can invite a friend to join their chat with a seller. The company says this makes it easier to coordinate pickup, negotiate prices, and get answers to questions.

These new collaborative features could be useful in instances when a group of roommates is looking to furnish their new apartment or when someone wants to keep their partner in the loop when discussing potential purchases. 

While Meta says the changes announced on Thursday are designed to make Marketplace more useful, they also mark the company's ongoing efforts to bring Meta AI into all of its services and products. Additionally, by blending social, commerce, and AI, the company is looking boost time spent on Marketplace while also enhancing its competitiveness against other e-commerce platforms. 

In terms of the Meta AI integrations, Meta is going to start using its AI tools to help buyers ask the right questions when making a purchase. Now, when users start a chat with a seller, they will see a “Suggested questions to ask” button. If they tap it, Meta AI will use the details from the listing and the conversation to suggest questions they might want to ask.

Additionally, Meta is bringing AI insights to vehicle listings on Marketplace, noting that vehicles are among the top five searches for young adults. Now, when users view a vehicle listing, they'll see AI-generated insights that bring together key details like engine options, safety ratings, transmission type, seating and cargo capacity, reviews, and price information.

Meta also announced that users can react and comment directly on listings. The company says this will help others learn about item quality and discover new finds. It'll be interesting to see how people react to this change, as Marketplace has had a simple design since its launch. Some might find the addition of reactions and comments as distracting, or even cluttering the service.

Meta notes that if a user likes an item, Marketplace will learn what they're interested in and display more items aligned with their preferences.

As part of its announcement, Meta said it began integrating eBay and Poshmark inventory into Marketplace earlier this year to give people more options when it comes to buying across categories like fashion and electronics.

“Partner listings are marked with an icon on the listing image, and are integrated throughout your Marketplace feed so you'll see them while you're browsing,” Meta explained in a blog post. “You can also see the listing and seller's information on the Marketplace product details page, and when you're ready to buy, you'll be taken to the partner's site for checkout.”

As for the improved checkout experience, buyers will now see total costs, including shipping and tax, upfront. They'll now also receive notifications as the status of their order changes.

In the US, the safety standards consider only the occupants of the car. The safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and occupants of other cars are not considered. This was looking like it would change but with the current administration I doubt it.The Cybertruck is not legal in Europe and anywhere else with actual safety standards.

At 55mph perhaps this doesn't matter, but most vehicle-pedestrian collisions occur at far lower speeds than that, and then it absolutely does matter.I self identify as a Tesla fanboy, the model Y is the best car in the world in my opinion, but even I have to admit the cybertruck has several fatal flaws and just isn't a good vehicle.On paper it has a bunch of things going for it, for example it is (as far as I know) the cheapest fully electric vehicle with air suspension. In practice it all falls apart (both literally and figuratively)I wish Tesla would try again and build a new truck, without the cyber and the cold rolled stainless steel. Stick to the design language of the other Tesla models this time. Let Franz do his thing.

Also, if you get hit by a Cybertruck at 55mph, the sharp angles are going to cut you far deeper than a Mini Cooper would. You're not going to walk away from it either way, but you're probably more likely to perish from the Cybertruck.(That doesn't stop me from wanting a Cybertruck but that's just because it's cool in other ways. I don't know if I'd want one to be my daily driver, but it is very cool.)

Additionally, they didn't manage to find a satisfactory solution to attach the steel panels to the frame so they glued them on.I suspect the 'parts falling off' has something to do with the inflexibility of both materials as well as the different thermal expansion coefficients.On normal cars, bodywork is either made of flexible plastic, or is attached via spring joints so that the vibration doesn't damage them - that's why you have panel gaps - so they can move around a bit.If you fix them rigidly, they're going to shake off eventually.

I have no issue calling Musk a wildly successful businessman as he has made several great investments including getting companies off the ground, however his track record for actually running things is questionable.  Was ‘taking Tesla over from its founders' a good idea or not is different than ‘was investing in Tesla' a good idea.  Financially it definitely allowed him to extract more money from the company so it's a good business decision, but as far as actually running things I don't know.The Roadster v2 is a no show and the Cybertruck is a failure, the 3 on the other hand is successful but part of the initial pitch for the company.  The minimally innovative model Y is arguably his biggest success as a manager.  Even the charging network Telsa's biggest strategic advantage has become deprioritized. Boring, X, and Tesla Solar have clearly been mismanaged. Neuralink is a long way from delivering anything viable as a company.The parts of SpaceX he's seemingly ignoring are doing way better than the bits under his focus.  Starlink is doing well and he definitely had a hand on that so that's something significant.

Falcon Heavy has done 11 flights since 2018 and now they're building an even larger platform despite heavy launch not really being a viable market segment. Starship has been slower than the now canceled SLS program run by Boing. If Starship succeeds it seems to guarantee than Falcon Heavy will have a negative ROI, but Starship needs to be wildly successful to have a positive ROI.Starlink helps justify a high launch capacity, but isn't in need of a heavy launch platform.  A more reusable Falcon 9 would have simplified thermal issues, reduced R&D costs, and presumably increased profits much sooner.  That IMO would have been a far better strategy than scaling, up while changing to a wildly different engine, and targeting increased reusability, etc.

There is no other consumer car that can self-drive from start to finish for an entire trip. That alone will keep me on Tesla until the others catch up. Crash tests have shown that it's excellent at protecting its occupants, which matters to me as a father of two. The cyberpunk aesthetic, whole home battery backup, and large secured truck bed are just icing on the cake.I had the trim glue issue fixed proactively (it's now secured mechanically) and I don't have a light bar so the new issue doesn't affect me. Granted, it's not great that they opted for glue for that use case.

They've also recalled powerwalks.  Tesla is great at being visionary, their Achilles heal has always been their weak manufacturing.  Which makes sense, its the really hard part about being in the car or battery business.

Cybertrucks are for pioneers. If you want something super reliable, just get a "boring" Model Y. They've improved all parts of the design continuously, the cars are indistinguishable from the early ones when it comes to finish quality

reply

Well, here in NJ at least, Cybertrucks are not for pioneers, but inevitably for wealth signaling of mostly clueless people to show they have cash to throw away.There are of course many wealth signaling cars, but the Cybertruck is in a special noisome class all its own.

Is that typical in the industry, parts or components being glued onto an exterior surface instead of fastened?

reply

Mid-size accessories like add-on spoilers on trunk lids, or other exterior styling pieces are frequently attached with adhesive.A larger component commonly attached with adhesives are the rear fender flares on dually pickups. Very commonly these are built with a standard bed, and then the flares to cover the extra wheel width are applied with a 3M VHB-like adhesive strip.But like anything, there is a way to do it properly, and a way to do it hacky.

Most plastic body panels are held on with conformal clips. But they couldn't do that with the metal panels of the cyber truck nor did they want visible fasteners so glue is the only option.Glue isn't ideal because the part has to be clamped in place while the glue cures which is slow, and quality control is tough because you're doing a little chemistry experiment on your assembly line hundreds of times per day.Normal cars have this problem with paint and quality control with paint is such a big deal that it has its own separate production line just for painting stuff pre or post assemblyUsing composite panels is very uncommon in production vehicles and when they are used (for looks) traditional fasteners are used during assembly often with threaded inserts embedded in the composite panel during manufacture

There just isn't a lot of options other than adhesive for installing a light bar considering the windshield consumes all of the forward facing real estate (as the roof slopes back from the apex).

reply

Many vehicles with light bars have them mounted onto a standoff bracket. Why not design a standoff that mounts after the apex (back sloped part), using a piece with an angle complementary to the roof slope, providing a flat surface for the light bar to mount on? Pretty straightforward and honestly exactly what I would expect as an official accessory to a $100K vehicle.Btw, does Tesla pay you for all your white knighting?

Yes.  If automotive OEMs can glue it they will.It's just that other OEMs don't build uninterrupted 5ft light bars so glueing is a much less suitable (think about how much glue contact patch per amount of light bar there is and how little leverage it's mass has over the glue, contrast with normal light) solution for them.

IIRC, Tesla skipped the industry's normal typical period of real world testing for new platforms. That should have scared off most buyers.--Cybertruck should have been rolled out like the Roadster. Exclusive, prestige, wrap-around customer service. The superfans would happily pay to participate.There's always a (modest) market for niche vehicles, like the Cybertruck. eg Subaru Brat, VW The Thing (name?).--Cybertruck has so much innovation, cool tech. 48V, drive-by-wire, the modular internet bus thing, 4 wheel steering, even bigger castings, etc.Tesla was (initially) right to de-risk those things by using them in a (much) lower volume vehicle. And field test everything ahead of the high volume Model 2 / Robotaxi.--The big, IMHO, mistake was juicing the stock price by hyping Cybertruck as Tesla's next home run.

[Editor's Note: Agents of Transformation is an independent GeekWire series and 2026 event, underwritten by Accenture, exploring the people, companies, and ideas behind the rise of AI agents.]

REDMOND, Wash. — If AI were a religion, this would probably qualify as a cathedral.

On the edge of Microsoft's headquarters, overlooking Lake Bill amid a stand of evergreens, a new four-story building has emerged as a destination for business and tech decision-makers.

Equal parts briefing center, conference hall, and technology showroom, Microsoft's “Experience Center One” offers a curated glimpse of the future — guided tours through glowing demo rooms where AI manages factory lines, models financial markets, and helps design new drugs.

It's part of a larger scene playing out across tech. As Microsoft, Google, Amazon and others pour billions into data centers, GPUs, and frontier models, they're making the case that AI represents not a bubble but a business transformation that's here to stay. 

As the new center shows, Microsoft's pitch isn't just about off-the-shelf AI models or run-of-the-mill chatbots — it's about custom agentic systems that act on behalf of workers to complete tasks across a variety of tools and data sources. 

That idea runs through nearly everything inside the facility, a glass-encased building featuring an elevated garden in a soaring open-air atrium, just across from Microsoft's new executive offices on its revamped East Campus.

Experience Center One highlights what Microsoft calls “frontier firms” — ambitious companies using AI to push their operations to the edge of what's possible in their industries. 

Agentic AI is “fast becoming the next defining chapter of a frontier organization,” said Alysa Taylor, Microsoft chief marketing officer for Commercial Cloud and AI, in an interview.

The underlying message is clear: get on board or risk falling behind, both competitively and financially. A new IDC study, commissioned by Microsoft, finds both opportunity in spending big and risk in not being bold enough. Companies integrating AI across an average of seven business functions are realizing a return on investment of 2.84 times, it says. In contrast, “laggards” are seeing returns of 0.84 times — basically losing money on their initial spend.

The divide extends to revenue, too: 88% of frontier firms report top-line growth from their AI initiatives, compared to just 23% of “laggards,” according to the IDC study.

And hey, somebody has to foot the bill for those multi-billion-dollar AI superfactories.

For this second installment in our Agents of Transformation series, GeekWire visited the new Microsoft facility to see first-hand how the company is presenting its vision of the future. Here are some of the takeaways from the sampling of demos we saw.

These are not off-the-shelf solutions. Each demo reflects a custom deployment built with a major customer, showing how AI tools can be tailored to specific business problems. 

For example, one shows how Microsoft has worked with BlackRock to integrate a custom AI copilot inside the investment firm's Aladdin platform to help analysts process large volumes of client and market data more efficiently. It helps reduce the manual work of gathering data and points analysts to potential risks sooner than they might have spotted it on their own.

As another example of the customization, the system is trained to translate natural language requests into “BQL,” BlackRock's proprietary programming language.

This deep level of integration tracks with the findings in the IDC report. It found that 58% of “frontier firms” are already relying on custom-built or fine-tuned solutions rather than generic models. This is expected to accelerate, with 70% planning to move toward customized tools in the next two years to better handle their proprietary data and compliance needs.

“That's a trend that we've seen even in the low-code movement — taking an out-of-the-box solution, extending it, and customizing it,” said Taylor, the Microsoft commercial CMO.

OpenAI integration remains critical for many Microsoft customers. Another demo focused on Microsoft's work with Ralph Lauren, showing how the “Ask Ralph” assistant interprets a shopper's intent and recommends full outfits from available inventory.

Like many of the scenarios inside Experience Center One, this experience runs on Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service. It's a reminder that Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI — renewed and expanded in recent months — is still a key driver of commercial demand for the tech giant, even as both companies increasingly work with other industry partners.

Teams of agents are starting to redefine industrial work. The clearest example of this was a digital twin simulation from Mercedes-Benz — essentially a virtual version of a factory that lets engineers anticipate and diagnose issues without stopping real production.

The demo begins with a production alert triggered by a drop in efficiency. In a real plant, tracking down the cause (something as small as a slight angle change in a screw) might take a team of specialists days of sorting through machine logs and sensor data.

In Microsoft's version, a human manager simply asks the system to diagnose what's causing the problem, through a natural language interface. That question triggers a set of AI agents, each with a specific role: one pulls the right data, another retrieves machine logs, and a third interprets what it all means in plain language.

Within about 15 minutes, the system produces a clear explanation of the likely cause and possible fixes, shortcutting a task that could otherwise stretch across most of a week.

AI is compressing weeks or months of scientific research into days or hours. A demo focusing on Insilico Medicine's work with Microsoft showed how AI is starting to significantly collapse the timeline for drug discovery. 

The process begins with a “digital researcher” that scans huge amounts of public biomedical data to surface promising disease targets. It's the kind of work that would otherwise take teams of scientists months of reading and analysis.

A second system runs simulated chemistry experiments in the cloud, generating and ranking potential molecules that might bind to those targets. These simulations can be completed in a matter of days, or less, replacing weeks or even months of traditional laboratory work.

The demo follows a real example: Insilico used this workflow to identify a potential target for a lung disease and design molecules that could affect it. The company then synthesized dozens of these AI-generated compounds in the lab. One of them is now in Phase 2a human trials.

That's a small sampling of the demos inside Microsoft's Experience Center One. During our tour, we walked past displays for other major brands, including more iconic U.S. companies, but not everyone was on board to have the media spotlight cast upon their projects. As a condition of access, we agreed to stick to the examples cleared for public release.

Of course, the demos are carefully curated, and it remains to be seen how broadly companies will deploy these kinds of systems in their real-world operations.

In many ways, the facility is a successor to Microsoft's longtime Executive Briefing Center and conference facility, which remains in use a short walk away on the Redmond campus. 

Experience Center One has been in operation for a couple months, hosting delegations of business clients and political dignitaries, including the prime minister of Luxembourg this week.

It's closed to the public, invite-only. Employees can request access to visit.

Visitors arrive via a circular drive, with a plaque at the entrance dedicating the building to John Thompson, the former Microsoft board chair who led the search process that resulted in Satya Nadella's appointment as CEO. There are private briefing suites on the upper floors, and a full cafe on the second. The building also includes a conference center with three auditoriums. 

But perhaps the most distinct feature is the interactive portal. As they leave the demos, visitors walk through an immersive digital corridor with scenes of nature on the virtual walls.

Walking through the tunnel, motion sensors track their movement, causing digital leaves and particles on the wall-sized screens to swirl and flow in their wake.

The audio consists of nature sounds (birds, wind, and rustling trees) that were recorded locally in the Redmond and Sammamish area. And in a fittingly Pacific Northwest touch, the visual display is connected to a weather API. If it has been raining outside (as it often has been recently) the digital environment inside the tunnel turns rainy, too.

It's meant to be a final moment of grounding — a programmed moment of Zen to help executives decompress and center themselves as they contemplate the frontier ahead.

When Hannan Happi started thinking about how to solve the AI power crisis, he kept one figure in mind: one cent per kilowatt-hour.

“We went through all sorts of configurations and designs,” Happi, co-founder and CEO of Exowatt, told TechCrunch. “They all look different from each other. We tried to learn from every one of them: How do I reduce structural costs? How do I reduce maintenance costs? How do I optimize for this?”

After years of brainstorming and building, Exowatt's first step toward that goal is a simple box the size of a shipping container topped with a clear awning. Inside is similarly simple. If Exowatt can deliver on its promise of delivering cheap solar power that generates electricity 24-7, it could upend the data center market and broader energy world, delivering round-the-clock power at very low cost.

To scale production in pursuit of the one-cent per kWh target, Exowatt has raised an additional $50 million in an extension to its $70 million Series A round that closed in April, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. 

The extension was led by MVP Ventures and 8090 Industries with participation from Atomic, BAM, Bay Bridge Ventures, DeepWork Capital, Dragon Global, the Florida Opportunity Fund, Massive VC, New Atlas Capital, Overmatch, Protagonist, and StepStone. Previous investors include Andreessen Horowitz and Sam Altman.

Happi said that Exowatt wasn't looking to raise additional capital after the April round, but “strong momentum we saw in the market” and “strong investor interest” encouraged him to take the new money at a higher valuation.

Exowatt's backlog is currently about 10 million P3 units representing 90 gigawatt-hours of capacity, he said. “The goal is to scale as fast as possible to the millions and ultimately billions of units,” he said. The company should hit its one-cent target when production hits around 1 million units per year, Happi said.

Exowatt is basically repackaging a technology that's been around for decades. Known as concentrated solar power or thermal solar power, it uses the sun's energy to heat materials that are good at storing or transporting thermal energy. In cases where that thermal energy is stored for an extended period of time, those materials tend to be derived from or resemble rocks — hence the technology's nickname of “rocks in a box.”

Each P3 device consists of a metal box topped with lenses that focus the sunlight into a tight beam. That beam then heats a special brick inside the shipping container. A fan blows air over the brick to carry the heat to another box which contains a Stirling engine (a piston-driven device that converts heat to mechanical energy) and a generator. To store more power, developers would install more P3 boxes. “Everything is designed to be extremely simple,” Happi said.

Each thermal battery can retain heat for up to five days, ensuring continuous operation, and Exowatt will string several together to feed a single generator unit. How many depends on how quickly and how much electricity a customer wants to generate. The system's efficiency is on par with photovoltaic solar panels, and slightly better than PV paired with lithium-ion batteries, Happi said.

Other companies have built various approaches to the same technology, though most have failed to compete with photovoltaic solar and lithium-ion batteries, both of which have surprised experts with how quickly they've come down in cost.

Happi argued that the P3's small size and Exowatt's iterative approach sets it apart. There are just over 100 solar thermal or concentrated solar power projects that are planned, built, or decommissioned around the world, he said. “If you compare that to the fact that we produce 1.5 billion solar panels per year, you can see the learning curve effects are very, very far apart from each other. 

“What Exowatt is about is taking a modular system that we know in principle works, and really scaling the manufacturing of that and then applying the learning curves of manufacturing.”

Exowatt is unlikely to be cost-effective everywhere, and the number of P3 units needed to power a data center could require massive amounts of land. Plus, it works best in the sunniest regions, which could limit its broader impact. 

But Happi counters that there's a “high overlap” between where Exowatt's P3 excels and where new data centers are being built. “We're not running short of any projects to do,” he said.

SIMA 2, which can figure out how to solve problems inside virtual worlds, could lead to more general-purpose agents and better robots.

Google DeepMind has built a new video-game-playing agent called SIMA 2 that can navigate and solve problems in a wide range of 3D virtual worlds. The company claims it's a big step toward more general-purpose agents and better real-world robots.   

Google DeepMind first demoed SIMA (which stands for “scalable instructable multiworld agent”) last year. But SIMA 2 has been built on top of Gemini, the firm's flagship large language model, which gives the agent a huge boost in capability.

The researchers claim that SIMA 2 can carry out a range of more complex tasks inside virtual worlds, figure out how to solve certain challenges by itself, and chat with its users. It can also improve itself by tackling harder tasks multiple times and learning through trial and error.

“Games have been a driving force behind agent research for quite a while,” Joe Marino, a research scientist at Google DeepMind, said in a press conference this week. He noted that even a simple action in a game, such as lighting a lantern, can involve multiple steps: “It's a really complex set of tasks you need to solve to progress.”

The ultimate aim is to develop next-generation agents that are able to follow instructions and carry out open-ended tasks inside more complex environments than a web browser. In the long run, Google DeepMind wants to use such agents to drive real-world robots. Marino claimed that the skills SIMA 2 has learned, such as navigating an environment, using tools, and collaborating with humans to solve problems, are essential building blocks for future robot companions.

Unlike previous work on game-playing agents such as AlphaZero, which beat a Go grandmaster in 2016, or AlphaStar, which beat 99.8% of ranked human competition players at the video game StarCraft 2 in 2019, the idea behind SIMA is to train an agent to play an open-ended game without preset goals. Instead, the agent learns to carry out instructions given to it by people.

Humans control SIMA 2 via text chat, by talking to it out loud, or by drawing on the game's screen. The agent takes in a video game's pixels frame by frame and figures out what actions it needs to take to carry out its tasks.

Like its predecessor, SIMA 2 was trained on footage of humans playing eight commercial video games, including No Man's Sky and Goat Simulator 3, as well as three virtual worlds created by the company. The agent learned to match keyboard and mouse inputs to actions.

Hooked up to Gemini, the researchers claim, SIMA 2 is far better at following instructions (asking questions and providing updates as it goes) and figuring out for itself how to perform certain more complex tasks.  

Google DeepMind tested the agent inside environments it had never seen before. In one set of experiments, researchers asked Genie 3, the latest version of the firm's world model, to produce environments from scratch and dropped SIMA 2 into them. They found that the agent was able to navigate and carry out instructions there.

The researchers also used Gemini to generate new tasks for SIMA 2. If the agent failed, at first Gemini generated tips that SIMA 2 took on board when it tried again. Repeating a task multiple times in this way often allowed SIMA 2 to improve by trial and error until it succeeded, Marino said.

SIMA 2 is still an experiment. The agent struggles with complex tasks that require multiple steps and more time to complete. It also remembers only its most recent interactions (to make SIMA 2 more responsive, the team cut its long-term memory). It's also still nowhere near as good as people at using a mouse and keyboard to interact with a virtual world.

Julian Togelius, an AI researcher at New York University who works on creativity and video games, thinks it's an interesting result. Previous attempts at training a single system to play multiple games haven't gone too well, he says. That's because training models to control multiple games just by watching the screen isn't easy: “Playing in real time from visual input only is ‘hard mode,'” he says.

In particular, Togelius calls out GATO, a previous system from Google DeepMind, which—despite being hyped at the time—could not transfer skills across a significant number of virtual environments.  

Still, he is open-minded about whether or not SIMA 2 could lead to better robots. “The real world is both harder and easier than video games,” he says. It's harder because you can't just press A to open a door. At the same time, a robot in the real world will know exactly what its body can and can't do at any time. That's not the case in video games, where the rules inside each virtual world can differ.

Others are more skeptical. Matthew Guzdial, an AI researcher at the University of Alberta, isn't too surprised that SIMA 2 can play many different video games. He notes that most games have very similar keyboard and mouse controls: Learn one and you learn them all. “If you put a game with weird input in front of it, I don't think it'd be able to perform well,” he says.

Guzdial also questions how much of what SIMA 2 has learned would really carry over to robots. “It's much harder to understand visuals from cameras in the real world compared to games, which are designed with easily parsable visuals for human players,” he says.

Still, Marino and his colleagues hope to continue their work with Genie 3 to allow the agent to improve inside a kind of endless virtual training dojo, where Genie generates worlds for SIMA to learn in via trial and error guided by Gemini's feedback. “We've kind of just scratched the surface of what's possible,” he said at the press conference.   

We're increasingly developing bonds with chatbots. While that's safe for some, it's dangerous for others.

Machine translators have made it easier than ever to create error-plagued Wikipedia articles in obscure languages. What happens when AI models get trained on junk pages?

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

India is OpenAI's second-largest market, but ChatGPT and Sora reproduce caste stereotypes that harm millions of people.

Disabling the AMD External Events Utility service appears to be a workaround, but with modern disk caching, we aren't sure there's a tangible problem.

A Redditor has observed what, at best, might be classed as unexpected behavior precipitated by the AMD chipset drivers. Takia_Gecko has uncovered a bug/feature in AMD's drivers that causes a system log file to be repeatedly appended as on-screen windows are moved and/or rescaled. Undoubtedly, this is happening, but the most important question is whether it is a mountain or a molehill, and that is yet undetermined. Are the observed rapid, constant file writes going to impact system performance or wear the SSD? We've reached out to AMD for a definitive answer.

Modern computer systems do a lot of stuff in the background that everyday users might be completely unaware of. Opening up a system monitor, like the built-in Windows Task Manager, and expanding all the processes provides some insight into these behind-the-scenes goings-on. But most of what is happening – beyond the apps you use and the obvious Windows things – will likely be unfathomable to the majority.

Some enthusiasts and tinkerers are interested in tightly controlling and taming these processes, and we guess Takia_Gecko is one of these, and thus spotted this unexpected behavior. They have even developed a workaround, but without exhaustive and extensive testing aren't sure whether the wrinkle workaround has its own deep wrinkles…

The video embedded above gives you a super-clear view of the observed issue. What you are seeing is a log file in C:\Windows\System32\AMD\EEUDumps\ on Takia_Gecko's PC getting bombarded with updates in response to windows being manipulated on screen. This behavior was charted by a utility dubbed ReadDirectoryChangesW.

So, the unexpected behavior is quite certainly there. And, as a workaround, the Redditor discovered that it could be stopped by “redirecting writes to the whole [EEUDUmps] folder to nul:”. But is this machine-gunning of data to your SSD going to impact its health and longevity?

The frustrating answer we have right now is ‘probably not,' with an emphasis on the probably. Modern storage makes extensive and smart use of caching – even cacheless SSDs use some of your system RAM (e.g., HMB drives) to ease back on actual disk activity. These log file writes, though numerous and rapid, are apparently tiny, so they might not have any impact on concerns about SSD endurance, and so on.

Another legitimate concern among those with AMD chipset drivers installed is that this bug/feature might affect FreeSync. Takia_Gecko claims they confirmed with an AMD engineer that a Windows process spawned by the drivers, called ‘AMD External Events Utility,' is somehow related to the provision of FreeSync features.

This is an important observation because the Redditor noted that disabling this service/process prevents the log from being updated, thereby ending the errant, seemingly wasteful file writing. Alternatively, piping the process output to nul: is a workaround advanced by the Redditor. They note that this has no discernible effect on their system, but warn others to only do the same at their own risk.

Note that Takia_Gecko doesn't say whether their system uses FreeSync. Comments on this post don't establish any relationship between FreeSync functionality and this log file writing workaround, either.

We've reached out to AMD to ascertain whether these seemingly meaningless log file updates are going to be addressed in upcoming updates to its chipset drivers.

Running in bad socks sucks. If clocking up more than 65 marathons and 20 ultras, and plodding most of the way across Europe has taught me one thing, it is this: A runner is only as happy as his or her feet. You can drop hundreds of bucks on the best running shoes, but if you stick your foot into an old gym sock, you still risk ending up with blisters.

Running socks—along with running underwear—are probably as mission-critical to your comfort as anything else you work out in. It's why regular ultra runners change their socks for a big psychological boost mid-race. If your socks fit poorly, hold onto sweat, or fail to cushion your steps, it's a fast ticket to hot spots and Blisterville. And if they don't look the part, forget the PR.

To help you avoid all of that, we've run our way through the unending variety of cut, cushion, and yes, color, to find options worth their price tags. Whether you're someone logging daily miles for fitness, a trail-taming ultrarunner, or a twice-a-week jogger, there's a sock for you. Don't see anything you like?

Runners often lace up daily trainers for their regular mileage and save race day running shoes for when things get serious. I take the same approach to running socks. I'll train in my race socks–because “nothing new on race day”–but I avoid putting too much mileage and wear into those pricier options. For soaking up the strain of the everyday mileage, I reach for a reliable, hard-wearing, daily workhorse sock. These tick all the right boxes: excellent mid-cushion with extra protection where the impact hits hardest, great fit, blister-busting seamless toes, and effective moisture control. That's a lot of performance for a $30 three-pack.

Stance

Zappos

In race mode on the road, over almost any distance, I reach for Stance socks. I've run countless blister-free marathons and ultras in the Stance Performance Run Crew. But these lighter, thinner crew socks work even better with the snug fit of the latest carbon-plate super shoes like the Puma Fast R3. You get a happy balance of ample road-softening under the ball of your foot, at the heel, and across the top of the toes, but they're thinner elsewhere to stay light and race-shoe friendly. They handle moisture well too—an excellent mid-cushioned sock that's great for comfort on longer runs.

Asics

When you're long-hauling, guaranteed comfort is critical. These performance crew socks have it all: plenty of cushioning on the sole, extra toe box padding to protect your pinky toes, and cuffs that stay put but don't dig trenches in your calves. The highly effective mesh ventilation also means even my very sweaty feet finished two-hour marathon training runs relatively dry. You can also get them at a quarter height, and Asics is kicking out some pretty snazzy designs.

Stepping off the asphalt onto the trail calls for different sock considerations, like more ankle coverage to protect you from the brush and extra cushioning to dampen the shock from roots and rocks. The Trail Max Cushion does both. The low-ish 2-inch quarter length shields your ankles from scrapes and scratches and deflects the dirt and debris. The high-cushion and seamless toes offer easy comfort, without being so thick that you lose that all-important connection with the terrain underfoot. They're also well reinforced with nylon in high-wear areas, so they'll go for hundreds of miles.

Stox

Stox (Women's)

Not all compression socks are made equal. While plenty claim to offer the boosted blood flow benefits of the big squeeze, few actually deliver the medical-grade compression you need to reap the rewards, like delaying muscle fatigue, clearing lactic acid, and speeding recovery. Stox's graduated 23- to 32-mmHg compression is the real deal, delivering excellent calf support that's great for longer runs, races, and recovery plods. The seamless circular knit helps ward off blisters, and there's extra padding in the toes and heels to boost comfort. They're also great for trail runs to protect you from scratchy foliage—or ticks.

Swiftwick

Swiftwick

The WIRED test team are longtime fans of Swiftwick's line of minimal socks. The thinner fabric performs well in hotter weather, and there's a small tab to prevent heel rub. What I really love is the Y-shaped heel that molds to your foot and stays there—no slipping, sliding, bunching, or rubbing. They're thin enough to work well with closer-fitting running shoes and a great option for shorter races and hybrid workouts. If you're looking for a great thin sock that works for many sports, these are the ones to get.

Darn Tough

Darn Tough (Men's)

Darn Tough (Women's)

There are some big upsides to slipping your feet into merino socks. The natural material is thermoregulating, moisture-wicking, and sustainable. (And really soft and comfy.) These quarter-length trail and road-ready numbers from Darn Tough blend merino with nylon and lycra and have become a favorite. I like the lighter mesh across the top of the foot for airiness and flexibility, and the leg cuffs don't droop, even after many months of wear-wash cycles. If you stray into wet weather or you're forced to plod through puddles, they dry fast.

Tracksmith

Tracksmith

Adrienne So hesitates to recommend expensive socks, but these are compressive, they don't fall down, and they're black, so they don't get as stained and gross as white ones. Crew socks are better for cooler days or anywhere you might get a little dust or mud on your ankles, and Tracksmith's gorgeous and simple designs—for these socks, as well as shorts, shirts, and hats—are some of the best in the business.

Uyn

Uyn

I have a recurring problem with toe-on-toe aggression. Basically my toes sit too close to each other, so after a while the little pinky gets battered from being trodden on. That's not great for an ultra runner. But UYN's toe-separating Five Socks are a revelation, albeit an expensive one. I've used them twice to run a 22-hour, 100-mile ultra along the Berlin Wall trail, and I've never finished a race with my feet so intact—no blisters, no hot spots, no discomfort. Beyond the toe-sock design, the padding puts thicker fabric in all the right places for long-haul cushion, and they handle heat exceptionally well. I ran in 80 degrees and the ventilation was top notch.

H&M

H&M

If you're a casual runner, you probably don't need the highest-end socks around. Instead, snag a multipack of these totally serviceable socks from H&M. The blend of cotton, spandex and nylon is quite thick, can get a bit hot, and wouldn't be my first choice for runs over an hour. But they're more than up to shorter jogs and jumping from the treadmill to the gym floor. The high-rise ribbed legs don't sag, there's an almost-seamless toe, and plenty of cushion in all the right places. At $18 for a 5-pack, they're excellent value.

Lululemon

Lululemon

Whether it's there for safety or style, we're not 100 percent sure. Maybe a bit of both. But the reflective grid pattern built into Lululemon's unisex Power Stride Crew socks does a good job of making you more visible when you're running in the dark. The cushioning is on the lighter side, and if you like lots of padding there are better options. But I like the way the heel cup wraps your foot for excellent hold, and I also like the extra midfoot support from the arch band.

Balega

Amazon

Fleet Feet

If you're after maximum cushion and comfort in a no-show running sock, you can stop looking right now. Balega's Hidden Comfort socks take plushness to the next level with a thick layer of super soft, almost terry-towel-like fabric right across the bottom of your foot and an extra-deep heel pocket for some serious coziness. Up top, it's all much thinner, more flexible and breathable. That offsets the weight of the underfoot cushioning, helps dissipate heat, and keeps the sweat at bay, even when you're grinding hard. The heel tabs are highly padded too. Some no-show socks risk heel rub, but there's none of that here. Oh, and they come in a huge selection of colors, so it's easy to round off your matchy-matchy run fit.

Real estate brokerage platform Redfin released a conversational chatbot to help house hunters search for homes using natural language.

The tool lets users describe what they want and refine results through back-and-forth dialogue. Unlike real estate platforms that offer only one-off natural-language queries, Redfin says its chatbot can ask clarifying questions, respond to feedback, and surface more tailored recommendations.

“We relied on search filters to define queries for years, but people share more about their preferences when it's a conversation,” Ariel Dos Santos, Redfin senior vice president of product and design, said in a statement.

Seattle-based Redfin, acquired by Rocket Companies in July, built the system with Sierra, the AI customer experience platform recently valued at $10 billion.

Redfin and other real estate companies are racing to deploy conversational AI tools. Last month, fellow Seattle real estate giant Zillow unveiled the first real estate app within ChatGPT.

Redfin's new conversational interface aims to mirror how buyers talk to a real agent — but with the advantage of scanning every listing on Redfin nationwide. Home shoppers can tell the chatbot what they're looking for, react to suggested listings (“more like this, but with an extra bedroom”), or adjust search criteria as new ideas arise. The feature also supports multiple languages.

As buyers interact with the chatbot, it “learns from real user conversations” to deliver increasingly relevant options over time, according to the company.

Early testing suggests that the feature is well-received. Users of the conversational search technology viewed nearly twice as many homes as those using filtered searches. They were also 47% more inclined to ask for a tour or other Redfin services, the company reported. 

The tool is available on Redfin.com and mobile web, and will come to Redfin's iOS app in December.

Last year the company launched its “Ask Redfin” generative AI assistant designed for homebuyer questions about a specific listing.

The Allen Institute in Seattle has released the Brain Knowledge Platform, a research aid described as the most comprehensive artificial intelligence tool available for neuroscience.

The project aims to unify brain information from dozens of collaborators, species (such as humans, other primates and mice), and samples that span early development to old age, encompassing diverse data including cell types and disease indicators. 

Using AI, this data has been translated into a shared scientific language or format, allowing for “apples-to-apples” comparisons across institutions and organisms to create a much larger dataset for new insights.

“Understanding the brain is not a single institute's effort,” said Shoaib Mufti, the Allen Institute's head of data and technology. “So you have to bring the community together in order to understand it.”

There's an urgent need to better prevent, diagnose and treat neurological conditions. The number of people worldwide living with or dying from conditions like stroke, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and meningitis has increased significantly over recent decades, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. 

In 2021, an estimated 3.4 billion people experienced a nervous system condition, which also includes brain injuries and migraines. 

To create the Brain Knowledge Platform, the Allen Institute recruited participants to voluntarily share their data. Contributors include the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, teams at the University of Washington and Harvard University, the Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Brain Cell Atlas, or SEA-AD, and others.

Amazon Web Services engineered the tool's core computing infrastructure while Google developed AI models for the neuroscience. Funding came from the Allen Institute as well as the National Institutes of Health's Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative, or BRAIN Initiative.

Mufti said the resource is designed to be a “discovery platform,” not a traditional research tool where a scientist has a clear idea of what they are looking for. “How you can get to the ‘aha moments' so you find something unexpected?” he asked.

Using the platform, scientists will be able to look across diseases. Studying the differences and similarities between people diagnosed with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, for example, was previously laborious to make the data comparable. 

With the Brain Knowledge Platform, “you can literally line those up side by side in the tool,” said Tyler Mollenkopf, associate director of data and technology at the Allen Institute.

While much of the data comes from research animals, information gathered from human brains — including 84 postmortem donors — is also available, stripped from identifying details. 

The resource is offered to scientists for free. The team hopes more organizations contribute data and they're devising a mechanism to provide attribution to credit researchers for their information, which could encourage sharing.

Given the massive societal impact of brain diseases “a real breakthrough is needed” to better understand them, said Mufti. “Let's bring all the information together and make it discoverable. I'm hoping that [we] can really move the ball forward in a single community.”

The post's comments section quickly turned into a ravenous pool of AI- and cloud-hating piranhas.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Microsoft's President of Windows & Devices, Pavan Davuluri, has taken to social media to share his enthusiasm about the evolution of Windows. The Microsoft exec wanted to share his excitement about how Windows is "evolving into an agentic OS." But we didn't see anyone celebrating alongside Davuluri. Rather, the comments section was quickly overrun with sharp criticism, reflecting widespread unease about the direction Microsoft seems to be taking Windows.

Windows is evolving into an agentic OS, connecting devices, cloud, and AI to unlock intelligent productivity and secure work anywhere. Join us at #MSIgnite to see how frontier firms are transforming with Windows and what's next for the platform. We can't wait to show you!…November 10, 2025

Davuluri used his X profile to share information about a breakout session at Microsoft Ignite. The developer-focused event will take place at large, prestigious venues such as the Chase Center and the Moscone Center in San Francisco next week.

“Windows is evolving into an agentic OS, connecting devices, cloud, and AI to unlock intelligent productivity and secure work anywhere,” Davuluri wrote on his public profile page. “Join us at #MSIgnite to see how frontier firms are transforming with Windows and what's next for the platform. We can't wait to show you!”

Davuluri's enthusiasm regarding the evolution of Windows faced overwhelmingly negative criticism. If we had to condense the replies into a single, representative, super-reply, it would probably read something like this: ‘No one wants this; we are fed up with AI everything; Windows needs tuning for performance; and Linux is looking good.'

In some ways, we agree with the Windows and PC enthusiast old-guard. The execs that steer Windows might be advised to remember that, first and foremost, it is an operating system and should be honed to facilitate the operations its users wish to complete. Whatever frills it adds — whatever side dishes it offers — the OS definitely should not get in the way of users, and interruptions of computer workflows, entertainment, and gaming fun should be red-flagged as being contrary to the prime directive.

Having said that, some of the negativity from social media commenters went a little off the rails. Davuluri's highlighted Ignite session seems to be targeted at ‘frontier firms,' and if they want the Windows features described, laced with artificial intelligence and connected cloud trimmings, it seems fair that Microsoft should address them. As long as these features aren't foisted on users who want to ignore the OS and focus on their apps, content, and games, we don't think there will be an uprising or a mass exodus in the immediate future.

Uber once touted itself as an alternative to car ownership. Data, however, show that over a decade into the ride-hailing revolution, car ownership is here to stay—even in places where Lyft, Uber, and Waymo run rampant.

In 2023 Uber had a profitable year—its first since it went public and started having to disclose its financials. So it's worth traveling back to the early days of ride-hailing, to revisit the beautiful future proposed by at-the-time CEO Travis Kalanick. In the days when Uber had just blown up, he described his “vision” to the Wall Street Journal like this:

So what is that vision?… It's a reflection of our mission to turn ground transportation into a seamless service. Basically make car ownership a thing of the past…If you just looked at San Francisco, the ground transportation market in just San Francisco — where people pay to get in a car and go somewhere, whether they own the car or otherwise — is $22 billion. No wonder we're several hundred million in size just in SF, and growing faster this year than last year.

Uber is now a load-bearing pillar of the tech economy, and ride-hailing is now a regular feature of life, so it seems like a good time to check in on Kalanick's vision. He seemed to be arguing that his app's success in San Francisco in 2011 was an indication of a transition away from personal car ownership already in progress. Did his dream come true?

A brief report published Wednesday, compiled from census data, says, basically: LOL.

The data on car ownership show that not only hasn't transportation become as simple as tapping your phone, being whisked away, and never having to worry about tire rotation again, but the trends look like they're going a little in the opposite direction. In dense areas served by ride-hailing services, car ownership is basically flat since the birth of Uber, or even inching slightly up.

The report is from retired automotive researcher Glenn Mercer, who writes a newsletter called “Car Charts,” which is about car charts.

Looking at the crude totals without controlling for other factors, Mercer found that nationally, there were 800 cars per 1,000 Americans in 2000, and about 850 per 1,000 Americans now—lots more cars, as anyone would probably guess.

But instead of leaving it there, he looked closely at major metropolitan areas, focusing on the census metrics that reveal the number of “vehicles available to the members of the household” where ride-hailing services are popular. Mercer focuses on certain representative years from 2005-2024—before Uber, during Uber's rise, and the most recent year with data.

During that time, these were the changes in the chart's raw metric, with a one-point increase or decrease basically corresponding to, “one one-hundredth of a car per household”:

In other words, no significant change anywhere, although the one tenth of a car increase in Dallas is somewhat eyebrow-raising.

Mercer's analysis is that, he doesn't “see any real impact on cars per household. Even in the Bay area, the ancestral home of All Things App, no movement.”

With that in mind, did you know the cost of the average new car in the US is now over $50,000? A 2023 report by Brookings argues that young people own fewer cars than members of older generations simply because they don't have enough money to buy cars. A Deloitte report from earlier this year found that 44% of adults 34 and under would be willing to get rid of their cars in favor of a valid alternative.

So it seems like there was nothing wrong with Kalanick's “vision.” It would be great. It's just too bad ride-hailing services haven't turned out to be the path to making it a reality. Not yet, anyway.

Gizmodo reached out to Uber for comment, and will update if we hear back.

They themselves are likely to some extent the victims of social engineering as well. After all who benefits from creating exploits for online games and getting children to become script kiddies? Its easier (and probably safer) to make money off of cyber crime if your role isn't committing the crimes yourself. It isn't illegal to create premium software that could in theory be use for crime if you don't market it that way.

To gift to a 529 regardless of the financial institution, you go to some random ugift529.com site and put in a code plus all your financial info.  This is considered the gold standard.To get a payout from a class-action lawsuit that leaked your data, you must go to some other random site (usually some random domain name loosely related to the settlement recently registered by kroll)  and enter basically more PII than was leaked in the first place.To pay your fed taxes with a credit card, you must verify your identity with some 3rd party site, then go to yet another 3rd party site to enter your CC info.This is insane and forces/trains people to perform actions that in many other scenarios lead to a phishing attack.

Right! But, wouldn't a more appropriate approach be to mitigate the damage from being hacked as much as possible in the first place? Perhaps this starts by simplifying bloated systems, reducing data collection to data that which is only absolutely legally necessary for KYC and financial transactions in whatever respective country(ies) the service operates in, hammer-testing databases for old tricks that seem to have been forgotten about in a landscape of hacks with ever-increasingly complexity, etc.Maybe it's the dad in me, years of telling me son to not apologize, but to avoid the behavior that causes the problem in the first place. Bad things happen, and we all screw up from time to time, that is a fact of life, but a little forethought and consideration about the best or safest way to do a thing is a great way to shrink the blast area of any surprise bombs that go off.

What an odd thing to teach a child. If you've wronged someone, avoiding the behavior in future is something that'll help you, but does sweet fuck all for the person you just wronged. They still deserve an apology.

But yes, even if you try to make a healthy balance, there are still plenty of times when an apology are appropriate and will go a long way, for the giver and receiver, in my opinion anyway.

Even so, we still need to keep an eye out. A couple of days ago, an old account (not quite a year), started spewing connection requests to all the app users. It had been a legit account, so I have to assume it was pwned. We deleted it quickly.A lot of our monitoring is done manually, and carefully. We have extremely strict privacy rules, and that actually makes security monitoring a bit more difficult.

reply

Such data is a liability, not an asset and if you dispose of it as soon as you reasonably can that's good. If this is a communications service consider saving a hash of the ID and refusing new sign ups with that same ID because if the data gets deleted then someone could re-sign up with someone else's old account. But if you keep a copy of the hash around you can check if an account has ever existed and refuse registration if that's the case.

reply

It's important that "delete all my information" also deletes everything after the user logs in for the first time.Also, I'm not sure that Apple would allow it. They insist that deletion remove all traces of the user. As far as I know, there's no legal mandate to retain anything, and the nature of our demographic, means that folks could be hurt badly by leaks.So we retain as little information as possible -even if that makes it more difficult for us to adminster, and destroy everything, when we delete.

Exactly. I think it is great for people like you to inject some more realistic expectations into discussions like these.An entity like Amazon is not - in the longer term - going to escape fate, but they have more budget and (usually) much better internal practices which rule out the kind of thing that would bring down a lesser org. But in the end it is all about the budget, as long as Amazon's budget is significantly larger than the attackers they will probably manage to stay ahead. But if they ever get complacent or start economizing on security then the odds change very rapidly. Your very realistic stance is one of the reasons it hasn't happened yet, you are acutely aware you are in spite of all of your efforts still at risk.Blast radius reduction by removing data you no longer need (and that includes the marketing department, who more often than not are the real culprit) is a good first step towards more realistic expectations for any org.

Every additional nine of not getting hacked takes effort. Getting to 100% takes infinite effort i.e. is impossible. Trying to achieve the impossible will make you spin on the spot chasing ever more obscure solutions.As soon as you understand a potential solution enough to implement it you also understand that it cannot achieve the impossible. If you keep insisting on achieving the impossible you have to abandon this potential solution and pin your hope on something you don't understand yet. And so the cycle repeats.It is good to hold people accountable but only demand the impossible from those you want to go crazy.

In terms of "downplaying" it seems like they are pretty concrete in sharing the blast radius. If less than 25% of users were affected, how else should they phrase this? They do say that this was data used for onboarding merchants that was on a system that was used in the past and is no longer used.I am as annoyed by companies sugar coating responses, but here the response sounds refreshingly concrete and more genuine than most.

In my country, this debate is being held WRT the atrocities my country committed in its (former) colonies, and towards enslaved humans¹. Our king and prime minister never truly "apologized". Because, I kid you not, the government fears that this opens up possibilities for financial reparation or compensation and the government doesn't want to pay this. They basically searched for the words that sound as close to apologies as possible, but aren't words that require one to act on the apologies.¹ I'm talking about The Netherlands. Where such atrocities were committed as close as one and a half generations ago still (1949) (https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/blog/2022/10/how-do-dutc...) but mostly during what is still called "The Golden Age".

It's a sliding scale, where payment firmly pushes you in the more comfortable direction.Also, the uncomfortable truth is that ransomware payments are very common. Not paying will make essentially no difference, the business would probably still be incredibly lucrative even if payment rates dropped to 5% of what they are now.If there was global co-operation to outlaw ransom payments, that'd be great. Until then, individual companies refusing to pay is largely pointless.

If your company gets hit by one of these groups and you want to protect your customers, paying is almost always the most effective way to do that. Someone who isn't particularly interested in protecting their customers probably wouldn't pay if the damage from not paying would be lower than the cost of paying.A third possibility is that you simply feel uncomfortable about paying, which is fine, but it isn't a particularly rational basis for the decision.I think we can also fairly assume that the vast majority of people have no strong feelings about ransomware, so there's likely going to be no meaningful reputational damage caused by paying.

The extortionist knows they cannot prove they destroyed the data, so they will eventually sell it anyway.They will maybe hold off for a bit to prove their "reputation" or "legitimacy". Just don't pay.

The ransom payments tend to be so big anyway that selling the data and associated reputational damage is most likely not worth the hassle.Basic game theory shows that the best course of action for any ransomware group with multiple victims is to act honestly. You can never be sure, but the incentives are there and they're pretty obvious.The big groups are making in the neighbourhood of $billions, earning extra millions by sabotaging their main source of revenue seems ridiculous.

However they don't really need to because there are plenty of documented cases, and the incident response company you hire will almost certainly have prior knowledge of the group you're forced to deal with.If they had a history of fucking over their “customers”, the IR team you hired would know and presumably advise against paying.

Yes, the data might still leak. It's absurd to suggest that it's not less likely to leak if you pay.There's a reason why businesses very frequently arrive at the conclusion that it's better to pay, and it's not because they're stupid or malicious. They actually have money on the line too, unlike almost everyone who would criticise them for paying.

Picking up hundreds of thousands at best (very few databases would be worth so much) when your main business pays millions or tens of millions per victim simply isn't worth it, selling the data would jeopardise their main business which is orders of magnitude more profitable.Absolutely no IR company will advise their clients to pay if the particular ransomware group is known to renege on their promises.

I see it more as a middle finger to the perps: “look, we can afford to pay, here, see us pay that amount elsewhere, but you aren't getting it”. It isn't signalling virtue as much as it is signalling “fuck you and your ransom demands” in the hope that this will mark them as not an easy target for that sort of thing in future.

For customers it signals sincerity and may help dampen outrage in their follow up dealings.

It's also a term you can use against political opponents because it's much easier to speak well than to actually do good.Refusing to negociate with criminals and help fund security seems like the proper long-term reaction for everyone.

Making it illegal to pay ransom is likely a much easier to implement and more effective solution.And this isn't virtue signaling - they literally did the virtuous thing that is better for society at the expense of their bottom line. That is just virtue.

Yes there are negative externalities in funding ransomware operations, not paying is still much more likely to hurt your customers than paying.

reply

Besides, if they were genuinely interested in positive externalities they would be spending the money lobbying for a ransomware payments ban and not donating to universities.

reply

You send them the payment, they tell you they deleted the data, but they also sell the data to 10 other customers over the dark-web.Why would you ever trust people who are inherently trustworthy and who are trying to screw you? While also encouraging further ransomware crimes in the future.

If you don't pay, the odds they will publish your data are closer to 100%. If you do pay, the odds have historically been much closer to 0% than 100%You aren't paying to be sure, but to improve your chances.

Often times it would have been easier to rebuild the whole project over trying to upgrade 5-6 year old dependencies.Ultimately the companies do not care about these kinda incidents. They say sorry, everyone laughs at them for a week and then after its business as usual, with that one thing fixed and still rolling legacy stuff for everything else.

They failed so damn bad and it's hilariously bad and I feel awful for the somewhat competent coworker who was stuck on that team and dealt with how awful it was.Then we fired most of that team like 3 times because of how value negative they have been.Then my coworker and I rebuilt it in java in 2 months. It is 100x faster, has almost no bugs, accidentally avoided tons of data management bugs that plague the python version (because java can't have those problems the way we wrote it) and I built us tooling to achieve bug for bug compatibility (using trivial to patch out helpers), and it is trivially scalable but doesn't need to because it's so much faster and uses way less memory.If the people in charge of a project are fucking incompetent yeah nothing good will ever happen, but if you have even semi-competent people under reasonable management (neither of us are even close to rockstars) and the system you are trying to rewrite has obvious known flaws, plenty of time you will build a better system.

To me it seems most likely that this is data collected during the KYC process during onboarding, meaning company documents, director passport or ID card scans, those kind of things. So the risk here for at least a few more years until all identity documents have expired is identity theft possibilities (e.g. fraudsters registering their company with another PSP using the stolen documents and then processing fraudulent payments until they get shut down, or signing up for bank accounts using their info and tax id).

reply

If you read between the lines of the verbiage here, it looks like a general archived dropbox of stuff like PDF documents which the onboarding team used.Since GDPR etc, items like passports, driving license data etc, has been kept in far more secure areas that low-level staff (e.g. people doing merchant onboarding) won't have easy access to.I could be wrong but I would be fairly surprised if JPGs of passports were kept alongside docx files of merchant onboarding questionnaires.

How do you qualify this statement? Did you mean “should never”? Even then, you're likely overstating things. Nothing prevents co-locating KYC/KYB information. On the contrary, most businesses conducting KYB are required to conduct UBO and they're trained to combine them both. Register as a director/officer with any FSI in North America and you'll see.

reply

reply

Why would merchants fill out docx files? They would submit an online form with their business, director and UBO details, that data would be stored in the Checkout.com merchants database, and any supporting documents like passport scans would be stored in a cloud storage system, just like the one that got hacked.If it was just some internal PDFs used by the onboarding team, probably they wouldn't make such a big announcement.

This sort of data is generally treated very differently to the actual PANs and payment information (which are highly encrypted using HSMs).So it's obviously shitty to get hacked, but if it was just KYB (or KYC) type information, it's not harming any individuals. A lot of KYB information is public (depending on country).Fair play on them for being open about this.

This is definitely not the case. If you make $100 profit and you would have had to pay 20% corporate tax, then you pay $20 in taxes, you'd be left with $80 to buy chocolate or whatever you want.If you donate $20 and deduct it from your profit, then your profit is now calculated at $80. So you pay $16 in taxes. So you saved $4 but spent $20, so you're $16 dollars down and now you only have $64 for chocolate, so not 'essentially nothing'.

Unless you're positing some very specific, unusual situation, this isn't how tax deductibility works. The dollar amount of a tax deductible donation is subtracted from your taxable income, not from your tax bill. So you're getting a discount on the donation equal to your marginal tax rate.

reply

That's not how tax deduction works.

Example:You earn $100,000.You donate $10,000 to a qualifying charity.You can now deduct that $10,000, i.e. you'll be taxed as if you earned $90,000, not $100,000.If your marginal tax rate is 30%, you'll save 30% of $10,000 = $3,000 in taxes.
So you're still out $7,000 in real money.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

With the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 30) underway this week, researchers have shared a first look at this year's carbon emissions data. The findings show that global emissions from fossil fuels are on track to hit a record high in 2025.

The Global Carbon Budget report, produced by an international team of more than 130 scientists and published on Wednesday, predicts roughly 42 billion tons (38 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuels this year. That's a 1.1% increase from 2024.

Based on this and other factors, limiting global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels—the threshold set by the Paris Agreement in 2015—will be virtually impossible, the authors conclude. To stabilize the current warming trend, we don't just need to cut our emissions, we need to bring them down to zero.

In times like these, it's easy to despair. But the report's lead author, Pierre Friedlingstein—a University of Exeter professor specializing in global carbon cycle modeling and director of the Global Carbon Budget Office—says the findings should galvanize the world to act now to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

“There is no alternative,” Friedlingstein told Gizmodo. “We have to remain hopeful because we have to tackle the climate change issue.”

Believe it or not, the report isn't all bad news. While the data suggests that fossil fuel emissions have risen, total global carbon emissions—a combination of emissions from fossil fuels and land use—are projected to be slightly lower than last year.

“There are certainly signs in [the report] that emissions are really starting to slow down their increase or change direction,” said Piers Forster, a professor of physical climate change and founding director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds, who was not involved in the study.

Speaking with Gizmodo from COP 30 in Belém, Brazil, Forster pointed to China's leadership in electrification and renewable energy as a sign that we may be reaching a turning point not just in terms of emissions, but also in the availability of climate solutions.

Though China remains the world's biggest CO2 emitter, the report finds that its emissions growth has slowed thanks to moderate growth in energy consumption combined with extraordinary growth in renewables. Indeed, China has emerged as a key leader at COP 30 this year, especially in the absence of the world's second-biggest CO2 emitter: the U.S.

The report also highlights a projected decline in emissions from land-use change—most notably deforestation. This was what tipped the scales on total global carbon emissions this year, slightly offsetting the rise in fossil fuel emissions.

“The deforestation rate is declining in South America, but also in other parts of the world,” Friedlingstein said. “And reforestation is also slowly increasing.” That said, emissions from deforestation and land-use change are still far from zero, he clarified.

The report's findings come with several caveats. First and foremost, looking at the global carbon budget report for a single year is not a good indication of long-term progress—or lack thereof—toward climate goals, Friedlingstein notes. Still, these reports are crucial for keeping the international community on track and informing year-to-year decisions on emission reduction strategies and targets.

It's also worth noting that the report only looks at CO2 emissions—it does not account for other greenhouse gases such as methane. And for all the progress China has made toward decarbonizing its economy and the reductions we're seeing in deforestation, the world is still nowhere close to achieving net-zero emissions.

“We've still got heaps to go,” Forster said. “I mean, we've got greenhouse gas emissions at an all-time high. We've got a tiny remaining carbon budget to [avoid] 1.5℃. So we have this huge sense of urgency, we have to get our emissions back down.”

One of the most alarming findings from the report is that 8% of the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration since 1960 is due to climate change itself. Rising global temperatures have reduced the efficiency of land and ocean carbon sinks, essentially weakening Earth's ability to counteract humanity's growing emissions. A companion paper published in Nature discusses this finding in greater detail.

In spite of these circumstances, both Friedlingstein and Forster emphasize that hope is key to progress, and progress is our only hope. “There is no plan B,” Friedlingstein said. “Adapting and not doing anything in terms of mitigation is not an option.”

Though Forster said he is not optimistic based on what the current research shows, he finds hope at the UN climate negotiations. “Cooperation between countries is so important,” he said. “I think there are still actors in every country who do see the threat of climate change and want to make a difference.”

Pinned between the stomach and spine, the pancreas supervises both digestion and blood sugar in the body. It's also the site of an aggressive cancer called pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or PDAC. 

PDAC is the most common type of pancreatic cancer, the third-leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. It's difficult to detect and recurs about 70% of the time after treatment. Only 13% of those diagnosed survive more than five years. 

A team of surgeons, anesthesiologists and engineers at the University of Illinois Chicago is studying how lidocaine, a common local anesthetic, affects pancreatic cancer cells released into the bloodstream during surgery. Their latest advancement evaluates a method for capturing these rogue cells and is published in the journal Lab on a Chip.

I really expect that the results of this study may help our patients. The notion that lidocaine, which has been used to relieve pain for more than 65 years, may mitigate metastasis and favorably affect patient outcomes is highly innovative." 

Dr. Gina Votta-Velis, UIC professor of anesthesiology in the College of Medicine and lead investigator

In 2018, Votta-Velis received a grant from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine for this project. Circulating tumor cells are cancerous cells that break away from the tumor - often during tumor-removal surgery - and escape into the bloodstream. Patients with more aggressive circulating tumor cells in their blood have poorer prognoses and higher recurrence rates. 

Votta-Velis said patients must recover from surgery before starting chemotherapy. In that window of time, circulating tumor cells, or CTCs, can travel throughout the body and spawn new tumors. But preliminary in-vitro studies have shown that lidocaine may hamper cells from bursting back out of the bloodstream, instead trapping them to be naturally cleaned out by our immune systems.

"CTCs are the seeds of metastasis," she said. "If we can detect them and decrease their aggressiveness with lidocaine infusion, we may lower the risk of the metastatic process." 

Because circulating tumor cells are rare, isolating them could mean pulling 30 to 40 cells out of the billions in our bloodstream - just like pulling a needle from a haystack. That's why Votta-Velis teamed up with fellow University of Illinois Cancer Center affiliate Ian Papautsky, the UIC Richard and Loan Hill Professor of Biomedical Engineering in the College of Engineering. He specializes in microfluidics: how small amounts of fluids, like blood, flow through minute channels. 

His contribution to the project is a small microfluidic device, fabricated from glass and plastic, measuring just a couple of inches long and containing channels just wider than a strand of hair. The device isolates cancer cells from a patient's blood sample based on their size - a process referred to as a liquid biopsy. 

"CTCs are typically larger than white blood cells, which are larger than red blood cells. Cancer cells also tend to be softer and more moldable," Papautsky said. "When we put the blood into this device, we can filter out the CTCs without modifying or damaging the cells." 

In 2019, Papautsky's team demonstrated that this method picks out cancer cells with 93% accuracy. This time, the researchers compared Papautsky's method to a commercially available tool called EasySep, which pulls cells apart magnetically. Papautsky said magnetic separation can be harsh and sometimes destroy the cells it's attempting to catch. 

The researchers tested both systems - EasySep and their original method - with blood samples from pancreatic cancer patients. They found that Papautsky's method recovered eight times as many cancer cells and processed blood samples faster, in as little as 20 minutes. 

"The method's success is so important for asymptomatic cancers like pancreatic cancer, where a blood draw may be the only way to diagnose early," Papautsky said. 

Dr. Pier Giulianotti, a co-investigator and the division chief of general, minimally invasive and robotic surgery in the College of Medicine, said this discovery opens the door to the next generation of personalized medical treatment. 

"Science is based on little steps," said Giulianotti, who is a world-renowned expert in the surgical treatment of hepatobiliary pancreatic cancer malignancies. "And this is a very good step. Most malignant cancers in humans spread through the bloodstream. Understanding how cancer cells are released into the bloodstream and being able to control this process is very, very important." 

Additional UIC researchers include Celine Macaraniag, Ifra Khan, Alexandra Barabanova, Valentina Valle and Alain Borgeat. Jian Zhou of Rush University Medical Center is a coauthor.

Platelets are small, disc-shaped cell fragments in the blood that are essential to stop bleeding and to initiate blood clotting after injury. Platelet transfusions in patients with severe trauma or medical conditions, including bone marrow disease, leukemia, or sepsis, can be lifesaving. Despite being a standard clinical practice, platelet transfusions face issues related to the availability of blood donations from which platelets are isolated, the relatively short shelf life of purified platelets, and the risk of an immune response in patients receiving platelets from unmatched donors.

A potential solution to this has been proposed by the team of Koji Eto at the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application at Kyoto University, Japan, who invented a method for manufacturing platelet-producing cells, megakaryocytes, from stem cells. Via genetic engineering, Koji's team first made so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and then converted them into megakaryocytes in the lab. Platelets can then be harvested from the megakaryocyte cultures and given back to the same patient, thereby avoiding immune rejection.

Although this strategy, in theory, provides an unlimited supply of patient-derived platelets, some impediments towards industrial large-scale production remain, most notably variable efficiency of platelet production from megakaryocytes across different patients and a decrease in productivity over time.

In their work published today in Stem Cell Reports, Eto's team addresses these issues by showing that megakaryocyte growth is directly linked to platelet production and is controlled by the protein KAT7, which acts as a "molecular switch." While megakaryocytes with high KAT7 levels divide fast and make high amounts of platelets, megakaryocytes with low KAT7 levels switch behavior-they stop multiplying, accumulate DNA damage, and produce more inflammatory proteins-while at the same time ceasing platelet production.

This work demonstrates that maintaining high cellular KAT7 levels is essential for consistently high platelet production from stem cell-derived megakaryocytes. Monitoring KAT7 levels can potentially be used for quality control during clinical-scale production and thus be leveraged to ensure efficient and consistent platelet manufacturing across patients.

Young sexual minority men – a term used to describe gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men – with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms are more likely to begin using substances such as cigarettes, alcohol, cannabis, stimulants and illicit drugs at an earlier age, according to Rutgers Health researchers.

The study, published in the Journal of Gay & Lesbian Mental Health and led by the Center for Health, Identity, Behavior & Prevention Studies (CHIBPS) at the Rutgers School of Public Health, analyzed data from 597 young sexual minority men to assess ADHD symptoms and their associations with substance use.

The researchers found clinically significant ADHD symptoms were both common and strongly associated with heightened risk and earlier initiation of substance use. Inattentive symptoms were closely tied to cigarette use, while both inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms predicted earlier use across all substances assessed.

"Given that young sexual minority men are disproportionately impacted by several other mental and physical health problems, this phenomenon warrants further attention from healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers alike," said Kristen Krause, an assistant professor at the School of Public Health and co-author of the study.

Findings also suggested key differences across subgroups. The connection between ADHD and early-onset substance use was stronger among bisexual men than among gay men, suggesting that tailored prevention strategies may be needed to address distinct vulnerabilities within the sexual minority population.

Krause, who also is the deputy director of the center, said the findings underscore the importance of integrating mental health and substance use screening and prevention efforts for sexual minority youth, particularly young men. Early identification of ADHD and intervention strategies could help reduce long-term health disparities in this group.

At CHIBPS, we have long understood that health risks do not occur in a vacuum but that they are the result of the complex interplay of person, social conditions, and physical and mental health. Modern and relevant public health approaches recognize that simply telling people to become vaccinated, wear a condom every time, and/or of banning menthol cigarettes is simply not enough."

Perry N. Halkitis, dean of the School of Public Health and senior author of the study

"The focus must be on the person not the drug or the pathogen," said Halkitis, whose forthcoming book, Humanizing Public Health: How Pathogen-Centered Approaches Have Failed Us, will be published by Johns Hopkins University Press in the winter.

Halkitis, who is the director of the center, and the researchers said future studies should use different measurement tools to better estimate ADHD prevalence and severity in sexual minority men. Longitudinal approaches that account for factors such as resilience, mental health comorbidities and social support could offer deeper insights and inform more effective interventions.

Although penile cancer represents less than 1% of male malignancies, it carries substantial physical and psychological burden, with a five-year survival rate near 50%. Around half of Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) cases are associated with persistent HPV infection, which triggers oncogenic transformation via viral oncoproteins E6 and E7. Interestingly, HPV-positive PSCC patients tend to have better survival and treatment responses compared to HPV-negative cases. However, the mechanisms behind this clinical advantage remain poorly understood. Due to limited patient samples and tumor heterogeneity, previous genomic studies failed to fully capture the immune microenvironment. Given these challenges, it is necessary to explore the cellular ecosystem of HPV-associated PSCC using single-cell approaches.

A research team from the University of Science and Technology of China has mapped the tumor microenvironment of HPV-associated penile cancer at single-cell resolution. The study, published (DOI: 10.1093/pcmedi/pbaf013) in Precision Clinical Medicine in September 2025, analyzed 52,980 single cells from 11 treatment-naïve PSCC patients. By comparing HPV-positive (HPV+) and HPV-negative (HPV−) tumors, the researchers revealed profound immune differences that may explain variations in prognosis and therapeutic response. The single-cell atlas provides a high-resolution reference for understanding how HPV infection shapes tumor immunity and microenvironmental dynamics.

Using high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing, the team profiled immune, stromal, and epithelial cells from PSCC tissues to dissect their heterogeneity. Unsupervised clustering identified 49 distinct cellular subpopulations grouped into seven major cell types, including T cells, B cells, macrophages, NK cells, endothelial cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Notably, HPV+-PSCC tumors showed an increased abundance of mast cells but a significant reduction in proliferative macrophages compared to HPV− cases. Gene ontology analysis revealed that inflammatory CAFs in HPV+-PSCC expressed higher levels of chemokines such as CXCL13, CXCL3, and CXCL12, suggesting enhanced immune recruitment. In contrast, antigen-presenting cells in HPV− tumors upregulated CXCL5, CXCL1, and CCL13, promoting leukocyte migration and a more immunosuppressive niche. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed that CD8+ T cells in HPV+-PSCC expressed markedly lower levels of immune checkpoint molecules-including PDCD1 (PD-1), CTLA4, HAVCR2 (TIM-3), LAG3, and TIGIT-indicating reduced exhaustion and potentially greater antitumor activity. Ligand–receptor analysis highlighted that inhibitory signaling via TIGIT and its ligands (PVR, NECTIN2/3/4) was enriched in HPV− tumors, reinforcing their suppressed immune environment.

"Our findings provide a comprehensive single-cell atlas of PSCC and uncover how HPV infection remodels the tumor ecosystem," said the study's investigators from the University of Science and Technology of China. "By identifying cell-type-specific immune signatures and signaling interactions, we can better understand why HPV-positive tumors tend to respond more favorably to therapy. These results also emphasize the importance of examining viral factors when designing personalized immunotherapy strategies for rare cancers like PSCC."

This single-cell landscape offers a crucial resource for future research on viral-induced cancers and tumor immunology. The discovery that HPV-positive tumors harbor fewer exhausted CD8+ T cells and weaker inhibitory TIGIT–PVR signaling suggests potential biomarkers for prognosis and targets for immunotherapy. Therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring immune activation in HPV− tumors-such as TIGIT blockade or chemokine modulation-could enhance treatment efficacy. Beyond penile cancer, this study also provides a conceptual framework for understanding how viral infections shape tumor immune microenvironments across different cancer types.

The current kidney transplant waitlisting criterion is based on a single measurement of kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤20 ml/min/1.73m2) and does not consider an individual's risk of progressing to kidney failure. A new study reveals that inclusion of a patient's 2-year risk of progression to kidney failure (using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation [KFRE], which incorporates age, sex, urine albumin, and eGFR) as a decision-making tool toward pre-emptive listing for kidney transplantation, has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce racial disparities. The findings will be presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025 November 5–9.

When examining the use of the 2-year risk of progression to kidney failure of ≥25% based on the KFRE as listing criterion and comparing it with the current eGFR ≤20 criterion, investigators found that among 10,368 US veterans with chronic kidney disease in 2022 who would meet at least one of the criteria, 60% met both and 20% met only one or the other. 

In 2022, veterans who only qualified by the eGFR ≤20 criterion were older (71 years) than those who only qualify by KFRE ≥25% (53 years). Also, using the kidney disease progression criteria only, more males, minorities (Hispanic, Black, and Asian), and those with diabetes and/or albuminuria would be waitlisted. When examining longitudinal data (2006–2019) to assess outcomes, the group who met both criteria or the KFRE ≥25% only, had the highest rates of kidney failure and lower mortality compared with those who only met the eGFR ≤20 criterion.

Expanding the waitlisting criteria for kidney transplantation to include risk of kidney failure prioritizes individualized approaches to care and could improve outcomes in younger patients with chronic kidney disease, as well as improve racial parity in access to kidney transplantation. This approach will continue to be studied prospectively and in populations beyond veterans to verify its potential to improve patient outcomes."

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

One of the most underrated time management strategies in residency is investing in your end-of-day routine. Before leaving, take just 5 minutes to write tomorrow's to-do list. That means identifying outstanding tasks, labs to follow up, notes to finalize, patient updates to check, or consults to review. 

The reason this works is cognitive offloading. By putting tasks on paper, you free up mental space and reduce the risk of forgetting something overnight. It also minimizes this “morning scramble” effect. Research shows that structured planning can save 30 minutes or more the next day.

Beyond just efficiency, it actually helps with stress management because you're walking out of work with closure instead of carrying an open mental loop home.

Residency is full of unpredictability, but this one habit gives you a greater sense of control, a sharper focus, and more bandwidth for patient care.

NYU Langone hospitals continue to receive elite distinctions in patient safety and quality, joining just 1 percent of hospitals nationwide to receive 11 consecutive "A" grades from The Leapfrog Group, a national nonprofit watchdog organization focused on healthcare safety and quality.

The "A" rating applies to Tisch Hospital and Kimmel Pavilion in Manhattan, NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn and NYU Langone Hospital—Long Island.

Additionally, NYU Langone Hospital—Suffolk advanced from a "C" to a "B" Leapfrog grade just eight months after completing its merger with the health system. The higher grade is the latest advancement since the hospital began its affiliation with NYU Langone in 2022. Since then, NYU Langone Hospital—Suffolk has expanded services and quality enhancements, such as shortening length of stay by more than a day, reducing arrival-to-provider wait times in the emergency department by more than 70 percent, to less than eight minutes, and advancing to an American College of Surgeons verified Level 2 adult trauma center.

NYU Langone's reputation in the communities we serve is built on a foundation of safe, top-quality care, thanks to our teams who put their patients first every day. Leapfrog is one of the best barometers patients can look to in determining where to receive their care, and we are proud of these ratings. This includes NYU Langone Hospital—Suffolk, where the pace of improvements has been extraordinary, because of the incredible work of our teams there."

Alec Kimmelman, MD, PhD, Dean and CEO of NYU Langone Health

Twice each year, The Leapfrog Group evaluates nearly 3,000 acute-care hospitals nationwide across 30 evidence-based patient safety performance measures, including the prevention of medical errors, injuries, accidents, infections and other potential harms to patients. Grades are assigned to hospitals across the country based on their performance regarding these measures. These grades are peer-reviewed, fully transparent and free to the public. Just over 32 percent of hospitals in the nation, and only 23 percent of hospitals in the state of New York, achieved an A grade in the fall 2025 survey.

Prof. Takashi Hiiragi (Hubrecht Institute), Dr. Robert Prevedel (European Molecular Biology Laboratory), and Dr. Lukas Krainer (Prospective Instruments) have launched an interdisciplinary collaboration to develop a novel intravital microscopy platform for studying mammalian embryo implantation.

Prof. Takashi Hiiragi explains: "Our research explores how self-organisation drives the emergence of forms and patterns in early mammalian embryos. By combining genetics, microscopy, biophysics, engineering, and modelling, we investigate how a seemingly simple cluster of cells develops into organised structures."

Prof. Takashi Hiiragi continues: "To study embryo development in the uterus,  we established a new interdisciplinary collaboration with the Prevedel group at EMBL Heidelberg and the industry partner Prospective Instruments to build the intravital microscope. We have extensively tested each microscope component to identify and observe the embryo-uterus interaction, and optimized and finalized its design. The mammalian implantation process is largely enigmatic, and the dynamic embryo-uterus interaction and its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This new intravital microscope will provide a fresh window and potentially transform the research of early mammalian development. Fortunately, Prospective Instruments could provide the level of customizable design we needed to enable our imaging research."

We are excited to participate in a project that truly pushes the limits of multiphoton imaging by combining such diverse imaging modalities. For many years, we have been supporting researchers with our state-of-the-art multiphoton microscopy solutions. Now, by integrating high-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) in an automated and user-friendly system, we enable researchers to gain insights from their samples that were not possible before."

Carolina Molecular Inc., a leading molecular testing services laboratory, and Pixelgen Technologies AB announced today a partnership to expand access to cutting-edge 3D protein interactomics capabilities to researchers and clinicians in the United States. Carolina Molecular will be the first certified U.S. service provider for Pixelgen.

As a certified service provider, Carolina Molecular will provide academic, pharmaceutical, and biotech researchers across the US with streamlined access to Pixelgen's advanced Proximity Network Assay, which offers novel insights into protein-protein interactions and cellular functions by measuring the proximity between the proteins on the cell surface. This level of understanding is critical for advancing research in immuno-oncology, cell therapy, hematology, auto-immune disease research, and biomarker discovery, where understanding the mechanism of action and cellular responses is paramount.

Pixelgen's technology provides an important omics dimension, protein interactomics, by mapping the complex cell surface protein interactome of single cells. The company's proprietary Pixelgen Proxiome Kit, delivers nanoscale spatial analysis of immune cell proteins at scale. The assay uses DNA-barcoded antibodies and rolling circle amplification to create a high-resolution map of protein colocalization, clustering, and abundance, providing novel insights into disease mechanisms, drug response, and biomarker discovery. The workflow generates sequencer-ready libraries that integrate seamlessly with standard NGS platforms.

Partnering with Pixelgen is a direct extension of what our clients are asking for: bolstering molecular insights with complex multiomic studies. Researchers in immuno-oncology and cell therapy need to understand not just if a protein is present, but how it's interacting with its neighbors. As the first US service provider for this technology, we can now offer a powerful tool to help our partners dissect these critical protein-protein interactions and accelerate their therapeutic programs."

Trent Carrier, President, Carolina Molecular

Mursla Bio, a leader in Extracellular Vesicle (EV) science on a mission to advance precision diagnostics and significantly improve chronic disease outcomes for at-risk patients, today announced a collaboration with a leading global pharmaceutical company recognized for its expertise in precision medicine and biomarker-guided drug development.

Under the collaboration, Mursla Bio's AI Precision Medicine Platform will generate hepatocyte-specific extracellular vesicle (h-EV) profiles from blood samples collected from a well-characterized cohort of patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and matched healthy controls. The collaboration will explore mode-of-action (MoA)-related biomarkers and evaluate biomarker panels to identify patients most likely to benefit from the pharmaceutical company's investigational therapy.

The initial phase will focus on generating insights into liver tissue biology in MASH by building tissue-labeled, high dimensional mRNA and protein datasets from h-EVs in blood. This data will help define MoA-related pathways and patient stratification signatures, while strengthening Mursla Bio's AI liver disease models developed through its MEV01 clinical study and extending their applicability across future programs.

Complementing Mursla Bio's lead product, EvoLiver™, developed for liver cancer surveillance among cirrhotic patients, the partnership broadens the clinical and translational reach of its clinically validated platform across metabolic liver diseases. The same infrastructure that enabled EvoLiver™ to achieve FDA Breakthrough Device Designation2 will be used to accelerate the translation of exploratory biomarkers into regulatory-grade companion diagnostics.

This collaboration reflects the growing demand from global pharmaceutical leaders for our AI Precision Medicine Platform. As the GLP-1 revolution reshapes obesity management, MASH is rapidly emerging as the next major therapeutic focus, and the need for precise liver-specific biomarkers has never been greater. By profiling intact hepatocyte biology protected within the cargo of h-EVs, we are enabling a new generation of biomarker-guided precision medicine in liver care. This partnership deepens our reach in hepatology, expanding on the foundation established with EvoLiver."

Pierre Arsène, Founder and CEO of Mursla Bio

MASH is an advanced stage of fatty liver disease, strongly associated with the global rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes. MASH affects 5-7 % of the world's adult population with more than 75 % of those classed as overweight, obese, and living with type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by the buildup of excess fat in the liver, which causes inflammation and cell damage. MASH can progress to irreversible scarring (cirrhosis) and, in some cases, lead to liver failure or liver cancer.

The immigrant from India believed her husband when he said that if she wasn't gone by the time he got to their Georgia home in 10 minutes, he would kill her.

She said her husband and his family, who are also immigrants, abused her throughout their marriage, beating her with a belt, pouring hot water on her, cutting her, and pushing her head through a wall.

"Several times I tried to escape, but they found me and brought me back home," said the woman, who is in the country illegally and spoke on the condition of anonymity because she is afraid being identified would harm her chances of gaining legal status.

With no time to run after her husband's call in July 2020, she dialed 911, even though she knew she could be deported. The police arrived to find the husband threatening her with a knife in front of their young children, she recalled. He was arrested but not prosecuted, she said.

The woman and her children sought services from the Tahirih Justice Center, a national nonprofit organization that serves immigrant survivors of gender-based violence. She is still winding through the immigration process five years later.

Besides immigrants' increased vulnerability to sexual violence, they face a host of mental health and physical challenges, researchers say. They have high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, and anxiety, according to a 2024 study.

"Personally, I know anxiety related to the current political climate is precipitating expensive emergency room visits and negatively impacting people's ability to get to work and make a living," said Nicole E. Warren, a nurse midwife and an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in Baltimore.

Immigrants without legal status also face increased rates of chronic conditions and higher death rates from preventable diseases due to their limited access to health care and their fear of seeking it, advocates say.

"One of our clients was so afraid to leave her home that she avoided seeking medical care during her pregnancy, out of fear of interacting with ICE," said Miriam Camero, director of client advocacy, social services, at Tahirih.

Food banks have reported that many immigrants in need of food assistance have stopped coming, for fear of deportation.

It has always been difficult for people without legal immigration status to get help when they need it. The Trump administration's crackdown on people in the country illegally has intensified the pressure. The situation has also hampered the advocates and attorneys who defend their rights.

"We're working extra hours to do all the work," said Vanessa Wilkins, executive director of Tahirih's office in Atlanta. "The safety planning and added protection that clients might need, including documents just to make sure they are safe, can definitely make you feel overwhelmed."

For domestic abuse survivors without legal status, like the woman from India, going to the authorities seems more fraught amid the immigration crackdown, said Maricarmen Garza, chief counsel of the American Bar Association Commission on Domestic & Sexual Violence.

"There are just no guarantees," Garza said, "especially with how law enforcement is intertwined in enforcing immigration law."

In more than half of states, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can collaborate by formal written agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies to identify and remove people in the country illegally. Advocates say this can interfere with victims' efforts to get a certificate to file for a "U visa," which would allow them to live and work in the U.S. with the possibility of lawful permanent residency.

The battered woman from India recalls police telling her that if she did not press charges, she could get a certificate for a U visa. She agreed to their suggestion but recalls the anxiety of filing about five abuse reports over two years to get the certificate. "I got panic attacks just writing them down, because it meant I was reliving the situations again," she said.

When asked for comment about the difficulties immigrant domestic violence victims face, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson touted President Donald Trump's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. "The president's successful effort to deport criminal illegal aliens is making all victims safer and ensuring they will never again be harmed by dangerous criminal illegal aliens," Jackson said in a statement. She said "allegations without evidence" that immigrants have been told to drop charges "should not be taken seriously."

Immigrant women without legal status can be particularly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation because of language barriers, as well as cultural and social isolation, researchers have found.

According to a 2023 report, lifetime rates of abuse by intimate partners range up to 93% in some immigrant groups, compared with about 41% of U.S.-born women experiencing such abuse in their lifetime.

As the Trump administration reshapes the country's immigration system, survivors of violence who entered the country illegally have a tough time proving their abuse and trauma to get relief, advocates say.

A refugee health and asylum program at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore provides immigrant victims of abuse with free forensic evaluations to support their claims for humanitarian relief, including applications for U visas.

Warren, the program's associate director for women's health, said that in the past, a written affidavit of the clinic's findings was enough to corroborate an applicant's legal accounts of past trauma.

"Now, we are getting requests for our in-person testimony," Warren said.

The woman from India applied for a visa after she received a certificate from law enforcement allowing her to do so in 2023. Hers is one of nearly 11.6 million pending visa applications, according to data through June — the highest volume of cases ever recorded by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The number of pending U visa applications is 415,000, according to the agency.

Only about 10,000 U visas are issued per year, and it can take more than seven years to process applications, Garza said.

Adding to the pressure, the Trump administration has reduced the availability of Section 8 housing, which helps low-income individuals and others pay their rent. As of September, people without legal authorization to be in the United States are not eligible to receive rental help over U.S. citizens.

"If Tahirih wasn't behind me, I could be homeless," said the woman, who said she can afford only half her rent.

Victims' advocates say they are working harder than ever to support their clients but are stretched thin as they face federal funding cuts and increased demand.

The Tahirih center reported a 200% increase in call volume in the four months after Trump took office, compared with the same period last year.

"At the end of the day there are a lot of emails and a lot of people we aren't able to reach as quickly as in the past," said Casey Carter Swegman, the center's director of public policy.

To reach immigrant survivors of abuse who are afraid to come forward, advocates are "getting back to basics," said Joanna Otero-Cruz, executive director and president of the Philadelphia group Women Against Abuse.

"We're doing grassroots outreach to hairdressers and other small-business owners," she said. "They're the eyes and ears for us."

In Riverhead, New York, a 38-year-old woman who emigrated from El Salvador said she has twice been the victim of domestic abuse but was too scared to report it to police.

She said the second assault was by a man for whom she cooked and cleaned in his home. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of her sense of shame and her fears of deportation, said he raped her, took pictures of her naked, and threatened to put them on social media if she tried to go to the police. He then stalked her, she said.

Noemi Sanchez, Long Island regional coordinator for the Rural & Migrant Ministry, a nonprofit that supports farm workers, is working closely with the woman to elevate her self-esteem and help her understand that "no woman deserves to have a man mistreat them."

Meanwhile, the survivor from India received a temporary work permit in 2024 and is employed as a certified nursing assistant, which "helps me survive," she said.

"I have really come a long way," she added. "It wasn't easy. I had great support behind me. They didn't let me down."

Pain is a constant, complex companion that clinicians often struggle to understand and measure for people living with sickle cell disease. Traditional pain scales reduce this deeply personal experience to a single number that is often inaccurate. A new study led by Carnegie Mellon University's Wood Neuro Research Group takes a more human-centered approach, using advanced brain imaging and a digital visualization tool to illuminate how pain is processed in the brain, aiming to bridge the gap in pain interpretation between patients and clinicians.

"Traditional questionnaires only scratch the surface," explained Joel Disu, first author of The Journal of Pain paper and biomedical engineering Ph.D. student.

They don't capture the complexity or the internal experience of sickle cell pain. We wanted to see what happens in the brain when people describe their pain in a way that's truer to how they actually feel it."

Joel Disu, Carnegie Mellon University

The team explored how Painimation, a novel app developed by Emory University collaborator Dr. Charles Jonassaint, could help decode the neural signatures of pain in adults with sickle cell disease. Instead of rating pain on a 1-to-10 scale, participants use animated visuals to describe what their pain feels like, for example throbbing, stabbing, cramping, or shooting sensations.

Using ultra-high-resolution MRI data, the researchers compared brain connectivity patterns between 27 patients with sickle cell disease and 30 healthy, pain-free participants. They focused on three key brain networks linked to pain perception: the default mode, salience, and somatosensory networks. Their results showed that patients with sickle cell disease had significantly reduced connectivity across all three, particularly in regions involved in emotion, attention, and sensory processing.

When the team linked these imaging findings to participants' Painimation selections, a striking pattern emerged. Pain descriptors like cramping and stabbing correlated strongly with changes in the somatosensory network, the area responsible for processing physical sensations like touch and pressure. Moreover, patients who rated these sensations as more intense showed even greater disruption in those brain regions.

"This gives us a foundational step toward developing objective pain biomarkers," Disu explained. "We can begin to see, in real time, how the quality and intensity of pain map onto the brain."

Beyond its scientific novelty, the study addresses a critical gap in healthcare communication. Pain in sickle cell disease is frequently misunderstood, leading to mistrust between patients and providers. Many patients report managing their pain crises at home, because they fear being dismissed, the increased burden of healthcare fees, or being labeled as drug-seeking when they seek care.

"Our work helps visualize what has long been invisible or ignored," noted Sossena Wood, assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon. "This research validates patients' experiences with neuroscientific evidence. It shows that the pain they feel is real, measurable, and rooted in brain function in vital pain receptors."

The implications extend beyond research labs and translate to an assessable digital tool that can be assessed in the patient's home. Painimation is already being adopted by several sickle cell communities across the country, helping clinicians better interpret pain experiences. Wood's team hopes to build on these findings by exploring how tools like virtual reality and wearable sensors might one day help modulate pain perception or even reduce it through targeted brain stimulation.

Earlier this year, Disu was selected by the American Society of Hematology to receive the 2025 Hematology Inclusion Pathway Graduate Student Award. The honor includes a $40,000 annual stipend over two years to support his ongoing research, including studies like this one that aim to transform the way pain is understood and managed in sickle cell disease. Disu is the first Carnegie Mellon student to receive this prestigious award.

Wood added, "Ultimately, we want to bridge the gap between patients' lived experiences and what clinicians can measure. By bringing together neuroscience and empathy, we can start to transform the way pain is understood and treated in sickle cell disease."

A widely-used, inexpensive gout drug could reduce heart attacks and strokes in people with cardiovascular disease, according to a new Cochrane review.The review examined the effects of low doses of colchicine, a drug used to treat gout, and found no increase in serious side effects.Cardiovascular disease is often driven by chronic low-grade inflammation, which contributes to recurrent cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. Colchicine has anti-inflammatory properties that make it a promising option for people with heart disease. 

The review included 12 randomized controlled trials involving nearly 23,000 people with a history of heart disease, heart attack or stroke. The studies looked at patients who took colchicine for at least six months, with doses of 0.5 mg once or twice a day. Most participants were male (~80%) and the mean age was 57 to 74 years old. Half received colchicine, while the other half received either a placebo or no additional treatment alongside their usual care.Overall, those taking low-dose colchicine were less likely to experience a heart attack or stroke. For every 1,000 people treated, there were 9 fewer heart attacks and 8 fewer strokes compared with those not taking the drug. Whilst there were no serious adverse events identified, patients who took colchicine were more likely to have stomach or digestive side effects, but these were usually mild and didn't last long.

Among 200 people with cardiovascular disease – where we would normally expect around seven heart attacks and four strokes – using low-dose colchicine could prevent about two of each. Reductions like this can make a real difference for patients who live with ongoing, lifelong cardiovascular risk." 

Dr. Ramin Ebrahimi, co-lead author, University Medicine Greifswald, Germany

As cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, colchicine presents a promising inexpensive and accessible option for secondary prevention in high-risk patients."These results come from publicly funded trials repurposing a very old, low-cost drug for an entirely new use," says Lars Hemkens, senior author from the University of Bern, Switzerland. "It shows the power of academic research to reveal treatment opportunities that traditional drug development often overlooks."The evidence is less clear when it comes to whether colchicine affects overall death rates or the need for procedures like coronary revascularization. The studies didn't provide any information to say whether the drug improves quality of life or reduces hospital stays. The authors stress that further research is needed in these areas.

World Cup

2026 World

Cup Countdown

live

Updated 5m ago

Nigeria have beaten Gabon 4-1 to advance to the play-off final of African qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.

They needed extra time to make it through after Mario Lemina's late deflected effort cancelled out Akor Adams' opener in normal time.

Substitute Chidera Ejuke restored Nigeria's lead early in extra time and their advantage was hammered home by two clinical Victor Osimhen strikes. Osimhen could, however, have stopped us needing extra time but badly squandered a huge chance in the final minute of second-half stoppage time.

Nigeria will face the winner of this evening's other semi-final between DR Congo and Cameroon in Sunday's final. The winner of that final will progress to the  World Cup's intercontinental play-offs in March.

GO FURTHER

Nigeria 4 Gabon 1: World Cup dream lives on, Osimhen's miss (and goals) and VAR controversy

Considering the importance of this game, the stadium was surprisingly empty before kick-off. It is difficult to make an exact estimate, but there cannot have been more than 2,500 fans when the teams emerged.

The Confederation of African Football (CAF) announced the day before that supporters with tickets for AFCON could attend this game and Cameroon vs DR Congo for free. It was clearly an attempt by CAF to convince local Moroccans to come to the Moulay El Hassan Stadium to boost crowd numbers, but it did not have much of an impact.

Nigeria fans finally emerged just after that incident in the 59th minute. They were stationed in the upper tier but started banging their own drums and quickly drowned out the boos from Gabon's support when they arrived.

After a dramatic 48 hours in the build-up to this game, which saw Nigeria's squad boycott training due to a dispute with the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), they have taken another step towards qualifying for next year's World Cup.

If they had lost to Gabon, supporters would have criticised the timing of their feud and argued whether they could have waited until the end of these play-offs. Those concerns might still be raised if they lose to Cameroon or DR Congo on Sunday, but they have at least temporarily silenced the noise around them.

We mentioned earlier on how committed Alex Iwobi has been to Nigeria over the last 10 years and he was absolutely superb today.

If you missed it, that was his 90th appearance for his country — only three men have more Nigeria caps (Ahmed Musa, Vincent Enyeama and Joseph Yobo).

The 29-year-old Fulham international did everything in his powers to ensure he and his team-mates have a chance at playing in next summer's World Cup.

We know that Nigeria will play here again on Sunday evening, but we don't yet know who they will be playing against in that match.

The Nigerian supporters will be paying very close attention to the match between DR Congo and Cameroon — that kicked off around 10 minutes ago — as the winner of that game will be Sunday's opponent.

One thing is for sure, Nigeria will have to be a lot better than they were in normal time today if they want to win again in a few days' time.

All the talk coming into the game was about Victor Osimhen's red-hot Galatasaray form, particularly in the Champions League.

But it looked for much of the game as though he would be unable to help Nigeria to an important win. He squandered a host of big chances, including one in the very last minute of normal time, and must have been kicking himself ahead of extra time.

Then he came up trumps in that extra-time period with two great finishes. Nigeria fans will be hoping to see the Osimhen of extra time in Sunday's game...

How is the blood pressure after that one, Nigeria fans?

A mammoth match that started exactly three hours ago — and we didn't even have a penalty shootout!

Victor Osimhen couldn't finish it off in normal time, but put the game beyond all doubt in extra time with two great strikes. I can only imagine the entire country of Nigeria is asking why he couldn't have done that earlier on!

But that all matters very little now as he and his team-mates advance to the next stage.

Nigeria know that they need three more wins to book a place at the 2026 World Cup...

That's it!

Finally.

Nigeria move through to the CAF play-off final against Cameroon or DR Congo as their 2026 World Cup qualification campaign continues.

Gabon's World Cup dream is over.

4-1 after extra time and the managers shake hands.

120+1' Nigeria 4-1 Gabon

That makes it a whole extra half hour of time added on today.

Mainly for injuries and VAR checks.

Both teams just playing out time before the end now.

Gabon have a decent effort from inside the box saved by Nwabali.

And...

120' Nigeria 4-1 Gabon

Gabon's Nze Samake rattles into a tough tackle on Frank Onyeka, who goes down pretending to be injured, gets up to start some pushing and shoving, then promptly goes down pretending to be injured again.

Both men are booked.

119' Nigeria 4-1 Gabon

Wilfred Ndidi's drive from outside the box is well saved by Loyce Mbaba!

Corner and Nigeria are content to see out time now.

117' Nigeria 4-1 Gabon

Victor Osimhen is off and will not secure a treble today.

The striker will be wrapped up in cotton wool, you'd have thought, ahead of the weekend's play-off final match against Cameroon or DR Congo.

Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare is on in his place.

115' Nigeria 4-1 Gabon

Gabon are losing their tempers here and Alex Moucketou-Moussounda is booked after a tasty challenge on Wilfred Ndidi.

Iwobi receives a long hug from one of Nigeria's backroom staff. 

He looked knackered but thirty seconds later he jumped off the bench and threw his water bottle on the floor when Osimhen made it 4-1. 

Game over. Disaster avoided.

111' Nigeria 4-1 Gabon

Victor Osimhen took down a long ball on his chest, powered past a few defenders and into the penalty area.

Despite being on the angle and facing away from goal, he levered a strong low effort past a flat-footed Mbaba and into the corner.

Eight goals for Osimhen in this qualifying campaign and even the Gabon players realise this is over now.

They will not be going to the World Cup unless a miracle of all football miracles happens.

110' Nigeria 4-1 Gabon

Surely this match is over now!

Victor Osimhen has two and Nigeria are basically into the play-off final.

109' Nigeria 3-1 Gabon

Nigeria looking to lock it down now.

Off come midfielder Alex Iwobi and right-back Bright Osayi-Samuel.

Centre-backs Chidozie Awaziem and William Troost-Ekong are on.

108' Nigeria 3-1 Gabon

What on earth is Stanley Nwabali doing?

The Nigeria goalkeeper has been lax and casual in possession inside his penalty area on several occasions already and has nearly been caught on it a couple of times.

There, he allowed the ball to roll almost to the goal-line, with a Gabon attacker sliding in and unlucky not to bundle it in.

Nwabali somehow scrambles it out of play. Just get rid of it!

After a very short break and intense team talk, the second period of extra time is up and running.

A fantastic quarter of an hour or so for Nigeria.

They have scored two goals and are surely set to progress to the CAF play-off final.

Gabon have a mountain to climb.

Victor Osimhen has scored eight goals in seven appearances for Nigeria in 2026 World Cup qualification

Nigeria advanced to the final of African play-offs for the 2026 Fifa World Cup following a dramatic 4-1 win over Gabon after extra time.

Chidera Ejuke and Victor Osimhen struck in the first period of added time after the match in Rabat had ended 1-1 after 90 minutes.

Osimhen ripped off his protective face mask and shirt to celebrate his goal - no doubt partly in relief after the striker had squandered a glorious chance to win it for the Super Eagles in the 12th minute stoppage time at the end of the game.

The Galatasaray man grabbed his second goal of the evening five minutes after the extra-time break to make sure of victory.

Nigeria, who enjoyed the better of the semi-final tie, had seemed on course to win in regulation time after Akor Adams pounced on a poor back pass to give Eric Chelle's side the lead in the 78th minute.

But Gabon levelled in the 89th minute through Mario Lemina's deflected shot to send the game to extra-time, before the Panthers were eventually undone by clinical finishing from their West African rivals.

Nigeria will face either Cameroon or DR Congo in Africa's play-off final on Sunday (19:00 GMT).

The winners of that match will then progress to a six-team intercontinental qualifier, which will be held in March and will determine the final two qualifiers for next year's World Cup.

Nigeria missed out on Qatar 2022 and their bid to return to the finals has seen numerous twists and turns over the course of a two-year campaign, including two changes of manager.

The Super Eagles only qualified for the African play-offs on goal difference after a 91st-minute strike in their final group game against Benin, and players and technical staff boycotted training on Tuesday over unpaid allowances and match bonuses.

Yet the side showed no ill effects from that dispute as they took the game to Gabon in persistent rain in the Moroccan capital.

Adams was denied early on and Osimhen headed wide from nine yards before Gabon goalkeeper Loyce Mbaba made two brilliant reflex saves.

The Panthers looked to play on the counter-attack, but one major flashpoint came early in the second half when they claimed a penalty for a shirt pull by Bright Osayi-Samuel on Aaron Appindangoye.

Yet, after referee Abongile Tom spent over three minutes studying his pitch-side monitor and in conversation with Video Assistant Referee Akhona Makalima, the appeals were turned down.

Denis Bouanga and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had scored 15 goals between them for the Panthers during the group stage but rarely had a sight at goal as Benjamin Frederick impressed at the heart of the Nigeria defence.

The result extends Chelle's unbeaten start since he became the first non-Nigerian African to take charge of the Super Eagles in January.

The Malian is now one game closer to leading the three-time continental champions to the expanded 48-team World Cup, and winning over those who questioned his appointment.

JUMP TO:

Nigeria face Gabon today in the semifinals of the CAF World Cup qualification playoff round.

The Super Eagles somehow kept their dreams alive of reaching next year's finals by thrashing Benin in a decisive game back in October. They must now attempt to defeat Thierry Mouyouma's side to progress to a final on Sunday against either Cameroon or DR Congo.

Only the winners of this month's mini-tournament will secure their place in the inter-continental playoffs next March and compete for one of two spots in the World Cup group stage.

All matches are being staged in Morocco, giving this the feel of a condensed Africa Cup of Nations, with Africa's premier competition taking place in the country in December.



Venue: Moulay Hassan Stadium (Rabat, Morocco)Referee: Tom Abongile (South Africa)

Starting lineups:

Nigeria (4-4-2, right to left): Nwabali (GK) — Osayi-Samuel, Fredrick, Bassey, Sanusi — Chukwueze (Ejuke), Iwobi, Ndidi, Lookman (Simon) — Adams (8. Onyeka), Osimhen

Gabon (4-3-3, right to left): Mbaba (GK) — Ondele, Oyono, Ecuele, Ekoumie — Openda (Meyo), M. Lemina, Ndong (Samake) — Aubameyang, Biyogo (N. Lemina), Bouanga



BET NOW: Latest odds and predictions for Nigeria vs. Gabon

Who's winning this?

And that's the end of the half. Extraordinary stuff. We'll have 30 minutes of extra time and, if needed, a penalty shootout...

90+12 mins: OSIMHEN! WHAT JUST HAPPENED? Aubameyang's pass is cut out by Wilfred Ndidi, and suddenly, Gabon are wide open at the back. A simple pass sends Osimhen through on goal, all alone, but his attempted finish bobbles harmlessly wide of the target. A remarkable miss.

90+6 mins: All the pressure is coming from Nigeria, but Gabon are holding firm. Aubameyang this time makes a challenge on Simon on the edge of his own area.

90+2 mins: Ejuke slides a throughball into Osimhen's path, but he drags his low shot wide of the far post. He was onside, too; that was a decent chance wasted.

90 mins: We're going to have TWELVE minutes of added time...

89 mins: GOAL! GABON EQUALISE! It looked like Gabon's dreams of a first World Cup were over, but they've snatched a leveller through Mario Lemina. Osayi-Samuel's header falls kindly to the midfielder, who sets himself before trying to bend a shot into the far corner. It takes a big deflection, wrong-foots Nwabali, and flies into the net.

85 mins: Brentford's Frank Onyeka is on for the goal-scorer and tidies up in front of his own box well as Gabon attack down the left, highlighting just why he's been brought on. Nigeria have five minutes plus added time to hold on.

78 mins: GOAL! NIGERIA ARE GIFTED THE LEAD! It's a horrible moment for Gabon, as a loose pass in defence from Ondele is pounced upon by Akor Adams. Mbaba had come off his line to intercept but realised he wouldn't get there, and Adams simply had to move into space and slot the ball into the empty net.

67 mins: It's all got a bit cagey again (unsurprisingly, given what is at stake). Gabon look the more likely to score; Nigeria need to raise their level again.

60 mins: Two changes for Nigeria: Lookman and Chukwueze go off, with Moses Simon and Chidera Ejuke on.

56 mins: NO PENALTY GABON! Well, that could be a moment that is looked back on after this game. Osayi-Samuel clearly had a handful of Ondele's jersey, but referee Tom Abongile — who took a long, long time to review the footage — appeared unconvinced that the Gabon defender would get to the ball regardless of the apparent offence.

52 mins: Big Gabon appeals for a penalty! Aron Ondele looked like he had his shirt pulled as a free-kick was crossed into the box... and VAR recommends a review!

We're off and running again.

Nothing to split the sides at the break.

45+6 mins: Into the sixth minute of added time, and 36-year-old Aubameyang has just engaged in a foot race with Fredrick, a defender 16 years his junior. It was pretty close, too; Fredrick eventually makes a good block to stop the striker getting a shot on target.

44 mins: Openda with a chance! Nigeria make a bit of a mess of halting a Gabon break, and the ball falls to Openda in the area. He turns back onto his left foot to create space for the shot, but it's a tame effort, easily saved by Nwabali.

37 mins: Chance wasted on the break there by Gabon. After defending a corner, they launched a 4-on-4 counter, with Aubameyang playing Bouanga into the box. The LAFC man chose to shoot from a difficult angle rather than pull the ball back across, and his effort was blocked.

32 mins: Royce Openda looks lively down the Gabon right. He wins their first corner with his latest positive run, but Nigeria scramble the delivery clear.

28 mins: Somehow, Gabon survive! Ademola Lookman's cross is headed down by Osimhen, two Gabon defenders get in a complete muddle, and Mbaba has to spring to his right to stop the ball crossing the line. Referee Tom Abongile then seems to point to the centre-circle before clarifying that, no, the ball did not cross the line. Crazy.

23 mins: Another chance for Osimhen! The ball is slipped through to the Galatasaray striker, but he's off balance as he tries a shot, and he slices the effort well wide while stumbling. Gabon can't keep giving him opportunities like that.

21 mins: BRILLIANT SAVE! Osimhen with another header, this time under pressure around six yards from goal, but Mbaba gets down to his right and claws the ball away. Excellent stop. Nigeria are on top here, though.

17 mins: OSIMHEN! Big, big chance for Nigeria! Akor Adams floats in a cross from the left, Loyce Mbaba comes and gets nowhere near it, but Osimhen can't hit the target with a header from 12 yards! He then gets clattered by the goalkeeper for his trouble and requires some treatment. Sensibly, he is wearing his face mask again today.

13 mins: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's first involvement ends in a looping cross that Nwabali catches well. He then kicks it straight to Anthony Oyono, who tries to chip the keeper from halfway and misses by... well, a lot.

9 mins: It's been (unsurprisingly) a fairly cagey start. LAFC's Denis Bouanga has looked bright early on, but Stanley Nwabali's goal has not been threatened yet.

Here we go!

15 mins before kickoff: It's not exactly a packed house here in Rabat in this pouring rain, but the fans who have made the trip are making a good amount of noise. It's almost time for kickoff...

1 hour before kickoff: The team news is in! Eric Chelle makes two changes from the Benin game last month: in come Bright Osayi-Samuel and Ademola Lookman, with Semi Ajayi and Moses Simon making way.

1 hour 30 mins before kickoff: The importance of this game can't be ignored, and yet Nigeria's players caused a storm earlier in the week when they went on strike over a dispute with the country's football federation relating to bonus payments. However, captain William Troost-Ekong announced via X on Wednesday that the issue was "resolved". Still, not a great way to prepare for a fixture of this magnitude.

Issue RESOLVED. Outstanding financials cleared and on ground. Team is UNITED and focussed as before on representing NIGERIA with our maximum for the games ahead! 🇳🇬 @NGSuperEagles

2 hours before kickoff: Somehow, Nigeria are still alive in the race to reach the World Cup. Only the victors today will stay in the hunt for the finals. It's all to play for.

This CAF World Cup qualifying playoff semifinal takes place at the Moulay Hassan Stadium in Rabat, Morocco and kicks off on Thursday, November 13 at 5 p.m. local time.

Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories:

Moses Simon and Samuel Chukwueze provided plenty of opportunities for hat-trick hero Victor Osimhen last time out, but Simon makes way this time for Ademola Lookman.

There is also a change in defence, with Semi Ajayi dropping out and Bright Osayi-Samuel coming in, which likely means Benjamin Fredrick moving to centre-back.

Nigeria (4-4-2, right to left): Nwabali (GK) — Osayi-Samuel, Fredrick, Bassey, Sanusi — Chukwueze, Iwobi, Ndidi, Lookman — Adams, Osimhen

Nigeria subs: Okoye, Troost-Ekong, Ejuke, Onyeka, Arokodare, Onyemaechi, Abdullahi, Simon, Obasogie, Nwadike, Awaziem, Olusegun

Gabon are missing a handful of key players, including Jim Allevinah, Shavy Babicka, Medwin Biteghe, Michel Mboula, and Junior Noubi Fotso.

Much like Nigeria and Osimhen, their hopes will largely rest on the shoulders of their most famous star forward: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the Marseille striker, who has four goals in 10 Ligue 1 games this season.

Gabon (4-3-3, right to left): Mbaba (GK) — Ondele, Oyono, Ecuele, Ekoumie — Openda, Lemina, Ndong — Aubameyang, Biyogo, Bouanga

Gabon subs: Mounguenou, Bekale, Moucketou-Moussounda, Obiang, J. Do Marcolino, J. Oyono, N. Lemina, Nze Bagnama, A. Do Marcolino, Essang-Matouti, Averlant, Meyo

Christian Pulisic named his dream U.S. men's national team five-a-side team and did not include Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan or Tim Howard, instead opting for “more recent” American stars.

The AC Milan winger had a mild-mannered back-and-forth with the USMNT legends over the years until this summer, when he came under extreme fire for skipping the Gold Cup. Pulisic's commitment to the Stars and Stripes was questioned, prompting swift and spiky responses from the 27-year-old and his father.

Months after the exchange of words, Pulisic was asked to put together his ultimate USMNT five-a-side team by Kate Scott in an exclusive interview with Paramount+.

The USMNT captain rattled off Brad Guzan in goal, followed by Weston McKennie, Tyler Adams, himself and Oguchi Onyewu.

Pulisic noticeably left off Dempsey, Donovan and Howard, who are widely considered the three best players in USMNT history. The forward, though, did preface his picks by stating, “I'm just going to go more recent, because they're my guys.”

Still, Scott mentioned the glaring snubs, to which Pulisic replied, “I had to do it on the spot. There's a lot of good names out there.”

Not only did Pulisic recognize McKennie and Adams in his five-a-side team, but he also addressed the current USMNT as a whole, highlighting the widespread talent representing the Stars and Stripes. 

“Earlier on in my career, going into the national team, I kind of had this [weight] of, ‘Oh, this new kid is playing in Europe and now he's on the national team and—at least this is what I thought in my head, which looking back is stupid—I'm expected to score goals. I have to win games for the team,'” Pulisic said.

“But now I've gotten to a place, especially now with the other top players who are playing around the world on huge teams... I'm not the only one who's going to be able to make a difference in games now with this national team, so I'm really grateful for that.”

Indeed, the Stars and Stripes have a wealth of talent playing in Europe's top five leagues. From Chris Richards and Antonee Robinson to Folarin Balogun and Tim Weah, Mauricio Pochettino has the talent he needs to make a statement at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, unfolding largely on home soil for the first time since 1994.

The Kennedy Center booked the World Cup draw at President Donald Trump's urging. It will occupy much of the campus and displace planned performances.

FIFA will not pay a rental fee when it takes over much of the Kennedy Center later this month for the 2026 World Cup draw, according to a copy of the venue use agreement obtained by The Washington Post and other internal documents. The center's arrangement with soccer's international governing body will disrupt its performance schedule, forcing the relocation or postponement of several concerts at an institution that has seen a sharp decline in ticket sales since it was taken over by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

Christian Pulisic admitted missing out on the November international window is the “best decision” for himself, the U.S. men's national team and AC Milan as he works to return to full fitness. 

The USMNT captain is one of many American superstars absent from the Stars and Stripes'  final camp of the calendar year. Pulisic had been nursing a hamstring injury ever since the October international break and only just returned for Milan last weekend. 

Instead of heading straight to Philadelphia to meet up with Mauricio Pochettino's squad, the winger stayed back in Milan to work on fully recovering from injury, leaving the USMNT without its best player for international friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay.

There was ongoing speculation of a brewing feud between the USMNT and AC Milan over the Pulisic's fitness, but 27-year-old revealed both sides were on the same page when it came to prioritizing his health. 

“Speaking with the people at Milan, but also when I was leaving the national team, we had good conversations," Pulisic told Kate Scott in an exclusive interview with Paramount+ that took place before he returned to action for his club.

“I haven't come back and played yet, so I don't think it's right for me to fly over there and try to get my first games back with the national team when I just want to make sure I have the time now to fully care for myself and make sure that my hamstring is doing well and allow other guys to take the place. 

“So I think it's just the best decision for everyone right now,” Pulisic said.

Gio Reyna is one of the players that received a surprise call-up in place of Pulisic. Timmy Tillman also made Pochettino's roster after Tyler Adams was forced to withdraw due to injury.

Despite missing time for both Milan and the USMNT, Pulisic is not letting his hamstring injury bring down his spirits, especially when the issue only had him sidelined for a relatively short period. 

“Right when it happens, it's so frustrating,” Pulisic said. “You have all those thoughts, ‘Why now? Things were going so well at the beginning of the season.'

“It seems to happen that way but honestly I trust in God's timing. I trust in that it's the best thing for me and to be honest, it's not like... it's not the worst thing ever. I was out a couple of weeks and now I'm already back, so I'm lucky that it wasn't as bad as it could have been, so I'm trying to see it from the positive perspective.”

Pulisic was leading Serie A in scoring before his brief trip to the sidelines. The American star had eight goal contributions across all competitions before was forced into the infirmary.

Still, the good news for the Italian giants is Pulisic will be able to lead the Rossoneri against bitter rivals Inter on Sunday, Nov. 23. The Stars and Stripes, though, will have to make do without their top playmaker for now in order in order to hopefully ensure his full fitness in the buildup to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Lionel Messi was stunned to find 20,000 fans pack the Elche stands to watch him train with Argentina. It was meant to be a simple training session ahead of the Albiceleste's friendly against Angola, but it turned into a football festival unlike anything the Spanish city had ever seen. The Inter Miami star was also handed a special Elche shirt with his name and number on the back to commemorate the occasion.

Official attendance figures clocked at 20,085, which transformed the modest Martínez Valero Stadium into a cauldron of emotion. Hours before the gates opened, fans had already begun forming queues stretching around the blocks, chanting songs and holding homemade banners bearing Messi's face. Argentina's national flag illuminated giant screens, while the phrase "Coronados de gloria vivamos" (Let us live crowned with glory) stretched across the main stand. Around it were towering images of Maradona, Messi, and the current squad, creating an unforgettable tribute to the lineage of Argentine greatness. As the players walked out to the Argentine national anthem, the Martínez Valero erupted with joy. Every flick of Messi's boots was met with loud cheers. A simple wave toward the stands sent the crowd into a frenzy. Elche even presented Messi with a personalised club jersey that bore his name and the iconic number 10, and this heartwarming gesture drew the loudest cheer of the day.

Argentina's training session two days earlier had been held behind closed doors. Still, fans climbed hills, fences, and rooftops just to catch a glimpse of Messi or De Paul. Their passion and persistence prompted the Argentine Football Association to make a last-minute decision and throw open Thursday's session to the public. After the session, Messi took to social media to express his gratitude.

He wrote on social media: "It had been a while since I'd been here, and honestly, the affection you always showed me everywhere I went still moves me. Thank you so much to everyone who came today, there were so many Argentinians too!!! It's always a pleasure to see you all again!!"

Just days earlier, Messi had quietly visited the newly renovated Camp Nou at midnight to escape the cameras. He later posted a heartfelt message about "missing the place with his soul," sparking a fresh wave of speculation about a possible short-term return ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Barcelona president Joan Laporta, however, was quick to temper the growing excitement. Speaking to Catalunya Radio, he dismissed any notion of Messi rejoining the club as a player.

"Out of respect for Messi, our players, and our members, it's not the time to speculate with unrealistic scenarios," he said. 

He did, however, confirm that the club intends to hold a grand tribute to Messi once Camp Nou's renovations are complete.

"I didn't know he was coming, but the Spotify Camp Nou is his home," he said. "When they explained how it happened, I think it was a sweet little spur-of-the-moment decision; he'd just finished dinner and felt like coming with some friends. It's only right that Leo receives the most beautiful tribute in the world. When it's finished, we'll have a capacity of 105,000 fans, so we'd love to have him there. We're working on the tribute and on ensuring that the best football in the world can be seen, and as part of the tribute, we'd like to offer Leo the tribute he deserves."

Messi's emotional ties to Barcelona remain unbroken, but professionally, his path is set. Earlier this year, he signed a new deal with Inter Miami, extending his stay in the MLS through to the 2028 season. He's happy in Florida and enjoying life with his family, and yet, still, he has also hinted at longing for his old home.

He told Sport: "We miss Barcelona a lot, that the children continuously, and my wife, talk about Barcelona, the idea of living there again. We have our house, everything, so it's what we want. I'm really looking forward to returning to the stadium when it's finished because since I went to Paris I haven't returned to the Camp Nou either and then they went to Montjuic."

Messi is expected to start when Argentina take on Angola on Friday before returning to club duties with Inter Miami on November 23, when the Herons will play the MLS Conference semi-finals against Cincinnati.

ATLANTA (Nov. 13, 2025) – The U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team will come together for a training camp in Fayetteville, Ga., the future home of the Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center, for a training camp running from Nov. 24-Dec. 1.

With the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup now complete, this group will focus on qualifying for the 2026 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup as Ciara Crinion takes over as head coach of the U-17s while Katie Schoepfer moves to the U-16s and the group that will attempt to qualify for the 2027 FIFA U-17 WWC.

The primary birth year of this group is 2009 and Crinion has called in 21 players born in 2009 with two in 2010 and one in 2011. This is the second training camp for this age group of players at the U-17 level after transitioning from the U-16s this summer.

There were four players on the USA's 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup Team that fell in penalty kicks in the quarterfinal to eventual runners-up Netherlands that were born in 2009 and one that was born in 2010, making them age-eligible for the 2026 FIFA U-17 WWC. The only player on this roster with U-17 caps is midfielder Loradana Paletta, who has four. She is also the only player born in 2011 on this roster.

The camp is part of the Federation's continued focus on the U.S. Way philosophy, which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

Of all the teams vying for one of the 48 spots in the newly expanded 2026 FIFA World Cup field, it is not an exaggeration to say that San Marino are literally the worst, ranking 210th out of 210 eligible teams in FIFA's men's world rankings.

With a population of just over 34,000 -- making it the fifth-smallest recognized country in the world -- San Marino is actually the larger but significantly less famous of two microstates within Italy (as far as we know, Vatican City does not have a FIFA-recognized squad). Thus far, in their quest to play for the world's soccer championship in North America next summer, La Serenissima have lost every one of their seven World Cup qualifying matches, scoring just one goal and allowing 32.

So, you would be forgiven for assuming that all hope is lost for San Marino to play in the next World Cup -- but that is not actually so. For it to happen, though, there will have to be a very specific chain of events ... potentially culminating in San Marino having to lose their final World Cup qualifying match by as many goals as possible.

European teams are awarded 16 of the 48 World Cup bids. After a lengthy round-robin qualifying format, which ends on Nov. 18, the first-place finishers in each of the 12 groups earn an automatic bid. The 12 second-place finishers each advance to a 16-team playoff with the remaining four UEFA bids still up for grabs.

Here's where it gets a bit complicated. The final four spots in that playoff are reserved for the highest-ranked teams who won one of the 14 UEFA Nations League groups back in 2024. As fate would have it, San Marino actually won their three-team Nations League group for the 2024-25 season, notching two wins over Liechtenstein (another European microstate) and holding off Gibraltar with a draw and a loss.

San Marino are ranked 14th out of these 14 Nations League teams, so in order for one of these four playoff spots to fall into their laps, they need 10 of the 13 teams ranked ahead of them in this "winners list" to not need the bid. In other words, if -- and only if -- at least 10 of those countries finish first (and directly qualify for the World Cup) or second (and already qualify for a playoff spot) in their World Cup groups. And, this is where things start to get messy.

As we enter the final week of qualifying games, eight teams that could have earned Nations League bids have already qualified for the World Cup and, therefore, don't need them. This means that San Marino's hopes basically rely on having just two other countries pull out a second-place finish in their groups.

If Nations League group winner Northern Ireland beat Slovakia in their World Cup qualifier on Friday, they would move into second in UEFA World Cup qualifying Group A and be in very good shape to stay there. Then, on Saturday, if Romania -- yet another Nations League group winner -- defeat Bosnia and Herzegovina, those two countries would be tied for second in UEFA World Cup qualifying Group H -- a group which also includes San Marino.

Should this sequence of events come to pass, it will set up the scenario where, when San Marino plays Romania on Nov. 18, La Serenissima will be incentivized to lose by as many goals as possible to ensure the Romanians move on in the traditional World Cup qualifying process and abandon their slot in the Nations League playoff, allowing San Marino to take that spot.

It's the kind of dizzying logistical nightmare that FIFA has been trying to avoid since the "Disgrace of Gijón," when West Germany and Austria allegedly colluded in their final group stage match to allow both teams to advance in the 1982 World Cup, subsequently eliminating Algeria. That match catalyzed FIFA to institute the now familiar rule that all final World Cup group stage matches be played simultaneously.

If San Marino does find themselves with incentive to lose to Romania by as much as possible, though, it begs the question: How would sportsbooks make lines for the match?

For starters, it should be noted that World Cup qualifying handle is not currently a popular betting commodity for soccer, let alone compared to the rest of the menu at sportsbooks: BetMGM soccer trader Tom Pullin told ESPN over email that "interest in World Cup qualifying has been good, but not as high as regular league football like the Premier League." Further, he said that San Marino's matches don't stand out unless they play a high-profile team.

In these World Cup qualifiers, San Marino have, predictably, not been given a chance by bookmakers. At ESPN BET, San Marino's shortest odds to win a match were against Cyprus on Oct. 12 when they were +1300 on the three-way money line. Their longest odds were an astounding 100-1 against Austria just one match prior on Oct. 9. On the flip side, Cyprus were -600 to win, while Austria were not even listed because the odds were too short.

The big-money bettors who did tune in for these matches also predictably faded San Marino at every turn, according to BetMGM and DraftKings. However, Caesars Sportsbook's head of soccer and UK sports Mark Bickerdike said that many bettors "love a big underdog story," so the book racked up solid liability on lots of smaller wagers at long odds.

Which brings us back to the potential "doomsday scenario" on Nov. 18. Given San Marino are already as low as can be in the power ratings, sportsbooks will likely be motivated to list Romania as short as humanly possible, with the possibility of not even listing a money line for them at all, assuming San Marino are incentivized to get demolished.

"We would usually treat San Marino matches slightly differently given the disparity between them and most of the other teams," Pullin said. "For a potential hypothetical situation like you described, the trading team will use market/bets they field as a guide to where prices should be with consideration to the possible higher goal scoring in the initial price."

But for the scenario to even come to fruition, Northern Ireland (+310) will have to upset Slovakia (EVEN), and Romania (+185) will have to upset Bosnia and Herzegovina (+140). A parlay of those two results from the three-way money lines yields +1069 odds, per ESPN BET lines.

"Along with the rest of the industry, we are waiting until we know the outcome of the Bosnia-Romania game on Saturday before deciding on releasing prices for the Romania-San Marino fixture," Bickerdike said over email. "It will be a unique scenario if it plays out."

But should the extraordinary happen and San Marino actually do end up with a chance to advance in World Cup qualifying by losing a match spectacularly, it sets up an absolutely epic dilemma. FIFA rules, of course, prohibit teams from purposely losing matches, but given how poorly things have already gone for San Marino in World Cup qualifying -- one of their matches against Austria ended in a 10-0 drubbing -- it would be difficult to prove that La Serenissima did anything out of the ordinary at all.

Mauricio Pochettino coming on board as the U.S. men's national team coach was the shot in the arm US Soccer thought they needed to take their national team to the next level ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Almost a year later, though, the initial excitement has given way to serious concern. 

His biggest weakness — an inability to pin down a clear tactical approach — is becoming impossible for fans to brush off.

When US Soccer went all in on Pochettino in September 2024, the plan was to give the national team a much-needed dose of ambition and a winning mentality. On paper at least, his track record at the likes of Tottenham, PSG, and Chelsea looked ideal. Teams that were structured and made progress. But the reality with the USMNT under Pochettino has been a team that just can't quite decide on its identity.

Pochettino's biggest problem has been figuring out a playing style that works. He just can't seem to settle on a formation — has been playing with a 4–2–3–1 one minute, a 3–4–2–1 the next — and has shuffled his starting line-up so much that it's starting to feel like players themselves are just not sure what to expect. 

Pochettino has been constantly tinkering with his tactics, resulting in players being left in the dark as to what to do next.

We saw this play out in a losing March 2025 Nations League match against Panama ; not the first time we've seen US players look just unsure of what was going on, either in possession of the ball or when they lost it. And it's been a recurring problem. 

Worse yet, Pochettino's explanation for it hasn't been particularly helpful . He calls his system “organized chaos” and claims he hates being predictable, which, on paper, sounds great , but in practice, is creating more questions than answers.

“That is the thing that I hate, being predictable,” Pochettino told CBS Sports recently, “but you need these types of talents, talented players that can do different things from respecting the organization, but having the possibility to also create the chaos in the opponent because he's creating the chaos in the other team, but with organization. I don't know if I can explain, but I try.”

The thing is, at the club level this approach used to be a real winner for him. Because he had a stable environment and his teams were well into the rhythm of his system by the time they stepped out onto the pitch. But at the international level, things are just a lot more complicated. Clarity in the system has got to come before creativity, at the end of the day.

Fans are left asking the same questions: what does this team look like at its best? What are our starting 11? And how does the team adapt when it gets down to business under pressure? And at this point, the answers just aren't there.

With the World Cup less than a year away and it's being held on home soil, the pressure is really on.

AC Milan have stepped up their pursuit of Robert Lewandowski, scheduling a new round of talks with his agent Pini Zahavi as the Barcelona striker weighs his future as his contract nears its end. With Zlatan Ibrahimovic pushing internally to bring the 37-year-old to San Siro and Milan rebuilding under Max Allegri, the Rossoneri sense an opening, but salary demands remain a major hurdle.

According to Calciomercato, Milan are preparing a fresh approach for Lewandowski, with a new meeting scheduled between sporting director Igli Tare and the striker's agent Pini Zahavi in the coming weeks. The Rossoneri have made the 37-year-old a priority target for June, convinced that his arrival could transform the club's rebuild under Allegri. Lewandowski's contract with Barca runs until June 2026, but uncertainty around his long-term role coupled with the club's plan to sign a new No.9 next summer has placed his future firmly in play.

Milan rejected the idea of approaching him last year due to salary constraints, but with Champions League qualification now a central objective, the Rossoneri believe the timing may be right to formalise negotiations. The San Siro hierarchy have already tested the waters with Lewandowski's entourage. This next meeting is expected to focus on possible salary parameters, with the Pole currently earning €20 million (£17m/$22m) net at Barcelona, almost triple the wages of Milan's highest earner, Rafael Leao.

With Barcelona evaluating replacements and Lewandowski keeping all options open, the situation is edging into a crucial phase, one that could reshape the summer transfer market.

This renewed push from the Rossoneri comes with the backing of their former striker Ibrahimovic, now a senior advisor at RedBird and one of the most influential voices behind Milan's sporting strategy. He views Lewandowski as the type of elite striker who can immediately elevate the squad, much like his own transformative return to the club in 2020.

On the Barcelona side, their search for a new striker highlights how the club is preparing for life after Lewandowski. Reports indicate that Harry Kane sits at the top of their shortlist, with the England captain scoring 108 goals in 113 games for Bayern Munich since 2023. Other names include Julian Alvarez, long admired by Barca, and even a dream move for Erling Haaland, described internally as Joan Laporta's “obsession”. Financial realities, however, mean the Catalan giants are also analysing cheaper alternatives such as Etta Eyong, underlining the scale of the transition being planned.

Lewandowski's reduced role this season, a result of injuries and the emergence of Ferran Torres has only added to uncertainty. Despite this, he remains Barca's leading scorer with seven goals in nine La Liga matches, second only to Mbappe in the Spanish scoring charts.

The ex-Bayern striker has been open about his indecision regarding the next step in his career. While on duty with Poland, he made it clear that he does not intend to rush any decision: “I still don't know the answer. That's why I'm not in a hurry, I'm at peace with myself. Even if, for example, the club contacted me now, I still wouldn't answer that question. Because I also have to feel what's best for me. Now I'm calm, I'm not in a hurry and, at the moment, I don't expect anything else.”

His stance aligns with Milan's long-term approach under Allegri and Tare, who are intent on recruiting experienced leaders to stabilise the squad. Zahavi's strong relationship with Milan further strengthens their position. For Milan, landing Lewandowski would represent both a sporting coup and a symbolic statement that their project is entering a new era.

The Rossoneri's upcoming talks with Zahavi will be pivotal. If the two sides can find common ground on salary structure, potentially through bonuses or multi-year guarantees, negotiations could accelerate rapidly ahead of June. Barcelona, meanwhile, are expected to continue planning for a major reshuffle in the forward department, with the Lewandowski decision acting as the first domino.

As interest from multiple European clubs quietly grows, all eyes now turn to Milan's next meeting. The battle for Lewandowski is only just beginning and the outcome could define one of the summer's biggest transfer sagas.

Vincent Kompany has been handed a huge boost as Bayern Munich edge closer to welcoming back Jamal Musiala and Alphonso Davies from long-term injuries. Musiala, sidelined since July's Club World Cup, could return by December, while Davies' recovery is progressing ahead of schedule. Both are expected to rejoin full training soon.

The German starlet Musiala's road to recovery is finally nearing its end, as the 22-year-old Bayern Munich midfielder, who suffered a broken fibula and dislocated ankle in a horrific collision with PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma during the Club World Cup in July, has taken significant strides toward a full comeback.

According to Abendzeitung, Musiala is expected to return to full fitness “within the next four to eight weeks.” This would make a December return feasible, potentially allowing him to feature in Bayern's final two games of 2025 against Mainz on December 14 and Heidenheim on December 21.

The report adds that Musiala's rehabilitation is progressing positively and that the club remains cautious about rushing his recovery. “He will recover to full health and return fully functional,” the paper noted, reflecting Bayern's internal decision at Sabener Street not to take any risks.

The young German star's gradual return comes as a welcome sign for Kompany, who has not been deprived but tactically concerned of his most creative attacking outlet since the summer. Bayern's attack has shown enormous potential and upgrade but also arguably lacked the fluidity Musiala provides between the lines, and his reintroduction could only escalate the spark..

Bayern boss Kompany has confirmed that the club will remain patient with Musiala's recovery, even as optimism grows over his December return. Speaking to Abendzeitung, the Belgian manager said: “When will he return? The plan was January, but we'll see. These are the kinds of long-term injuries; it could happen a bit faster, but it could also take a bit longer. That's why I want to give him the necessary rest for his return.”

Kompany's comments underline Bayern's pragmatic approach, ensuring Musiala's long-term health over short-term needs. Although early reports hinted at a January return, but the club has been optimistic about his early return, and now the new assessments have opened the possibility of him featuring before the winter break.

Meanwhile, Kicker offers a slightly more cautious view, suggesting that while Musiala's rehabilitation is progressing, January remains the more likely timeframe for his official return to competitive play. The player himself is said to be determined but patient, focusing on “a step-by-step” approach alongside Bayern's medical team to ensure he returns at peak fitness.

It's not just Musiala who's nearing a return, the Canadian international and Bayern's one of the fastest express Davies, another crucial component of the Die Roten's squad, is reportedly on track to rejoin the team before the end of the calendar year. The Canadian defender, who suffered a torn cruciate ligament and meniscus damage earlier this year, could feature in December according to Kicker.

Adding to the optimism, Abendzeitung journalist Maximilian Koch reported that Davies and Japanese defender Hiroki Ito are expected to “fully join team training after the international break and return to playing in December.”

For Kompany, this development provides a timely boost as Bayern prepare for the second half of the Bundesliga campaign. Davies' pace and attacking width have been sorely missed, while Ito's defensive composure offers more stability. If all these players return in December, Bayern could enter 2026 with a fully fit and rejuvenated squad.

At Bayern, there is growing belief that Musiala's recovery has been nothing short of extraordinary. Just four months after his devastating injury, the German international has resumed light training, completing passing and coordination drills, a milestone that has lifted spirits both in Munich and across Germany.

Local reports have described his progress as “a recovery that borders on the impossible.” The young midfielder's smile during training sessions has become a symbol of Bayern's renewed optimism, with teammates and staff alike praising his resilience.

The Bavarians' fixture list offers a promising window for the returning stars. The Bundesliga leaders host Freiburg on November 22, and a high-powered Arsenal game up in the end of November, before facing Mainz and Heidenheim in December, two fixtures where Musiala's and Davies' availability could prove decisive.

Bayern currently top the table with 28 points, unbeaten at home with seven straight wins. Freiburg, sitting 10th with 13 points, will be their next domestic challenge.

If Musiala and Davies make their comebacks before the winter break, it could transform Bayern's attack and defensive balance just in time for the Champions League knockout rounds. With both nearing full fitness, Kompany's squad may retain its trademark dominance, making Bayern's December fixtures as much about Champions League redemption as competition.

Craig Bellamy has overseen six wins, four draws and four defeats in his 14 matches as Wales boss

Wales return to World Cup qualifying action this weekend as they take on Liechtenstein in Vaduz on Saturday (17:00 GMT).

Craig Bellamy's side remain firmly in contention to clinch second place in Group J, so there is a huge amount riding on this month's fixtures - with North Macedonia visiting Cardiff on Tuesday night (19:45 GMT).

Here's everything you need to know about the upcoming fixture with Liechtenstein.

The match at the Rheinpark Stadion will be shown live on BBC Two Wales, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website.

You can listen to live commentary on BBC Sounds via BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Cymru. Commentary is also available on BBC Sport Online and via BBC Radio Wales on FM/DAB & DTV.

Live text commentary will be available on the BBC Sport website and app.

The BBC will also have extensive coverage of Tuesday's qualifier against North Macedonia in the Welsh capital.

Craig Bellamy will be without defenders Ben Davies and Ben Cabango as well as striker Kieffer Moore due to injury.

Cardiff City's Isaak Davies and Queens Park Rangers' Rhys Norrington-Davies have both been called up to the senior squad.

Aaron Ramsey has not been included in the squad but will be with the camp at their Vale Resort training base for this month's double header.

Leeds United winger Daniel James is included having missed the October camp due to an ankle injury.

Burnley defender Connor Roberts, Wrexham goalkeeper Danny Ward and Ipswich Town winger Wes Burns remain unavailable.

"We need to win two," said the head coach. 

"Liechtenstein, we expect to win and I'm not going to shy away from that. North Macedonia is a different game, but I feel they've been fortunate not to lose. 

"They're games I believe we will have a lot of possession in, and we have to be able to create chances from having that possession.

"There's no easy route, but to get to a World Cup there isn't supposed to be. If we finish second then we could avoid a couple of top teams at their grounds [in the play-offs], and that's a motivation for us. I just want us to try and win every game."

Can you name all the clubs Craig Bellamy played for?

Davies, Cabango and Moore withdraw from Wales squad

Belgium appear destined to secure top spot, but second place remains firmly up for grabs.

Thanks to their Nations League ranking, Wales are all-but guaranteed to be in next year's play-offs regardless of whether they finish second or third in the group.

But they can earn themselves a more favourable draw, and home advantage, for the March double header by finishing as runners-up.

Two wins over the coming days will ensure Bellamy's side finish second.

There are also two other scenarios that will see them end up in second spot.

The first would be if they drew with Liechtenstein and then beat North Macedonia three days later.

The second is that Wales would need to beat Liechtenstein by six or more goals which would then mean a draw in the final fixture at Cardiff City Stadium would be enough to finish above North Macedonia on goals scored.

The semi-final play-off matches take place on 26 March next year - with the finals being held five days later on 31 March.

The World Cup in the United States of America, Mexico and Canada runs from 11 June to 19 July, 2026.

...

It starts today!

This Thursday afternoon marks the beginning of the World Cup qualification play-offs for the Africa zone.

In this knockout phase, four teams will be fighting for their chance to reach the biggest competition of all. Here's everything you need to know.

Four teams will face off in a format with two semi-finals, followed by a final. But the qualifying ticket for the World Cup won't be handed to the country that wins this tournament just yet.

The winner of the Africa zone play-offs will then go on to compete in another mini-tournament during the March international window.

The qualified African nation will join two teams from CONCACAF, one from the AFC, one from CONMEBOL (Bolivia), and one from the OFC (New Caledonia).

Two of these teams will then secure the final spots for the 2026 World Cup.

Here are the fixtures for the Africa zone mini-tournament starting this Thursday:

Nigeria - Gabon (5:00 PM)

Cameroon - DR Congo (8:00 PM)

All these matches are taking place in Rabat, Morocco, at the El Barid Stadium and the Prince Moulay El Hassan Sports Complex. The final will be played this Sunday, November 16.

The countries qualified by finishing as the best runners-up in the African qualification phase for the 2026 World Cup.

In a group dominated from start to finish by Ivory Coast, Gabon still managed to secure their spot in the play-offs.

While they had their fate in their own hands just a few matches before the end of the qualifiers, the Congolese suffered a crushing home defeat to Senegal (2-3) after leading 2-0. Now, here they are in the play-offs.

For their part, Cameroon secured a place in the play-offs by finishing behind Cape Verde, who made history by qualifying for their first ever World Cup.

Finally, Nigeria is the surprise survivor of this tournament. Thanks to a 4-0 victory over Benin, the Super Eagles snatched second place from the Beninese on the final day of qualification.

In your opinion, who will secure the ticket for the intercontinental play-off?

If you look just over the shoulder of Mauricio Pochettino as he roams the sideline during a U.S. men's national team game, you'll find his top assistant, Jesús Pérez, in a place he finds most comfortable.

“Two or three yards behind the coach,” Pérez said.

Within that short distance, there is a massive difference, he insists. There is a gulf between thinking through decisions and actually making them — and the consequences that come with those choices.

“When you are No. 2, you see things,” Pérez said. “But when you are No. 1 … wow, the map is bigger.”

Those three yards, however, do not minimize the importance of Pérez's role on the U.S. staff. Pérez has worked at Pochettino's side since 2010, rising from analyst at Espanyol to the coach's right-hand man at Southampton, Tottenham, PSG, Chelsea and now the U.S. He has an outsized impact on the national team as both an integral on-field coach and a chief of staff of sorts, keeping a pulse on every department and connecting the pieces to keep the organization running smoothly.

Pérez is always there, whether it's in stadium suites scouting games of national team players, leaning against the wall during postgame press conferences or running meetings across a number of departments. He is, as Pochettino describes it, the “hands-on coordinator.”

“Jesús is someone who coordinates the professional areas and ensures that integration with the staff, whether from the clubs or the national team, [and] allows us to have better communication channels,” Pochettino told The Athletic. “Where everything can flow more smoothly, preventing any problems and ultimately providing the players with a better platform to perform.”

Pochettino is the face, figurehead and the ultimate decision-maker — those three yards matter. But Pérez grinds behind the scenes to give the staff, and its leader, the best chance at being successful. More importantly, the 54-year-old has become a trusted advisor that Pochettino has leaned on for more than a decade and a half.

“He's a very important person, because, over the years, besides being an important person on the staff professionally, he's also become a friend,” Pochettino said. “That's something that doesn't always happen, especially in the professional sphere like in this sport. That's something beautiful to experience, because we're a group of people who have known each other for many years and who have also found common ground, who share life values, not only professional values, but human values. And I think that's what makes it unique. Within the friendship and within the professional side, that makes us respect each other. That constant challenge of always being better is what's always the priority — in our entire relationship. And I think that's something beautiful.”

The memory still sticks in the back of Ryan Mason's mind.

It was preseason at Spurs under Pochettino, who gave him his Premier League debut. The style of play under the Argentine manager was intense, and they were going through a demanding training session. Mason was hitting a wall when he heard Pérez's voice.

“Mase, you're a strong boy!” the coach shouted.

“He was so good on the mental side of it,” recalled Mason, now head coach at West Brom. “The impact that had on my body was huge. I remember feeling it give me more life, give me more belief in my body. And I still hear it to this day. I can still hear it now. It's something that stuck with me and sticks with me. You have your physical side, but a lot of people have limitations. Some people hit their ceiling because mentally they can't break through certain barriers and challenges. Whereas I believe Jesús and Mauricio, they're people that can really push through your barriers and help you reach higher levels.”

Pérez spent much of the early portion of his career as a fitness coach working in Spain and then Saudi Arabia. He got sick toward the end of his time in the latter – a stress-induced illness, he said – and nearly walked away from coaching before Espanyol's sporting director at the time, Ramón Planes, reached out. Pochettino was looking for someone with Pérez's background to join the club. The offer was intriguing enough to pull him back to work.

Pérez established his value not just on the fitness side, but in other areas, too. He first caught Pochettino's eye with his work ethic in a shared office, where he worked quietly but diligently. Then he showed an ability as an analyst.

Pérez started working from up in the stands but one day offered advice that won Pochettino's trust. At the time, the staff was discussing dropping a forward in favor of a midfielder because they were being overrun in the middle of the park. Pérez saw things differently.

“If you allow me to say you should do the opposite, you are a brave coach, you are a brave team,” he offered. “I think what you have to do is tell one of the center backs to step up and compensate the situation and push high the line, don't drop the striker.”

Within two months, Pérez found himself on the bench with Pochettino.

“We brought him into the club in the youth academy,” Pochettino said. “From there, for six months we got to know each other, and then, when I had the opportunity to bring him into the technical staff with me, I made him the offer. He accepted, and that's how we started working together in Espanyol.”

Still, that fitness background never left him. Players felt the assistant had a way of understanding and unlocking what it took to push them to the next level.

“He helped me to maintain my speed, my agility, my power and he helped me to even get better in my game and in my performances,” said LAFC goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, who played under Pochettino and Pérez at Tottenham. “I still do things (today), it's part of my routine that I learned from them at that time. … I believe that in the shadow of (a) big manager, there (are) always big assistants. And Jesús is one of them. He is a really bright person, really intelligent, and he knows really well his job.”

Over 15 years together, between Pochettino, Pérez and the rest of the staff – which includes Miki D'Agostino (who played with Pochettino at Newell's Old Boys) and goalkeeper coach Toni Jiménez – there is a chemistry and balance that is unique at the upper end of the sport. The coaches interact well and complement each other's strengths.

Pochettino is a charismatic former player. Pérez is far more analytical. If Pochettino pushes hard on players, Pérez understands how to take the good-cop approach. At Spurs, if a player showed up with a new car or a fancy watch, Pérez was known to drop a comment in passing so the player knew the staff noticed. If a story is written or a TV report put out about the U.S. team, chances are Pérez has read it or watched it. In a way, he is Pochettino's eyes and ears around the program.

“Jesús is an extension of Mauricio,” U.S. defender Tim Ream said. “He's got his finger on the pulse with everything, sees all the small details, but also all the big ones as well. He's very much the glue that kind of keeps all the departments together, and his communication is very similar to that of Mauricio. Lots of personal one-on-one conversations, but also making sure that everybody's doing the right thing at all times and doing the things together and pulling in the same direction.”

Top managers typically churn through assistants — many leave for other jobs or simply burn out. That the staff has been together this long stands out. There is a level of loyalty that exists within the group. Pochettino typically negotiates contracts for his entire staff.

“He always did what he promised to me,” Pérez said. “ He said (when we) were in Espanyol, ‘We cannot give you the value that you have, but I promise you one day we will try to get the contract that you deserve.' And since we arrived to England, I never was worried about my contract. When he asked me, you know, what do you think about your contract, I said, ‘Whatever you decide. For me, it's fine.' That's my answer in the last 15 years, and it will be the same forever.”

Pérez was linked to possible top jobs in England, but never took one. Even now he basically laughs off a question about it.

“The credit is his credit,” Pérez said. “It's Mauricio's credit. It's not because I want to be humble, but I know how this business works. If people want to give me some credit, fine. I'm sure some qualities probably are (from) myself. But Mauricio was doing great before I joined the team and I'm sure if all of us, (if) we leave at some point, he will continue having success.”

Pérez insists he is focused on his role within Pochettino's staff — of being the connector.

That role has been different in some ways with the U.S.

Coaches are not around players as much, which brings “completely different dynamics.” That doesn't just mean in how hands-on coaches can be on the field, but also in some of the relationships and politics that happen behind the scenes. Players who play require less handling. You show them where and how to improve, but their morale is up. With the rest of the squad there is a constant need to stay on top of players' mentality and belief.

“The challenge in the club is to sustain the motivation, the energy, the readiness of the guys that don't play, and to deal with everything that comes along — the results or decisions or transfers or politics,” Pérez said. “That's consuming. But in the national team, you select a player, and if a player doesn't want to come, (they) stay out. So in general, you shouldn't have problems of motivation in the camp.”

What Pochettino, Pérez and the rest of the staff have learned, though, is there are many uncontrollable variables with the national team. You never really know what players will be available. Since taking over the national team in October 2024, this staff has dealt with numerous long-term injuries to key players, including Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi, Sergiño Dest and Antonee Robinson. That has added to the already-difficult task of team-building.

“When we were discussing the job, you look at the list of the players you know, and you imagine the best version of everyone you know,” Pérez said. “And then (you have) every single situation, injuries or personal situations, and also every group has a past, so things don't happen without reason. So, our duty was to go through one year knowing, assessing and digesting situations that came from the past, but trying to do (things) our way, with our circumstances. It was the real challenge.

“We want to win matches. We didn't go to the U.S. to have an experience. We went there to increase our [experience], to play the World Cup. But we are there to win matches, to compete. The way to compete is maximizing resources, but we need to maximize the best group of players that they can be together.”

That process hasn't come without pain. The staff brought in numerous new faces and left out several regulars in a bid to increase competition and eliminate complacency. But the results that build belief in the process haven't always been there. Pérez said there is still real conviction they have taken the right approach.

The staff seems to have unlocked something in their move to a hybrid back line that shifts from a three- to four-man look and utilizes wingbacks, a position of strength in the pool. They were also able to truly manufacture competition in a pool where it has often seemed obvious who the best players are.

“There are different ways to win matches, obviously we have our preference, but as Mauricio always says, we adapt to the players' qualities and to the player's state, and we are not a slave of one way or another,” Pérez said. “At the end of the day, the principles of the games are there. … But none of them are going to be right if you are not fully committed. Fully committed with no doubts. And that's the basics. So before we talk (about) other things, we [must] feel that we have a group really committed. And if it was some noise around those circumstances, I think everything (is now) clear.”

With time winding down toward the World Cup, and with yet another camp with numerous key figures missing, Pérez said the coaches are confident they've gone through the right process to find the players they trust. That was part of why they spent so much time calling in new faces and looking at options beyond the previous core.

“We know exactly the big group of players that we can rely on,” Pérez said. “Depending on the circumstances, now it's a matter of state and injuries. But we know (for example), if we call Alex Freeman, what Alex can give us. When we gave him the opportunity, we saw the potential. And now (he is) just getting better for the national team, for his club. But if we need to call Nathaniel Harriel, that probably has played less with us, we know him very well (too).”

Each player — and there have been 71 called into camp since Pochettino took over — has added value in working toward the end goal, Pérez insisted.

“That's the biggest asset of the group,” he said. “That we are going to feel bad and sorry for the guys that probably at the end, they can't make it, but we will give (them) credit and value for what they did for us and for the group, because without them, we couldn't have the final group.”

For Pérez, that part of the process is critical to team-building. And delegating credit in the name of group success – that's just part of Pérez's process.

Qualification for the 2026 World Cup is hitting a critical juncture.

Of the tournament's 48 qualifying spots, 28 already have been claimed. A few more can be secured as World Cup qualifiers take place during FIFA's November international window.

The attention during the November qualification slate leans heavy toward Europe, where as many as eight nations can join the World Cup field this week. England is the only squad that has claimed one of UEFA's 16 allotted World Cup spots.

In addition to the three spots given to the World Cup hosts — Canada, Mexico and the United States — Concacaf has three additional spots (and a possibility for a fourth) up for grabs. Two of those spots can be secured during the November qualifying window.

Here's what to know about where qualifying stands for the 2026 World Cup, including which nations could secure berths next:

The 2026 World Cup will include 48 teams, a huge jump up from the 32 that participated in Qatar 2022. As November's qualifiers play out, 28 nations have qualified.

Here is a complete list of every country to qualify for the 2026 World Cup entering November's qualifying window:

Qualification is nearing its conclusion (the World Cup draw is Dec. 5, after all). Each confederation's schedule and process mean each continent wraps up at different points - for example, spots in Africa, Asia and South America already have been claimed.

Here is a complete breakdown of how FIFA divided all 48 berths at the 2026 World Cup:

For the first time, the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be hosted across three different countries: Canada, Mexico and the United States of America. Kansas City is the smallest of the 16 selected cities for the tournament, with six matches coming to the metro next June and July.

This is the first time Kansas City will hold a global sporting event of this scale, with about 650,000 expected to come into town for the games. That's a big crowd, and fans both locally and from around the globe will want to be part of the action.

Because we're Midwest nice, KCUR decided to make it easier for you to jump on the World Cup bandwagon and bring your superfan A-game.

And don't worry, we'll update information regularly on this page so you can keep up as the World Cup approaches and more details develop. Find more of KCUR's World Cup coverage here.

Bonus: Join KCUR on Saturday, Nov. 15 at Strange Day Brewing for a special discussion about the World Cup, and then watch the USA vs. Paraguay match!



The 2026 FIFA World Cup is a 104-game tournament featuring 48 competing countries. It will kick off June 11, 2026, at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City.

You can see a live countdown clock for the start of the tournament here or get a selfie in front of one at Kansas City's Union Station entrance lobby, or at Terminal A inside the new Kansas City International Airport.

The tournament will last 39 days and take place across 16 North American cities.

This is the full schedule for all the matches.

The World Cup final will be held at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 19, 2026.



Yes, but ticketing for all games — including the ones in Kansas City — happens in phases through a lottery draw system.

For access to all ticket sales, you'll need to register a profile through FIFA's site.

Phase 1 and 2 of the ticket draws have closed, and successful entrants should already be notified of their opportunity to purchase tickets.

There is still the random selection draw phase, which begins after the World Cup teams are finalized on Dec. 5, 2025. Fans will be able to apply for specific matches once those matchups are announced.

Then, at some point closer to the tournament's start, fans can purchase last minute tickets on a first-come, first-served basis.

You can also can find premium (AKA more expensive) hospitality packages for games.

For information on the resale/exchange marketplace or travel visa requirements, read FIFA's ticket site very carefully.

Kansas City will host six matches at GEHA Arrowhead Stadium, which will be renamed Kansas City Stadium for the tournament:

We won't know which Group Stage teams will play until the draw on Dec. 5, 2025.

Once the teams are selected, they'll finalize their base camp locations – the facilities where they will practice and gather.

KC 2026 is the nonprofit organizing logistics for the games across Kansas City. They've been recruiting volunteers and offering resources for local businesses.

KC 2026 is also planning an elaborate Fan Fest experience on the lawn in front of the National WWI Museum and Memorial with a giant screen, stage and activities. That's a way for anyone to interact with the World Cup excitement in Kansas City, even if you don't have tickets to a game.

You can expect to find watch parties and festivities at Power & Light, which has served as an iconic soccer gathering zone in the past, as well as other pop ups across the city.

Want a soundtrack for your excitement? Kansas City hip-hop legend Tech n9ne has already written the official host city theme song. (He knows a thing or two about themes for championship-winning teams.)

And local artist Jadie Arnett's “Woven Together” was chosen from over 100 submissions as Kansas City's official host city poster. It depicts a game day scarf and images of Kansas and Missouri.

Local businesses, and art groups, are already preparing for the influx of people, as are the Kansas City Police Department and the advocacy group MOCSA, which is leading sexual-assault intervention trainings for service industry workers.

KC 2026 announced in March 2025 that they procured 200 extra buses to help with transportation by tapping into and expanding our existing routes.

This will include routes to matches at Arrowhead Stadium, the airport, hotel centers and key destinations on both sides of the state line. KC 2026 has yet to announce a concrete plan of what this new service will look like or how it will operate.

In the meantime, here are Ride KC's bus maps and schedules.

The newly expanded, and free, KC Streetcar line has a live tracker you can monitor. This fun guide from KCUR can help you explore every stop along the route. While the streetcar is a great way to move through midtown and downtown Kansas City (and soon make it to a Current match on the riverfront), it won't get you to Arrowhead Stadium itself.

The city also offers paratransit RideShare and BikeShare. Lyft and Uber operate in the city, as well, but expect demand to cause high prices.

Kansas City has a long history with soccer. You can learn more about some of the early immigrants who first brought the game to the city here, from KCUR's podcast A People's History of Kansas City.

And it was Kansas City businessman Lamar Hunt, more famously known as the patriarch of the Chiefs, who was instrumental in developing professional soccer leagues and attracting the country's last FIFA World Cup, back in 1994.

Now Kansas City has two professional soccer teams: a men's MLS team, Sporting KC, and a women's NWSL team, the Current.

The Current, whose official colors are teal and red, has given Kansas City the unofficial nickname of “Teal Town.” They were the first professional women's team in the world to have a stadium built just for them: CPKC Stadium, on the Berkley Riverfront.

If you want to play soccer, Kansas City is home to plenty of recreational leagues for kids and adults.

Or if you just want to cheer, there are soccer fan supporter groups: The KC Blue Crew pulls for the Current, and The Cauldron for Sporting KC. You can even find local supporter groups for clubs around the globe. The city just recently hosted the Premier League Fan Festival, attracting thousands of people.

We also just happen to be the hometown of Jason Sudeikis, co-creator and star of the popular soccer series, Ted Lasso -- which recently shot its fourth season in Kansas City. Sudeikis said the show was partly inspired by his actual childhood coach at Shawnee Mission West High School.



The sport Association Football, known in the U.S. as soccer, has different professional leagues and tournaments around the world.  

FIFA oversees the largest of them all, the World Cup, which takes place every four years.

The FIFA tournament qualifying process takes years. This article explains the U.S. National team's schedule for FIFA's international window, friendlies and other tournaments.

Technically, this upcoming 2026 FIFA tournament started soon after the last one ended, in September 2023. You can already find their international match calendar into 2030.

A record 48 teams will qualify to compete in the upcoming 2026 games, making this the biggest FIFA World Cup tournament ever.

These are the 121 nations that didn't qualify. :(

Geographically, FIFA puts member countries into six continental confederations, which then get a determined amount of qualifying spots.

The final six teams will be decided in part during the Nov. 20, 2025 draw and then in March 2026 during the FIFA play-off tournament and European Play-offs. 

(If you're wondering how the World Cup differs from the Olympic men's soccer tournament, it's a lot. World Cup teams have to take a smaller roster and abide by player age limits — and it's not a FIFA-sanctioned tournament.)

The FIFA World Cup tournament is broken down into different rounds. This video explains it very well!

The Group Stage: Thursday, June 11 - Saturday, June 27

Round of 32: Sunday, June 28 - Friday, July 3

The teams that advance will continue on to the final knockout rounds.

Getting on the same page about the rules of soccer is a critical part of organizing an international tournament of this scale.

FIFA uses the laws of the game from the International Football Association Board, translated into multiple languages.

Most of us know the basics of the game. You kick the ball with your foot into the opponent's goal, and only the goalie can touch the ball with their hands while it is in play within their own penalty box area.

Here's a direct link to the explanation of the offside (not “offsides”) rule. That way you'll be ready in those especially heated moments.

The basic rules during the knockout phase of the tournament are:

In total, the U.S. men's team has appeared in 11 World Cups throughout history. 

They got third place in the first-ever tournament in 1930, but hit a dry spell through most of the 20th century. The team started making more regular appearances again after 1990, even reaching the quarterfinals in 2002. They failed to qualify at all in 2018, but advanced to the knockout stage in 2022 before being defeated by the Netherlands.

As tournament co-hosts in 2026, the USA secured their spot and are looking to do better than their last appearance during the Qatar games of 2022, when the team exited in the Round of 16.

By contrast, the women's national team has qualified for every single Women's FIFA World Cup since the first one in 1991, and has won four of them, mostly recently in 2019 against the Netherlands.

The U.S. women's team have already secured their spot for the 2027 women's World Cup games in Brazil.

We won't know exactly who will be on the full 26-man roster until the games get closer, but a key person to keep an eye out for is star forward Christian Pulisic, who plays for AC Milan.

This will be the first time Mauricio Pochettino will coach a national team. A former Argentinian player who once played in World Cup games, his coaching experience lies more in the European leagues.

We're not likely to see many Kansas City player connections on the men's national team, like when Sporting KC's Graham Zusi and Matt Besler played in the 2014 tournament.

But 2024 MLS Assistant referee of the year Kyle Atkins, a Kansas City resident and Kansas State grad, refereed in the 2022 Qatar World Cup Games and could be a part of the upcoming games.

If you're rooting for the USA, red, white and blue are your go-to colors, obviously.

If you're rooting for a different country, the chants and colors will tend to match that particular nation's flag,

Do a little research ahead of time, and see if you can find fellow fans to watch a match with, like at a local business or restaurant that has ties to a particular country. That can be a fun way to experience the World Cup even if you're not particularly invested.

If you're planning an elaborate outfit, or even something simple for fan fest or the game, be sure to check requirements for what's allowed ahead of time so you can have fun and not worry about being denied access.

The World Cup promises to be both an intense and exciting time in Kansas City -- maybe a little annoying for locals going about their normal lives, and all-consuming for the wild fans expected to descend upon the region.

No matter where you land on the spectrum, you'll likely be affected by the games in some form. So be ready, and let's show the world what Kansas City has to offer.

	(Reuters) - Barcelona president Joan Laporta has downplayed the possibility of Lionel Messi returning to the club, calling it unrealistic, following the Argentine's surprise visit to the revamped Camp Nou, where he spent 21 years of his glittering career.


	 


	Messi, who joined Barca's youth academy as a 13-year-old and became their all-time leading scorer with 672 goals in 778 appearances, left the Catalan side in 2021 when they could not make it financially viable to keep him.


	 


	The 38-year-old World Cup winner, who now plays for Inter Miami, visited the iconic stadium on Sunday and expressed his desire to return there one day.


	 


	"I hope that one day I can return, and not just to say goodbye as a player, as I never got to do," the eight-times Ballon d'Or winner had said.


	 


	"Out of respect to Messi, all the club staff and the club members, it's not right for me to speculate on something that would not be realistic, and it's not the moment to do it," Laporta told Catalunya Radio on Wednesday.


	 


	During Messi's storied Barca career, he won 10 LaLiga titles, four Champions League crowns and three Club World Cups.


	 


	Messi, who moved to Paris St Germain on a free transfer after his Barca exit, extended his contract with Inter Miami in October and has previously hinted that the Major League Soccer club would likely be his last.


	 


	Laporta said that Barca would like to give Messi a tribute at Camp Nou once the renovations — set to expand the stadium's capacity to 105,000 — are completed.


	 


	"He's playing for Inter Miami. He knows he's loved and appreciated for who he is and that he'll always be welcome," Laporta said.


	 


	"It's only fair that he should have the best tribute in the world. It would be wonderful to have his tribute here, in front of 105,000 fans."

Henry Patten still has a chance to win the Nitto ATP Finals with partner Harri Heliovaara, but the Briton has already earned a win for life this week.

Sunday, the day before Patten played his first match of the season finale, he got engaged to longtime partner Ellie Stone.

“I've been with Ellie now for best part of 10 years, pretty much,” Patten told ATPTour.com. “It was coming at some point and as a tennis player, I don't get to see her that much throughout the year. And this is one of the trips that she chose to come on.”

Patten secured the ring during Wimbledon and has been waiting for the special moment since, always having an eye on Turin. The 29-year-old arrived a day before Stone and scouted the city for the perfect spot. He ended up discovering Basilica di Superga, which has a view of the city.

“Somehow it was really quiet. Went up there in the morning, really beautiful day, and then I told her to look over at the chimneys, made up some kind of excuse, and then proposed,” Patten said. “She was very, very happy, I'm pleased to report. And [she was] surprised, which I think gets me bonus points.”



The doubles standout played college tennis at the University of North Carolina Asheville, where he met Stone, who was on the soccer team. They have been together since.

It is difficult for them to spend time together throughout the year because Stone is in her second year of medical residency in North Carolina.

“She's a doctor, officially, but she is in the process of becoming fully trained as a doctor over there,” Patten said. “She doesn't get much time off and she can't travel much. It's not like she can do her job remotely. She's in the hospital all the time.”

As excited as he was, Patten needed to refocus quickly to take the court inside Inalpi Arena Monday for his opening match of the year-end championships with Heliovaara against Christian Harrison and Evan King.

“I was much more nervous about getting engaged than I was about playing my first match,” Patten said, cracking a laugh. “I can tell you that for free.” 

Heliovaara and Patten are 1-1 in the John McEnroe Group and still have a chance to qualify for the semi-finals. The Briton hopes to make it as far as possible in Turin, but will leave the city with his head held high no matter what happens.

“It's such a big deal to me, so much more important. We've been together for 10 years and I'll spend the rest of my life with her, which I'm incredibly excited about,” Patten said of his engagement. “It's crazy, because obviously it is one of the biggest [tournaments], but it's taken quite a big back seat. That being said, we're still taking the tennis pretty seriously.”

Jannik Sinner is turning into an indoor titan.

The Italian, who has already guaranteed his place in the semi-finals of the Nitto ATP Finals, has become dominant with a roof over his head. The second seed's win against Alexander Zverev was his 28th in a row indoors and he shows no sign of slowing down.

Sinner's winning streak is already the sixth longest in the Open Era (carpet not included) and dates back to the championship match in Turin two years ago, when he fell to Novak Djokovic. Only John McEnroe, Djokovic, Roger Federer and Ivan Lendl have won more consecutive indoor hard-court matches, with Federer accomplishing the feat twice.

McEnroe owns the longest streak in the Open Era, having emerged victorious in 47 straight indoor hard-court matches from 1978 through 1987. Nobody else has won more than 35 in a row.

Longest Indoor Hard-Court Winning Streaks in Open Era




What is most impressive about Sinner's streak is not just that he has won, but how convincingly he has done so. The Italian has needed a deciding set in just three of the 28 triumphs he has earned during this streak. In his 25 straight-sets wins, Sinner has needed just five tie-breaks.

At last year's Nitto ATP Finals, Sinner did not drop more than four games in a set, becoming the first player to win the season finale without losing a set since Lendl in 1986. He has not lost a set through two matches this year in Turin, either. 

The 24-year-old has an idea of why he is successful in such conditions.

“I feel like when someone hits fast, it's very difficult to change the pace of the ball. So this for sure helps me a lot playing indoors,” Sinner said. “[At] the same time I also try to change the pace because it is essential and it is important, especially with the difference of the players you play against.

“But yeah, you don't have the wind, you don't have the sun. You always have the same feeling on the court. It also helps you to feel more and more comfortable, at least from my side.”





Sinner's indoor performance ranks highly not just among his peers, but among the all-time greats. The San Candido native is 88-21 indoors, giving him the fifth-best winning percentage in the Open Era according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Only McEnroe (85.3%), Lendl (83%), Jimmy Connors (81.6%) and Federer (81%) have won at a higher rate.

No other active player, including Djokovic (80.2%), has won a better percentage of indoor matches. Sinner can continue his imperious indoor play this week but extending his winning streak to 31 and successfully defending his Nitto ATP Finals trophy.

Taylor Townsend and Naomi Osaka went viral with a yacht dance video to a Minaj and 4 Non Blondes remix to as a part of their offseason vacation. Osaka dazzled in a blue swimsuit, while Townsend rocked a black one-piece. The video was the latest showcase of their off-court friendship.

Taylor Townsend and Naomi Osaka are making waves this offseason -- literally and figuratively! 

The two stars set the Internet ablaze with a joint video posted to social media on Wednesday, where they could be seen dancing on a yacht to a mash-up of Minaj's 2012 song “Beez in the Trap” and 4 Non Blondes' 1993 chart-topper “What's Up?” The remix has gone viral on TikTok, with creators blending Minaj's verses and Linda Perry's famous vocals to create a remix that Rolling Stone says that the video app "can't get enough of."

Looking cool on the clear-blue seas, Osaka stunned in a bejeweled blue swimsuit accented with multicolored beads, while Townsend wore black cut-out one-piece and layered in gold jewelry.

"In the ocean trap with @naomiosaka," captioned Townsend on Instagram, where the post picked up nearly 100,000 likes less than a day after it was posted.

Later, posing in a blue two-piece, a relaxed Osaka showed off more sun-soaked snapshots. "Beaches and I just get along." she wrote.

Two of the Hologic WTA Tour's touring mothers, Osaka and Townsend showcased an off-court bond more than once this season. After giving birth to son Adyn in 2021, Townsend returned to tennis a year later and had the best season of her career this season, which included an Australian Open win with Katerina Siniakova and an ascent to the World No. 1 ranking. 

At the US Open, where Townsend reached the fourth round in singles and was runner-up with Siniakova in doubles, Osaka credited her hard work -- and joked that it was "sickening" that Townsend's "hardware collection grows every tournament."

But Osaka's hardware collection grew this year, too. She reached two tour-level finals -- the ASB Classic and the Omnium Banque Nationale -- and also won a WTA 125 tournament in Saint-Malo, France. For the first time since 2021, the four-time Grand Slam champion finished in the Top 20 of the PIF WTA Rankings.

 Gleison Bremer knows plenty about the challenges of elite sport. He is vice-captain of one of the world's most historic football teams, Juventus FC, while he has also earned five caps for the Brazilian national team. 

 Yet even an athlete as established on the world stage as Bremer sees plenty to marvel at in the exploits of the ATP Tour's roster of stars. The 28-year-old, who is a big tennis fan and names Lorenzo Musetti, Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic as his favourite players, came to Turin's Inalpi Arena on Wednesday evening to take in the action at the Nitto ATP Finals. 

 "Their mentality impresses me the most,” Bremer told ATPTour.com (in Italian), when asked about the differences between his own sport and tennis. “In tennis you're alone, you have no alibis, you must take all the responsibility. In football you can afford to play not at your best if your teammates help you." 

 The Nitto ATP Finals is not the only ATP Tour event Bremer has visited in 2025. He also went to the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters in April, when he met Musetti. In Turin on Wednesday, the Brazilian was courtside for Sinner's straight-sets win against Alexander Zverev, and after the match he met and congratulated the No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings and defending Turin champion.

 Of course, any Brazilian interested in tennis in 2025 can't help but be excited by the recent emergence of a breakout star from the South American country. Joao Fonseca won the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF and has backed that with a stellar 2025 season. 

 The 19-year-old Fonseca rose to a career-high No. 24 in the PIF ATP Rankings earlier this month after lifting his maiden ATP 500 title at the Swiss Indoors Basel. For Bremer, the teenager from Rio de Janeiro has the potential to add his name to an iconic list of greats from a famously proud sporting nation. 

 "He's young, but he's rising,” said Bremer of Fonseca. “I think in the future he has the potential to reach the same level of those world-class champions. We missed great sportsmen in the past years. In the past we've had Pele, Ayrton Senna, Guga [Kuerten]."

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo

All 10 current Formula 1 teams will continue to sponsor a livery and driver in F1 ACADEMY, while Cadillac are set to join the all-female series as a sponsor from 2027.

F1 ACADEMY and Formula 1 have announced that all 10 current F1 teams have reaffirmed their commitment to sponsor a livery and driver in the all-female series as part of a multi-year partnership.

The Cadillac Formula 1 team, who will join F1 in 2026, have also confirmed that they will join the F1 ACADEMY grid as a sponsor from 2027.

This agreement not only reiterates the sport's deep commitment to increasing female participation in motorsport, on and off the track, but also reflects the rapidly expanding and highly competitive pool of drivers competing for a seat in the all-female F4-level series.

In addition, with a focus on deeper talent development, from 2027 drivers who have competed in the two previous seasons may be granted an exemption to race in the series for a third season, in accordance with the updated 2027 regulations.

This new provision reflects a tailored approach to nurturing talent and will be granted exclusively to drivers whose performance indicates strong potential for continued growth throughout a third campaign.

The news comes at a time of continued global growth for F1 ACADEMY. The series' brand platform has grown rapidly in the three seasons since its launch in 2023, with races broadcast in over 170 global territories, the seven-part documentary series on Netflix produced by Reese Witherspoon's production company Hello Sunshine, F1: The Academy, and a cumulative social audience across Instagram, YouTube, X and TikTok of 1.38 million.

Susie Wolff, Managing Director of F1 ACADEMY, said: “The commitment of long-term support from all 10 current Formula 1 teams, and the addition of Cadillac to our grid from 2027, sends a powerful message about the future of F1 ACADEMY.

“We're not just providing a platform for the current generation of female drivers; together, we're building a pathway to support generations of talent to come.

“We continue to be impressed by the depth of female talent coming out of the world of karting and are encouraged by the growth and strength of the emerging talent pool.

“A sharpened focus on individualised talent development, including the opportunity for drivers with high potential to compete in up to three seasons, will give standout drivers the support and platform needed to fully realise their potential, while ensuring that the F1 ACADEMY grid consistently features the very best female talent.”

The future of “Poker Face” is looking like a mystery that might even puzzle Charlie Cale at first glance.

IndieWire has confirmed that Peacock has opted not to renew the Rian Johnson-created mystery series after two seasons, but the show is seeking a new home. In an unexpected twist, however, Lyonne will not be returning as traveling detective/human lie detector Charlie Cale. 

The role of “Charlie” (unclear if it's specifically “Charlie Cale”) will instead be played by Peter Dinklage. No lie. A source close to the project told IndieWire that supposedly this was by design for Johnson's T-Street Productions and MRC, as the show now plans on recasting the “Charlie” character every two seasons.

Lyonne will remain on board as an executive producer if the show lands at another network or streaming service.

“Poker Face” premiered on Peacock in 2023, with Johnson directing the first two episodes before handing things off to showrunners Nora and Lilla Zuckerman (Johnson also directed Episode 9). Season 2, which aired in spring 2025, saw the Zuckermans replaced by “Americana” director Tony Tost as showrunner, with Johnson directing the season premiere. Season 2 ended with a dramatic finale that appeared to be setting up a major new confrontation for Cale, essentially a Moriarty to Cale's Sherlock Holmes, but it is unclear whether that story will be directly continued with Dinklage.

 










The show saw Johnson applying the same modern touch to “Columbo”-style case-of-the-week detective stories that his “Knives Out” franchise brought to whodunnit movies. The episodic format made it easy to bring in major guest stars, with the likes of Adrien Brody, Cynthia Erivo, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ron Perlman, Giancarlo Esposito, John Mulaney, and Kumail Nanjiani making appearances during the first two seasons.  

“Poker Face” was one of Peacock's top performing shows, at least according to Nielsen ratings. It debuted among the Top 5 on Nielsen's Top Original streaming series when it debuted back in 2023, launching with 547 million viewing minutes logged, and that number grew from there in Week 2. Season 2 had the show's premiere return to the Top 5, but with just 497M viewing minutes. 

Regardless of what the future of “Poker Face” holds, Johnson and Lyonne currently have full slates of projects to juggle. Johnson's “Knives Out” series continues to hum along smoothly, with the third film “Wake Up Dead Man” earning rave reviews following its Toronto premiere ahead of its upcoming holiday release. The “Looper” director has also teased plans to direct an original sci-fi film as his next project. Lyonne is making her directorial debut on the film “Uncanny Valley,” which is being produced by her new AI studio Asteria.

 










News of the show's cancellation and recasting plans was first reported by Deadline.

Should the show land at another outlet, Dinklage would take over the role of Charlie from Natasha Lyonne.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


Peacock has canceled Poker Face after two seasons, but series creator Rian Johnson is looking to take the show to another outlet — and with a new lead actor.


	News of the cancellation comes about four months after Poker Face, starring Natasha Lyonne, concluded its second season. The second season didn't perform quite as well as the first installment in 2023, based on available ratings data, though it was among Peacock's most watched original shows and reviews remained heavily positive. It was also a fairly expensive show, however, and not produced in-house at NBCUniversal; Johnson's T-Street produces the series with independent studio MRC Television.

	Johnson and MRC will shop Poker Face to other outlets — but with a twist. Lyonne will no longer play the lead role of Charlie Cale, who's blessed/cursed with the ability to instantly tell if people are lying (Lyonne will continue as an executive producer on the series). As first reported by Deadline, Emmy winner Peter Dinklage has signed on to play Charlie.


	Going forward, the idea is to have a new lead actor as Charlie every two seasons — all predicated, obviously, on another outlet picking up the Columbo-inspired crime procedural. 


	“We've been germinating this next move together since writing the season two finale,” Johnson and Lyonne said in a statement. “We love our Poker Face and this is the perfect way to keep it rolling. Give us a beat and we may just see Charlie Cale again down that open highway.”

	











	Tony Tost served as showrunner for season two of Poker Face, taking over from Nora and Lilla Zuckerman. It's unclear at the moment whether Tost will return or a new showrunner will come aboard should the show find a home. Johnson and Ram Bergman executive produce for T-Street; Tost, the Zuckerman sisters, Lyonne, Chris Provenzano, Adam Arkin and Nena Rodrigue executive produced season two.


	Dinklage recently guest starred in The Lowdown at FX. The former Game of Thrones star's recent credits also include Roofman and Dexter: Resurrection, and he provides the voice for Dr. Dillamond in Wicked: For Good. Dinklage is repped by CAA.


	Lyonne is repped by CAA and Untitled Entertainment.

Cynthia Erivo put her body art on full display at the Singapore premiere of “Wicked: For Good” on Thursday, wearing a dramatic black Vivienne Westwood Couture gown with a sheer cutout panel that showed off a cluster of flowers tattooed on her hip.

The strapless corset design was embroidered with black roses and accessorized with a matching choker and an array of Tiffany & Co. earrings.

The Westwood design team included a sneaky nod to Oz inside the dress, stitching a black witch's hat inside the corset as an homage to Erivo's character, Elphaba. 

At the movie's Brazil premiere last week, the 38-year-old actress flashed a trio of heart tattoos on her sternum in a custom Jean Paul Gaultier crop top by Duran Lantink. She and co-star Ariana Grande each have an impressive collection of ink, including matching tattoos on their palms reading “For Good.”

The London-born star has been working closely with stylist Jason Bolden to create a darker, more sophisticated aesthetic for the sequel's promotional appearances. 

The duo has pivoted away from the Elphaba green that dominated the first film's press tour, instead embracing all-black ensembles that reflect the character's evolution.

“I think fashion is another form of art and expression,” Erivo told GQ UK in a new interview for the magazine's Men of the Year issue. “I think that if you don't use it well, it's wasted.”

She continued, “I like being able to express myself through the clothes I wear, through the jewellery I wear. I actually think it's another inward expression turned outwards. I don't believe in taking the last thing off — I believe in wearing as much as you want.”

The “Wicked: For Good” press tour continues with a final stop in New York City on Nov. 17 ahead of the film's Nov. 21 wide release date.

Everyone's taste for romance is a little bit different, and so while we might not balk at anyone — let alone a lush, lavish, and very sexy marketing blitz — deeming a classic story “the greatest love story of all time,” we've got to call time on something here. Whatever form Emerald Fennell's upcoming “Wuthering Heights” adaptation takes (and, knowing her work, that will definitely mean out-there, wild, sexy, and strange, compliments all), we're starting to get worried about one particular element after seeing the first full trailer for her film.

 










Iconic romantic leads? Sure, yes, Cathy and Heathcliff fit the bill. But that's not all they're about, and even their most ardent fans have to recognize a baseline truth that so far has been missing from marketing for the film: they're also huge assholes. That's not even a value judgement and it's also kind of romantic, as their forbidden love only further irritates their worst qualities. If you can't have love, sure, it could make you selfish and cruel and just plain mean, and that's often the case with Cathy and Heathcliff.

And yet, for those uninitiated into Emily Brontë's classic novel and whom are just now only enjoying these sumptuous first looks at Fennell's latest film, learning just how big of jerks they are might come as a surprise. Let's hope that doesn't carry over to the final film.

Billed as “a bold and original imagining of one of the greatest love stories of all time,” the film stars Margot Robbie as Cathy and Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff, whose “forbidden passion for one another turns from romantic to intoxicating in an epic tale of lust, love, and madness.” Fennell directs from her own screenplay, based on the novel “Wuthering Heights” by Emily Brontë. Fennell's film also stars Hong Chau, Shazad Latif, Alison Oliver, Martin Clunes, and Ewan Mitchell. 

In tandem with today's new trailer, Charli xcx has also released her new track from the film, “Chains of Love,” and shared a pre-order link for the full “Wuthering Heights” album.

Warner Bros. Pictures will release the film in theaters nationwide on February 13, 2026, and internationally beginning February 11, 2026. Check out the film's first full trailer below.

Charli XCX has announced a new album. The follow-up to Brat and its spinoffs is called Wuthering Heights, and it is out on February 13 via Atlantic. Below, listen to a new song from the album called “Chains of Love.”

As the title suggests, Wuthering Heights was born from Charli XCX's work with Emerald Fennell on the filmmaker's new adaptation of the famed Emily Brontë novel. “I called Emerald and asked her what she was hoping for from my read of the script,” the British musician explained on Substack. “She coyly suggested ‘A song?' and I suggested ‘An album?' because why not? I wanted to dive into persona, into a world that felt undeniably raw, wild, sexual, gothic, British, tortured and full of actual real sentences, punctuation and grammar. Without a cigarette or a pair of sunglasses in sight, it was all totally other from the life I was currently living. I was fucking IN.”

Charli XCX also wrote about how she made Wuthering Heights primarily with Finn Keane, the British producer and songwriter formerly known as Easyfun. “From the very start of our process we were discussing the Todd Hayne's documentary about The Velvet Underground and in particular this one quote from John Cale where he describes that the main sonic rule of creating songs for the band was that all things had to be both ‘elegant and brutal,'” she said. “We started to live by this description as we created songs for the Wuthering Heights album throughout most of this year. Finn came with me on tour and we rented a studio space most days.”

The 12-song Wuthering Heights opens with “House,” Charli XCX's recent collaboration with Velvet Underground co-founder John Cale. The album follows Brat, the deluxe expansion Brat and It's the Same but There's Three More Songs So It's Not, and the remix album Brat and It's Completely Different but Also Still Brat.

If you like the person you're seeing enough, almost anything can transform a bad date into a romantic memory. Rude waiters become funny stories. Nervous jitters reveal deep feelings. That creepy guy who was watching you and your date kiss in the car? He just wants to be at your wedding.

And yet, Oz Perkins' “Keeper” is as bad of an idea as that invite, and it's got even fewer redeeming qualities. From the genre-embattled Neon (h/t “Shelby Oaks”), this nightmarish romance sees the director of “Longlegs” and “The Monkey” throw more spaghetti at the wall and walk away with his worst movie yet. If that metaphor doesn't totally track, well that only makes it all the more well-suited to describe Perkins' profoundly dull new feature about the early stages of love, which amounts to little more than a wooden series of “Conjuring”-esque cliches and try-hard visual effects.

 








Related Stories ‘Wuthering Heights' Trailer: Is Emerald Fennell Obscuring the Truth of Her Romantic Leads with Another Lush Look? ‘The Beast in Me' Review: Claire Danes' Bloated Netflix Thriller Treats a Savage Story Too Timidly 

The red flags first start to appear when snarky painter Liz (the always wonderful Tatiana Maslany, here defeated by a thoroughly exhausting script) takes her new relationship out for spin, as she agrees to join her sweet surgeon boyfriend, Malcolm (Rossif Sutherland), on a couple's getaway to his strangely modern cabin. Tucked in the emerald-green woods of Vancouver, Malcom's glossy abode overlooks a fairytale meadow, some ominous trash bags, and his cousin's eerily similar place next door. An “American Psycho” in Canada, Darren (Birkett Turton) is a total scumbag, as transparently awful as he is easy to forget. His vapid girlfriend Minka (Eden Weiss) fares a bit better, announcing herself with a thick accent, paper-thin backstory as a model, and a weird-enough opening line: “It tastes like shit.”

She's referring to a chocolate cake that's baked through with more personality than the entirety of the movie's human cast. Liz won't clock that the mysterious treat has been made for her specifically — not until she's hunched over Malcolm's kitchen table, moaning in Minka's voice while she doggedly reenacts the grossest scene from “Matilda.” But soon enough, Liz gets left alone and sees a shadowy thing over there. Then, oh no! It's another shadowy thing over… there! Making fun of bad magicians is a kind of shitty thing to do, but Perkins' slight-of-hand needs real work if it's ever going to save a movie. 

Putting on a show that's self-important at worst, familiar and forced at best, this frustrating fever dream (a generous term) offers only a handful of surprises to the average horror fan. It's got none of the underdog energy you need to explain that shortage, and the limited goodwill this director once had with genre audiences has already run dry. Perkins will need more than a dictionary definition of surrealism to work out the next one, and Nick Leperd's script — all wheel-spinning in search of elusive substance — doesn't give the movie's ideas enough shape for Perkins to have fun playing around with them. If “The Monkey” exploded with divisive originality, and “Longlegs” spun a solid mystery well, “Keeper” proves a keenly motivated artist can receive several chances and mess up worse each time.

 










Jump-scares tend to skew more annoying than frightening when they're presented without the right context, and as a matter of plot and pacing, “Keeper” is all over the place. Most movies keep you engaged through the narrative's connective tissue. Point A escalates to point B, then to C, D, and so on. A linear structure that ramps up gradually can help the audience experience visionary finales in a way that makes sense and stays taut. Arthouse filmmakers can achieve that same effect through stylish, opaque images meant to manipulate feelings on a subconscious level. But Perkins' listless saga is only dreamlike if you're dreaming about MadLibs, and — paired with awful dialogue — randomness is not enough to sustain our interest.

Foggy window. Garbage disposal. Blood. Screaming. Demonic… snake… thing. Not every familiar beat in “Keeper” would make it up on the board for a Perkins-hosted round of “Family Feud.” But this chaotic supernatural effort rehashes a string of recognizable scares most viewers have seen executed better before. There isn't enough that works comedically to call this satire, and worse still, the jokes that almost land reek of a smugness that feels like it's insulting your intelligence, even if it's not. 

Characters are more than the titles they hold at their jobs, and a dozen vaguely freaky clues do not an inciting incident make. Maslany seems to almost willfully flatten her typical charisma as Liz, matching the inscrutable sheen that cloaks the rest of the film with an over-egged sameness that firmly implies the actress wanted to be there; she just didn't know what to do. Meanwhile, Sutherland doesn't even attempt to act beyond the likability baked into his teddy bear face — shrugging off lines like the slouchy sweaters everyone in “Keeper” wears for some reason. Neither actor says much of value about gender roles or modern intimacy. Still, the contrast between the levels of creative effort is telling, painful, and sharp. 

 










Bizarre editing puts scenes that look like they were made for the finale at the top of the story, and the tone slaps from grounded suspense to airy agony in a sloppy cycle that recalls truly bad sex. Snapping in and out of the action at will, this grueling chore of a genre exercise all but stops the projector to ask if you “like that” before trudging towards more of the nonsense that — for all of its randomness — feels strangely predictable in light of the movie's title. Lacking in chemistry, clarity, and conviction, Neon's latest rendezvous with Perkins hits like a crumbling marriage that would serve everyone involved by ending as soon as possible.

From Neon, “Keeper” opens in theaters nationwide on Friday, November 14.

Week 9 of “Dancing with the Stars” Season 34 also coincided with the show's 20th anniversary. It was a special night for Robert Irwin, as he performed an emotional Foxtrot to “Footprints in the Sand” by Leona Lewis in honor of his late father, Steve Irwin.  The routine had been inspired by his sister, Bindi Irwin, and her dedication dance to their father when she competed on Season 21 alongside professional dance partner Derek Hough. 

But this wasn't Robert's only performance on the night, and his jive was so fun! 

Robert also scored his first perfect score of 40 out of 40, and the first of the season. Judges and fans at home were impressed with his dance alongside professional dance partner Witney Carson. Later in the evening, the wildlife conservationist returned to the ballroom to do his relay dance. This time it wasn't alongside Carson, but with Xochitl Gomez, who competed on and won Season 32 of DWTS. 

Irwin and Gomez performed a jive, and it was an energetic, fun routine. They won the relay over Alix Earle and Season 33 Mirrorball champ Joey Graziadei. A video of their performance was shared on the official “Dancing with the Stars” Instagram account, allowing fans to rewatch it and share their thoughts. 

“Robert Irwin & Xochitl Gomez and Alix Earle & Joey Graziadei dance the Jive to ‘Dance with Me Tonight' by Olly Murs. #DWTS20 #DWTS,” the caption of the video reads. The comment section has been flooded with excited fans' reactions. 

“Ughhh i love Robert and Xochitl so much!!! I knew they were gonna win they were just perfect!!” an excited fan shared. “The chemistry between xochitl and Robert is undeniable and Soo cute. Fantastic partnership and dance!!” another person shared. 

Other reactions include, “Robert and Xochitl were soooo good!!!,” “robert and xochitl KILLED IT. so cute! and so so clean and technically good, too! just plain fun and adorable, couldn't stop smiling,” and “Go Xochitl!!!  and Robert is such a natural with the Jive!” 

The performance was a more playful part of the evening compared to Irwin's beautiful but emotional Foxtrot, and he had previously shared a look into his bond with Gomez. In a video posted on Instagram on November 11, the pair shared a hilarious skit as Irwin mimed to a voiceover. The clip didn't highlight their dance abilities, but it did show they both have a great sense of humor. “My dance knowledge has reached a new high with a mirrorball winner in the rehearsal room! @_xochitl.gomez,” the caption reads. 

“So funny. I'm gonna miss all these funny videos after u win,” a fan wrote. “The perfect pair!!!” another person shared.

The ABC News community is mourning the loss of longtime correspondent Jim Avila, who has died at 69. His passing was announced on Thursday, November 13, by ABC News Live anchor Diane Macedo, who described the update as “sad news” for the network.

Macedo shared that Avila “passed away after a long illness,” though no additional details were released. She also reflected on his extensive history with ABC. She reported that his tenure stretched nearly two decades and covered some of the network's most significant political and international stories.

During his years with ABC, Avila served as a senior correspondent based in Los Angeles, where he covered justice, major national stories, and high-impact consumer investigations. His work was known for its clarity, urgency, and ability to break complex stories under intense deadlines.

Avila's reporting earned him the prestigious Merriman Smith Award from the White House Correspondents Association, which praised his “tight, breathless morning reports where every word was news” and his ability to “tell the whole story on merciless deadlines.”

He also contributed to “20/20,” bringing depth and nuance to major investigative pieces and long-form storytelling.

After leaving ABC News, Avila continued his career at the ABC affiliate in San Diego as a senior investigative reporter, as per Newsweek. He covered a wide range of stories with what Macedo described as “depth and fairness.”

She also noted that Avila faced significant health battles in recent years and handled them “with courage,” including undergoing a kidney transplant donated by his brother.

ABC News president Almin Karamehmedovic honored Avila in a statement published by People, saying, “We send our heartfelt condolences to his family, including his three children, Jamie, Jenny, and Evan, and we thank him for his many contributions and unwavering commitment to seeking out the truth.”



Avila's colleagues remember him not only as a seasoned journalist but as a mentor and friend who never wavered in his commitment to accuracy and fairness. They recall a reporter who stayed calm under pressure, chased the truth with relentless focus, and cared deeply about telling stories that made a difference.

He leaves behind a legacy of thoughtful, high-impact journalism across broadcast news and major investigative work. Colleagues and viewers alike continue to honor the integrity and dedication he brought to every assignment.

Nile Jarvis is an asshole. Played by Matthew Rhys without the faintest hint of self-awareness (aka, played exactly right), the New York City real estate scion who's also the eldest son of a New York City real estate scion interrupts his wife's conversations by shouting over her. He thinks everyone else exists to entertain him and doesn't see anything wrong with that worldview. At lunch, he orders for you without asking. After dinner, he invites himself in to drink all your booze, and… oh yeah, he almost certainly murdered his wife. Well, his first wife. Because of course, a mid-forties Nile Jarvis is already on wife no. 2.

 










“The Beast in Me” doesn't pretend Nile is anything but what he is — a rich-prick sociopath with control, daddy, and anger issues — and yet it still dances around whether or not he's a legit murderer for far too long. (That it doesn't really wink or nod to his similarities to real-life murderer Robert Durst only further exhibits its debilitating indecisiveness.) Like our protagonist, Agatha “Aggie” Wiggs (Claire Danes), we're meant to be repulsed by his selfish disregard for other people, yet drawn to his titillating backstory despite our better instincts. Is he just an ordinary rich asshole, or is he something even more dangerous?

Unfortunately, as a TV character, he can be both. 

Created by Gabe Rotter (a writers' assistant on the original “X-Files” series before returning as a writer and producer on the revival) and showrun by Howard Gordon (FX's “Tyrant,” Fox's “Accused”), the limited series looks at what separates impulse from action and belief from truth. Naturally, an unconscionably wealthy white guy who can't tell the difference between either makes for an ideal subject (and Rhys, with his inherent charms and invoked vehemence, an ideal interpreter), but across eight episodes, the line wears thin long before the story reaches its inevitable conclusion. What “The Beast in Me” has to say about being tempted by our lesser angels would've hit harder in a more concise encapsulation, which leaves Danes and Rhys straining to complicate characters who prove all too familiar (whether you've seen “The Jinx” or not).

Aggie is an awkward character from the jump, but only some of her graceless stammering is intentionally clumsy. A former magazine profile writer who won acclaim for her debut book, Aggie can't seem to put pen to paper (or digital letters to her computer screen) on a follow-up. She's researching an ambitious biography of Ruth Bader-Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia, and her publisher is eager to see some pages, but she isn't happy with what little she's written. Worse still, she can't shake the growing feeling that she's driven more by how Important her work sounds than how interesting she actually finds it.

 










Sorting out what matters to her is also a little tricky given Aggie's soul-swallowing grief. Years earlier, her son died in an accident where their car collided with a drunk driver. The other guy walked away without a scratch — or a manslaughter charge — Aggie couldn't get over the injustice of it all, and her unflagging anger soon killed her marriage to Shelley (Natalie Morales). Still bereft and furious, Aggie is trying to get on with her job, at least, while living alone in a big, dilapidated house with only a little white dog named Steve for company. (Steve is a good boy. Nothing happens to Steve.)

That is, until Nile moves in next door, disrupting Aggie's upstate New York hermitage. Despite ignoring his initial greeting and relying on her cranky anti-neighborly attitude to dissuade further outreach, Nile won't relent. He wants to build a running path in their shared woods, but Aggie prefers not to pave her purgatory to put up a jogging trot. Their impasse leads to conversations, shared meals, and then, an offer: What if Aggie wrote her next book about Nile? After being dogged for years by rumors about his missing wife, it would give Nile an opportunity to clear his name, and it would give Aggie a subject who's so enticing he's combative.

But will she live to tell the tale? In the sly hands of director Antonio Campos, who previously examined the dangers of seeking objective truth from subjective storytelling in HBO Max's “The Staircase,” Aggie mainly functions as an audience proxy. She's happy to see depravity in her shithead neighbor; to poke and prod his life until a definitive portrait emerges, the uglier the better. But like all those Netflix viewers devouring one grisly true-crime show after another, she's less eager to look at what's driving her to spend so much time in the mind of a brute — not until Nile pushes her to see their similarities. “We need our villains, alive and well,” Aggie writes in Episode 4. “Because without them, we're left to face ourselves.”

 










While encouraging healthy self-assessments over ghoulish monster-hunting is sound enough advice (although advice we've heard many a time already during our true-crime boom), “The Beast in Me” doesn't hold up to the same level of scrutiny it demands from us. Sure, it's easy enough to go along with the premise's leaps in logic — like a writer, even a writer with a Pulitzer Prize, being able to afford a house in the same zip code as a titan of Manhattan real estate with generational wealth — but it's harder to watch these ostensibly smart people avoid acknowledging their obvious personal revelations for so long. Aggie wrote about using villains as a distraction from your demons in Episode 4, but she doesn't follow through for four more hours, covering however many days? Really?

Meanwhile, Gordon and Rotter pile on supporting characters who only exist to prop up the eight hours. Jonathan Banks is Nile's aptly grumpy father doing a decent Logan Roy impression (without enough care or specifics to flesh him out). David Lyons is a suitably stressed FBI agent who's repeatedly tried and failed to bring the Jarvis family to justice (without much motivation beyond what the plot needs from him). Aleyse Shannon is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, er, I mean a “socialist” city council member trying to build affordable housing where Nile wants a glistening monument to his ego. Brittany Snow fares best as Nile's current wife, Nina, but the bulk of her development comes too little, too late.

 










“The Beast in Me” dances around a number of compelling ideas — about America's obsession with placing blame, about the morally corrosive nature of wealth, about Matthew Rhys‘ presumptive dancing abilities (he cuts a few new moves here) — but it lacks the conviction to really confront them. The muddied narrative does its job in pitting Danes and Rhys together in scene after scene, but it also keeps the show from being as vicious as it should be, leaving them to make up the difference. (Rhys fares slightly better, layering his slow unveiling so it ends with a satisfying eruption, whereas Danes' trademark tremble gets deployed early and often.) If one of your leads can't stop “joking” about killing his wife and your other lead is still inextricably drawn to him, the story has to delve way further into the darkness than “The Beast in Me” is willing to go.

In the end, all the series manages to say clearly is too simple to sustain an eight-hour story. In fact, it's so simple that another TV show summed it up in two lines: “If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.”

So, maybe just don't be an asshole?

“The Beast in Me” premieres Thursday, November 13, on Netflix. All eight episodes will be released at once.

Brooke Shields and daughter Rowan Henchy were cute as a button (or many buttons, actually) at the Alice + Olivia x Grateful Dead launch party on Wednesday.

The “Blue Lagoon” actress, 60, paired the brand's olive green Winn long jacket ($995) with the matching Rubi mini skirt ($295) and over-the-knee suede boots.

Meanwhile, Henchy, 22, wore the Madison strapless vegan leather dress ($495) with a Chanel clutch and gold statement collar necklace, adding a coordinating long leather jacket over her shoulders for the November outing.

The close-knit duo rang in 2025 by getting matching tattoos reading “and to a party” in Rowan's handwriting at East Side Ink in NYC.

“Another matching tattoo with my bug,” Shields captioned an Instagram story at the time.

It's their second set of matching ink; they previously got ladybug tattoos in June 2021 to celebrate Rowan's high school graduation.

Henchy graduated from Wake Forest University in North Carolina in the spring, and last month, a Page Six spy spotted her filming for Bravo's nepo baby show “Next Gen NYC.”

The show, which is in production on its second season, stars a bevy of reality stars' scions, including “Real Housewives” kids Riley Burress (the daughter of Atlanta's Kandi Buress), Gia Giudice (the daughter of New Jersey's Teresa Giudice), and Brooks Marks (the son of Salt Lake City's Meredith Marks), along with Damon Dash's daughter Ava Dash and others.

Shields also shares daughter Grier, 19, with husband Chris Henchy, a film producer and director, whom she married in 2001.

Wednesday's event celebrated Alice + Olivia's second collaboration with the Grateful Dead, honoring the iconic band's 60th anniversary. The 14-piece capsule collection ranges from $275 to $1,795 and features the band's signature dancing bear motif reimagined by designer Stacey Bendet.

“The Grateful Dead built more than a band; they built a legendary community,” Bendet said in a statement. “Sixty years later, their spirit, style, and music still resonate.”

The collection is now available at select Alice + Olivia boutiques worldwide and on the brand's website.

In an interview with Empire magazine about the second season of Fallout, which premieres December 17 on Prime Video, Ella Purnell said Lucy and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins) are “trying to influence each other and see who's going to rub off on whom.” She teased: “Is the Ghoul going to become good? Is Lucy going to become bad? Or are they going to be somewhere in the middle?”

In the new trailer for season two, Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton) complains that it's easy for Lucy to be good, growing up in “some cozy little impenetrable home,” where you “wouldn't have to steal and stab and fib all the goddamn time just to get by.” But of course good and bad isn't all that black and white in the world of Fallout. Lucy thought her dad (Kyle MacLachlan) was good, and now she's on a quest to bring him to justice. The Ghoul used to believe in such ideals, but over 200 years he's become quite the villain—all in the name of reuniting with his lost family. Is it true, as Lucy proposed, that how people conduct themselves matters? Do the ends justify the means?

﻿

The Fallout season two trailer teases big confrontations and new characters played by the likes of Kumail Nanjiani, Macaulay Culkin, and Justin Theroux. Speaking with Forbes, Goggins opined that the latest installment is a mashup of “Indiana Jones meets Doctor Strangelove meets the Star Wars [Cantina], and so far it's surpassed my expectations.” He said, “I've been around, so I understand the arcs of seasons and understand if Season 1 catches fire, Season 2 should be better … That's when you're really hitting your stride. The critics will have their point of view or whatever, but I can tell you from my perspective, we've hit our stride and we're telling this story in such a subversive way that it's so fun to watch with real consequences. I just can't wait for people to see it.”

Ariana Grande was the target of a fan attack during the Wicked: For Good premiere in Singapore. While walking the carpet lined by fans there to greet the cast, the singer and actress was aggressively grabbed by a man who pulled her into an embrace. Cynthia Erivo reacted quicker than the crew of security guards surrounding them, shoving the man away from her co-star and checking that she wasn't hurt.


	The attacker was quickly identified as Johnson Wen, a self-proclaimed “stage invader” who lives in Australia and goes by the handle Pyjama Man. Wen frequently attends live music and sporting events, where he storms the stage for unauthorized interactions with the performing artists. He has managed to evade security at tours featuring artists including Katy Perry, the Weeknd, and the Chainsmokers.

	Grande was Wen's latest target, but there seems to be an additional layer of delusion and fanaticism that fueled this particular encounter. In an Instagram post, he shared a video that captured him running up to Grande — who appeared visibly frightened — and jumping up and down while gripping her shoulders. “Dear Ariana Grande Thank You for letting me Jump on the Yellow Carpet with You ❤️,” Wen wrote in the caption. The bio of his Instagram account also includes the note: “Ariana Grande is the Queen.”

	











	Wen removed his shoes before rushing Grande, wearing only white socks, a T-shirt, and shorts. Erivo appeared to yell at him before shifting his focus solely to consoling Grande, who was ushered away from the carpet. A rep for Grande did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment, though her publicist was by her side during the incident.

	Wen has restricted comments on his Instagram post about the incident. Fans have swarmed the comment sections of his previous posts, which also include instances of general public disruption in libraries, food courts, and public transportation. “What you did was so disrespectful not only to Ariana herself, but also to all the actual fans who waited years to meet her,” one fan wrote.

	Grande drew necessary boundaries with fans at the start of the Wicked: For Good premiere tour. After sharing that she would regretfully miss the Brazil premiere due to flight delays beyond her control, some disappointed fans took their remarks too far. “Please don't wish danger on us,” Grande wrote in a social media statement. “We did everything we could and I promise you no one is more upset than I am, I promise. No matter how upset or disappointed you are, please please do not wish danger on us or assume that we didn't try.”


	The premiere tour will continue with a final event in New York on Monday, and most likely with additional security measures. In another video from their Singapore appearance, Grande and Erivo made their exit, going straight to their waiting car as fans watched and cheered for them. The Wicked stars didn't stop to greet anyone.

Senior Managing Editor


Prime Video has released a new Season 2 trailer for Fallout that finds Lucy (Ella Purnell) and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins) on the hunt for her father in New Vegas.


	“What exactly do you plan on doing once we find your daddy?,” the Ghoul (Goggins) asks Lucy (Purnell).


	“Gonna bring him to justice,” Lucy replies. “So that people know that how they conduct themselves matters. And they don't give up hope.” 


	At one point, the Ghoul acknowledges that he's wastelanded for 200 years and has kept himself alive for one reason. “To find my family,” he says.  We then hear an ominious voiceover in response. “Well then, you're gonna need friends. There's a war coming.” 

	











	Based on the video game from Bethesda Game Studios, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have. Two-hundred years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind—and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Season 2 of Fallout will pick up in the aftermath of Season 1's epic finale, taking viewers on a journey through the wasteland of the Mojave to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas. 


	Purnell and Goggins star along with Aaron Moten, Kyle MacLachlan, Moisés Arias and Frances Turner.


Fallout is produced by Kilter Films, with executive producers Nolan, Joy and Athena Wickham. Robertson-Dworet and Wagner also serve as executive producers, creators, and showrunners. Todd Howard, Bethesda Game Studios, executive produces along with James Altman for Bethesda Softworks. Amazon MGM Studios and Kilter Films produce in association with Bethesda Game Studios and Bethesda Softworks.


	Season 2 of Fallout premieres Dec. 17 on Prime Video.

They're back in black.

At least when it comes to the Coppola-Mars family, who turned out for the Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit on Wednesday night in New York City in coordinated, classic style.  

Hosted by Chanel, longtime friend and muse of the house, Sofia Coppola, attended alongside her husband Thomas Mars and teenage daughters Romy and Cosima Mars.

The three women coordinated their head-to-toe Chanel looks, wearing black dresses in varying lengths and styles with an array of classic accessories from the storied French design house.

Sofia chose a long-sleeve, long gown embellished with sequins, straight off the runway from Matthieu Blazy's first Chanel collection. 

Pointed-toe pumps peeked out from underneath the dress's handkerchief hemline, which hit at the ankle. The esteemed director added even more sparkle with diamond drop earrings and a diamond bracelet from Cartier on her right wrist.

Cosima, 15, showed a little more leg with a printed silk mini dress, belted at the waist. It featured a flounce skirt and a backless halter silhouette. She carried a metallic silver quilted Chanel bag and slipped into embellished slingback heels.

Elder sister, Romy, 18, went for classic black with a sheer camisole and pleated maxi skirt with a slit up the front. She added a black mini flap bag and sparkly silver-and-black cap-toe pumps, both classic Chanel designs.

The trio doesn't often make public appearances together, but, when they do, there's no doubt they've discussed their looks beforehand.

Back in July, Coppola and her daughters stepped out together for the Chanel Haute Couture fall 2025 fashion show in Paris, wearing coordinated pastel looks. Romy and Sofia wore baby blue while Cosima chose pale pink.

While Romy has been busy on social media, making a name for herself as a nepo baby, her sister Cosima has stayed out of the limelight — for now.

With more public appearances on the calendar, however, there's plenty of time for little sis to come into her own.

They're back in black.

At least when it comes to the Coppola-Mars family, who turned out for the Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit on Wednesday night in New York City in coordinated, classic style.  

Hosted by Chanel, longtime friend and muse of the house, Sofia Coppola, attended alongside her husband Thomas Mars and teenage daughters Romy and Cosima Mars.

The three women coordinated their head-to-toe Chanel looks, wearing black dresses in varying lengths and styles with an array of classic accessories from the storied French design house.

Sofia chose a long-sleeve, long gown embellished with sequins, straight off the runway from Matthieu Blazy's first Chanel collection. 

Pointed-toe pumps peeked out from underneath the dress's handkerchief hemline, which hit at the ankle. The esteemed director added even more sparkle with diamond drop earrings and a diamond bracelet from Cartier on her right wrist.

Cosima, 15, showed a little more leg with a printed silk mini dress, belted at the waist. It featured a flounce skirt and a backless halter silhouette. She carried a metallic silver quilted Chanel bag and slipped into embellished slingback heels.

Elder sister, Romy, 18, went for classic black with a sheer camisole and pleated maxi skirt with a slit up the front. She added a black mini flap bag and sparkly silver-and-black cap-toe pumps, both classic Chanel designs.

The 98th annual Academy Awards are set to take place on March 15.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



	When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reveals its Academy Award shortlists in 10 categories on Dec. 16, it will constitute an early holiday present for the creators of 15 original songs and 20 original scores. Another round of voting will follow, preceding the nominations announcement on Jan. 22, 2026. A final round of voting will then occur before the 98th annual Oscars telecast on March 15.

	











	Three top contenders for best original song — “Golden” from KPop Demon Hunters, “Lose My Mind” from F1: The Movie and “Dying To Live” from Billy Idol Should Be Dead — are each the work of five co-writers. The academy will award no more than four Oscars in this category. Should any of those songs win, the songwriters must share a single statuette.


“Dream As One”Miley Cyrus, Andrew Wyatt, Mark Ronson, Simon FranglenAvatar: Fire and Ash, 20th Century Studios


	Wyatt and Ronson won in this category in 2019 for co-writing “Shallow” from A Star Is Born with Lady Gaga and Anthony Rossomando. They received a second nod in 2024 for “I'm Just Ken” from Barbie. Cyrus and Wyatt teamed with Lykke Li last year to write “Beautiful That Way” from The Last Showgirl. It wasn't nominated (or shortlisted), but it generated some buzz. Franglen also scored the film.

	











“Dying To Live”Billy Idol, J. Ralph, Steve Stevens, Tommy English, Joe JaniakBilly Idol Should Be Dead, Live Nation Productions


	This would be Ralph's fourth nomination in this category and the first for the other songwriters. Idol has received three Grammy nods, including one for “Cradle of Love” from the 1990 film The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Billy Idol Should Be Dead was directed by Jonas Åkerlund, who has helmed concert and documentary films by such A-listers as Madonna, Paul McCartney, Beyoncé & Jay-Z and Taylor Swift.


“Salt Then Sour Then Sweet”Sara Bareilles, Brandi Carlile, Andrea GibsonCome See Me in the Good Light, Apple Original Films


	Gibson, who died of ovarian cancer in July, would be the first person to be posthumously nominated in this category since Howard Ashman, who received four nods (including one win) in the two years following his 1991 death. Bareilles and Carlile executive-produced the documentary about Gibson and her wife dealing with Gibson's illness. Carlile was nominated in this category at the 2025 ceremony for co-writing “Never Too Late” from Elton John: Never Too Late.


“Just Keep Watching”Tate McRae, Tyler Spry, Ryan Tedder, Amy AllenF1: The Movie, Apple Original Films


	This year, McRae landed her first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 and her first No. 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100. Could she earn her first Oscar nomination in early 2026? Allen is the reigning Grammy winner for songwriter of the year, ­non-classical. Tedder has three album of the year Grammys for his work with Adele and Taylor Swift. Spry is known for his credits with artists such as OneRepublic and McRae.

	











“Lose My Mind”Grant Boutin, Ryan Tedder, Amala Zandile Dlamini, Caleb Toliver, Hans ZimmerF1: The Movie, Apple Original Films


	Although it's rare for two songs from one film to be nominated, Emilia Pérez achieved the feat at the 2025 ceremony. F1: The Movie, Sinners and Wicked: For Good are among the films hoping to do the same early next year. If “Lose My Mind” is nominated, it will mark Zimmer's first nod in this category. He has received 12 nominations (and won twice) in scoring categories.


“Highest 2 Lowest”Aiyana-Lee Anderson, Nicole Daciana AndersonHighest 2 Lowest, A24


Highest 2 Lowest, directed by Spike Lee, is an English-language remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1963 Japanese film, High and Low. The movie stars Denzel Washington, Jeffrey Wright, A$AP Rocky, LaChanze, Princess Nokia and Ice Spice (in her film debut). Aiyana-­Lee Anderson, the niece of David Ruffin of The Temptations, co-wrote the titular track with her mother, Nicole Daciana Anderson. This would be the first song from a Lee film to be nominated.


“Golden”EJAE, Mark Sonnenblick, IDO, 24, TeddyKPop Demon Hunters, Netflix


	“Golden,” which topped the Hot 100 for eight weeks, would be the first No. 1 since Justin Timberlake's “Can't Stop the Feeling!” from Trolls in 2017 to rule the chart and then land an Oscar nod. (“Shallow” from A Star Is Born hit No. 1 only after its Oscar win.) EJAE, IDO, 24 and Teddy would be the first South Korean-born songwriters to be nominated since Karen O, who was cited in 2014 for co-writing “The Moon Song” from Her.

	











“Dear Me”Diane WarrenRelentless, Greenwich Entertainment/MasterClass


	Earlier this year, Warren tied Sammy Cahn's record of earning a best original song nomination for eight consecutive years. If she is nominated again in 2026, she'll stand alone. It would be her 17th nomination in the category, a total surpassed only by Cahn (26) and Johnny Mercer (18). Moreover, it would be her 13th nod as a solitary songwriter, tying Randy Newman for the most solo-written nominated songs.


“I Lied to You”Raphael Saadiq, Ludwig GöranssonSinners, Warner Bros. Pictures


	Ryan Coogler produced, wrote and directed Sinners, which was No. 1 at the box office for two weeks in April. The last two films that Coogler wrote and directed — Black Panther and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever — both spawned best original song nominees. Saadiq and Göransson are past nominees in this category: Saadiq in 2018 for co-­writing “Mighty River” from Mudbound and Göransson in 2023 for co-writing “Lift Me Up” from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.


“Last Time (I Seen the Sun)”Alice Smith, Miles CatonSinners, Warner Bros. Pictures


	Caton, who turned 20 in March, would be the youngest nominee for best original song since Billie Eilish, who was just six weeks past her 20th birthday in 2022 when she was nominated for co-writing the title song to No Time To Die (which won). In addition to co-­writing the song, Caton co-stars in the film. Smith was a Grammy nominee for best urban/alternative performance in 2008 for “Dream.”

	











“Train Dreams”Nick Cave, Bryce DessnerTrain Dreams, Netflix


	Cave is vying to become the third songwriter from Australia to be nominated in this category, following John Farrar (for writing “Hopelessly Devoted to You” from Grease) and Peter Allen (for co-writing “Arthur's Theme [Best That You Can Do]” from Arthur, which won). Dessner has won two Grammys. Train Dreams stars Joel Edgerton, Felicity Jones and William H. Macy.


“As Alive as You Need Me To Be”Nine Inch NailsTron: Ares, Disney


	Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are submitting this as Nine Inch Nails rather than under their individual names. If the academy keeps it that way, it would be the first nominee in this category to be listed under their group billing. Reznor and Ross have received three Oscar nods for their scores, but this would be their first for a song. Jared Leto stars in Tron: Ares, the third installment in the Tron franchise.


“The Girl in the ­Bubble”Stephen SchwartzWicked: For Good, Universal


	Schwartz has received five nominations in this category, winning the first two times for “Colors of the Wind” from Pocahontas and “When You Believe” from The Prince of Egypt. He was subsequently nominated for co-writing three songs from ­Enchanted. Wicked: For Good is the sequel to Wicked, which received 10 nominations earlier this year, but none in this category since it didn't include any new songs.


“No Place Like Home”Stephen SchwartzWicked: For Good, Universal


	If both of Schwartz's songs are nominated, he'll become the first individual songwriter with two songs in the running since Randy Newman accomplished the feat 16 years ago with The Princess and the Frog. Wicked: For Good adapts the second act of the 2003 stage musical by Schwartz and Winnie Holzman. Jon M. Chu directed both this film and its megahit predecessor.

	











“Zoo”Blake Slatkin, Ed Sheeran, ShakiraZootopia 2, Disney


	Colombian superstar Shakira is vying to become the first songwriter born in Latin America to be nominated in this category since Brazilians Sergio Mendes and Carlinhos Brown were nominated in 2012 for a song from Rio. Sheeran is a four-time Grammy nominee for song of the year, winning for “Thinking Out Loud.” Slatkin was nominated in that category for co-writing Lizzo's “About Damn Time.”


Avatar: Fire and Ash (20th Century Studios)Simon Franglen


	This is the third installment in the ­Avatar franchise. James Horner's score for the original film was nominated in this category in 2010. Horner was set to score the sequel, 2022's Avatar: The Way of Water, before he died in a 2015 turboprop plane crash. Franglen subsequently got the assignment for that film, though his work wasn't nominated. This would be Franglen's first Oscar nod.


Bugonia (Focus Features)Jerskin Fendrix


	Fendrix was nominated in 2024 in this category for scoring director Yorgos Lanthimos' Poor Things. Fendrix also scored Lanthimos' follow-up, Kinds of Kindness, though that film didn't receive any Oscar nods. The composer and director are back for a third go-round. Bugonia stars Emma Stone, who won the Oscar for best actress with Poor Things and also starred in Kinds of Kindness.


Captain America: Brave New World (Marvel/Disney)Laura Karpman


	Karpman was nominated in this category two years ago for scoring American Fiction. If she's nominated again, she'll join a short list of women who have received two or more nods in scoring categories, following Rachel Portman and Angela Morley. (Hildur Guðnadóttir is also hoping to make that list with Hedda.) This is the fourth installment in the Captain America franchise. Alan Silvestri scored the first; Henry Jackman handled the second and third.

	











Fantastic Four: First Steps (Marvel/Disney)Michael Giacchino


	Giacchino was nominated in this category for Ratatouille in 2008 and won for Up in 2010. Fantastic Four: First Steps, the 37th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, features an ensemble cast including Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Joseph Quinn.


F1: The Movie (Apple Original Films)Hans Zimmer


	Zimmer has received 12 nominations in this category, landing at least one in each of the last five decades and winning for The Lion King and Dune. He's third on the list of living composers with the most score nominations, trailing only John Williams (who has amassed an astounding 49 in score categories) and Thomas Newman (14). F1: The Movie became the top-grossing auto racing film ever and the top-grossing movie of Brad Pitt's career.


Frankenstein (Netflix)Alexandre Desplat


	Desplat has received 11 nominations for his scores, winning for The Grand Budapest Hotel in 2015 and The Shape of Water in 2018. Frankenstein was directed, written and co-produced by Guillermo del Toro, who did the honors on The Shape of Water as well as a third film that Desplat scored, Pinocchio. Frankenstein, which stars Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi and Christoph Waltz, is based on Mary Shelley's classic 1818 novel of the same name.


Hamnet (Focus Features)Max Richter


Hamnet was co-written, co-­edited and directed by Chloé Zhao, who won a pair of Oscars in 2021 for directing and co-producing Nomadland. Based on Maggie O'Farrell's 2020 novel, Hamnet follows the relationship between William Shakespeare and his wife, Anne Hathaway, and the impact of the death of their 11-year-old son, Hamnet, on their lives. Richter has received two Grammy nominations — best score soundtrack for visual media for Ad Astra and best music video as a featured artist on Woodkid's “The Golden Age.”

	











Hedda (Amazon MGM)Hildur Guðnadóttir


	In 2020, when Guðnadóttir won best original score for Joker, the Icelandic composer became just the fourth woman to capture an Oscar in a scoring category. Lyricist Marilyn Bergman shared the award for original song score in 1984 for Yentl. Rachel Portman won best original musical or comedy score in 1997 for Emma. Anne Dudley won in that same category the following year for The Full Monty.


A House of Dynamite (Netflix)Volker Bertelmann


	This would be Bertelmann's fourth nomination in this category, following Lion (a collaboration with Dustin O'Halloran) in 2017, All Quiet on the Western Front in 2023 (for which he won) and Conclave earlier this year. A House of Dynamite is an apocalyptic political thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow. The film's ensemble cast includes Idris Elba, Tracy Letts and Anthony Ramos.


Jay Kelly (Netflix)Nicholas Britell


	This would be Britell's fourth nomination in this category, following nods for the Barry Jenkins films Moonlight and If Beale Street Could Talk and Adam McKay's Don't Look Up. Jay Kelly is a coming-of-age comedy-­drama directed by Noah Baumbach that he co-wrote with Emily Mortimer. The film stars an ensemble cast that includes George Clooney, Adam Sandler, Laura Dern and Billy Crudup.


The Lost Bus (Apple Original Films)James Newton Howard


	This would be Howard's eighth nod in a scoring category. He has also been nominated for two songs. The Lost Bus was directed by Paul Greengrass and stars Matthew McConaughey and America Ferrera. The film is based on the true story of a bus driver who navigated a bus carrying 22 children and their teachers to safety through the 2018 Camp Fire, which was the deadliest fire in California history.

	











Marty Supreme (A24)Daniel Lopatin


	Lopatin, an electronic music producer, has composed scores for such films as Good Time (2017) and Uncut Gems (2019). He won the Soundtrack Award at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival for Good Time. Marty Supreme, which stars Timothée Chalamet and Gwyneth Paltrow, is a sports comedy-drama set in New York during the 1950s. It is loosely inspired by American table tennis player Marty Reisman and his at-all-costs pursuit of greatness.


Materialists (A24)Daniel Pemberton


	Pemberton has yet to be nominated for a score, though he was nominated for best original song in 2021 for co-writing “Hear My Voice” from The Trial of the Chicago 7. Materialists, a romantic comedy-drama written and directed by Celine Song, follows a love triangle among characters played by Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal. It's Song's second feature as a writer-director following Past Lives.


One Battle After ­Another (Warner Bros. Pictures)Jonny Greenwood


	This would be Greenwood's third nod in this category, following Phantom Thread in 2018 and The Power of the Dog in 2022. Greenwood, the lead guitarist and keyboardist of Radiohead, and Nine Inch Nails mainstays Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have yet to be nominated in the same year. One Battle After Another is an action thriller written, co-produced and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Leonardo DiCaprio and Benicio Del Toro star.


Sentimental Value (Neon)Hania Rani


	This would be the first nomination for Rani, a Polish pianist, composer and singer. Sentimental Value, a comedy-drama directed by Joachim Trier, follows a fractured relationship between an acclaimed director and his two estranged daughters. The film had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May, where it won the Grand Prix. It was selected as the Norwegian entry for best international feature film at the upcoming Oscars.

	











Sinners (Warner Bros. Pictures)Ludwig Göransson


	Göransson has received two nominations for best original score for Black Panther in 2019 and Oppenheimer in 2024, winning both times. The Swedish composer has scored all five of director Ryan Coogler's films — Fruitvale Station, Creed, Black Panther, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and now Sinners. Göransson also has an executive producer credit on this film, which stars Michael B. Jordan in dual roles as twin brothers.


The Testament of Ann Lee (Searchlight Pictures)Daniel Blumberg


	Blumberg won this category earlier this year for The Brutalist. He is vying to become the first best original score winner to be nominated again the following year since Alexandre Desplat was nominated for Isle of Dogs at the 2019 ceremony after winning the previous year for The Shape of Water. The Testament of Ann Lee stars Amanda Seyfried as Ann Lee, the founding leader of the Shakers religious sect in the 18th century.


Train Dreams (Netflix)Bryce Dessner


	This would mark the first Oscar nomination for Dessner, who has won two Grammys — best chamber music/small ensemble performance in 2016 for producing Eighth Blackbird's Filament and best alternative music album in 2018 as a band member and co-producer of The National's Sleep Well Beast. Train Dreams stars Joel Edgerton as a logger who is working to develop the railroad across the United States.


Tron: Ares (Disney)Nine Inch Nails


	As with their best original song entry, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are submitting this under their group name. If the academy keeps it that way, Nine Inch Nails will be the third group nominated in a scoring category as such, following The Beatles, who won best original song score in 1971 for Let It Be, and Son Lux, which was nominated for best original score three years ago for Everything Everywhere All at Once.

	











Wicked: For Good (Universal)John Powell, Stephen Schwartz


	Powell and Schwartz were nominated in this category at the 2025 ceremony for Wicked. Schwartz previously won in the defunct original musical or comedy score category for Pocahontas and was nominated in that category for The Hunchback of Notre Dame and The Prince of Egypt. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, who were Oscar-­nominated for Wicked, reprise their roles in the sequel, as do Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Bowen Yang, ­Marissa Bode, Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum.

Rolling Stone Films and Documentary+ have acquired “The Spiritual Advisor,” a 23-minute documentary that will premiere at DOC NYC on November 16 at the IFC Center. The film, directed by Joel Fendelman and produced by James Chase Sanchez, follows Rev. Jeff Hood, a priest and death-penalty activist who serves as a spiritual advisor to death row inmates.

Filmed over five days in September 2024, the documentary tracks Hood as he travels to Oklahoma to advocate for clemency for Emmanuel Littlejohn, a man scheduled for execution. The film is based on the March 2025 Rolling Stone story “The Last Face Death Row Inmates See” by Brenna Ehrlich (you can read it right here).

 








Related Stories ‘Keeper' Review: Not Even the Great Tatiana Maslany Can Save Oz Perkins from His Worst Movie Yet ‘Kokuho' Review: Japan's Oscar Entry and Box Office Achiever Is an Absorbing Three Hours of Kabuki and Conflicted Masculinity 

The documentary captures Hood's work on two fronts: attempting to prevent the execution while simultaneously preparing Littlejohn for death if the clemency effort fails. Fendelman's camera follows Hood through prison visits, prayer sessions, and meetings with state officials.

Hood, an Old Catholic priest based in Little Rock, has been arrested multiple times for his activism against capital punishment. In 2024, he served as spiritual advisor to Kenneth Smith, who was executed in Alabama using nitrogen gas — the state's first execution by that method.

 










“Joel Fendelman has crafted a film that examines the intersection of belief, justice, and conscience,” said Alexandra Dale, Head of Rolling Stone Films, in an official statement.

Fendelman previously directed “Man on Fire” in 2017. The new documentary was produced by A Pound of Snow Productions in association with Rolling Stone Films and Documentary+. After its premiere at DOC NYC, “The Spiritual Advisor” will stream early next year on Rolling Stone's website and YouTube channel and on Documentary+.

Rolling Stone Films' recent work includes “Little Richard: I Am Everything,” which won an Emmy for Outstanding Arts & Culture Documentary in 2023.

Apple TV has set a premiere date for the Season 2 premiere of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters. The 10-epsiode second run will debut globally on February 27 with the first episode, followed by one episode every Friday until May 1. The streamer also released a teaser trailer, which you can view above, and a first-look image below.


	Season one tracks two siblings looking to uncover their family's connection to the secretive organization known as Monarch. Clues lead them into the world of monsters and ultimately down the rabbit hole to Army officer Lee Shaw (played by Kurt Russell and Wyatt Russell), taking place in the 1950s and half a century later where Monarch is threatened by what Shaw knows. 

	











	As revealed Wednesday, Kurt Russell will return as Lee Shaw in Season 2 following Season 1's finale that left his fate in limbo. The older Lee chose to stay behind to fix a malfunction in the portal that would be used to get the crew back to Earth. Unfortunately, Lee didn't make it after falling off the Monarch ship and was sucked into the Hollow Earth as the crew returned.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Per the offical synopsis: Season 2 will pick up with the fate of Monarch — and the world — hanging in the balance. The dramatic saga reveals buried secrets that reunite our heroes (and villains) on Kong's Skull Island, and a new, mysterious village where a mythical Titan rises from the sea. The ripple effects of the past make waves in the present day, blurring the bonds between family, friend and foe — all with the threat of a titan event on the horizon.

	











	Anna Sawai, Kiersey Clemons, Ren Watabe, Mari Yamamoto, Joe Tippett and  Anders Holm also star.


	From Legendary Television, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is executive produced by Joby Harold and Tory Tunnell from Safehouse Pictures, alongside Chris Black, Jen Roskind, Matt Shakman, Andrew Colville and Lawrence Trillling, who also directs four episodes, as well as Andrew Colville, who writes two episodes and serves as executive producer. Black serves as showrunner on season two. Hiro Matsuoka and Takemasa Arita executive produce on behalf of Toho Co., Ltd., the owner of the Godzilla character.

Disney‘s strong results in streaming, including a better-than-expected subscriber jump, helped offset a struggling film studio and sluggish ad sales in the company's fiscal fourth quarter.


	In the company's last quarter of reporting streaming subscribers, the company said Thursday that the overall tally for Disney+ and Hulu hit 196 million. Disney+, which launched six years ago nearly to the day, is now at 131.6 million subscribers, split nearly evenly between the U.S. and international.


	Despite the traction in streaming, Disney's total revenue missed Wall Street forecasts. That was one reason why the company's stock fell 8% (a big move for the large-cap Dow component) in early trading.

			Watch on Deadline		







	The gain of 12.4 million streaming subscribers from last quarter came in more than 2 million better than Wall Street's target. Operating income in the direct-to-consumer unit rose $99 million to $352 million, with revenue climbing 8%.


	About half of the subscriber gain in the quarter came via wholesale deals, notably the landmark distribution agreement with Charter Communications, CFO Hugh Johnston said in an interview with CNBC.


	The launch of ESPN‘s newly bulked up streaming service occurred during the quarter, on August 21, but ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro and other Disney execs have maintained that they do not plan to regularly disclose subscriber numbers.

	Adjusted earnings per share drifted down to $1.11 from $1.14 in the year-ago period, but they still beat Wall Street analysts' expectations by 6 cents. Revenue, though, was flat with a year ago at $22.5 billion and undershot forecasts.


	The lack of political ad spending in the 2025 quarter compared with 2024 resulted in a $40 million shortfall, the company said. Studio results in the July-to-September period were hurt by comparisons with the same period a year ago, when Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine were making theater turnstiles spin. Content Sales/Licensing and Other revenue fell $368 million as a result. The studio's bumpy run of late ended last weekend with Predator: Badlands hitting a franchise high in its opening weekend. Marquee titles Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash are arriving for Thanksgiving and Christmas, respectively.


	Sports revenue ticked up 2% to just shy of $4 billion, but operating income fell 2%, in part due to expenses related to the debut of the ESPN streaming service. The return of college football and the NFL during the quarter helped ESPN domestic ad revenue increase 8%.


	Experiences, the corporate division including the company's ever-lucrative theme parks, saw a modest year-over-year revenue gain of 6% to $8.77 billion. 


	The company plans to add two cruise ships to its fleet in the coming months, the Disney Adventure and the Disney Destiny, and warned investors it will incur $160 million in pre-opening expenses and $120 million in dry dock expenses.


Disney's carriage battle with YouTube TV, which has resulted in a two-week blackout, one of the longest in Disney history, is not reflected in the quarterly report because it began after the September 27 end of the quarter. But CEO Bob Iger and Johnston could be asked about it during a conference call with analysts.

How are they not juicing their report by talking about total subscribers but not talking about the net change including how many they lost due to trying to can Jimmy Kimmel? Obviously they are only reporting numbers to get on investors' good side with this. Also, the mention of no political ad spending is intentional to get on departed subscribers' (like me) good side. I'm still not going back.

That's some crazy spin. Disney+ was supposed to be profitable by fall 2024, and when it wasn't they bought Hulu and changed their wording to a more vague “streaming”. 

And, clearly, Disney+ still isn't getting the subscriber growth they promised, which is why they offered it for free to Charter customers to pad their numbers.

Investing in this company is like borrowing money from a loan shark.

“About half of the subscriber gain in the quarter came via wholesale deals, notably the landmark distribution agreement with Charter Communications”

They gave Disney+ away for FREE to Charter customers. How are these earnings reports not considered fraudulent?

Ben Stiller stopped by The Tonight Show to promote his new documentary, Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost, and took the opportunity to rave about working with Ariana Grande on Focker In-Law. 


	“It's crazy how talented she is,” Stiller told host Jimmy Fallon. “She's so sweet. I didn't know her before. Actually, I had met her before because she did a cameo in Zoolander 2 10 years ago. She was in an orgy scene we had. But I haven't seen her since the orgy. She's so great with comedy. She's amazing in Wicked and she's such a good singer, obviously, too.”


	He recalled how sometimes he would hear her randomly singing on set and it would be this “incredible, operatic kind of soliloquy.” “And that's just her humming,” he noted. 


	Stiller complimented Grande's talent for comedy. “She's just a total natural,” he said. “I feel like she could do anything.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Grande recently revealed on social media that she had completed filming for her role in the upcoming Meet the Parents sequel. The fourth installment in the comedy series was announced in late May, with Grande reportedly cast as Olivia Jones, the fiancée of Ben Stiller and Teri Polo's son and “a ball-busting woman who seems all wrong for him.”

	











	“I can't really talk too much, I guess, at this point about the movie,” Stiller previously told The Today Show about the sequel. “But the character [Grande's] playing is — she's going to be really, really funny and kind of the whole engine of the new movie. So it's exciting.”

	











	Universal Pictures scheduled the sequel for November 25, 2026, with John Hamburg — who penned the first three movies, 2000's Meet the Parents, 2004's Meet the Fockers, and 2010's Little Fockers — on board as writer and now director for the fourth installment. Owen Wilson, Blythe Danner, and Teri Polo are all confirmed to return for Focker In-Law, with Skyler Gisondo joining the cast as Stiller's son and Grande's husband-to-be.

	Elsewhere on The Tonight Show, Stiller discussed Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost, about his parents Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, and the most recent season of his show Severance. Fallon noted that after a successful second season, fans now just want Season 3. “Yes they do,” Stiller said. “And it's coming.” He confirmed that more episodes of Severance will arrive “soon-ish.”


	“It's tough because people do love the show,” Stiller said. “People love the show and then they're always like, ‘When is the next season? When is the next season?' And it's always, ‘We're working on it.' But we've only done 19 episodes over five and a half years on the show. I think Young Sheldon‘s done 600 episodes in that time.”

The 38-minute short, world premiering at IDFA in Amsterdam, explores the mourning after an airplane crash in Ethiopia, which killed the younger brother of the director, whose father produced the film.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


an open field, a 38-minute short film from director Teboho Edkins and his father and producer Don Edkins, which will world premiere at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) on Sunday, is very personal.


	In March 2019, a Boeing 737 MAX airplane crashed just six minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. All 157 people on board died, including Max Thabiso Edkins, the director's younger brother. 




	So, he and his father decided to travel together to the crash site “to seek something tangible in their grief,” as a synopsis for an open field notes. “What they find is a community in which mourning is an important part of the culture. Just as for the Edkins family, the lives of the villagers have also been turned upside down by the crash. In a deeply moving experience, they discover that the community members who welcome them regard the crash victims as visiting guests, whom they have taken into their hearts as brothers and sisters. Their compassion contrasts starkly with the calculating stance of airplane manufacturer Boeing. As if attempting somehow to connect with his brother's spirit, the filmmaker immerses himself in the sounds of the disaster site.”

	The movie, a South Africa, France, Germany production, is co-produced by Carine Chichkowsky for Survivance, with cinematography courtesy of Jide Akinleminu and editing handled by Anne Fabini. The film, shot in color and black-and-white and featuring dialogue in both English and Amharic, will screen in the IDFA 2025 Competition for Short Documentary program.

	











	“The first time I visited the crash site, a giant crater in an open field, was shortly after the crash in 2019,” explains Teboho Edkins. “Grief-stricken, I showed the local villagers sitting by the crater photos of my brother Max and realized that they had become the custodians of the site. My father Don, a documentary film producer, felt the need to throw himself into a film project about the crash. Initially, I wanted nothing to do with it. Years passed, and I found it very difficult to begin working on the project. Also, no media was allowed close to the crash site, until, as a family member, and after much time spent by my father building relationships, Ethiopian Airlines finally gave us exclusive permission to film at the site in 2022.”


	Father and producer Don Edkins adds: “I wanted to make a film about the crash that would highlight the injustice that took so many lives. Having grown up under apartheid in South Africa, I had always looked at how documentary cinema could spotlight injustice and human rights, and how I could use activism and creativity to navigate the grief we felt.”


	And he shares: “When I went to the crash site for the first anniversary in March 2020, I met the families who lived nearby and saw how the entire community — hundreds of people — came together to mourn with us. It was a powerful moment. Such pure humanity stood in stark contrast to Boeing's widely criticized actions, including the use of a flawed flight-control system and the failure to fully inform pilots about it — issues highlighted in official investigations and public reporting. They chose cost-cutting measures and prioritized profit over safety.”

	











	Now, THR can unveil a clip from an open field, which includes an eyewitness of the plane crash recalling what he experienced. At the end of the clip, next to the film's title, we also see a very personal note from the filmmaker: “The film I didn't want to make.”

	Trey Parker and Matt Stone may be getting a call from corporate soon.


	The South Park creators' latest episode, “Sora Not Sorry,” tackled the ever-escalating world of AI as two plots unraveled in Colorado and Washington. While Butters, his friends, and Detective Harris dealt with a disturbing deepfake epidemic at South Park Elementary, a cartoon President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance schemed around the White House trying to figure out what to do with Trump and Satan's demon baby.


	Eventually, Trump and Vance are depicted moving business from the hot tub to the bedroom … and things quickly devolve from there. The lovemaking soundtracked by Foreigner's “I Want to Know What Love Is” elicited understandable horror from the far corners of social media. One X commenter wrote, “Thanks for the nightmares I'm gonna have tonight South Park”; another lamented, “OMG I can't unsee that,” alongside a GIF of Homer Simpson washing his eyes with bleach.


	In response to a screenshot of the hot-tub scene posted by South Park, an X user declared, “That was hilarious. Trump & Vance upstaged the puppet sex scene in Team America.”

South Park has leaned heavily into politics and the MAGA storyline for its current season, and its latest episode arrives days after The New York Times published its interview with Parker and Stone. “It's not that we got all political,” Parker said. “It's that politics became pop culture.”


	Stone added that “new taboos” had emerged amid a fear of speaking out against the Trump administration. “Trey and I are attracted to that like flies to honey,” Stone said. “Oh, that's where the taboo is? Over there? OK, then we're over there.”

Danielle Fishel is opening up about her surprise over Andy Richter's “Dancing With the Stars” elimination. She called his anniversary-night performance one of his best yet. The “Boy Meets World” alum reflected on the 20th anniversary episode during her podcast, admitting she didn't expect Richter and partner Emma Slater to go home after what she described as his “most impressive” routine to date.

During the 20th Birthday Party for “Dancing With the Stars” last night, Alfonso Ribeiro and Julianne Hough revealed the results at the end of the episode. While many were shocked that Andy & Emma were still on the show, including Andy himself, they did make it to week 9. However, it was the end of the road for them last night.

Fishel, 44, talked about Andy's elimination during the week 9 episode of her “Dancing With the Stars” recap. The podcast is released under the “Pod Meets World” podcast umbrella.

She said, “Of all the nights, I thought tonight was the most impressive night Andy had since he held the camera in his hand, when everybody fell in love with him.”

Fishel was a little worried about Andy & Emma's routine when she heard they would be taking on a quickstep. She stated, “I know Andy struggles with his knees. He recently had just posted [that] he had a bunch of fluid drained from his knee.”

Because of that, she was thinking the dance wouldn't “be that quick” and wouldn't have “that many steps.” However, she was pleasantly surprised.

“I thought it had significantly more content than I thought it was going to. There were times that he really moved. I was impressed,” Fishel continued.

Despite Fishel being impressed by the routine, Andy & Emma fell short with the votes and judges' scores this past week and were sent home. Fishel said, “I can't believe I'm saying this, but I was somehow surprised that Andy went home tonight.”

She was probably equally as surprised after her elimination during the November 4 episode. Since her elimination, Fishel talked with Us Weekly and aired one major grievance about her time on the show.

During her last performance on “Dancing With the Stars” season 34, she and her pro partner, Pasha Pashkov, danced to “Dream On” by Aerosmith. However, they created a backstory for the performance, which the audience never got to hear.

“Our story is about the impossible standards placed on women both from society and from ourselves. If we pursue work outside the home and have a family, we're told that we should be with our kids more,” she explained to Us Weekly. “When we stay home, we're told we don't work and are uninteresting. If we're too thin, we're told to eat a burger, and if we gain weight, we're told to get off the couch.”

Despite all of that, Fishel wanted that routine to focus on “living out your dreams.” This was especially true after her 2024 breast cancer diagnosis.

She added, “When we were on the ballroom floor, I was like, listening to my package, and I was like … none of that was even mentioned, like, none of my story was even in the package. Those are just things that are completely out of our control.”

“Dancing With the Stars” season 34 airs live on Tuesdays at 8:00 p.m. ET on ABC and Disney+, and streams the next day on Hulu.

Among its debuts is a No. 8 bow on Top Album Sales.

Radiohead's second live album, Hail to the Thief: Live Recordings 2003-2009, makes a top 10 debut across four Billboard album charts (dated Nov. 15), including a No. 8 bow on Top Album Sales, marking the band's ninth top 10. The set also enters the top 10 on Indie Store Album Sales (No. 4), Vinyl Albums (No. 5) and Top Current Album Sales (No. 8).

	











	On the overall Billboard 200 chart, the set squeaks in at No. 200, landing the group its 17th chart entry. The set also bows at No. 30 on Independent Albums and at No. 48 on Top Rock & Alternative Albums.


	In the tracking week ending Nov. 6 in the United States, the album earned a little over 8,000 equivalent album units, of which essentially all were in traditional album sales (purchases of digital and physical copies of the album).


Billboard's Top Album Sales chart ranks the top-selling albums of the week based only on traditional album sales. The chart's history dates back to May 25, 1991, the first week Billboard began tabulating charts with electronically monitored piece count information from SoundScan, now Luminate. Pure album sales were the sole measurement utilized by the Billboard 200 albums chart through the list dated Dec. 6, 2014, after which that chart switched to a methodology that blends album sales with track equivalent album (TEA) units and streaming equivalent album (SEA) units.

	











	Radiohead's new live album is one of six debuts or re-entries among the top 10 on the latest Top Album Sales chart, where Florence + the Machine's Everybody Scream debuts atop the list. Tyler, The Creator's chart-topping CHROMAKOPIA reenters at No. 2 after its one-year anniversary reissue on CD, vinyl and in two deluxe boxed sets (each containing branded merch and a copy of the CD). Grateful Dead's latest archival live set Dave's Picks, Vol. 56: Rainbow Theatre, London, England, 3/20/81 & 3/21/81 enters at No. 3, while Taylor Swift's former No. 1 The Life of a Showgirl slips 3-4. The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack rises a spot to No. 5, while Hamilton: 10 Shots (Highlights From the Original Broadway Cast Recording) bows at No. 6. Stray Kids' chart-topping KARMA climbs 9-7, Bob Dylan's from-the-vaults compilation Through the Open Window: The Bootleg Series, Vol. 18, 1956-1963 debuts at No. 9 and Vince Guaraldi Trio's A Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack returns to the top 10, rising 14-10.

'Death Stranding Isolations' will hit the streamer in 2027. 


							By 

	Abid Rahman


International Editor, Digital


Death Stranding fans rejoice! Hideo Kojima‘s groundbreaking video game franchise is set to expand with an all-new animated series that's heading to Disney+. 


	At Disney's Asia Pacific originals content showcase in Hong Kong, Kojima made a surprise appearance to announce the new show, Death Stranding Isolations (working title), that is scheduled to hit Disney+ in 2027. 




	Launched in 2019 by Kojima Productions, Death Stranding became an instant classic and bestseller that built upon Kojima's legendary world building skills and marrying them with breathtaking cinematic visuals. The game featured actors Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen, Léa Seydoux, Margaret Qualley, Troy Baker, Tommie Earl Jenkins, and Lindsay Wagner in prominent roles. A sequel game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, was released in June this year for the PlayStation 5. And the Death Stranding will grow with a feature film adaptation also in the works from A24.

	Kojima, who will serve as executive producer of the animated series, appeared on the Hong Kong stage with the show's director Takayuki Sano (Bullet/Bullet, Gridman Universe) to share details on the project, the latest expansion of Death Stranding franchise. New concept art created by Ilya Kuvshinov, who served as character designer for Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045, was also revealed.


	Speaking through a translator, Kojima said that the series will be “pretty mind-blowing” and that he wanted to expand his franchise into anime as it would allow him to do things you can only do with animation. He added the series will have new and different characters.

	











	Asked why he was working with Disney, Kojima said he was a longtime fan of the company and worked with them on the 2023 documentary, Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds. He added that Disney approached him about the project while working together on the doc.


	As for his motivation for making the series, Kojima said he realized there were people who may not play video games, and he wanted to share the world of Death Stranding with more people.


	The series will utilize traditional hand-drawn 2D animation style, with E&H Production (Ninja Kamui, Red Cat Ramen), one of Japan's top animation studios, currently working on the project.


	Disney+ also provided a brief outline for the series, “Set in the world of Death Stranding, Death Stranding Isolations (working title) will tell a completely new story, separate from that of the video games. The upcoming series will follow a young man and woman as they set out on an adventure.”

Will Smith joined his ex-wife, Sheree Zampino, as they marked their son Trey's 33rd birthday with a family celebration. 

The “Bad Boys” star posed for rare blended family photos featuring his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and his second son, Jaden Smith, in an Instagram post shared by Zampino on Wednesday.

“Wow! You are 33 Son! What a pure delight and magnificent soul you are! Your light is infectious and the love, grace, and compassion that you live & move in is such a beautiful honor, privilege & joy to behold!” she captioned the post.

“To say that I am honored to be your Mother would only touch the surface of the depth of my gratitude and love for you! May this 33rd year around the Sun be a portal into another dimension of brilliance & abundance! HAPPY 33rd to The AngO!”

In the first picture, Will stood next to Zampino while their son wrapped his arms around the group. 

She also posted a video of Will — along with several other family and friends — singing “Happy Birthday” to the birthday boy.

The “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” star married Zampino in 1992 but the pair went their separate ways and divorced in 1995.

Just two years later, Will married Pinkett Smith. The two share son Jaden, 27, and daughter Willow, 25.

As far as their co-parenting relationship, the road was rocky between Pinkett Smith and Zampino, according to the entrepreneur.

Zampino revealed in August 2022 that the trio of parents didn't see eye to eye on parenting styles because they each had “three different dynamics, three different personalities and [three] different belief systems.”

“My thing was with Jada — it was like, as long as she treats him well, we're good,” Zampino said on David Yontef's “Behind the Velvet Rope” podcast.

At the time, Zampino noted that the “Girls Trip” star always “treated [Trey] well” and “loved him.”

However, the “Men in Black” star revealed that he had his own issues with his son following his divorce from Zampino.  

In 2018, Will shared that the father and son “struggled for years” after his split from his ex as he reflected on the progress he had made with Trey over the years. 

“It has not always been like this between Trey & I. We STRUGGLED FOR YEARS after my Divorce from his Mother. He felt betrayed & abandoned. It is a Wild Blessing to recover & restore a Loving Relationship with My Beautiful Son! @treysmith0011,” he said in an Instagram update.

Will went on to share that his son told him that his dad had come to be his best friend. 

Trey has typically kept a low profile in comparison to the rest of his famous family. 

However, he appeared next to Will in the star's 1998 music video for his track titled “Just The Two of Us,” and went on to star in two episodes of the series “All Of Us” in 2003.

Donald Trump would prefer not to hear the name Jeffrey Epstein ever again. “Are you still talking about Jeffery Epstein?” he asked a reporter who brought up the late sex offender in July. “Are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable.”


	Unfortunately for the president, lingering questions about the crimes Epstein committed with his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell continue to be of national interest. Polling shows that about three-quarters of Americans want the government to release all the materials it has from investigations and prosecutions of Epstein, who died by suicide in a jail cell while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019. Trump's own supporters and his allies in Washington have been particularly vocal regarding the so-called “Epstein files,” believing they could implicate various powerful elites in a child sex trafficking ring, and during his 2024 campaign, Trump indicated that he would make them public if reelected. 

	











	The issue is that Trump — a close friend of Epstein's for more than a decade — is named in these documents himself, as the Justice Department informed him in May. That alone is not evidence of wrongdoing, and Trump has denied knowledge of or participation in any of Epstein's illegal activities. But the association is damaging nonetheless, and the steady trickle of details about their relationship (House Democrats on Wednesday dropped a 2019 email from Epstein in which he wrote that Trump “knew about the girls,” for example) have not played in his favor. Meanwhile, Trump hasn't ruled out a pardon for Maxwell, who was moved to a minimum-security prison facility this summer as she continues to serve her 20-year sentence.

	Here's everything we currently know about Trump's relationship with Epstein.


	Trump has said that he and Epstein became friends in the late 1980s. The two were neighbors in affluent Palm Beach, Florida — Trump bought his Mar-a-Lago estate there in 1985, initially using it as a residence before its conversion to a country club a decade later — and moved in the same social circles. Often spotted together at high-profile gatherings of the rich and powerful, Epstein and Trump seemed quite close at the time, according to Jack O'Donnell, an executive at Trump Plaza and Casino during this period. “In my mind, [Epstein] was his best friend, you know, [throughout] the time I was there for four years,” O'Donnell told CNN in 2025. He further claimed that Epstein and Trump once illegally brought underage girls into Trump's Atlantic City casino, where they often spent time together.

	The most widely circulated footage of Trump and Epstein together comes from a November 1992 party that the future president held at Mar-a-Lago, with NFL cheerleaders in attendance. Trump invited NBC to document the soirée; following Epstein's 2019 arrest, the network aired archival clips of the pair evidently assessing the women at the event. “Look at her, back there… she's hot,” Trump appears to tell Epstein at one point. Another snippet shows Epstein doubling over with laughter at something Trump whispers to him. Trump can also be seen dancing with a woman and patting her buttocks.


	Epstein was a guest at Trump's 1993 wedding to Marla Maples at New York's Plaza hotel, and Trump flew between Palm Beach and New York on Epstein's private jets seven times between 1993 and 1997, according to flight logs presented as evidence in Maxwell's 2021 trial.


	Other images linking Trump and Epstein come from a 1997 Victoria's Secret party in New York (Epstein was a business associate of Les Wexner, then the CEO of L Brands, which owned the fashion company) and a 2000 charity fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. At that party, Trump posed for a photo with his future wife Melania, Epstein, and Maxwell. Also in attendance at that party was Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, a prince of the British royal family until he was stripped of his royal titles this October, following the settlement of a sexual assault lawsuit from the late Epstein accuser ​​Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Epstein had trafficked her to him.

	In the early Aughts, Epstein and Trump were still the best of pals. “I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Trump said in an interview for a 2002 New York Magazine profile of Epstein as a well-connected “International Moneyman of Mystery.” 


	“He's a lot of fun to be with,” Trump added. “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” 


	The following year, Epstein celebrated his 50th birthday. To mark the occasion, Maxwell had his friends contribute letters, photos, and drawings to a scrapbook, the full contents of which were made public by the House Oversight Committee in September. A note that appears to be from Trump (though he has denied writing it) consisted of the drawing of a nude female figure and an imagined dialogue between the two men. “We have certain things in common, Jeffrey,” “Donald” says in the exchange, which is typed out. “Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?” reads another line. The letter concludes: “A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” Trump's signature appears below the drawing and words. 


	Trump and Epstein grew apart in the following years, however. Their 2004 competition to buy an oceanfront Palm Beach mansion at a foreclosure auction likely helped to sour the relationship, though in July, Trump said that he had cut ties with his former friend because Epstein “stole” young women employees of the Mar-a-Lago spa. He indicated that Giuffre, recruited as a teenager by Maxwell to be a masseuse for Epstein in 2000, was one of the spa workers hired away by the financier. Epstein remained a member of Mar-a-Lago until 2007, when Trump banned him from the club, reportedly after Epstein sexually harassed the teenage daughter of another member.


	By that point, Epstein had been indicted in Florida for solicitation of prostitution following an investigation opened by Palm Beach police in 2005, and the FBI was preparing federal charges against him. His lawyers angled for a plea agreement with Alexander Acosta, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida. In return for the federal case being dropped, Epstein pleaded guilty to two state charges in 2008, receiving an 18-month sentence, and was required to register as a convicted sex offender. When Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and federally charged for the sex trafficking of minors, Acosta — then serving as President Trump's Labor Secretary — faced significant blowback for Epstein's earlier non-prosecution agreement, often referred to as a “sweetheart deal.” He resigned from the cabinet that same month.

	











	In 2016, an anonymous Jane Doe filed a lawsuit claiming that Trump and Epstein had sexually assaulted and raped her at Epstein's New York residence multiple times in 1994, when she was 13 years old. The suit was withdrawn days before Trump won the presidential election. (Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by 28 women — though none were under age — and in 2023 was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in a lawsuit brought by writer E. Jean Carroll, a judgment he has been trying to overturn ever since.)


	In 2017, Epstein spoke to author Michael Wolff about being Trump's “closest friend.” In the taped interview, published in 2024, he claimed that Trump had first slept with Melania on his private plane. Although Epstein described Trump as charismatic, he was critical of his performance as president and said he was a serial adulterer. “He's a horrible human being,” Epstein said. “He does nasty things to his best friends, best friends' wives, anyone who he first tries to gain their trust and uses it to do bad things to them.” He also claimed that Trump was “functionally illiterate.”


	Epstein's arrest in July 2019 prompted Trump to further distance himself from his former friend, claiming they had not been in touch for 15 years. The following month, Epstein hanged himself in a federal prison facility in Manhattan. According to Bill Barr, the U.S. Attorney General at the time, Trump was shocked to learn of his death. He called for an investigation into how Epstein could have died while in custody, meanwhile amplifying unfounded conspiracy theories which implied that Bill Clinton, another acquaintance of Epstein, may have had something to do with it.  


	After Maxwell was federally charged for sex trafficking in 2020, Trump raised eyebrows by lending her words of support. “I haven't really been following it too much,” he said of the case. “I just wish her well, frankly.” In 2025, as she was appealing her conviction and seeking a pardon from a reelected Trump, Maxwell told Justice Department officials that she had never seen the president “in any inappropriate setting.”


	In October 2024, former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Stacey Williams went public with an allegation that in 1993, Epstein, whom she'd met the year before, brought her to visit Trump at Trump Tower in New York, where Trump brazenly groped her as the two men continued to talk casually, “smiling at one another and continuing on in their conversation,” as she put it. Williams called the encounter part of a “twisted game” between them. The Trump campaign denied the allegation.

	











	Conspiracy theories began circulating around Epstein's death as soon as it made headlines, with believers insisting that he was murdered as part of a cover-up to protect his associates. MAGA loyalists proved especially keen on the idea that prominent Democrats and various wealthy liberal elites are behind this supposed plot and need to be exposed for their links to Epstein. This commentary typically comes along with repeated calls to release the “Epstein files,” or all the material related to criminal investigations and prosecutions of Epstein dating back to 2005, though some have demanded the publication of a hypothetical “Epstein list” naming clients of his sex trafficking operation that he may have been blackmailing. There is no evidence that such a list exists.


	Once Trump was back in the Oval Office, his supporters expected him to make good on his campaign promise to reveal everything the government knows about Epstein. To that end, Attorney General Pam Bondi in February invited a number of right-wing influencers to the White House and gave them binders of documents labeled “The Epstein Files: Phase One,” with the understanding that they would share any findings with their followers. It quickly emerged, however, that they had only received material that was already a matter of public record, including Epstein's address book, which was first published in 2015. Conspiracy theorists were livid, not least because Bondi had promised revelatory information.


	The botched stunt brought renewed scrutiny of the relationship between Trump and Epstein, with Trump officials working to tamp down discontent over their failure to disclose anything new about the Epstein case. In May, FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino — both of whom had stoked Epstein conspiracy theories before Trump appointed them to lead the bureau — said that footage from the jail where he was being held prove that his death was a suicide. A week later, amid their escalating public feud, Trump megadonor Elon Musk, recently departed from his advisory position in the administration, said that Trump was named in the Epstein files. “That is the real reason they have not been made public,” he posted on X, his social media platform.” (He later deleted these comments.)


	Then, in early July, the Justice Department attempted to put the Epstein story to bed with a brief memo explaining that he had indeed died by suicide while in custody, that there is no reason to believe a “client list” exists, and that their investigation was effectively closed. The DOJ also provided surveillance footage from the prison where Epstein was being held on the night of his death, which did not show anyone entering his cell after him. Conspiracy theorists found the video unconvincing and were enraged that the DOJ wasn't prosecuting anyone else in connection with Epstein's sex trafficking operation.

	











	The memo caused a schism within the administration as well, and led to Trump lashing out at his supporters for caring about the “bullshit” Epstein files. He and White House officials tried, without much success, to spin them as some kind of Democrat-engineered “hoax.” At the same time, The Wall Street Journal broke the story about Trump's 2003 birthday book letter to Epstein; the president dismissed it as “a fake thing.” Then it emerged that Bondi had told Trump in May that his name appeared in the Epstein files, contrary to his claim to a reporter in July that the DOJ had not informed him of this.


	As Epstein victims spoke out agains the administration's handling of the case, Trump privately fumed that they were “Democrats” and out to make him look bad. Meanwhile, Maxwell was moved in August to a more comfortable prison where she is reportedly “much happier,” though the Federal Bureau of Prisons gave no reason for the transfer. This came after Trump told the press that he was “allowed” to pardon Maxwell if he wanted to. She additionally gave an interview to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, formerly Trump's personal attorney, in which she had only flattering things to say about the president. (The Supreme Court declined to hear Maxwell's appeal to overturn her conviction in October, leaving her reliant on the president to commute her sentence.)


	In September, House Speaker Mike Johnson came under fire for alleged attempts to mislead the public on the Epstein case and block further disclosures about it. First, he bizarrely stated that Trump was “an FBI informant” trying to take down Epstein — a claim he later retracted. Then he led House Republicans in refusing to swear in newly elected Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.) for more than a month during a record-breaking U.S. government shutdown. Because Grijalva would have been the last signature needed on a discharge petition to force a vote on a bill for releasing files pertaining to Epstein, and Trump opposes the measure, some political observers considered this a stonewalling strategy. Grijalva was finally sworn in on Nov. 12, clearing the path for a vote on the Epstein documents bill.


	November also brought the release of more than 20,000 Epstein documents by Democrats and Republicans in Congress, including emails in which the late sex offender discussed Trump. In a 2011 email to Maxwell, for example, he wrote, “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump,” claiming that Trump once “spent hours at my house” with a young woman who went on to accuse Epstein of trafficking and abusing her. Elsewhere, in a 2018 message, he wrote: “you see, i know how dirty Donald is.” Epstein even called Trump “borderline insane” in his digital correspondence.

	Once more, Trump and his administration sought to wave away the direct links to Epstein. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the emails a “clear distraction,” with the president saying much the same. “The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,” he complained on Truth Social. “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap.” Trump has reportedly reached out to Reps. Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace, two Republican lawmakers pushing for a full release of the Epstein files, in hopes of convincing them to back off of the topic.


	If the Epstein saga has taught us anything, however, it's that you can't easily sweep this mess under the rug — not after years of feverish speculation, misinformation, and accusations of shielding sexual predators from accountability while ignoring the stories of survivors. Slowly but surely, more is coming to light, and the demand for answers is as loud as it's ever been.

As with so much of AI discourse, the conversations surrounding “Tilly Norwood”—the supposed “AI actress” created by tech company Xicoia, which garnered lots of not-entirely-positive headlines a few weeks back when the company started making big noises about the potential for getting their character signed by a Hollywood agency—has served as a bit of a Rorschach test. Acting unions like SAG have bristled at a technology that seems to want to replace its members' lifetimes of craft with cheap imitations; male profile writers of a certain character have lined up to salivate over “her” in the manner they once lavished on human ingenues; and others have simply pointed out how very creepy it is that the first recourse of any company trying to make waves in this sphere seems to be to create a completely compliant homunculus of the female form for users to take digital custody of.

Take, for instance, comments made recently by performer Jameela Jamil, who, per Deadline, opened up with her thoughts on the Tilly Norwood debate at the Web Summit in Lisbon this week. Jamil didn't mince words about her reaction to the Norwood character, which Xicoia—a division of tech company Particle6, created by founder Eline Van Der Velden—had featured in a few online videos, before they brought the Hollywood firestorm down on their heads. “Shame on it,” Jamil said, for “Being a teenage-looking girl who can't say no to a type of sex scene or to a sexual abuse scene, who can't advocate for herself, who can't advocate for more money. It's marked that it was a young woman, rather than a man that they came out with first and that she looks a particular way. I find the whole thing deeply disturbing.”

Jamil (who most recently appeared in theaters with a voice role in Pixar's Elio) also talked more broadly about the technology, saying she finds the whole endeavor absurd because “the whole point of acting is to emulate the human experience and so having something that is not human trying to emulate our experience is not possible.” At the same time, she expressed fear for people who work both above and below the line in film and TV production, saying, “I can't think of anything sadder than replacing these people and these departments with a computer by someone who isn't an artist.”

Is there any place for fakes in a genre built on connection and authenticity?


													By
												

	Melinda Newman



	As artificial intelligence moves further into the music space, how concerned should the country community, which has built its reputation on authenticity and a trusted connection between artists and fans, be?


	One-third of the top 10 on Billboard's Country Digital Song Sales chart dated Nov. 15 is composed of AI-assisted artists, including “Walk My Walk,” attributed to Breaking Rust, which spends its second week at No. 1; Cain Walker's “Don't Tread on Me” which stands at No. 3; and Walker's “Ain't My Problem,” which debuted at No. 9. (Walker's “Freedom” also debuted on the 15-position chart at No. 11).


	“Walk My Walk,” which is spending its second week at No. 1, has a gospel, stomping feel, while Walker's tunes are more dark country rock. All three share similar “stand my ground, don't mess with me”-type lyrics with boisterous vocals.


	The Distrokid-distributed songs are selling relatively small numbers: Breaking Rust's “Walk My Walk” sold more than 2,000 copies in the U.S. for the tracking week ending Nov. 6, according to Luminate, while Walker's “Don't Tread on Me” sold more than 1,000 copies, and his “Ain't My Problem” sold slightly under 1,000. By comparison, the top-selling song on Billboard‘s all-genre Digital Song Sales chart for the week ending Nov. 6, Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia,” sold 29,000 copies. 


Billboard determines if a charting title is AI or AI-assisted through checking the artist pages, some of which say they are generated with the help of AI, as well as cross-checks the songs using Deezer's AI detection tool, which adds a flag to all AI-generated content on the platform. Aubierre Rivaldo Taylor is listed as the songwriter for Breaking Rust's “Walk My Walk.” Billboard has reached out to him, but has not heard back.


	“It's a notable wake-up call but not yet an existential threat — more like a symptom of broader disruptions in how music is created, distributed and consumed,” says FEMco founder Leslie Fram. “In country, where authenticity and storytelling are core, this could erode trust if fans feel manipulated, but it's mostly confined to sales charts so far, not airplay or streaming staples.”


	Yet. But AI has already spread to another genre's airplay chart: Xania Monet, who signed to Hallwood Media after bidding offers reached $3 million, became the first known AI artist to earn enough radio airplay to rank on a Billboard radio chart when she debuted at No. 30 on the Adult R&B Airplay chart dated Nov. 11. Several other AI or AI-assisted acts have also debuted on Billboard charts in recent weeks, including Childpets Galore on Christian Digital Song Sales, Unbound Music and Emily Blue on Rock Digital Song Sales, and contemporary Christian artist Juno Skye on the Emerging Artists chart.


	Terrestrial country radio stations have not yet added Breaking Rust or Cain Walker to their rotations, and country radio consultant Joel Raab says that's wise. “Listeners react negatively to the idea of AI voices on their stations,” Raab says, citing research done on the question of AI use in general. “Listeners don't like the idea of AI voices, so by association, I don't think they'd like the music.”


	Furthermore, other than playing the songs for curiosity value, “leaning on that type of programming consistently seems very shortsighted considering radio makes money off of touring advertising and other artist-driven revenue,” says F2 Entertainment Group president/CEO Fletcher Foster, who manages MORIAH and other artists.


	Fram agrees. “[Country] stations prioritize ‘real' voices tied to tours and endorsements, so Breaking Rust might need active promo (e.g., fake ‘artist' interviews or tie-ins) to cross over,” she says. ”It's going to be a real conversation for gatekeepers. If [the song] hooks listeners, they may want to play it — radio's job is curation, not purity tests.”


	For real artists and their managers, though, the AI disruption could potentially make a difficult job even harder. “The artist development process has never been easy. Over the past few years, especially since COVID and the massive switch to DSPs, it has never been more challenging,” Fletcher says. “It's incredibly detrimental to have AI-generated songs taking up precious spots on the chart because not only do they clog up the chart, but they take positions away from a well-rounded artist that can have a career generating revenue and publishing, touring, brand partnerships, etc.”


	Some labels are embracing AI. Last month, Universal Music Group (UMG) announced a deal with Udio that settled UMG's involvement in a lawsuit it had filed last year against the AI music startup, along with Sony and Warner — and paved the way for a version of Udio that would create a new commercial consumption and streaming experience that would pay participating UMG artists for lending their work to Udio's AI model.


	Cain Walker is already spreading beyond music. His website is selling merchandise, including “Don't Tread On Me” t-shirt. 


	Country artist Martina McBride is among the artists who have been vocal about protecting artists and their voices. Earlier this year, she testified in support of the NO FAKES Act, bipartisan legislation that gives individuals the right to protect their voices and likenesses from being replicated by AI without their consent, both in music and in a broader context.  “AI technology is amazing and can be used for so many wonderful purposes. But like all great technologies, it can also be abused,” she wrote in a guest column for Billboard published in May.


	Raab and Fram are betting on the human race over deep fakes, even though there may be challenging times looming. “Looking ahead, the realness of human music with heart and human soul will win every time,” Raab predicts.


	“Casual streamers might shrug — ‘If it sounds good, who cares?', but dedicated fans — especially in genres like country — crave the human ‘mistakes' that add soul, per a study on what makes tracks memorable,” Fram says. “Bottom line: Fans will stream AI songs short-term, but loyalty? That's earned through real stories, not algorithms…Over time, ‘fake' acts risk fizzling like one-hit wonders; true superfans bet on humans who evolve with them. AI might open doors, but only flesh-and-blood keeps 'em coming back for encores.”

James Van Der Beek is auctioning off his personal collection of Dawson's Creek and Varsity Blues memorabilia amid his fight against cancer. Following news of his stage 3 colorectal cancer diagnosis last November, Van Der Beek is working with Propstore for their Winter Entertainment Memorabilia Live Auction being held Dec. 5-7.


	“I've been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it's clear that the time is now,” Van Der Beek told People. All proceeds will go to Van Der Beek to assist with the financial cost for his battle with cancer, according to the outlet.Among the items being sold is the necklace Dawson Leery (Van Der Beek) gifted Joey Potter (Katie Holmes) for prom, which is estimated to go for $26,400 to $52,800. “Dawson wore his iconic stone necklace throughout the series until the Season 3 Episode ‘Homecoming' where he gifted his necklace to Joey, signifying their eternal relationship to each other whether as either friends or lovers, defining them as simply ‘Dawson and Joey,'” reads the auction page.


	Other memorabilia includes Dawson's flannel shirt worn throughout the TV series and the the cleats and West Canaan Coyotes hat the actor used in 1999's Varsity Blues.

	“While I have some nostalgia tugging at me as I part with these items, it feels good to be able to offer them through Propstore's auction to share with those who have supported my work over the years,” he told People.


	Last December, the actor shared photos of the Varsity Blues limited edition Number 4 jerseys he offered for sale to help ease the “financial burden” stemming from his colorectal cancer treatments and to help other families in the same situation. 

	











	In September, Van Der Beek announced that he was forced to drop out of the live Dawson's Creek reunion due to illness.

I won't get to stand on that stage and thank every soul in the theater for showing up for me, and against cancer, when I needed it most.”

The disclosure of emails from the paedophile financier has fuelled calls for the full release of FBI files on his case

It is 20 years since Florida police first investigated the financier Jeffrey Epstein for the sexual abuse of underage girls; six years since he killed himself in prison following his arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges; and more than a year since Donald Trump said that he would have “no problem” with releasing the FBI files on the offender.

As the Democratic politician Ro Khanna noted, releasing the files “was core to Trump's promise … It was his central theme that the American corrupt elite had betrayed forgotten Americans”. The question is not only what Epstein's associates did, but also what they knew and what they did not do. It is not only about their own behaviour, but about any knowledge or suspicion of his crimes, and willingness to overlook them.

Yet the Maga base is still waiting. Mr Trump has said that he had “no idea” about Epstein's crimes. On Wednesday, questions were reignited by the Democrats' release of emails in which Epstein described Mr Trump as “that dog that hasn't barked”, adding that “[victim's name redacted] spent hours at my house with him”. Republicans said the victim was the late Virginia Giuffre, who told lawyers that “I don't think Donald Trump participated in anything”. Separately, Epstein wrote that “of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine [Maxwell] to stop” and that “Trump knew of it” but “he never got a massage”.

Mr Trump, who has mainstreamed and legitimised conspiracy politics and the championing of emotion over fact, attacks the issue as a “hoax”. The very people who urged Maga supporters to pursue this story – such as Kash Patel, now FBI chief – abruptly changed their minds this year without adequate explanation. Republicans released thousands of documents in response to the emails published by Democrats. But Mr Trump faces a bipartisan demand for the full release of the files, with members of the Maga far right joining Democrats.

The Republicans took a drubbing in off-year elections last week, and Mr Trump's approval rating is the lowest of this term. The ending of the longest government shutdown in history – after a handful of Democrats folded on Wednesday – relieved the White House, but opens the way for a vote on releasing the files, expected next week.

Mr Trump has shaken off troubles that would have ended any other political career – including E Jean Carroll's successful civil suit against him for sexual abuse (which he is again asking the supreme court to dismiss) and two dozen allegations of sexual assault, which he denies. The full release of documents might aid him: the slow drip of information has kept the scandal running and made it look, rightly or wrongly, as if the administration has something worse to hide.

For the Maga base, previously fired up by lurid and false “Pizzagate” claims of a paedophile ring connected to the Democratic political elite, this remains a burning issue. Their claims about Epstein's circle have at times been partisan, provably wrong and antisemitic. Yet it's hard to deny that the mills of justice usually grind slower when the rich and well-connected are involved, and that powerful figures who benefited from a relationship with Epstein, such as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Peter Mandelson, have sought to avoid scrutiny and minimise their ties. It took the courage of victims and dogged reporting to make Epstein accountable, and it took far too long. A fuller reckoning for his associates – from across the political spectrum – is overdue.

The Lightkeepers promises a supernatural tale of nautical solitude with a new co-op action game on Quest.

Developed by Spectral Games, likely best known for its work on Medieval Dynasty New Settlement, The Lightkeepers takes place in the 1920s in a world “where daylight unveils discoveries and nightfall demands survival.” Though it's unclear exactly how many players this supports, you're tasked with exploring mysterious islands and solving puzzles to prepare for the imminent threat. 

Revealed during today's VR Games Showcase, The Lightkeepers promises “new challenges, different enemies, and unpredictable places” across each expedition, featuring weapons ranging from muddy rifles to hand-crafted grenades. The studio states light comes at a price, while fending off the dark involves exploring, crafting, and directly fighting these nocturnal terrors as a team.

Strangely, this isn't the only VR game we've recently seen that's set in the 1920s. Last month saw Curvature Games share more about The Amusement, an Art Deco-style roomscale adventure that's inspired both aesthetically and in its setting by Luna Parks during the 1920s post-war period.

The Lightkeepers launches next year on Quest 3 and 3S.

When Will Tracy first watched Save the Green Planet! — a 2003 South Korean cult classic from writer-director Jang Joon-hwan — he didn't expect it to spark one of the most distinctive collaborations of his career. “I'd never seen or even heard of it,” he tells Gold Derby. “I watched it just the one time — I still have only seen it once. I didn't really want it in my head. I wanted to work very freely in adaptation and create something that stands on its own.”

That “something” became Bugonia, Yorgos Lanthimos' latest genre-bending fever dream starring Emma Stone as a powerful tech CEO and Jesse Plemons as the conspiracy theorist who kidnaps her, convinced she's part of an alien plot. The Succession and Menu writer penned the script in three pandemic-era weeks — “not thinking anything would really happen with it” — before it landed in Lanthimos' hands through mutual friend Ari Aster. “We sent it to him and he read it that week and said yes that week,” Tracy recalls. “It was probably about five years from when I wrote it to now, but I was happy to wait.”

Tracy expected the famously enigmatic filmmaker to dissect the screenplay like a philosophical puzzle. “In my imagination, I felt maybe a kind of forbidding aura to him,” he admits. “But he just doesn't play that at all.”




			Popular on Gold Derby		






Instead, Lanthimos gave only a few direct notes — mostly on structure and tone. “It was nothing with dialogue or scenes,” Tracy says. “It was more about reordering and changing emphasis to make things slightly more ambiguous and less explicit.” He made the revisions in just a few days. “They really did treat it almost like a play,” he adds. “Very faithfully as a text.”

 










Tracy's script diverges sharply from Save the Green Planet!, which mixes kidnapping, conspiracy, and slapstick into a dizzying blend of sci-fi and satire. “If you're going to do a remake, you owe it to yourself — and to the other film — to make it as distinct as possible,” he explains.

He stripped away the original's relentless torture sequences and police investigation, replacing them with psychological and ideological combat. “I just wanted to get these two people — really three — from extreme ends of a cultural-political divide in one space together,” he says. “Without the membrane of the internet, where people can shout from their echo chambers. If you get them in a room and give them both good arguments, I'm interested in watching that conversation.”

He structured the film around three escalating “set-piece chats,” building tension through words rather than violence. “That escalation is what I wanted to hang the movie's hat on,” Tracy says. “It's a chamber piece about those chats.”

Tracy likens handing a screenplay to a director to the way a songwriter turns a song over to a performer — the thrill of watching something you created come alive in new hands. He compares his experience on Bugonia to those rare moments when a performance transcends the original work, much like songwriter Diane Warren has described how a Whitney Houston interpretation could lift a song to another level.

 










That, he says, is what it felt like watching Lanthimos bring Bugonia to life. “He just delivers on the things you hoped he would deliver on,” Tracy explains. “And then he delivers on the stuff beyond the page — everything with the VistaVision, the music, the rhythms, the way he cuts. We're in Whitney Houston, voice of a generation territory. Yorgos is my Whitney Houston."

Although Bugonia deals with eco-terrorism and corporate power, its emotional core is empathy for its unhinged kidnapper, Teddy. “It's quite easy now to be cynical and demonize people who believe these theories,” Tracy notes. “I wanted to approach the conspiracy theorist with empathy. Why does he feel this way? In what ways has he been abused by the system? What ways does he have a point?”

He points out that Teddy “is right about a lot of things in the movie,” and that his pain reflects modern disillusionment. “I just didn't want to connect him to any political label,” he says. “He's a guy in serious pain who has a serious point to make.”

Tracy always imagined the CEO as female — even before Emma Stone's casting. Originally, he saw her as older, “maybe in her mid-50s or early 60s,” modeled on General Motors' Mary Barra. Once Lanthimos joined, he realized a younger, Silicon Valley-style executive made more sense. “Emma's actually the right age for that,” he says.

 










Opposite her, Jesse Plemons plays Teddy, with newcomer Aidan Vis as cousin Don. “Aidan spends his first film mainly in a room with the two finest actors of their generation,” Tracy marvels. “He completely hangs in there — he's sort of the heart and soul of the movie.”

Tracy still feels the loss of HBO's juggernaut, where he helped shape its fourth-season finale. “I was the first vote to say, ‘Let's end it at four,'” he recalls. “And of course now I think, ‘Why the hell did I do that?' I loved that show. But it was the right choice.”

He still keeps in touch with castmates — “Kieran Culkin, Sarah Snook, Jeremy Strong — they're all doing incredible things” — and jokes that the Roy family could easily wander into Bugonia. “Kendall would try to convince the kidnapper, ‘I'm just like you, man,'” he laughs. “Roman would be terrified and hilarious. Shiv would probably come closest to surviving — she can hide the football a little better. But Logan — he would have broken Teddy and Don within the first hour."

For now, Tracy's savoring the rare creative harmony he found with Lanthimos. “It was a really happy experience for me — which you don't always get to say as a writer,” he says. “You almost feel a slight sadness while it's happening, thinking, 'I might not get this again. This might be as good as it gets.'”

In recent weeks, Donald Trump's supporters have begun to align around the idea that a Democrat-led “grand conspiracy” – potentially involving former president Barack Obama – has been plotting against the US president since 2016. The narrative is that the 2016 Russia investigation, which resulted in the Mueller inquiry was part of this deep-state opposition to Trump, as was the investigation into the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. 

The focus of the fightback by Trump's supporters is in Miami, where a Trump-appointed US attorney, Jason A. Reding Quiñones, has begun to issue subpoenas to a wide range of former officials.  

This has included former CIA director John Brennan, former FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok, former FBI attorney Lisa Page and former director of national intelligence James Clapper, all of whom were involved in the federal investigation into alleged links between Russian intelligence and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

The way the so-called conspiracy is unfolding will feel familiar to anyone who has watched US politics closely in the past decade. There's been a constant stream of allegations and counter-allegations. But the narrative from the Trump camp is that the powerful “deep state” forces have been arrayed against the president. The “two-tier” justice system that has persecuted Trump can only be rebalanced by pursuing those who investigated him in 2017 and 2021. 

The Grand Conspiracy contains similarities with other prominent conspiracy theories and how they spread. The QAnon movement, whose most famous claim is of a global paedophile ring run out of a Washington pizza parlour involving senior Democrats, is one where disparate claims are sporadically and partially evidenced. The political potency of these claims does not sit in the individual pieces of evidence but in the overarching story. 

The story is that hidden government and proxy networks manipulate the truth and judicial outcomes and that only through pressure from “truthers” (what many people in the US who believe conspiracy theories call themselves) will wrongdoers be brought to account. Once these ideas are popularised, they take on a momentum and a direction that is difficult to control.

Soon after his inauguration, Trump set up a “weaponization working group” within the Department of Justice. Its director, Ed Martin, said in May that he would expose and discredit people he believes to be guilty, even if the evidence wasn't sufficient to charge them: “If they can be charged, we'll charge them. But if they can't be charged, we will name them. And we will name them, and in a culture that respects shame, they should be people that are ashamed.”

In the US the norm has been to “charge crimes, not people”, so this modification fundamentally changes the focus of prosecutors.

The recent subpoenas in Florida show this principle at work, effectively making legal process into the punishment. Even without full court hearings on specific charges, being forced to provide testimony or documents creates suspicion around those who are targeted. Criticism from legal officials that this is a “indict first, investigate second” method suggests that this is a break from historical norms. 

Lawfare, defined as “legal action undertaken as part of a hostile campaign”, doesn't require a successful prosecution. It merely requires enough investigative activity to solidify a narrative of suspected guilt and enough costs and pressure to seriously inconvenience those affected by it. In the new era of digital media, it's enough to degrade the standing of a political opponent. 

In that way, political retaliation has become a prosecuting objective. This is clear from what the US president has indicated in his frequent posts on his social media platforms for his enemies, such as former FBI director James Comey, who investigated his alleged links to Russia, or Adam Schiff, the senator who led his impeachment in 2019. 

Political scientists argue that authoritarianism is something that happens little by little. Some of these steps involve using state power to target political opponents, degrading checks and balances and making loyalty a legal requirement.  

There are reasons to believe that the US seems to be tracking this trajectory currently, certainly when it comes to using the Justice Department to harass the president's political enemies and pushing back against court judgments while attacking the judges that have issued them. 

Further slides towards authoritarianism are possible because of the political potency of contemporary conspiracy movements. The right-wing QAnon movement, for example, has been exceptionally agile. It has offered its followers identity, community spaces and a logic that encourages active participation, exhorting believers to “do your own research”, for example.

In the wake of the near daily addition of material from the investigations into the allegations that the late financier, Jeffrey Epstein, ran a sex trafficking ring, involving some influential US citizens, many American citizens have concluded as a general truth that their elites do hide things. This makes it far simpler for broader conspiracies to gain traction and more difficult for politicians and journalists to work out what is conspiracy and what is evidence. This is creating a problematic feedback loop – hints of wrongdoing fuel public suspicion, and public suspicion fuels the idea of a further need for investigation. 

But to suggest that anyone has control over this would be wrong. These movements can just as easily consume those seen as supporters as they do those seen as enemies. Marjorie Taylor-Greene's determination to release the full and unredacted Epstein files could well produce negative outcomes for some Maga supporters, including prominent ones. 

So, the transformation of legal process into public spectacle in America is suggestive of a drift towards authoritarianism. America's famous “constitutional guardrails” of separation of powers, independent courts, juries and counsels will be pivotal in preventing this. They will need to stand firm. 

The grand conspiracy theory might be more about seeking to isolate, and financially and emotionally exhaust opponents, while at the same time destroying America's system of checks and balances. It might work.

Barry Sonnenfeld's sci-fi comedy "Men in Black" was one of the more notable blockbusters of the 1990s. The film's screenplay was extrapolated from real-life urban myths about mysterious men in back suits (MIBs) who would visit people who had allegedly been abducted by aliens. MIBs had already appeared in "The X-Files," and their legend was passed around ufology circles for years. Sonnenfeld's "Men in Black" imagined the lives of MIBs as, essentially, sci-fi immigration officials, charged with policing the extraterrestrials living on Earth. Because the existence of aliens on Earth would cause a public panic, the Men in Black operate entirely in secret. They're equipped with memory-erasing devices they can use on any witnesses, and none of them use their original names. The two main characters of "Men in Black" are agents J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones). 

The Men in Black operate out of a massive airport-like headquarters building that's always bustling with extraterrestrial activity. Human and aliens work together to protect the wellbeing and interests of all alien immigrants, while also engaging in a large-scale technology exchange — meaning the Men in Black have alien cars and guns at their disposal. 

The production designer on "Men in Black" was Bo Welch, best known for his work on several Tim Burton movies. Welch discussed his amazing sets for "Men in Black" (which earned an Academy Award nomination) in a 2022 oral history for Inverse, where he discussed his inspiration for his Headquarters designs, as well as the unfortunately toxic materials he used to build it.

Bo Welch said that he liked the idea of Men in Black Headquarters looking like a 1960s-era airport terminal: a huge, long building full of steel walkways and shiny columns. Specifically, he emulated the architect Eero Saarinen, known for designing a terminal at JFK. 

Thomas Duffield, the film's art director, helped construct the columns themselves, building them out of fiberglass. Duffield said that Welch was fond of how ridiculous the columns looked. As one can see from the above photo, the columns bulged outward in the middle, and came to tiny points at the top and bottom. It gave them a fun, retro-futurist look, but it's clear that they wouldn't be able to hold up a building. They were then painted with chrome and polished to a shine. 

The silver chrome paint, though, was not a healthy substance to breathe in. Welch admitted as much, saying: 

"[The columns] were probably 35 feet tall. I wanted them to look like chrome. So we had brilliant sculptor-plasterers who spun that shape out of fiberglass and foam; coated them; but then the polished metal finish involved spraying some horribly toxic metallic material onto the body of that thing. And then grinding and buffing it to perfection."

Duffield added that "Since then, they said that technique is hazardous and no one can do it anymore." New, less toxic means now need to be used to create chrome on camera. 

Sadly, Welch did not win the Oscar that year, perhaps predictably losing to "Titanic." It's a pity, as Welch has always done good work. Most recently, he served as the production designer on the second season of "Schmigadoon!" That show netted him an Emmy nomination.

We hear a lot about how artificial intelligence will change our future. It's expected to transform fields like health care, education, data analysis and transportation — and in many ways it already has.

Hundreds of small business owners and entrepreneurs gathered in Scottsdale last month to talk strategy at the Grow2025 Conference, presented by the public company Thryv, which specializes in helping the little guy.

Joe Walsh is CEO of Texas-based Thryv.

“We're a software company. We work with small businesses, help them get found by customers, help them convert that interest into a sale, and then help them nurture those customers so they come back in the future," Walsh said.

Lately, Walsh said, the AI landscape has been shifting rapidly as humans, especially young people, have become more comfortable with it. He believes it could be a game-changer for his clients.

“You know, when you have a new paradigm that shows up, whatever it is, it sort of breaks down some of the incumbent advantages and opens the playing field to go again,” Walsh said.

“There's a brand new way to play. When the internet showed up, that happened. When the advent of mobile that happened. That's happening now with AI," he added.

How it's happening depends on the business, of course.

Jennifer George is owner of Northern Arizona Roof Services in Flagstaff.

“AI is limited for us right now. We use drones. There's also programs like Eagleview or GAF Measure that uses satellites to measure the roofs and then report to us square footages and all that information. So, it is already been used in the industry," George said.

George added they also use it for appointments and other automated reminders and will soon need to implement it for just about everything.

Angela Okyere is in a similar business. She's a product manager for Phoenix-based ChimSpect, which specializes in chimney inspection software.

“I use AI every single day to organize my business and to get better at what I do," Okyere said.

It's a virtual right-hand man for her.

“For all of us, it's really easy to say, ‘help me edit this email', but that's just the very basic level of what it can do. How can you analyze my website? What do I need to change? How am I matching up with my competitors? What can I do to improve? Asking it how I can improve, I mean it's just amazing," Okyere said.

From roofs and chimneys to video production. Patrick Noone is VP of marketing at Scottsdale-based MultiMedia Communications.

“So, AI is impacting us in a variety of ways, but it's not replacing us. We're using it mostly like on technology and editing and the cameras, so our processes are getting faster and becoming more affordable," Noone said.

But he said they aren't yet replacing humans in his business, and hopefully never will.

“I'm concerned about that. There's a lot of AI that can pseudo-human people right. I don't think there's gonna be a full replacement. There's still a one to one. There's still a relationship part of it, and that's what we really focus on," Noone said.

Meanwhile, could you be soon visiting your AI dentist?

Dr. Kamran Ruintan has been working on teeth for more than 30 years in the Valley.

“It's changing every day. But right now we're just using it for appointments, for reminders, for basically advertising and marketing, but it's coming," Ruintan said.

Could AI get inside your mouth and replace your dentist?

“I hope not,” Ruintan laughs. But it will get close, I bet.”

And who better than a fortune teller to ask about the future of artificial intelligence.

Bob Stahl is a professional psychic.

“I use AI to take the information that I get from the spirits or guides or whatever you want to call that, and turn it in to blog posts or emails and that kind of thing. So I use it to save time.”

His prediction: 

“Clearly, it's going to have a bigger role in our lives and our economies and all of those places. I feel like there does need to be some sense of control on it, but I feel like there are some many other positive things about it because it has helped my business tremendously," Stahl said.

And while some say AI could end the world, Thryv's Walsh also believes the benefits will outweigh the negatives.

“I think the net positive is enormous. And obviously every good thing comes with a couple of bad things, so there are ways we'll have to guard against it and protect it and people will find some diabolical things to do with it. But I think there's a huge net positive.”

How do you make live theater feel dangerous? The jump scare is a classic horror movie trope, but  can that be adapted to the stage without a quick cut or crash zoom?

Getting audiences to bolt out of their seats was the goal set by the team behind “Paranormal Activity,” a new  play based on the popular horror franchise of the same name, which opens Thursday  at Center Theatre Group's Ahmanson Theatre. 

“To create a show featuring an undercurrent of creeping dread and the shifting sands of not quite trusting what you're seeing really spoke to me,” said director Felix Barrett  on a video call from London with writer Levi Holloway and illusion designer Chris Fisher, who recently  won  a Special Tony Award for the  illusions and technical effects  for “Stranger Things: The First Shadow.” 

 Entertainment & Arts 

‘The Hunger Games: On Stage' debuts Wednesday at a custom-built London theater designed as an interactive arena with moving seats and immersive effects, which amplify the novel's brutal themes.

The “Paranormal Activity” films famously use a found-footage style to induce chills. The first movie, in particular, Barrett said, was created “of the screen for the screen.” That inspired the play's creators to “make something that was of the theater for the theater.” Paramount, which owns the franchise, gave them free rein  with the material so there was no beat-by-beat reconstruction of one of the seven films.

The original 2007 feature film, written and directed by Oren Peli, was made for $15,000 and grossed nearly $200 million worldwide. It featured a young couple terrorized by a demon in their new home, and was seemingly cut together out of footage the husband filmed on a camcorder in the house. 

Seven films later, the play was born, and the haunting continues with a new couple in a new home. The story follows James and Lou, who have relocated from Chicago to London to escape metaphorical demons, only to discover that true hauntings aren't of places, but of people.

Fisher was delighted to find that Holloway and Barrett were open to building the set around his illusions. The writer and director had bonded over  historic literary and cinematic material that they both found  terrifying, and called upon Fisher to bring those terrors to life. 

To start, the group workshopped a handful of illusions that Fisher built, which they considered key sequences for the unfolding action and plot.

“We worked out some of these big moments — before Fly [Davis] even designed the set — to understand the infrastructure that would be needed,” Fisher explained.

Fisher was then able to dictate crucial design issues to make his illusions work, such as where a certain cupboard should be in the kitchen, the ideal position of a sofa and the framing of a window. After that, the team got to work figuring out what kind of house the haunted couple  would live in   and what neighborhood it occupied. All these details figured into Holloway's final script.

More than a decade after “The Hunger Games” hit the big screen, a theatrical play will open in London, the latest in a recent string of movie-to-stage adaptations.

The resulting set, in many ways, is the production's pièce de résistance. It's a two-story house with the front sheared off so the audience can see all the rooms at once. The key to the creeping horror lies in what remains unseen and in what viewers think they may be witnessing, for example, in one darkened bedroom upstairs while actors go about their business in the kitchen below.

The team gave itself a unique challenge in its decision to not abstract the space, said Holloway, whose horror-themed thriller “Grey House,” starring Laurie Metcalf, premiered on Broadway in 2023.

“It forced us, as story makers, to not be able to hide too much, since everything's in plain sight, which actually lends itself to the horror,” Holloway said. “Because you could rotate the set, you could abstract it, you could travel to one room at a time, but here everything exists in real time. We didn't allow ourselves the space to camouflage anything, and that in itself is its own kind of  immersion.”

Barrett knows a thing or two about immersion. As the founder and artistic director of Punchdrunk theater company, he directed a show loosely based on “Macbeth,” called “Sleep No More,” which invited audiences to roam through the McKittrick Hotel in New York City, experiencing the production in various areas and rooms at their own pace. It played more than 5,000 performances during a 14-year run.

The director said he and Holloway  have a shared attraction to tension that builds slowly and methodically, like in a turn-of-the-century Gothic horror novella — such as Arthur Machen's “The Great God Pan.”  That slow burn, with its attendant low hum of fear and anxiety, is achieved onstage largely through misdirection.

“It's always about what you don't see — the vacant, negative space of the house,” Barrett said. “You're almost tricking the audience, where they're looking at the whole picture, and you're able to seed things and tease things and make them paranoid about where they should be looking.”

That's when people begin to feel the crackle of dark energy  in the theater.

The new stage show, starring JoJo Levesque and Leslie Rodriguez Kritzer, celebrates ‘80s music and girl power in its debut at the La Jolla Playhouse.

“How do we make a doorway  become the most threatening thing in this house?” Barrett asked.

Misdirection, Fisher adds, is the basis for magic and illusion, and that is why so much of it is used in the show. Controlling the audience's gaze is key so you can focus it on one thing while another thing is happening. 

The creators have also heightened the terror with repetition. The play originally premiered at  England's Leeds Playhouse in July 2024. Earlier this year it staged its North American premiere in Chicago and it's now landing at the Ahmanson while work is being done simultaneously to open it on London's West End in December. The creators have been watching and tinkering. The ending is now quite changed, with nail-biting results, the team said.

“As time has gone on, it's been made leaner and more potent in its form,” said Holloway. “There's something chilling about building a threat inside of the mundane.”

This review contains spoilers for 'Ultimate Wolverine' #11. 

From the very first issue of Ultimate Wolverine, I knew I was in for a bloody mess. Not just because it's a Wolverine comic, but because this new Ultimate universe has made it clear it plays by its own rules—or by the Maker's, in some cases. It's been a wild and messy ride so far, and now that we know this universe is heading toward its end, Ultimate Wolverine is only ramping up towards what looks like a devastating conclusion.

In the previous issue, Wolverine and the Opposition's secret Chernobyl base was exposed to the Eurasian Republic. To eliminate them, the Rasputins sent Omega Red and a squad of soldiers, all of whom met their demise at the hands of Logan and his allies. Even with the small victory, the Opposition is once again on the back foot and at a disadvantage as they have been the entire run. With their location compromised, the team was forced to relocate to a temporary base of operations, where issue #11 picks up.

Kudos to Condon. I'm not sure how much time he knew he'd have to wrap things up before the end of his Ultimate run, but here he takes full advantage of the space he's got. He calls back to major players taken off the board, like Professor Xavier and Jean Grey, while also tying up what's left in play. Earlier in the series, we learned that the Eurasian Republic had taken Xavier's brain with plans to weaponize it (which might be the second or third time that's happened in comic history), and now they make good on that threat.

Using a device that turns Xavier's brain into a kind of psychic bomb, the Republic unleashes it on the Opposition, seemingly wiping out everyone but Wolverine in one brutal stroke. I was admittedly very hopeful in this moment, silently wishing for Logan to succeed in his attempt to stop the explosion. But as an X-Men fan, it's hard to feel truly shocked in this moment. This was essentially another mutant massacre—we've seen it plenty of times—but it still stings to watch familiar faces fall, even in an alternate universe.

Cappuccio and Valenza continue to deliver stellar work on art and colors, giving every page a distinct, gritty feel that perfectly suits the bleak setting and emotional wreckage these characters are living through. Meanwhile, Condon keeps pulling Wolverine and readers alike through a minefield of pain, loss, and rage. By the time this run ends, I'm not sure anyone will be left standing, but I can't wait to see who, if anyone, comes out on top.
