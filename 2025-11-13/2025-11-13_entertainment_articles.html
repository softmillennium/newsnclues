The future of “Poker Face” is looking like a mystery that might even puzzle Charlie Cale at first glance. IndieWire has confirmed that Peacock has opted not to renew the Rian Johnson-created mystery series after two seasons, but the show is seeking a new home. In an unexpected twist, however, Lyonne will not be returning as traveling detective/human lie detector Charlie Cale. Related Stories ‘The Beast in Me' Review: Claire Danes' Bloated Netflix Thriller Treats a Savage Story Too Timidly One Killer Scene in ‘Death by Lightning' Made the Edit Click Lyonne will remain on board as an executive producer if the show lands at another network or streaming service. “Poker Face” premiered on Peacock in 2023, with Johnson directing the first two episodes before handing things off to showrunners Nora and Lilla Zuckerman (Johnson also directed Episode 9). Season 2 ended with a dramatic finale that appeared to be setting up a major new confrontation for Cale, essentially a Moriarty to Cale's Sherlock Holmes, but it is unclear whether that story will be directly continued with Dinklage. The show saw Johnson applying the same modern touch to “Columbo”-style case-of-the-week detective stories that his “Knives Out” franchise brought to whodunnit movies. The episodic format made it easy to bring in major guest stars, with the likes of Adrien Brody, Cynthia Erivo, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ron Perlman, Giancarlo Esposito, John Mulaney, and Kumail Nanjiani making appearances during the first two seasons. “Poker Face” was one of Peacock's top performing shows, at least according to Nielsen ratings. It debuted among the Top 5 on Nielsen's Top Original streaming series when it debuted back in 2023, launching with 547 million viewing minutes logged, and that number grew from there in Week 2. Johnson's “Knives Out” series continues to hum along smoothly, with the third film “Wake Up Dead Man” earning rave reviews following its Toronto premiere ahead of its upcoming holiday release. The “Looper” director has also teased plans to direct an original sci-fi film as his next project. News of the show's cancellation and recasting plans was first reported by Deadline.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Peacock has canceled Poker Face after two seasons, but series creator Rian Johnson is looking to take the show to another outlet — and with a new lead actor. News of the cancellation comes about four months after Poker Face, starring Natasha Lyonne, concluded its second season. The second season didn't perform quite as well as the first installment in 2023, based on available ratings data, though it was among Peacock's most watched original shows and reviews remained heavily positive. It was also a fairly expensive show, however, and not produced in-house at NBCUniversal; Johnson's T-Street produces the series with independent studio MRC Television. Johnson and MRC will shop Poker Face to other outlets — but with a twist. As first reported by Deadline, Emmy winner Peter Dinklage has signed on to play Charlie. Going forward, the idea is to have a new lead actor as Charlie every two seasons — all predicated, obviously, on another outlet picking up the Columbo-inspired crime procedural. “We've been germinating this next move together since writing the season two finale,” Johnson and Lyonne said in a statement. “We love our Poker Face and this is the perfect way to keep it rolling. Give us a beat and we may just see Charlie Cale again down that open highway.” Tony Tost served as showrunner for season two of Poker Face, taking over from Nora and Lilla Zuckerman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cynthia Erivo put her body art on full display at the Singapore premiere of “Wicked: For Good” on Thursday, wearing a dramatic black Vivienne Westwood Couture gown with a sheer cutout panel that showed off a cluster of flowers tattooed on her hip. The strapless corset design was embroidered with black roses and accessorized with a matching choker and an array of Tiffany & Co. earrings. At the movie's Brazil premiere last week, the 38-year-old actress flashed a trio of heart tattoos on her sternum in a custom Jean Paul Gaultier crop top by Duran Lantink. She and co-star Ariana Grande each have an impressive collection of ink, including matching tattoos on their palms reading “For Good.” The London-born star has been working closely with stylist Jason Bolden to create a darker, more sophisticated aesthetic for the sequel's promotional appearances.

Everyone's taste for romance is a little bit different, and so while we might not balk at anyone — let alone a lush, lavish, and very sexy marketing blitz — deeming a classic story “the greatest love story of all time,” we've got to call time on something here. Whatever form Emerald Fennell's upcoming “Wuthering Heights” adaptation takes (and, knowing her work, that will definitely mean out-there, wild, sexy, and strange, compliments all), we're starting to get worried about one particular element after seeing the first full trailer for her film. But that's not all they're about, and even their most ardent fans have to recognize a baseline truth that so far has been missing from marketing for the film: they're also huge assholes. That's not even a value judgement and it's also kind of romantic, as their forbidden love only further irritates their worst qualities.

Let's hope that doesn't carry over to the final film. Billed as “a bold and original imagining of one of the greatest love stories of all time,” the film stars Margot Robbie as Cathy and Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff, whose “forbidden passion for one another turns from romantic to intoxicating in an epic tale of lust, love, and madness.” Fennell directs from her own screenplay, based on the novel “Wuthering Heights” by Emily Brontë. Fennell's film also stars Hong Chau, Shazad Latif, Alison Oliver, Martin Clunes, and Ewan Mitchell. In tandem with today's new trailer, Charli xcx has also released her new track from the film, “Chains of Love,” and shared a pre-order link for the full “Wuthering Heights” album.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The follow-up to Brat and its spinoffs is called Wuthering Heights, and it is out on February 13 via Atlantic. Below, listen to a new song from the album called “Chains of Love.” “I called Emerald and asked her what she was hoping for from my read of the script,” the British musician explained on Substack. I wanted to dive into persona, into a world that felt undeniably raw, wild, sexual, gothic, British, tortured and full of actual real sentences, punctuation and grammar. Without a cigarette or a pair of sunglasses in sight, it was all totally other from the life I was currently living. Charli XCX also wrote about how she made Wuthering Heights primarily with Finn Keane, the British producer and songwriter formerly known as Easyfun. “From the very start of our process we were discussing the Todd Hayne's documentary about The Velvet Underground and in particular this one quote from John Cale where he describes that the main sonic rule of creating songs for the band was that all things had to be both ‘elegant and brutal,'” she said. “We started to live by this description as we created songs for the Wuthering Heights album throughout most of this year. Finn came with me on tour and we rented a studio space most days.” Pitchfork may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Week 9 of “Dancing with the Stars” Season 34 also coincided with the show's 20th anniversary. It was a special night for Robert Irwin, as he performed an emotional Foxtrot to “Footprints in the Sand” by Leona Lewis in honor of his late father, Steve Irwin. The routine had been inspired by his sister, Bindi Irwin, and her dedication dance to their father when she competed on Season 21 alongside professional dance partner Derek Hough. But this wasn't Robert's only performance on the night, and his jive was so fun! Judges and fans at home were impressed with his dance alongside professional dance partner Witney Carson. This time it wasn't alongside Carson, but with Xochitl Gomez, who competed on and won Season 32 of DWTS. Irwin and Gomez performed a jive, and it was an energetic, fun routine. They won the relay over Alix Earle and Season 33 Mirrorball champ Joey Graziadei. A video of their performance was shared on the official “Dancing with the Stars” Instagram account, allowing fans to rewatch it and share their thoughts. “Robert Irwin & Xochitl Gomez and Alix Earle & Joey Graziadei dance the Jive to ‘Dance with Me Tonight' by Olly Murs. The comment section has been flooded with excited fans' reactions. “Ughhh i love Robert and Xochitl so much!!! Other reactions include, “Robert and Xochitl were soooo good!! !,” “robert and xochitl KILLED IT. and Robert is such a natural with the Jive!” The performance was a more playful part of the evening compared to Irwin's beautiful but emotional Foxtrot, and he had previously shared a look into his bond with Gomez. In a video posted on Instagram on November 11, the pair shared a hilarious skit as Irwin mimed to a voiceover. The clip didn't highlight their dance abilities, but it did show they both have a great sense of humor. “My dance knowledge has reached a new high with a mirrorball winner in the rehearsal room! I'm gonna miss all these funny videos after u win,” a fan wrote. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Macedo shared that Avila “passed away after a long illness,” though no additional details were released. During his years with ABC, Avila served as a senior correspondent based in Los Angeles, where he covered justice, major national stories, and high-impact consumer investigations. His work was known for its clarity, urgency, and ability to break complex stories under intense deadlines. He covered a wide range of stories with what Macedo described as “depth and fairness.” She also noted that Avila faced significant health battles in recent years and handled them “with courage,” including undergoing a kidney transplant donated by his brother. ABC News president Almin Karamehmedovic honored Avila in a statement published by People, saying, “We send our heartfelt condolences to his family, including his three children, Jamie, Jenny, and Evan, and we thank him for his many contributions and unwavering commitment to seeking out the truth.” Avila's colleagues remember him not only as a seasoned journalist but as a mentor and friend who never wavered in his commitment to accuracy and fairness. They recall a reporter who stayed calm under pressure, chased the truth with relentless focus, and cared deeply about telling stories that made a difference.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an interview with Empire magazine about the second season of Fallout, which premieres December 17 on Prime Video, Ella Purnell said Lucy and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins) are “trying to influence each other and see who's going to rub off on whom.” She teased: “Is the Ghoul going to become good? Or are they going to be somewhere in the middle?” In the new trailer for season two, Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton) complains that it's easy for Lucy to be good, growing up in “some cozy little impenetrable home,” where you “wouldn't have to steal and stab and fib all the goddamn time just to get by.” But of course good and bad isn't all that black and white in the world of Fallout. Is it true, as Lucy proposed, that how people conduct themselves matters? Speaking with Forbes, Goggins opined that the latest installment is a mashup of “Indiana Jones meets Doctor Strangelove meets the Star Wars [Cantina], and so far it's surpassed my expectations.” He said, “I've been around, so I understand the arcs of seasons and understand if Season 1 catches fire, Season 2 should be better … That's when you're really hitting your stride. The critics will have their point of view or whatever, but I can tell you from my perspective, we've hit our stride and we're telling this story in such a subversive way that it's so fun to watch with real consequences.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cynthia Erivo reacted quicker than the crew of security guards surrounding them, shoving the man away from her co-star and checking that she wasn't hurt. The attacker was quickly identified as Johnson Wen, a self-proclaimed “stage invader” who lives in Australia and goes by the handle Pyjama Man. Cynthia doing a better job at protecting Ariana than the security guards 😭 pic.twitter.com/Ts1p9kOUQQ Grande was Wen's latest target, but there seems to be an additional layer of delusion and fanaticism that fueled this particular encounter. In an Instagram post, he shared a video that captured him running up to Grande — who appeared visibly frightened — and jumping up and down while gripping her shoulders. Wen removed his shoes before rushing Grande, wearing only white socks, a T-shirt, and shorts. A rep for Grande did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment, though her publicist was by her side during the incident. Wen has restricted comments on his Instagram post about the incident. Fans have swarmed the comment sections of his previous posts, which also include instances of general public disruption in libraries, food courts, and public transportation.

No matter how upset or disappointed you are, please please do not wish danger on us or assume that we didn't try.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Video has released a new Season 2 trailer for Fallout that finds Lucy (Ella Purnell) and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins) on the hunt for her father in New Vegas. “What exactly do you plan on doing once we find your daddy?,” the Ghoul (Goggins) asks Lucy (Purnell). “Gonna bring him to justice,” Lucy replies. And they don't give up hope.” At one point, the Ghoul acknowledges that he's wastelanded for 200 years and has kept himself alive for one reason. We then hear an ominious voiceover in response. “Well then, you're gonna need friends. Based on the video game from Bethesda Game Studios, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have. Two-hundred years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind—and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them. Fallout is produced by Kilter Films, with executive producers Nolan, Joy and Athena Wickham. Amazon MGM Studios and Kilter Films produce in association with Bethesda Game Studios and Bethesda Softworks. Season 2 of Fallout premieres Dec. 17 on Prime Video.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 98th annual Academy Awards are set to take place on March 15. When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reveals its Academy Award shortlists in 10 categories on Dec. 16, it will constitute an early holiday present for the creators of 15 original songs and 20 original scores. Another round of voting will follow, preceding the nominations announcement on Jan. 22, 2026. A final round of voting will then occur before the 98th annual Oscars telecast on March 15. Three top contenders for best original song — “Golden” from KPop Demon Hunters, “Lose My Mind” from F1: The Movie and “Dying To Live” from Billy Idol Should Be Dead — are each the work of five co-writers. The academy will award no more than four Oscars in this category. Should any of those songs win, the songwriters must share a single statuette. “Dream As One”Miley Cyrus, Andrew Wyatt, Mark Ronson, Simon FranglenAvatar: Fire and Ash, 20th Century Studios Wyatt and Ronson won in this category in 2019 for co-writing “Shallow” from A Star Is Born with Lady Gaga and Anthony Rossomando. They received a second nod in 2024 for “I'm Just Ken” from Barbie. Billy Idol Should Be Dead was directed by Jonas Åkerlund, who has helmed concert and documentary films by such A-listers as Madonna, Paul McCartney, Beyoncé & Jay-Z and Taylor Swift. Gibson, who died of ovarian cancer in July, would be the first person to be posthumously nominated in this category since Howard Ashman, who received four nods (including one win) in the two years following his 1991 death. Carlile was nominated in this category at the 2025 ceremony for co-writing “Never Too Late” from Elton John: Never Too Late. “Just Keep Watching”Tate McRae, Tyler Spry, Ryan Tedder, Amy AllenF1: The Movie, Apple Original Films Could she earn her first Oscar nomination in early 2026? Tedder has three album of the year Grammys for his work with Adele and Taylor Swift. Spry is known for his credits with artists such as OneRepublic and McRae. “Lose My Mind”Grant Boutin, Ryan Tedder, Amala Zandile Dlamini, Caleb Toliver, Hans ZimmerF1: The Movie, Apple Original Films If “Lose My Mind” is nominated, it will mark Zimmer's first nod in this category. He has received 12 nominations (and won twice) in scoring categories. Highest 2 Lowest, directed by Spike Lee, is an English-language remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1963 Japanese film, High and Low. The movie stars Denzel Washington, Jeffrey Wright, A$AP Rocky, LaChanze, Princess Nokia and Ice Spice (in her film debut). “Golden”EJAE, Mark Sonnenblick, IDO, 24, TeddyKPop Demon Hunters, Netflix 1 since Justin Timberlake's “Can't Stop the Feeling!” from Trolls in 2017 to rule the chart and then land an Oscar nod. EJAE, IDO, 24 and Teddy would be the first South Korean-born songwriters to be nominated since Karen O, who was cited in 2014 for co-writing “The Moon Song” from Her. Earlier this year, Warren tied Sammy Cahn's record of earning a best original song nomination for eight consecutive years. It would be her 17th nomination in the category, a total surpassed only by Cahn (26) and Johnny Mercer (18). Moreover, it would be her 13th nod as a solitary songwriter, tying Randy Newman for the most solo-written nominated songs. “I Lied to You”Raphael Saadiq, Ludwig GöranssonSinners, Warner Bros. Pictures Ryan Coogler produced, wrote and directed Sinners, which was No. 1 at the box office for two weeks in April. The last two films that Coogler wrote and directed — Black Panther and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever — both spawned best original song nominees. “Last Time (I Seen the Sun)”Alice Smith, Miles CatonSinners, Warner Bros. Pictures Caton, who turned 20 in March, would be the youngest nominee for best original song since Billie Eilish, who was just six weeks past her 20th birthday in 2022 when she was nominated for co-writing the title song to No Time To Die (which won). Cave is vying to become the third songwriter from Australia to be nominated in this category, following John Farrar (for writing “Hopelessly Devoted to You” from Grease) and Peter Allen (for co-writing “Arthur's Theme [Best That You Can Do]” from Arthur, which won). Train Dreams stars Joel Edgerton, Felicity Jones and William H. Macy. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are submitting this as Nine Inch Nails rather than under their individual names. If the academy keeps it that way, it would be the first nominee in this category to be listed under their group billing. He was subsequently nominated for co-writing three songs from ­Enchanted. Wicked: For Good is the sequel to Wicked, which received 10 nominations earlier this year, but none in this category since it didn't include any new songs. “No Place Like Home”Stephen SchwartzWicked: For Good, Universal Jon M. Chu directed both this film and its megahit predecessor. Colombian superstar Shakira is vying to become the first songwriter born in Latin America to be nominated in this category since Brazilians Sergio Mendes and Carlinhos Brown were nominated in 2012 for a song from Rio. Franglen subsequently got the assignment for that film, though his work wasn't nominated. Fendrix also scored Lanthimos' follow-up, Kinds of Kindness, though that film didn't receive any Oscar nods. The composer and director are back for a third go-round. Bugonia stars Emma Stone, who won the Oscar for best actress with Poor Things and also starred in Kinds of Kindness. Karpman was nominated in this category two years ago for scoring American Fiction. If she's nominated again, she'll join a short list of women who have received two or more nods in scoring categories, following Rachel Portman and Angela Morley. (Hildur Guðnadóttir is also hoping to make that list with Hedda.) Fantastic Four: First Steps, the 37th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, features an ensemble cast including Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Joseph Quinn. Zimmer has received 12 nominations in this category, landing at least one in each of the last five decades and winning for The Lion King and Dune. He's third on the list of living composers with the most score nominations, trailing only John Williams (who has amassed an astounding 49 in score categories) and Thomas Newman (14). Desplat has received 11 nominations for his scores, winning for The Grand Budapest Hotel in 2015 and The Shape of Water in 2018. Frankenstein was directed, written and co-produced by Guillermo del Toro, who did the honors on The Shape of Water as well as a third film that Desplat scored, Pinocchio. Frankenstein, which stars Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi and Christoph Waltz, is based on Mary Shelley's classic 1818 novel of the same name. Richter has received two Grammy nominations — best score soundtrack for visual media for Ad Astra and best music video as a featured artist on Woodkid's “The Golden Age.” In 2020, when Guðnadóttir won best original score for Joker, the Icelandic composer became just the fourth woman to capture an Oscar in a scoring category. Rachel Portman won best original musical or comedy score in 1997 for Emma. A House of Dynamite is an apocalyptic political thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow. The film's ensemble cast includes Idris Elba, Tracy Letts and Anthony Ramos. This would be Britell's fourth nomination in this category, following nods for the Barry Jenkins films Moonlight and If Beale Street Could Talk and Adam McKay's Don't Look Up. Jay Kelly is a coming-of-age comedy-­drama directed by Noah Baumbach that he co-wrote with Emily Mortimer. The film stars an ensemble cast that includes George Clooney, Adam Sandler, Laura Dern and Billy Crudup. The Lost Bus (Apple Original Films)James Newton Howard This would be Howard's eighth nod in a scoring category. Lopatin, an electronic music producer, has composed scores for such films as Good Time (2017) and Uncut Gems (2019). Marty Supreme, which stars Timothée Chalamet and Gwyneth Paltrow, is a sports comedy-drama set in New York during the 1950s. It is loosely inspired by American table tennis player Marty Reisman and his at-all-costs pursuit of greatness. Materialists, a romantic comedy-drama written and directed by Celine Song, follows a love triangle among characters played by Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal. It's Song's second feature as a writer-director following Past Lives. One Battle After Another is an action thriller written, co-produced and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. This would be the first nomination for Rani, a Polish pianist, composer and singer. The Swedish composer has scored all five of director Ryan Coogler's films — Fruitvale Station, Creed, Black Panther, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and now Sinners. Göransson also has an executive producer credit on this film, which stars Michael B. Jordan in dual roles as twin brothers. The Testament of Ann Lee (Searchlight Pictures)Daniel Blumberg This would mark the first Oscar nomination for Dessner, who has won two Grammys — best chamber music/small ensemble performance in 2016 for producing Eighth Blackbird's Filament and best alternative music album in 2018 as a band member and co-producer of The National's Sleep Well Beast. If the academy keeps it that way, Nine Inch Nails will be the third group nominated in a scoring category as such, following The Beatles, who won best original song score in 1971 for Let It Be, and Son Lux, which was nominated for best original score three years ago for Everything Everywhere All at Once. Powell and Schwartz were nominated in this category at the 2025 ceremony for Wicked. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, who were Oscar-­nominated for Wicked, reprise their roles in the sequel, as do Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Bowen Yang, ­Marissa Bode, Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 10-epsiode second run will debut globally on February 27 with the first episode, followed by one episode every Friday until May 1. The streamer also released a teaser trailer, which you can view above, and a first-look image below. Season one tracks two siblings looking to uncover their family's connection to the secretive organization known as Monarch. Clues lead them into the world of monsters and ultimately down the rabbit hole to Army officer Lee Shaw (played by Kurt Russell and Wyatt Russell), taking place in the 1950s and half a century later where Monarch is threatened by what Shaw knows. As revealed Wednesday, Kurt Russell will return as Lee Shaw in Season 2 following Season 1's finale that left his fate in limbo. The dramatic saga reveals buried secrets that reunite our heroes (and villains) on Kong's Skull Island, and a new, mysterious village where a mythical Titan rises from the sea. Anna Sawai, Kiersey Clemons, Ren Watabe, Mari Yamamoto, Joe Tippett and  Anders Holm also star. From Legendary Television, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is executive produced by Joby Harold and Tory Tunnell from Safehouse Pictures, alongside Chris Black, Jen Roskind, Matt Shakman, Andrew Colville and Lawrence Trillling, who also directs four episodes, as well as Andrew Colville, who writes two episodes and serves as executive producer. Black serves as showrunner on season two. Hiro Matsuoka and Takemasa Arita executive produce on behalf of Toho Co., Ltd., the owner of the Godzilla character.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Stiller stopped by The Tonight Show to promote his new documentary, Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost, and took the opportunity to rave about working with Ariana Grande on Focker In-Law. “It's crazy how talented she is,” Stiller told host Jimmy Fallon. Actually, I had met her before because she did a cameo in Zoolander 2 10 years ago. She was in an orgy scene we had. But I haven't seen her since the orgy. Grande recently revealed on social media that she had completed filming for her role in the upcoming Meet the Parents sequel. The fourth installment in the comedy series was announced in late May, with Grande reportedly cast as Olivia Jones, the fiancée of Ben Stiller and Teri Polo's son and “a ball-busting woman who seems all wrong for him.” Owen Wilson, Blythe Danner, and Teri Polo are all confirmed to return for Focker In-Law, with Skyler Gisondo joining the cast as Stiller's son and Grande's husband-to-be.

But we've only done 19 episodes over five and a half years on the show. I think Young Sheldon‘s done 600 episodes in that time.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

In March 2019, a Boeing 737 MAX airplane crashed just six minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. All 157 people on board died, including Max Thabiso Edkins, the director's younger brother. In a deeply moving experience, they discover that the community members who welcome them regard the crash victims as visiting guests, whom they have taken into their hearts as brothers and sisters. Their compassion contrasts starkly with the calculating stance of airplane manufacturer Boeing. Thomas Rabe Stepping Down as Bertelsmann, RTL Group CEO in 2027 The movie, a South Africa, France, Germany production, is co-produced by Carine Chichkowsky for Survivance, with cinematography courtesy of Jide Akinleminu and editing handled by Anne Fabini. Years passed, and I found it very difficult to begin working on the project. Also, no media was allowed close to the crash site, until, as a family member, and after much time spent by my father building relationships, Ethiopian Airlines finally gave us exclusive permission to film at the site in 2022.” Father and producer Don Edkins adds: “I wanted to make a film about the crash that would highlight the injustice that took so many lives. Having grown up under apartheid in South Africa, I had always looked at how documentary cinema could spotlight injustice and human rights, and how I could use activism and creativity to navigate the grief we felt.” Such pure humanity stood in stark contrast to Boeing's widely criticized actions, including the use of a flawed flight-control system and the failure to fully inform pilots about it — issues highlighted in official investigations and public reporting. They chose cost-cutting measures and prioritized profit over safety.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among its debuts is a No. Radiohead's second live album, Hail to the Thief: Live Recordings 2003-2009, makes a top 10 debut across four Billboard album charts (dated Nov. 15), including a No. The set also bows at No. In the tracking week ending Nov. 6 in the United States, the album earned a little over 8,000 equivalent album units, of which essentially all were in traditional album sales (purchases of digital and physical copies of the album). Billboard's Top Album Sales chart ranks the top-selling albums of the week based only on traditional album sales. The chart's history dates back to May 25, 1991, the first week Billboard began tabulating charts with electronically monitored piece count information from SoundScan, now Luminate. Pure album sales were the sole measurement utilized by the Billboard 200 albums chart through the list dated Dec. 6, 2014, after which that chart switched to a methodology that blends album sales with track equivalent album (TEA) units and streaming equivalent album (SEA) units. Tyler, The Creator's chart-topping CHROMAKOPIA reenters at No. 2 after its one-year anniversary reissue on CD, vinyl and in two deluxe boxed sets (each containing branded merch and a copy of the CD). Grateful Dead's latest archival live set Dave's Picks, Vol. 56: Rainbow Theatre, London, England, 3/20/81 & 3/21/81 enters at No. The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack rises a spot to No. 5, while Hamilton: 10 Shots (Highlights From the Original Broadway Cast Recording) bows at No. Stray Kids' chart-topping KARMA climbs 9-7, Bob Dylan's from-the-vaults compilation Through the Open Window: The Bootleg Series, Vol. 9 and Vince Guaraldi Trio's A Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack returns to the top 10, rising 14-10.

As with so much of AI discourse, the conversations surrounding “Tilly Norwood”—the supposed “AI actress” created by tech company Xicoia, which garnered lots of not-entirely-positive headlines a few weeks back when the company started making big noises about the potential for getting their character signed by a Hollywood agency—has served as a bit of a Rorschach test. Acting unions like SAG have bristled at a technology that seems to want to replace its members' lifetimes of craft with cheap imitations; male profile writers of a certain character have lined up to salivate over “her” in the manner they once lavished on human ingenues; and others have simply pointed out how very creepy it is that the first recourse of any company trying to make waves in this sphere seems to be to create a completely compliant homunculus of the female form for users to take digital custody of.

Take, for instance, comments made recently by performer Jameela Jamil, who, per Deadline, opened up with her thoughts on the Tilly Norwood debate at the Web Summit in Lisbon this week. Jamil didn't mince words about her reaction to the Norwood character, which Xicoia—a division of tech company Particle6, created by founder Eline Van Der Velden—had featured in a few online videos, before they brought the Hollywood firestorm down on their heads. “Shame on it,” Jamil said, for “Being a teenage-looking girl who can't say no to a type of sex scene or to a sexual abuse scene, who can't advocate for herself, who can't advocate for more money. It's marked that it was a young woman, rather than a man that they came out with first and that she looks a particular way. I find the whole thing deeply disturbing.”

Jamil (who most recently appeared in theaters with a voice role in Pixar's Elio) also talked more broadly about the technology, saying she finds the whole endeavor absurd because “the whole point of acting is to emulate the human experience and so having something that is not human trying to emulate our experience is not possible.” At the same time, she expressed fear for people who work both above and below the line in film and TV production, saying, “I can't think of anything sadder than replacing these people and these departments with a computer by someone who isn't an artist.”
