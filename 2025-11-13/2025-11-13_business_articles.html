                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The hemp industry is bracing for layoffs, production reductions and billions in lost revenue after Congress passed a government funding bill late Wednesday containing a surprise provision that will ban nearly all hemp-derived consumer products. Hemp, a derivative of the cannabis plant, was legalized in the 2018 Farm Bill for industrial uses like rope, textiles and seed. But the law's broad definition created a loophole in federal rules on THC — the psychoactive compound responsible for a high — experts said, allowing producers to extract psychoactive cannabinoids from federally legal hemp. Companies used that opening to flood the market with gummies, drinks and vapes capable of delivering a marijuana-like high. The new ban, tucked into legislation ending the longest shutdown in history, outlaws products containing more than 0.4 milligrams of total THC per container. Industry executives said that threshold will wipe out 95% of the $28 billion hemp retail market when it takes effect in a year. For reference, a single hemp gummy typically contains 2.5 to 10 milligrams of THC, according to the Journal of Cannabis Research. The new cap replaces the 2018 Farm Bill's definition of hemp, which was based on THC concentration and allowed products with less than 0.3% THC by weight instead of total amount. "We have a year to figure this out but in the meantime you could see losses across the industry if we can't," Miller said. More than 300,000 jobs tied to the hemp economy are at risk, according to Whitney Economics, a hemp and cannabis research firm, from farmers and extractors to manufacturers, logistics firms and retailers. The ripple effects could hit land use, contracted acreage and equipment financing, as farmers who scaled up hemp cultivation after 2018 could suddenly face canceled or restructured contracts, said Michael Gorenstein, CEO of marijuana producer Cronos Group. States with the biggest hemp infrastructure like Kentucky, Texas and Utah are likely to face the steepest economic fallout, hemp executives said. "There's a lot of the small retailers, small businesses and farmers that are relying on hemp sales to survive," Gorenstein told CNBC. The crackdown marks a dramatic reversal from 2018 when Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., championed hemp legalization to create a new national agricultural commodity and economic driver for Kentucky. But after that bill passed, the absence of federal rules allowed a patchwork market to emerge, with widespread safety issues from mislabeled and untested products to items with potency rivaling recreational marijuana, according to government officials and industry experts. "This was his [McConnell's] signature law, the hemp law, and he wanted to correct it," Boris Jordan, CEO of cannabis company Curaleaf, told CNBC. This was a request by him at the last minute." Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has sparred with his colleagues for months over hemp and blasted the provision as an overreach that is "killing jobs and crushing farmers," adding that "every hemp seed in the country will have to be destroyed." "This is the most thoughtless, ignorant proposal to an industry that I've seen in a long, long time," Paul said after the ban was passed. While leaders like Jordan said the legal market will sharply contract from a ban, they caution the consumer demand for hemp-derived THC will not. Studies have shown demand for marijuana and other THC-based products has continued rising in recent years as some consumers move away from alcohol and drink less overall. "What this ban is going to do is it's going to force all those little players right now into the illegal market," Jordan said. They [companies] aren't just going to go away, they're just going to go into the illicit market and put more people at risk." And as products move underground, law enforcement agencies could struggle to trace supply chains, Gorenstein said. "Bad actors thrive when things disappear from the formal economy," Gorenstein said. State and local governments could also lose out on millions in tax revenue tied to hemp sales, Gorenstein and Miller said. Several states use those funds to support addiction services, county budgets and public health programs. Moving forward, industry leaders argue the only durable solution is federal standards, not prohibition. Executives have also compared the current environment to the early e-cigarette boom, when products like Juul offered fruity and candy-like cartridges that spread quickly, with uneven oversight, before the FDA intervened. "Too many people have taken liberties that put the end user at risk," cannabis company Verano Holdings CEO George Archos told CNBC. "We already have members of Congress introducing regulation bills. We are pledging our support and we are working on the grassroots to get citizens activated around the issue," Miller said. Simultaneously, the Trump administration is "looking at" reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I drug — alongside heroin and LSD — to a Schedule III drug.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence startup Cursor on Thursday announced it has closed a $2.3 billion funding round at a $29.3 billion post-money valuation, nearly triple what it was worth as of its last raise in June. ET as Cursor CEO Michael Truell joins "Closing Bell: Overtime" to discuss the funding round. Watch in real time on CNBC+ or the CNBC Pro stream. Cursor built a popular AI coding tool that helps software developers generate, edit and review code. Its parent company, Anysphere, is an applied research lab that was founded in 2022. Cursor is one of just a handful of AI startups, including OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machines, that are valued at over $10 billion. Investors including Accel, Thrive Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, DST Global, Coatue, Nvidia and Google participated in its latest funding round, according to a blog post. Since the tool first launched in 2023, Cursor said it has crossed $1 billion in annualized revenue and swelled to more than 300 employees. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the company his "favorite enterprise AI service" in an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box" in October. The coding tool market has grown more crowded in recent months as it's proved to be a lucrative AI use case. Cursor competes with companies like OpenAI, Anthropic and Cognition, which acquired the AI coding startup Windsurf in July. OpenAI approached Anysphere earlier this year about potentially purchasing Cursor, but the deal failed to gain traction, as CNBC previously reported. OpenAI was also briefly in talks to acquire Windsurf before ultimately introducing its own coding tool called Codex in May. As of July, Windsurf was generating $82 million in annual recurring revenue, Cognition said in a blog post at the time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Verizon chairman Mark Bertolini said Thursday that the company's new CEO, former PayPal boss Dan Schulman, is working to revive Verizon from its period of share losses under former CEO Hans Vestberg. Bertolini, who is also the Oscar Health CEO and who was named Verizon chairman last month, told CNBC's Becky Quick on "Squawk Box" that the company needs to "do something different" as it undergoes its leadership change. "Verizon has gone from number one in market cap, bond ratings and market share to number three. And the network isn't as differentiated as it used to be, in large part because everybody's been spending money to put these 5G networks in place," Bertolini said. "So losing 30% share over the last eight years is an issue, and we have to do something different." In October, the company announced Schulman would be replacing Vestberg, who had led the company since 2018. In a statement at the time, Schulman said Verizon was at a "critical juncture" and that he believed the company had a "clear opportunity to redefine our trajectory." Schulman previously led PayPal through significant revenue growth and has served on Verizon's board of directors since 2018. Bertolini said Thursday that Schulman is evaluating underlying cost structures and other aspects of the company to ensure its success. "The Street reacted early on that there's going to be a price war; I think it's less about price war than the value of what we're offering to people through the product." Bertolini added that Schulman will be revealing his plan for turning around the company "sooner rather than later." "The board needed to act, and we acted," Bertolini said.

Meanwhile, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic announced yesterday that he will leave his position when his term expires in February. Bostic, the first Black and openly gay regional Fed president, said in a statement that he was proud of efforts "to turn the lofty goal of an economy that works for everyone into more of a reality." As drug costs in the U.S. skyrocket, a growing industry of businesses called alternative funding programs are promising patients more affordable options for accessing specialty medications — in many cases by obtaining the drugs overseas. Federal authorities are raising alarm about the legality of AFPs and the potential health risks for patients. Nicole Johnson, a special agent with the Department of Homeland Security, said AFPs are fulfilling prescriptions through "unverified" suppliers and "potentially illicit" online pharmacies. In a new investigation, CNBC traced medications traveling into the U.S. via a supply chain that's not authorized by the drug companies that make them. The investigation shows how ubiquitous these companies — which contract with employer-sponsored health plans — are becoming.

The president has denied knowing about Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls and young women and has never been charged with wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the House would vote next week on releasing files related to Epstein. — CNBC's Dan Mangan, Jeff Cox, Emily Wilkins, Sean Conlon, Lillian Rizzo, Scott Zamost, Paige Tortorelli, Melissa Lee, MacKenzie Sigalos and Spencer Kimball contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In its flagship World Energy Outlook, the Paris-based agency on Wednesday laid out a scenario in which demand for oil climbs to 113 million barrels per day by 2050, up 13% from 2024 levels. The IEA had previously estimated a peak in global fossil fuel demand before the end of this decade and said that, in order to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, there should be no new investments in coal, oil and gas projects. The concept of peak oil refers to the point at which global crude production reaches its highest point, before subsequently entering an irreversible decline. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, meanwhile, labeled the IEA's peak oil demand assumption as "nonsensical." This one assumes no new policies or regulations beyond those already in place. The agency said increasing oil demand would be primarily driven by demand for petrochemical products and jet fuel, alongside a slowdown in the growth of electric vehicles. Gregory Brew, an analyst at Eurasia Group's Energy, Climate and Resources team, said the IEA's retreat on peak oil demand signified "a major shift" from the group's position over the last five years. "The justifications offered for the shift include policy changes in the U.S., where slow EV penetration indicates robust oil [consumption], but is also tied to expected increases in petrochemical and aviation fuel in East and Southeast Asia," Brew told CNBC by email. "It's unlikely the agency is adjusting based on political pressure — though there has been some of that, with the Trump administration criticizing the group's supposed bias in favor of renewable energy — and the shift reflects a broader skepticism that oil demand is set to peak any time soon," he added. In an apparent thawing of tensions between two major players in the energy industry, OPEC welcomed what it described as the IEA's "rendezvous with reality." In a statement published on its website, OPEC said: "We hope that the IEA's World Energy Outlook represents a return to the fold of analysis grounded in energy realities and that we have passed the peak in the misguided notion of 'peak oil.'" In this assumption, the IEA said it expects oil demand to peak at 102 million barrels per day around 2030, before gradually declining. Global electric car sales are much stronger under this scenario compared to the CPS. The IEA said its multiple scenarios explore a range of consequences from various policy choices and should not be considered forecasts. Grant Hauber, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), said the IEA's CPS appears to be the U.S. administration "capitulation" scenario, which sees some sort of flattening of current energy market trends. CPS 'creates' enough global LNG demand to justify build-outs through 2035," Hauber said. "However, one only need look at the STEPS scenario to see how fragile that outlook is. Demand-Supply matching evaporates quickly over that same timeframe leading to LNG surplus. This occurs even with STEPS' more moderated additions of renewables, efficiency and electrification measures," he added. In all of the IEA's scenarios, the energy watchdog predicted that global temperatures will rise by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Scientists have repeatedly warned that global average temperatures must not increase by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. This threshold is recognized as a crucial long-term target because tipping points become more likely beyond this level. Lars Nitter Havro, head of energy macro at Rystad Energy, said the IEA's reintroduction of its CPS represents "a tonal shift," but shouldn't necessarily be seen as a "wholesale reversal" on peak oil.

Scion Asset Management was deregistered on Monday, according to regulatory disclosures. Burry's fund managed about $155 million for four accounts in late March, per its most recent Form ADV filing. Burry posted a screenshot of Scion's terminated status in an X post on Wednesday evening. @CNBC @WSJ @FTEach of those doodads let me sell $PLTR at $50 in 2027. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play." Burry shot to fame for predicting — and profiting from — the 2008 US housing market crash. The Scion boss rattled financial markets last week when his firm's third-quarter portfolio update revealed it owned bearish put options on two leading AI stocks, Nvidia and Palantir, as of September 30. Palantir CEO Alex Karp and Burry traded barbs after the disclosure. Karp described Scion's bets as "batshit crazy" in a televised interview, prompting Burry to retort on X that he wasn't surprised Karp "cannot crack a simple 13F." In his X post on Wednesday, Burry called out media outlets for reporting he'd bet $912 million against Palantir. He clarified that he'd purchased 50,000 put option contracts on Palantir stock, each covering 100 shares with a premium of $1.84 per share, for a total outlay of $9.2 million. Burry made a similar move in 2008 after his big short paid off. He closed Scion Capital after facing intense pressure from clients, with some demanding their money back before the housing bubble finally burst. He relaunched it as Scion Asset Management in 2013, tightly controlling its number of external clients. Burry is one of several high-profile investors who've closed their doors to outside capital. John Paulson, who along with Burry, was one of the few people to successfully short the housing bubble, converted his hedge fund into a family office in 2020. Billionaires David Tepper, who owns the Carolina Panthers and runs Appaloosa Management, and Stanley Druckenmiller, who worked with George Soros and runs Duquesne Capital, handed back external funds years ago but are still closely followed on Wall Street. Similarly, Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors has continued to be an active stock picker and prominent commentator since converting his hedge fund into a family office in 2018. The late Julian Robertson, who founded hedge fund Tiger Management, arguably grew more influential after he returned outside money and began focusing on seeding former employees and promising investors. The so-called Tiger Cub funds have spawned a generation of billionaire investors such as Chase Coleman, Andreas Halvorsen, Philippe Laffont, and more. Burry may be handing his clients their money back, but his social-media posts suggest he's not going anywhere — and may feel more liberated to say and do what he wants.</p>

Short seller Andrew Left isn't shy about publicizing his bearish bets against the hottest stocks. Now, he's unpacking his bearish thesis on targets in the quantum space. Left this week told Business Insider about why he's short Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum, stocks that are up 78% and 214% respectively in 2025. Left helped popularize short-selling in the early 2000s, publicly sharing detailed reports unpacking his bearish views on troubled companies such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which he compared to an Enron-style fraud. His bearish views on the quantum trade are mainly aimed at Rigetti, which he thinks is vulnerable to the high R&D costs associated with quantum development. "What have we learned about technology over the past four years?" Left said he once recommended Rigetti stock as a speculative play when it was trading at around $0.90 per share a few years ago, but after meeting with management, he said he's concerned about its quantum technology, specifically about its R&D spending and the stiff competition from tech titans that are investing in the space, primarily Google parent, Alphabet. Google has recently announced new developments that have been hailed as breakthroughs in the space, which could spell trouble for Rigetti and its similarly sized peers. He also flagged that Rigetti insiders have been offloading shares in recent months. Rigetti did not respond to a request for comment. While Left made it clear he thinks most quantum stocks are overvalued, there is at least one that he is bullish on in the space: Churchill Capital Corp, the blank-check partner of quantum producer Infleqtion. Left wrote in a post on X that he sees Infleqtion's business model of producing quantum technology that can be integrated into an ecosystem driven by tech giant Nvidia as a winning formula, while Rigetti's focus on building hardware that will compete with industry leaders is likely a mistake. The short-seller also dismissed the idea that the US government would be interested in an equity stake in any quantum company, adding that he doesn't see that as a likely scenario or a bullish indicator. "Donald Trump's not taking US money and bailing out CEOs that sell stock," he stated.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Back in August, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Waymo can't drive on highways because of the mix of sensors on the Alphabet company's robotaxis. Waymo's fifth-generation autonomous driving platform has five lidars, six radar sensors, and 29 cameras. "This sensor ambiguity causes increased, not decreased, risk," Musk wrote. "That's why Waymos can't drive on highways." On Wednesday, the robotaxi company began providing paid trips on major freeways in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix for select users. Musk has long been vocal about his stance against lidar — a type of sensor that shoots laser light to measure the distance to objects. While Tesla uses lidar for internal testing, Musk has said that the sensor is an expensive "crutch" that could get in the way of effectively scaling robotaxis. "Anyone relying on lidar is doomed," he said in 2019. Musk, for his part, is not making up claims about sensors providing conflicting readings of the real-world environment. During Tesla's shareholder meeting on November 6, Musk thanked the company for "paving the path" for quicker regulatory approval around robotaxis. Today, replying to an X post from Google's chief scientist, Jeff Dean, about Waymo's new highway access, Musk wrote, simply: "Congrats."</p>

In response, Ukraine warned that an estimated 1,400 people from three dozen African nations are fighting with Russian soldiers; some of them were tricked into joining. DON'T MISS THIS: Ruto seals Qatar deal to send 13,000 Kenyans for work a year after refugee scandal “I have requested President Zelensky to facilitate the release of any Kenyan in Ukrainian custody. I am grateful to His Excellency for acceding to my appeal,” Ruto said last week, after a phone call with Ukirane's head of state. "I had a productive conversation with the President of Kenya, William Ruto. We are aware of all the fraudulent methods being used and will work more closely to put an end to them,” Zelenskyy stated. In light of Ukraine's warnings, as recently reported by Reuters, Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also acknowledged that Russia is recruiting Kenyans to fight. "Recruitment exercises in Russia have reportedly expanded to include African nationals, including Kenyans," a statement by the ministry read. "Over two hundred Kenyans may have joined the Russian military... recruitment networks are still active in both Kenya and Russia," the statement said. The ministry also disclosed that Kenya's embassy in Moscow has documented injuries among some of the recruiters, who were reportedly promised up to $18,000 to cover travel, lodging, and visa expenses. Around 21 Kenyans who were being prepped to join the war were rescued during a security raid in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, in September.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has criticised US President Donald Trump for deciding to skip the upcoming G20 leaders' summit in Johannesburg, stating that boycott politics does not work and that the United States' absence is its own loss. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has strongly criticised US President Donald Trump's decision to skip the G20 leaders' summit in Johannesburg, warning that “boycott politics doesn't work.” The announcement comes amid Trump's repeated and widely discredited claims that white South Africans, particularly Afrikaners, are being persecuted, allegations that Pretoria says have no basis in fact. He asserted that “Afrikaners are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated,” adding that “no US government official will attend as long as these human rights abuses continue.” Although Trump initially planned to send Vice-President JD Vance in his stead, that decision was subsequently reversed. Before President Ramaphosa's response, South Africa had already condemned Trump's remarks and his decision to withdraw US participation as “regrettable,” emphasising that claims of white genocide are “widely discredited and unsupported by reliable evidence.” The government also reaffirmed that no white farmers have had their land confiscated without compensation. The boycott follows a reported confrontation between Ramaphosa and Trump in the Oval Office over these allegations, which have been consistently debunked by international observers, including some Afrikaner groups. Trump's tough rhetoric on African governance has intensified in recent months. Last week, he threatened Nigeria with possible military action over alleged Christian persecution in the country's northern regions, a move that strained Abuja's diplomatic efforts in Washington. Meanwhile, senior US political figures have urged Trump to prioritise domestic economic issues over foreign policy disputes, warning that such rhetoric could undermine US engagement with Africa on trade, investment, and security matters.

New York Attorney General Letitia James joined a Condé Nast union rally on Wednesday, calling on the company to reinstate four staffers who were fired after a confrontation with the company's HR head. "Let's be clear: New York is a union town," James said. "Let's also be clear: the right to organize is enshrined in our laws. These staffers had confronted Condé Nast's HR chief, Stan Duncan, about the company's decision earlier this month to fold Teen Vogue into the Vogue flagship site and lay off several of its staffers. The episode was partially captured in a widely viewed video published by TheWrap. Condé Nast said in an internal memo that it "took disciplinary action against employees who were engaged in harassing and intimidating conduct that interfered with our business operations." "Most people recognize that the misconduct exhibited by union members last week wouldn't be acceptable in any workplace," a company spokesperson said. "Their employment was terminated with cause, as they were in violation of our company policies." The Wednesday rally was organized by The NewsGuild of New York and Condé Nast Union, its unit representing around 500 people across about a dozen Condé Nast titles, including Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, and GQ, as well as Teen Vogue. Teen Vogue, which launched in 2003 as a print glossy and was scaled back to online only in 2017, has a history of political activism, and the union called the layoffs an attempt by the company to silence its cultural and political journalism. Condé Nast employees joined a companywide union in 2022 after some of its individual magazines unionized.</p>
