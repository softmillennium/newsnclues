                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a bid to become more familiar with how cryptocurrencies operate, The Czech National Bank announced on Thursday that it would invest $1 million in Bitcoin and a handful of dollar-backed stablecoins. “The aim was to test decentralised Bitcoin from the central bank's perspective and to evaluate its potential role in diversifying our reserves,” said CNB Governor Aleš Michl in a statement. The country's investment in Bitcoin comes during an up and down year for the digital currency. The Czech Republic's central bank is the first to purchase Bitcoin directly, though a handful of other countries have already made owning crypto part of their economic policy. Kazakhstan, already a major player in Bitcoin mining, in September announced its plan to create a Bitcoin sovereign wealth found. In the United States, meanwhile, President Trump announced the creation of a strategic Bitcoin this year. The CNB said that it intends to keep its currency strong and has had internal discussions about the future of payments. “It is realistic to expect that, in the future, it will be easy to use the koruna to buy tokenised Czech bonds and more besides – with one tap an espresso; with another an investment such as a bond or another asset that used to be the preserve of larger investors.” Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy | CA Notice at Collection and Privacy Notice | Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information FORTUNE is a trademark of Fortune Media IP Limited, registered in the U.S. and other countries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin says decentralized finance (DeFi) has reached a turning point, one where on-chain savings are not only viable but beginning to rival traditional banks. Speaking in a pre-recorded address at a Dromos Labs event on Wednesday, Buterin said he's “encouraged” by how far DeFi on Ethereum has come in terms of security, maturity, and usability. “We'll be seeing, I think, a growth in more and more cases of people, institutions, and all kinds of users around the world actually using this as their primary bank account,” he said. Buterin's remarks reflect a broader evolution in the sector that he believes is shifting from speculation toward stability. Ethereum-based DeFi was previously associated with high-risk lending, complex yield strategies, and frequent protocol exploits. Despite acknowledging recent breaches, including the multi-million-dollar Balancer hack earlier this month, he said smart contract security has improved substantially. Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic noted that while crypto losses in 2025 technically “dwarf” last year's, much of that figure stems from the historic Bybit hack in February, rather than DeFi's structural weaknesses. Buterin emphasized the “walkaway test,” a simple measure of DeFi safety ensuring users can always recover their funds independently. He urged developers to keep Ethereum's founding principles at the core: open-source code, interoperability, and censorship resistance. He also called on builders to design applications with both the Ethereum mainnet and Layer 2 networks in mind. With new tools such as Lighter, which has reached over 10,000 transactions per second, Buterin said scalability is improving on both L1 and L2. Buterin's optimism follows his September essay promoting “low-risk DeFi” as Ethereum's sustainable economic backbone, a form of decentralized banking that could support the network much like Google Search funds Google's ecosystem. He argued that stablecoin lending and flatcoins pegged to inflation indices or currency baskets could stabilize Ethereum's economy while preserving its values. Buterin wrote that blue-chip DeFi protocols like Aave, offering around 5% stablecoin yields, provide the low-risk finance Ethereum needs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following a recent pattern, BTC had bounced to as high as $104,000 overnight but reversed course in early U.S. hours, plunging below $100,000 in the early afternoon hours on the east coast and now lower by 1.7% over the past 24 hours. Crypto-linked equities were hit hard once more, especially miners with heavy AI infrastructure and data center exposure. The rest of the crypto equity sector also saw steep losses: Galaxy (GLXY), Bullish (BLSH), Gemini (GEMI) and Robinhood (HOOD) were all down 7%-8%. The pullback underscores a trend that's defined crypto markets in recent weeks: persistent weakness during U.S. hours, coinciding with cooling expectations of a December rate cut from the Federal Reserve. "Crypto is closely linked to macro-economics now more than anytime in the past," said Paul Howard, senior director at trading firm Wincent. With markets now pricing in roughly 50/50 odds for a 25 basis points rate cut next month, Howard expects BTC to stay muted near current levels for the remainder of the year. "My sense is with just six weeks left, we've seen the all-time highs for 2025," he said. Investors love to decry government deficits, but often lost in that attitude is the asset-boosting liquidity sloshing around in markets thanks to those deficits. Market-watcher Mel Mattison noted that the federal government actually ran a $198 billion fiscal surplus in September. The October data is coming later today and likely to show an even greater surplus given much of D.C. was shut down for the entire month. "We have had one of the driest periods for fiscal liquidity in months if not years," said Mattison on Thursday. "The [Trump administration] is going to unleash a tsunami of fiscal largess in coming quarters. The next couple of weeks could remain choppy, Mattison continued, but as liquidity returns, so should upward price action.

This article is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice. Since launching last year, it has positioned itself as a truly multichain-ready wallet, already connecting users across dozens of networks. This means one wallet has already surpassed MetaMask on two major fronts: multichain capability and ecosystem tokenization. And because of the native token, Best Wallet also unlocks several user advantages that MetaMask can't yet match, such as competitive swap rates, higher staking yields, and the upcoming rollout of gas token-free transactions. For a wallet that's already overtaken MetaMask in innovation and functionality, the launch of its native token could easily draw in crowds of traders across major exchanges. After years of being known as an Ethereum-only wallet, MetaMask has finally taken a major step toward true interoperability. With this update, users can now switch seamlessly between blockchains, making cross-network activity simpler and more efficient. After months of testing, feedback, and late-night chain-switching, Multichain Accounts are now live in @MetaMask! Make sure you're on the latest version of MetaMask and try it out today. But while MetaMask is only now catching up to the multichain movement, Best Wallet has been engineered for it since launch. Users with Bitcoin, Solana, or other non-EVM addresses can already manage their assets directly within the Best Wallet app. What truly separates Best Wallet, however, is that it pairs this multichain accessibility with industry-leading security architecture. As a non-custodial wallet, it employs Fireblocks' MPC-CMP technology, which divides private keys into encrypted shards stored across independent entities, eliminating any single point of failure. On top of that, two-factor authentication (2FA) and biometric verification further protect user accounts, while the upcoming Advanced Anti-Fraud Protection system will proactively identify and block malicious activity. In short, Best Wallet doesn't just enable multichain access; it also makes cross-chain interoperability secure. As mentioned earlier, another area where Best Wallet has already overtaken MetaMask is in launching its own native token. Back in September, Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin hinted that a MetaMask token could arrive “sooner than expected,” suggesting it would play a role in decentralizing aspects of the MetaMask platform. Consensys CEO Joe Lubin says the MetaMask token is coming and may arrive 'sooner than you would expect' pic.twitter.com/FQXL6PbS08 It unlocks lower transaction costs, which will become even more relevant when the platform launches its upcoming derivatives trading feature, complementing its in-app decentralized exchange (DEX). This means users won't need to hold each network's native token (such as ETH or BNB) to pay for gas fees, but instead, transactions can be settled directly using BEST, making cross-chain activity more straightforward and cost-efficient. Additionally, BEST will play a central role in the platform's upcoming rewards hub, as well as in reducing transaction costs for Best Card – a soon-to-launch debit card that connects the wallet to real-world payments, allowing users to make purchases directly using their crypto holdings. And finally, one key feature that explains why Best Wallet has quickly become one of the most used applications in Web3, boasting over 500,000 registered users, with 50% active monthly, is its Upcoming Tokens feature. This built-in tool helps users discover the most promising new crypto projects before their tokens launch on exchanges, giving early investors a rare opportunity to secure tokens at presale prices – just as they can now with BEST itself. 1️⃣ See what's trending before the crowd2️⃣ Learn about each project with in-app info3️⃣ Buy and track your tokens all in one place Several of the projects highlighted by Upcoming Tokens have already delivered impressive returns. Currently, it is spotlighting two new high-potential projects: PepeNode (PEPENODE), the first mine-to-earn crypto game, and Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), known as Bitcoin's fastest Layer-2 chain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin, Ethereum ETF Operator Grayscale Files to Go Public in US Crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments has announced plans to go public. In a Thursday statement, the firm said it had filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed initial public offering of its stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Grayscale Investments first signaled plans in July that it was hoping to go public by filing a draft registration statement with the SEC. The firm operates popular spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the United States, along with trusts for a variety of other assets. The firm manages around $35 billion in assets, making it one of the biggest crypto asset managers, and is a unit of Digital Currency Group. A number of top crypto companies have gone public this year—or announced plans to do so. Crypto exchange Gemini, stablecoin issuer Circle, and institutional investor platform Bullish all debuted on U.S. stock exchanges in 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China has intensified its campaign against stablecoins, warning that they pose a threat to global financial stability. The crackdown has left many wondering what comes next for borderless payments. While regulators are moving in one direction, investors are looking elsewhere, and a new name in the cross-border payment industry, Digitap ($TAP), is quietly becoming one of the most talked-about crypto presales this November. Today, their combined market value is approximately $300 billion, and they process trillions of dollars in transactions annually. But China's central bank now says that success comes at a cost. Governor Pan Gongsheng stated that stablecoins amplify weaknesses in the global system and fail to meet basic standards such as anti-money laundering and customer verification. He also warned that they undermine smaller economies by relying heavily on the U.S. dollar. From Washington to Brussels, regulators are demanding stricter rules. Stablecoins remain convenient, but they are also becoming a target for manipulation. Investors who once relied on them for cross-border transfers are starting to explore alternatives that can match their speed and reach without the same regulatory headaches. That search for a next-generation solution has put Digitap in the spotlight. The project combines real-world spending, global accessibility, and privacy in one platform. At the center of it all is the Digitap Card, a Visa co-branded product that allows users to pay with cryptocurrency just as easily as with cash. New users can set up an account and receive a virtual card in minutes, with no mandatory KYC. Transactions stay private, and funds are held in regulated offshore accounts for extra security. Digitap's approach solves what stablecoins currently struggle with: it delivers fast, compliant payments while giving users complete control, privacy, and security over their money. Digitap's growth is already reflected in its ongoing presale. The $TAP token is built on Ethereum with a fixed supply of two billion. It uses a deflationary system that automatically buys back and burns tokens, reducing circulation as the platform expands. This mix of scarcity, yield, and real utility is rare in early-stage crypto projects. For many investors watching the market for the best crypto to buy now, Digitap stands out as a presale that already delivers a working product. China's stablecoin crackdown highlights the fragility of private digital currencies that rely on centralized issuers and shifting regulations. Its real-time transactions, sub-1% fees, and deflationary token model position it as a credible alternative for both crypto users and global freelancers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a malicious Chrome extension that poses as a legitimate Ethereum wallet but harbors functionality to exfiltrate users' seed phrases. "Marketed as a simple, secure Ethereum (ETH) wallet, it contains a backdoor that exfiltrates seed phrases by encoding them into Sui addresses and broadcasting microtransactions from a threat actor-controlled Sui wallet," Socket security researcher Kirill Boychenko said. Specifically, the malware present within the browser add-on is designed to steal wallet mnemonic phrases by encoding them as fake Sui wallet addresses and then using micro-transactions to send 0.000001 SUI to those wallets from a hard-coded threat actor-controlled wallet. "This extension steals wallet seed phrases by encoding them as fake Sui addresses and sending micro-transactions to them from an attacker-controlled wallet, allowing the attacker to monitor the blockchain, decode the addresses back to seed phrases, and drain victims' funds," Koi Security notes in an analysis. Defenders are recommended to scan extensions for mnemonic encoders, synthetic address generators, and hard-coded seed phrases, as well as block those that write on the chain during wallet import or creation. "This technique lets threat actors switch chains and RPC endpoints with little effort, so detections that rely on domains, URLs, or specific extension IDs will miss it," Boychenko said. "Treat unexpected blockchain RPC calls from the browser as high signal, especially when the product claims to be single chain."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced that it conducted the first live transaction using its wholesale CBDC (wCBDC). This involved using the wCBDC for overnight interbank lending with DBS, OCBC and UOB participating in the test. Plans for the wholesale CBDC were announced last year in order to support the settlement of tokenized assets. In addition to the wholesale CBDC, the SGD testnet supports atomic settlement of cash and securities and programmable transactions. While MAS announced plans for the distributed ledger SGD testnet a year ago, it also ran  wholesale CBDC tests in 2023. At that time the wCBDC was used as part of tokenized deposit trials. MAS was amongst the first central banks to conduct extensive CBDC research, both retail and wholesale as part of Project Ubin, which commenced nine years ago.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are falling, but altcoin ETFs are rising, with investors and even small traders looking for undervalued altcoins with growth potential. For example, Uniswap became a trending topic this week, on news that it will update its economic model, and the price surged 50%. But the top altcoin pick for 2026 is DeepSnitch AI. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF trading in the US registered its second consecutive week of losses with $1.17 billion in outflows. According to CoinShares, this would be one of the worst weeks of the year, but that's not necessarily bad news. On the other hand, altcoin funds registered positive numbers, with Solana receiving $118 million last week and already totaling $2.1 billion in nine weeks. This is a sign that investors are not necessarily worried about the current market situation or about the price of Bitcoin falling to retest $105,000. In fact, it shows that with BTC trading sideways, they are looking for assets that offer better upside opportunities, like promising low-cap crypto projects and presales. DeepSnitch AI is still in presale, but its team has been demonstrating its commitment to the project every week. DeepSnitch AI will bring five AI agents that will monitor several on-chain activities, such as market news, trending coins, whale moves, insider wallets, liquid pools, rug pulls, and more. All this on-chain information will be processed and sent in real time, directly to users' Telegram channels. This will allow traders to receive high-level information in real time, enabling them to make better decisions about buying, selling, or investing. That's why DeepSnitch AI is being considered one of the most promising low-cap crypto projects. Your presale is still in stage 2, which means you can still get a cheap price for one of the top altcoin picks for 2026. All of this makes DSNT the best altcoin to invest in right now. Considering the volume and history to date, this could burn millions of tokens every month. It also creates an annual fund of 20 million UNI tokens to be used for expansion and new developments. Considering this is just the news and all this implementation is still pending, millions of tokens are expected to be burned in the next year, making Uniswap a top altcoin pick for 2026. While even the Bitcoin ETF has seen strong inflows, Solana has had nine positive weeks, with inflows totaling $2.1 billion, attracting investors who are swapping BTC for SOL in search of diversification and better upside. On November 11th, banking giant SoFi became the first bank in the US to allow customers to buy SOL directly from their banking account. This is extremely bullish, considering that SoFi Bank has over 12 million customers, and all these users will be able to buy and hold SOL within the banking app. While President Trump announced that he will pay $2,000 in global tariff dividends to every American citizen, it's possible to imagine that these 12 million SoFi customers will receive this money and could use part of it to invest in Solana. In this scenario, it's easy to imagine SOL being a top altcoin pick for 2026. SOL has been breaking records with its ETF. Uniswap has proposed a positive shift in its tokenomics, which could burn millions of UNI tokens next year. However, if you are looking for the biggest undervalued altcoin with growth potential, you should look at DeepSnitch AI. This project is still in presale, but has much more upside. Now that the network is live, early investors are proving the real potential of its technology, while seeing their investments rise by 50%. The price is rising quickly and has already jumped to $0.02244, but you can still get a cheap price considering it's an AI project designed to rise 100x in the long run. Why is DeepSnitch AI considered the best altcoin to invest in now? DeepSnitch AI combines artificial intelligence with on-chain monitoring to help traders make smarter decisions. Its network is already live, the presale has raised over $500,000, and its price has surged 50%, proving it's a promising low-cap crypto project with 100x potential. Investors point to DeepSnitch AI, Uniswap, and Solana as the top altcoin picks for 2026. These projects combine innovation, strong fundamentals, and community support for long-term growth potential. This move could burn millions of UNI tokens each month, making investors optimistic about its long-term value and performance. This article is not intended as financial advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whale.io has unveiled its Weekend Sale campaign for Crock Dentist NFTs, set to begin this Friday and run through the weekend until Monday, November 17, 2025. During this limited period and offer a 50% discount on NFT minting for Whale users, reducing the standard price from 500 USDT to 250 USDT per NFT. In late October, the first airdrop was completed, distributing approximately $5,000 worth of Solana (SOL) to NFT holders. Initially, each account could mint up to five NFTs; this limit has now been lifted following the price reaching its cap. Holders who acquired five NFTs at the initial discounted rate received approximately $85 worth of Solana (SOL) from the first airdrop, offsetting a portion of their initial cost. Crock Dentist NFTs function as access keys to recurring airdrops linked to the performance of the Crock Dentist game, developed by Whale Originals. Each NFT represents an entitlement to 0.1% of the total distribution pool, based on a fully minted collection, with holders of multiple NFTs receiving proportional allocations. Airdrops are automatically sent to compatible wallets at randomized intervals, with no action required from holders beyond maintaining NFT ownership. With minting activity accelerating and aftermarket data reflecting increased demand for larger allocations, the removal of per-account minting limits addresses a frequently raised community request. The current mint price remains at 500 USDT per NFT, with this rate scheduled to revert to its standard level on Tuesday, November 18, 2025. Whale.io continues to provide full visibility into game performance through live dashboards on its platform, showing game turnover, wager volume, and projected airdrop sizes. Crock Dentist remains active, with NFT minting currently available exclusively through whale.io during the ongoing campaign. Updates on campaign developments, airdrop distribution estimates, and participation guidelines are shared regularly via the official X account, @WhaleGames_en. The $WHALE token, which will feature in upcoming airdrops, serves multiple functions within the platform, including gameplay access, battlepass rewards, and future staking features. Additional utility for $WHALE is expected following the Token Generation Event (TGE).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market is in flux as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) face increased volatility in November 2025, but one emerging presale ICO project, Blazpay, continues to rise. Blazpay's AI-integrated ecosystem combines multichain interoperability, unified financial services, and smart automation, offering more than just a token. The presale remains live on blazpay.com, supporting seamless purchases through ETH, USDT, SOL, BNB, and BTC. With just one day left before Phase 4 begins, investor demand is accelerating rapidly, pushing Blazpay to the forefront of 2025's best presale tokens and creating growing anticipation around what could be one of the year's most talked-about AI-integrated crypto launches. Blazpay differentiates itself from traditional crypto presales by integrating AI across multiple functionalities. Its BlazAI engine powers smart trading automation, predictive analytics, and AI-based risk management tools. This AI-driven model transforms how presale tokens deliver value creating real-world use cases across decentralized finance (DeFi), staking, NFT management, and fiat conversions. For investors exploring AI crypto coins to buy, Blazpay offers a mix of scalability and innovation that sets it apart from static token projects. Blazpay's platform is designed around unified financial services that simplify how users interact with decentralized finance. Instead of switching between multiple platforms or wallets, users can manage all their crypto activities from trading and payments to staking and asset management within a single, interconnected ecosystem. This unified structure enhances efficiency, accessibility, and transparency, creating a seamless financial experience across different blockchains. Adding to this, Blazpay's conversational AI support introduces an intelligent layer of interaction. This AI-driven interface not only makes complex crypto functions easier to use but also brings personalization and automation to the forefront, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized technology. Blazpay's referral structure further enhances user participation by offering transparent, instantly withdrawable rewards. Instead of relying on delayed token-based bonuses, users can earn directly in USDT through verified transactions. The asset's short-term outlook remains volatile, with analysts warning that if support near $100,000 fails, Bitcoin could test lower levels around $74,000. Recent data from November 11, 2025, shows Bitcoin briefly hitting $107,500 before retracing, signaling intensified market fluctuations. Experts project a trading range between $105,616 and $131,208 for the month, with volatility expected to persist into December. Ethereum, currently priced near $3,447, has also seen volatility throughout the month. However, anticipation around the upcoming Fusaka mainnet upgrade in December 2025 has fueled optimism. The upgrade aims to improve Layer 2 scalability and reduce transaction costs, reinforcing Ethereum's long-term strength. Its combination of multichain flexibility, AI integration, and real-world usability makes it one of the top AI crypto coins to buy before the next major market breakout. Investors seeking innovation-driven growth rather than speculative hype are turning toward presale ICO projects like Blazpay, which merge AI-driven tools with practical blockchain utilities. By focusing on AI integration, multichain operations, and community inclusivity, Blazpay stands apart from traditional token offerings. With Phase 4 approaching and over $1.3 million raised, this presale ICO could shape the next era of decentralized finance and emerge as one of 2025's defining AI crypto coins to buy. Blazpay's presale ICO introduces an AI-powered multichain ecosystem combining DeFi utilities, gamified rewards, and a transparent referral model. It integrates AI across trading, analysis, and asset management, offering tangible value beyond token speculation. You can purchase directly through the official website, blazpay.com, using ETH, USDT, BNB, SOL, or BTC. Many analysts suggest that innovative AI-integrated projects like Blazpay could lead the next wave of growth among presale tokens in 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON — US President Donald Trump said his $300 million White House ballroom will be paid for “100% by me and some friends of mine.” The White House released a list of 37 donors, including crypto billionaires, charitable organizations, sports team owners, powerful financiers, tech and tobacco giants, media companies, longtime supporters of Republican causes, and several of the president's neighbors in Palm Beach, Florida. He added that she and her late husband Sheldon made more trips to the White House than anyone else. Other notable contributors include tech giants Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft — each of which also donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration. Their executives have met repeatedly with Trump in recent months as the administration emphasizes domestic manufacturing and AI development. Palantir Technologies, co-founded by Peter Thiel, was also said to be contributing, having secured lucrative federal contracts under the Trump administration. Additionally, major crypto firms, including Coinbase, Ripple and Tether, were featured among the donors, underscoring the industry's close alignment with Trump as his administration rolls back digital asset regulations and welcomes key crypto figures into advisory roles. The list also includes large corporations from other sectors — such as Lockheed Martin and Booz Allen Hamilton, two major defense contractors; Caterpillar and NextEra Energy, industrial and energy giants; and Union Pacific, the freight rail company whose proposed $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, which would be the largest-ever rail merger, Trump has endorsed. Individual donors include Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, oil magnate Harold Hamm, and Palm Beach entrepreneurs Edward and Shari Glazer, co-owners of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Among others, it doesn't include Carrier Group, which offered to donate an HVAC system for the ballroom, and artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia, whose CEO, Jensen Huang, publicly discussed its donation. The White House hasn't said how much each donor is giving, and almost none was willing to divulge that. Very few commented on their contributions when contacted by The Associated Press. A senior White House official said the list has grown since it was first released in October, but some companies don't want to be publicly named until required to do so by financial disclosure regulations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The charter subjects Telcoin to state regulation and backs its cryptocurrency “predominantly” with federal bonds or FDIC-insured Nebraska banks. The move turns Telcoin turning them into “stablecoins,” known as eUSD as they're tied to the U.S. dollar, in an effort to increase public confidence in — and use of — digital wallets by providing an alternative to other popular yet more volatile forms of digital currency. “For Nebraskans, stablecoins — a version of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a steady value — may soon be another payment option alongside checks, debit cards, and digital wallets," Wednesday's release from the governor states. Kelly Lammers, director of the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance, noted that the “special-purpose bank” had come together under state law. In the application advanced by Lammers in February, Telcoin said it had begun the filing process on October 2023 — two years after the Nebraska Financial Innovation Act, put forward by then-State Sen. Mike Flood, went into effect. “This special purpose bank is designed under Nebraska law to ensure the payment is always good,” Lammers said in Wednesday's release. Paul Neuner, founder and CEO of Telcoin, applauded state officials, calling the charter a “milestone.” “This charter is a milestone in the history of banking, but it also demonstrates that rural communities can play a part in emerging technologies — Norfolk, Nebraska can be at the center of the internet of money.” “We're very thankful to Governor Pillen, Congressman Flood, Director Lammers and his team for having the vision to see that this is about more than cryptocurrency. It's about the technology of money, payments, and banking — financial technology innovation right here in Nebraska,” he said in Wednesday's release.</p>
