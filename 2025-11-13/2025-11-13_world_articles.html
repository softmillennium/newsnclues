                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On my journey home, memories of my former life flooded me: the streets once beautiful, full of cars and smiling faces. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. When I finally fled from my home in Gaza City to Khan Younis in southern Gaza this September, I left behind everything that reminded me of myself. I dreamed of returning, yet I kept wondering whether there was anything left for me to stay for in this land. In the south, I felt like a stranger. If exile feels this hollow inside Gaza, what would life abroad be like? The most painful part was knowing that I was still in Gaza, yet unable to reach my own city. I dreamed of returning to a place only about 25 kilometers (15 miles) away — and yet, it felt unreachable. I became a stranger in my own land. Our area was heavily bombed, and when death began to close in from every direction, we decided to flee. The journey took 10 long hours — filled with fear, fatigue, and chaos. Everyone was running from death, yet there were no vehicles to escape in. This October, when I finally left my tent in Khan Younis and set off once again for Gaza City, the road wasn't much different. The bombings and killings continued, justified by claims that displaced people were “illegally returning” to their homes in areas like Shujaiya, where Israeli forces remain present. Since the ceasefire, at least 245 Palestinians have been killed. As I prepared myself for the journey and said goodbye to the relatives whose land in Al-Mawasi near Khan Younis had sheltered us, I felt something strange. I asked myself: How can everything change in a single moment? We had left believing Gaza would be wiped out completely — that we would never come back, that another year of war awaited us. I still remember when our neighbor, Marwan Al-Namra, told my father: “Take everything you own to the south — we will never return.” It's as if the occupation has taught us not to hold on to any place — not even the tent that had become warm and safe for us, the tent we left behind after just one month. As my father always says, “Our souls are bound to Gaza.” No matter how long or exhausting the road was, the mere idea of going back filled us with a happiness we hadn't felt in months. It wasn't physical exhaustion that broke me — after two years of war, that kind of tiredness had become part of us — but what I saw along the road. People walked in silence, carrying their belongings, worn down by the impossibility of paying for transport. Children, barely 2 years old, sat under the burning sun, their only shelter a worn-out piece of fabric. I asked myself: How can a child survive both the heat of summer and the cold of winter inside a tent? I knew, deep down, that nothing would truly change after the ceasefire. No one was speaking of rebuilding the city. And even if reconstruction began, as the driver murmured quietly, “Gaza would need at least 10 years to be rebuilt — but it will never be the same again.” As I took all of this in, memories of my former life flooded me: the streets once beautiful, filled with cars and smiling faces, people strolling for leisure or exercise with those they loved. For a moment, I stopped comparing, because I was comparing two entirely different cities: Gaza — warm by day, skies clear and bright, and by night illuminated with the soft glow of yellow lights and bustling cafés — versus today, a city that feels like a battlefield, a ghost town. I also remembered the suffering in my own neighborhood: the house I had taken refuge in for two years had no water, and some of its walls were destroyed. I asked myself: How many wars are we living through? It was a strange feeling, for how many tragedies have happened at this boundary? I passed many formerly beautiful places, like Al-Rashid Street, which was once lined with upscale restaurants overlooking the sea. An hour later, we arrived at Al-Rimal neighborhood, the neighborhood I had fled after it was heavily targeted and the Israeli army shelled the residential high-rise buildings where my neighbors and I were living. On October 28, my father tried to repair our house and block its many openings with plastic sheets to keep out the dust and debris, but his attempts at repair were repeatedly undone by the force of nearby bombardments. On October 29, despite the ceasefire, there was a severe airstrike nearby around 3 am that destroyed everything my father had managed to fix. Those who had been killed were reduced to numbers with no value. Life returned to its cruel cycle: bombardment, then ceasefire — and this is how we continue to live today. This is life in Gaza: bombardment and death, followed suddenly by the announcement of a ceasefire. It's as if we are living on land that is not ours, forced to endure everything. In Gaza, Israel is imposing collective punishment on us during its negotiations with Hamas. We are still struggling to get meat and eggs — so far, we have eaten meat only twice, and eggs not at all.

KALININGRAD, November 13. /TASS/. Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi has arrived in the Kaliningrad Region ahead of talks with Rosatom CEO Alexey Likhachev and has already left Khrabrovo Airport, an informed source told TASS.

"Rafael Grossi arrived at Khrabrovo and has now left the airport building," the source said.

The F3 6571 flight from Marseille to Kaliningrad landed at the airport at 5:34 p.m. local time (2:34 p.m. GMT).

Likhachev and Grossi are scheduled to hold talks in Kaliningrad on November 14 to discuss the situation at the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. According to the airport's online departure board, the IAEA chief is expected to leave Kaliningrad for Vienna later in the afternoon following the talks.</p>

On TikTok, the creator NewsWithLils wrote: “I'm no fashion expert but even I know Miranda Priestly wearing Valentino rockstud shoes in 2025 is a diabolical move and not in a good way.” The reaction is in line with a wider trend for online debate after the release of trailers or on-set images from films and TV that have a fashion angle. Style, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solved Strong reactions around costumes demonstrate the love of fashion in film and TV, which is something those making the shows are no doubt conscious of – so much so a preview of “wrongness” in the costumes could be deliberate and designed to get the internet talking and create more buzz before release. “When I started at Vogue in 2011, I remember Rockstuds being a familiar sight,” says Julia Hobbs, a senior contributing fashion features editor at Vogue. She suggests there is more to come with the film. “And if anyone can kickstart a shoe trend, it's Miranda Priestly.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republican Kevin Stitt commuted Tremane Wood's death sentence to life in prison for 2002 murder of Ronnie Wipf Tremane Wood, the 46-year-old death row inmate who faced execution on Thursday in Oklahoma, has had his life spared just minutes before he was set to receive a lethal injection. Kevin Stitt, the state's Republican governor, accepted the Oklahoma pardon and parole board's recommendation that Wood's sentence be commuted to life in prison without parole. It is just the second time during Stitt's nearly seven years as governor that he has granted clemency. Wood was convicted of felony murder in the stabbing death of Ronnie Wipf, a 19-year-old migrant farm worker from Montana, during a botched robbery in 2002. Wood's attorneys have not denied that he participated in the robbery but maintain that his brother, Zjaiton (“Jake”) Wood, was the one who stabbed Wipf. In issuing the pardon, Stitt said in a statement: “This action reflects the same punishment his brother received for their murder of an innocent young man and ensures a severe punishment that keeps a violent offender off the streets forever.” Stitt, who has served two terms and cannot run for re-election in 2026, has only granted clemency once during his nearly seven years as governor. Wood has been imprisoned at the Oklahoma state penitentiary in McAlester for more than 20 years. The state's pardon and parole board issued an uncommon clemency recommendation last week. Wood's attorneys had argued, among other things, that trial prosecutors did not properly reveal details of a plea agreement with a key witness. Prosecutors have painted Wood as a dangerous criminal who has continued to participate in gang activity and commit crimes while incarcerated, including buying and selling drugs, using contraband cellphones and ordering an attack on another person in the prison. “Even within the confines of maximum security prison, Tremane Wood has continued to manipulate, exploit and harm others,” the state's attorney general, Gentner Drummond, said earlier. I feel like a thousand pounds has been lifted off my shoulders”, Brendon Wood added. Brendon Wood said: “I think there needs to be possibly some precaution in place maybe even a bill that prevents last-second decisions like this … I believe that a person wholeheartedly thinking that they are about to take their last breath, and its coming down to seconds, minutes before the decision is made … I find that to be mental torture, I don't find that to be humane.” He added: “I think it is cruel and inhumane, mental torture because at that point they are trying to find their peace and find a place where they aren't going to go out in anguish.” Thank you to Governor Stitt for making the decision – the right decision – to give Tremane a chance at redemption and seeing his humanity,” she said. During testimony last week, Tremane Wood accepted responsibility for his prison misconduct and his participation in the robbery, but reiterated that he was not the one who killed Wipf. In Florida, Bryan Frederick Jennings was scheduled to die by lethal injection on Thursday. In South Carolina, Stephen Bryant was scheduled to die by firing squad on Friday.</p>

If you think that you're doing your body a favor by choosing diet soda over regular soda, new research suggests that your liver might disagree.

A study of nearly 124,000 people found that drinking just one daily serving of artificially sweetened drinks increased the risk of a liver disease known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). This condition involves fat buildup in the liver, which can cause inflammation, pain, fatigue, and loss of appetite.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Newly released documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate have once again raised questions over Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's account of his friendship with the late sex offender and his denials of the allegations of his accuser Virginia Giuffre. The former prince told Epstein and convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell “I can't take any more of this” when informed 14 years ago that a British newspaper was going to publish a story about the trio. A fresh tranche of documents provided by Epstein's estate, some of which also mentioned US President Donald Trump, was released by the US House Oversight Committee on Wednesday. “Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations,” Andrew wrote to Epstein. “I can't take any more of this my end.” I can't take any more of this.” Andrew sent his messages after he was forwarded a right-to-reply email by Epstein from the newspaper, in which, he featured in several claims. The email alleged that a woman, whose name has been redacted in the released documents, worked as a masseuse for Epstein and met and had sex with Andrew at Maxwell's London home in 2001. It alleged that the masseuse met Andrew again at Epstein's New York residence where she and another girl were directed by Maxwell to sit on his knee, and he groped them before Maxwell directed the girls to have sex with him. It also alleged that the woman was later directed to stage an orgy for Andrew and Epstein on the financier's private Caribbean island, Little St. James. The emails appear to be referring to the claims of Virginia Giuffre, who has spoken extensively about her years of being sexually trafficked, allegedly at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking in 2022 and is serving a 20-year sentence. Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Epstein who died by suicide in April, repeatedly claimed that she was forced to have sex with Andrew while underage on three occasions – in London, New York and on Little St. James. She alleged that third encounter was “an orgy” on Epstein's island with the financier and “approximately eight other girls” who “appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn't really speak English,” as detailed in her posthumous memoir. “I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,” Andrew told the BBC in a television interview in 2019. In another email exchange with a journalist in July 2011, Epstein also appeared to discuss Giuffre and the now infamous photograph of Andrew with his arm around the then-17-year-old. “Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew, as many of my employees have,” Epstein wrote. “I never misled you, this girl is a total liar,” Epstein wrote in the email. “Maybe your paper should jump on and show that (redacted)'s allegations re andrew (sic) are the same, she also accused numnerous (sic) people of having sex with her,” he added. Earlier this month, after Giuffre's memoir reignited public attention on Andrew's links to Epstein, he was officially stripped of his titles in an extraordinary move by his brother, King Charles III. Meanwhile last week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee requested Andrew answer questions as part of the panel's investigation into Epstein and his accomplices. Emails show that the pair were in contact as late as 2016 when Mandelson appeared to reference Epstein's birthday two weeks earlier. Their exchange also appears to suggest that Mandelson had cautioned Epstein to avoid Mountbatten-Windsor, with the disgraced financier writing that “you were right about staying away from Andrew.” Mandelson responds, “Yes, without Andrew it would not have gone nuclear.” It's unclear exactly what the two men are referring to. Mandelson was fired as Britain's ambassador to the US in September after Bloomberg published a trove of emails between him and Epstein which revealed the depth of their friendship. Those emails had shown that Mandelson had sent Epstein messages of support until 2010 – even after the sex offender was convicted of soliciting prostitution with a minor in Florida two years prior. But the September emails sparked a crisis for Britain's Labour government and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with many questioning why he appointed Mandelson despite concerns about his past. Following his dismissal two months ago, Mandelson said in a letter to embassy staff reported by the BBC that he continued “to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago and the plight of his victims.” CNN's Catherine Nicholls and Christian Edwards contributed to this story.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli settlers torched a mosque and sprayed it with graffiti in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, according to Palestinian authorities, the latest in a surge of increasingly brazen settler attacks against Palestinians. “The attack resulted in parts of the mosque being set on fire and defaced with racist graffiti by settler gangs, who carry out daily assaults on Islamic holy sites and citizens' properties amid a systematic escalation in both the frequency and nature of these violations,” the ministry statement said. Images showed parts of the interior damaged by fire, with a pile of charred debris scattered across the ground. Some 700,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territory the Palestinians want for a future state. Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are considered illegal according to international law. Settler attacks on Palestinians and their properties have surged this year, particularly during the olive harvest season in October and November. A United Nations report released last week found that Israeli settlers launched at least 264 attacks in October, the largest number since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006. The repeated attacks have marred this year's olive harvest. On Tuesday, dozens of Israeli settlers launched a major arson attack against an agricultural area in the northern West Bank village of Beit Lid, setting fire to a a new dairy factory and torching vehicles and tents in a nearby Bedouin community. Footage obtained by CNN showed the settlers pouring gasoline on cars and trucks before setting the vehicles alight. Dozens of Israeli settlers launch arson attack in West Bank as attacks against Palestinians surge Monjed Aljuneidi, an executive of Al-Juneidi Dairy and Food Company said the scene was “indescribable.” He recalled dozens of settlers scaling the factory fences from multiple directions. In the nearby Bedouin community of Deir Sharaf, residents told CNN at least four Palestinians were injured and required hospitalization from the attack. They said settlers beat them and killed four of their sheep. “It was terrifying, especially for the women and children…I was defensless against 100 of them…we need protection from the state” he told CNN. Israeli Police initially said it had arrested four suspects for questioning following what it called “extreme violence.” at the site. But by Wednesday evening, police said they had released three of the suspects.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ukrainian army command is threatening to kill its own soldiers who refuse to fight in Kupyansk, Vitaly Ganchev, head of the Kharkov military-civilian administration, said at a press conference in response to a question from TASS. "Of course, they are being coerced. They are told: either you go to fight, or we will abandon you there – and sometimes even bury you ourselves. We know how nationalist blocking detachments treat mobilized [Ukrainian] soldiers who refuse to fight. They did not want to fight when they were living their ordinary lives in Kharkov, Odessa, or elsewhere. And they still do not want to fight even when holding an automatic weapon," Ganchev said. He emphasized that former Ukrainian soldiers who had already surrendered to Russian forces spoke of such threats from their own commanders. Despite the risks, they lay down arms to Russian troops in hopes of saving their lives. "As soon as they turn themselves in, they are essentially liberated – freed from the oppression of their commanders. So, of course, they tell everything as it is," Ganchev added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Russian rapper Morgenshtern has been banned from entering Lithuania for 10 years after the government deemed him a potential "threat to national security." Morgenshtern had been scheduled to perform in Vilnius, the country's capital, later this month. Vilnius Mayor Valdas Benkunskas welcomed the rapper's entry ban, telling the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 13 that his city is "not a guest house for (Vladimir) Putin worshippers." "Previously, appeals were made to the awareness and responsibility of the event organizers, but it changed nothing, so it was not enough. Although Morgenshtern, whose real name is Alisher Valeyev, was sanctioned by the Russian government as a "foreign agent" in 2022, he has a history of publicly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and making questionable statements about Ukraine.In a 2019 interview with Russian journalist Yuriy Dud, Morgenshtern referred to Putin as "the man" and said it's better to "accept everything" than to fight injustice in the world. During a 2021 interview with Ukrainian journalist Dmitry Gordon, Morgenshtern refused to acknowledge that Russian-occupied Crimea is part of Ukraine and said that "as a showman" he respects how "the whole world fears Putin. "Some have praised Morgenshtern's songs post-2022 as being anti-war, but many of them, like the song "12," avoid political framing with broad statements like "He is Ukrainian, I am Russian. "News of Morgenshtern's 10-year ban from entering Lithuania comes as the European Union moves to tighten multiple-entry visa rules for Russian citizens, citing security concerns. "European governments have sounded the alarm over a growing wave of hybrid operations aimed at Ukraine's allies in the European Union and NATO, including arson, cyberattacks, infrastructure sabotage, and drone incursions.Critics of the measures caution that the crackdown on multiple-entry visas could put Russian democracy activists, independent journalists, human rights defenders, and others who dangerous work within Russia at heightened risk. However, exemptions to the tightening of visa rules may apply to humanitarian cases, family members of EU citizens, Russian citizens who are legally residing in the EU, and certain professionals.

Kyiv has previously managed to free civilian Ukrainian captives during exchanges with Moscow. Ihor Fursenko, one of the key members of the group allegedly laundering money from the scheme, was formally employed at Fire Point to save him from mobilization and allow him to travel outside of Ukraine, according to a snippet of dialogue released in the trial. Rubio also confirmed that the U.S. is not interfering in the expansion of a Hungarian nuclear power plant by a Russian company. Germany is preparing to reintroduce compulsory military service under a new model agreed by the country's main political parties during joint consultations on Nov. 13, Tagesschau reported, citing ARD's Berlin bureau. Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden have agreed on a joint arms donation intended to strengthen "air defense and support for the Ukrainian Air Force," the Danish Defense Ministry said. Explosions were reported in the Russian city of Oryol overnight as authorities simultaneously declared missile and drone threats in the region, according to local residents and Russian media.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Russian troops have encircled Pokrovsk on three sides, leaving only a roughly 15-kilometer (nine-mile) corridor for Ukrainian forces to bring in reinforcements and supplies, according to the Ukrainian open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState. In an interview with Bloomberg published Nov. 13, Zelensky admitted the situation is "very difficult," but insisted any decision to withdraw from the city was down to military commanders. "Nobody is pushing them to die for the sake of ruins," he said. "I will support our soldiers, especially commanders who are there, how they can control the situation. More than two weeks since Russian soldiers were filmed breaking into the urban area of the mining city in Donetsk Oblast en masse, the city has descended into a deep gray zone, in which the concept of territorial control is lost in a fog of chaotic movement. Three civilians were killed by a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone while fleeing fighting in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine's 77th Brigade said on Nov. 13. "Drone pilots of the 77th Brigade recorded another crime — a strike by an FPV drone on civilians who were traveling on a motorized tractor between the settlements of Zagryzove and Boguslavka, Kharkiv region. "People were trying to evacuate from the fighting area, but at that very moment, Russian forces deliberately attacked them with a drone." A Russian Su-27 crashed inside Russia on Nov. 13, according to media reports. The SHOT Telegram channel said it went down in the Republic of Karelia which borders Finland and both crew members on board were killed. Germany is preparing to reintroduce compulsory military service under a new model agreed by the country's main political parties during joint consultations on Nov. 13, Tagesschau reported, citing ARD's Berlin bureau. According to ARD, beginning in 2026, all 18-year-old men will be required to complete a mandatory questionnaire assessing their motivation and physical fitness for military duty. Ukraine carried out a series of long-range strikes on Russian military infrastructure in occupied Crimea, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and on Russian territory overnight on Nov. 13, using several types of domestically produced long-range weapons, including Flamingo and Bars missiles, Ukraine's General Staff reported. According to the report, Ukrainian Defense Forces struck "several dozen" targets as part of efforts to degrade Russia's military, logistical, and economic capabilities. "To conduct complex strikes, Ukraine employs attack UAVs, loitering munitions, and various types of missiles. The Flamingo is a domestically produced missile which was described by President Zelensky as "the most successful" missile Ukraine currently has. Russia has not taken control of Pokrovsk, but the area remains Russia's primary offensive focus, with the highest number of daily assaults and a significant concentration of Russian forces, Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 13. Syrskyi said he recently traveled to the sector to assess the progress of earlier tasks and coordinate further actions with local commanders. "Stabilizing the situation depends largely on effective coordination between command bodies and units operating in the area," he said, adding that Moscow is also attempting to use difficult and foggy weather conditions to push forward. At least three people have been killed and nine others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Nov. 13. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 102 out of the 138 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys launched by Russia overnight, according to a post from the Air Force. Thirty-six drone strikes occurred at 10 locations, the post said. The most brutal attack occurred in Kharkiv Oblast, where what preliminary reports suggest was a drone strike on a two-wheeled tractor near the village of Bohuslavka killed three people and injured one, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Other strikes on villages and towns in the region injured another four people, according to Prokudin. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces targeted another civilian with an FPV drone — a 52-year-old man in the village of Huliaipole received multiple injuries to his limbs and torso, according to Ivan Fedorov, head of the Zaporizhzhia Regional State Administration. Russia has lost around 1,155,360 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Nov. 12. The number includes 1,180 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.According to the report, Russia has also lost 23,567 (+11) armored fighting vehicles, 67,211 (+88) vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,388 (+9) artillery systems, 1,242 (+2) anti-aircraft systems, 1,540  multiple rocket launchers,  and 79, 945 (+141) drones.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China on Thursday demanded Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi retract remarks she made about how a conflict over Taiwan might prompt a military response from Japan, warning Tokyo would “bear all consequences” if she does not. Ms. Takaichi, a conservative nationalist and China hawk, became Japan's first female prime minister in October. That frostiness has since given way to outright hostility after Ms. Takaichi's comments about Taiwan, a self-ruled island over which China claims sovereignty – a stance rejected by an overwhelming majority of the Taiwanese people. While refusing to retract her remarks, Ms. Takaichi has characterized them as in-keeping with Japan's long-standing posture regarding peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and suggested she would not repeat them. “Those who start a fire will get burned by it,” the post read. He called Ms. Takaichi “an evil witch,” who has “successfully ignited a new explosion of mutual hatred between Chinese and Japanese public opinion.” Ms. Takaichi, a protege of former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe, has long been a supporter of Taiwan, and called earlier this year – before she became prime minister – for Tokyo and Taipei to “jointly address defence challenges.” While her comments did go further than Japanese leaders have in the past, Tokyo has long warned of the potential risks a conflict over Taiwan could bring to Japan. Taiwan is a former Japanese colony and Tokyo still controls several islands less than 150 kilometres from the Taiwanese coast, which have come under threat from Chinese military drills in the past, with missiles landing in Japanese waters. Japan also hosts multiple major U.S. military bases which could be targeted by China if Washington were to intervene in a conflict over Taiwan. The People's Liberation Army has also been seen testing landing barges that could potentially be used in an invasion scenario – though most analysts believe such an action is not imminent and may never be militarily feasible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A worker is seen at the new Rheinmetall artillery munitions factory in Germany this summer. Canada is in the running to headquarter a new multinational bank dedicated specifically to financing defence projects, a sea change for a sector that has traditionally been shunned by the country's financial institutions. The Defence, Security and Resilience Bank, or DSRB, is a multilateral lending institution being established by a collective of countries that includes NATO members and their Indo-Pacific allies. Mr. Murray is also the founding architect of NATO's Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, as well as its Innovation Fund. Federal budget earmarks $6.6-billion to grow defence industry with focus on emerging tech Twelve will be anchor countries, tasked with ratifying and governing the bank's founding charter and choosing the location of its headquarters. Those 12 are currently being finalized, and industry members, as well as members of the bank's development group, are lobbying Ottawa to throw its hat into the ring. Glenn Cowan, the founder and managing partner of defence-focused venture capital fund ONE9, says Canada missed out when it didn't join the 24 NATO allies establishing the NATO Innovation Fund for defence, security and resilience. Banks like this don't come around too often. A handful of institutions, including Royal Bank of Canada, JPMorgan Chase & Co., ING Group NV, Commerzbank AG and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, have already signed on to help establish the DSRB. The DSRB will be owned by member countries, but financial institutions, including Royal Bank of Canada, have signed on to help establish it.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail The bank will be owned by its member countries, which will be asked to contribute in two ways: paid-in and callable capital. Any contributions made by NATO members should count toward their commitment to spend the equivalent of 5 per cent of GDP on defence. Defence companies in Canada have come up against a wall of stigma in the past when seeking financing domestically, Mr. Reed told the industry committee. “Companies, just because they were in the defence category, were debanked,” he said, referring to the banking practice of terminating relations with a client based on perceived risk. A lot of that stigma stems from environmental, social and governance standards that do not look favourably upon financial institutions lending to defence firms. This is changing, slowly, across banks, pension funds and insurance companies, Mr. Reed said, but there's still a way to go before more credit and equity become available. Opinion: Ottawa defence procurement risks being mired in bureaucratic mess This will make it easier for banks interested in lending to a defence company to offer more loans, at better rates, with less risk. Drones, munitions, cyberinfrastructure, AI and other technologies with both civilian and military uses are among the projects the DSRB intends to finance. “Canada's capital region brings together innovation, technology and national policy. Having the DSRB anchored here would integrate finance into that triad.” Whoever lands the headquarters for the bank will have a home court advantage in terms of securing financing for their domestic defence industries, Ms. Shorey said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marco Rubio has denied claims Britain stopped intelligence sharing with the US over its strikes on “narcoboats” in the Caribbean. CNN reported on Tuesday the UK was no longer providing sensitive information because it believed the US attacks on the boats suspected of smuggling drugs to its shores are illegal. However, Mr Rubio, the US secretary of state, denied the claim following a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Canada. It was a “false story”, Mr Rubio said, adding the US had a strong partnership with the UK.According to CNN, Britain had cut off intelligence sharing a month ago because it did not want to become entangled in attacks it has deemed illegal. The UK has intelligence assets based in several of its territories in the Caribbean, and in the past has helped Washington identify drug boats so they can be intercepted by the US Coast Guard. However, British officials reportedly believed the strikes, which have killed at least 76 people, break international law and agree with an assessment by the UN's human rights chief that they amount to “extrajudicial killing”. Donald Trump's administration has faced criticism in Congress about the legal basis on which it is proceeding with the attacks, of which 19 have been publicly announced.In a memo to congressional committees, the US president signalled he was invoking sweeping wartime powers to justify the policy, which began in early September.He declared the US was in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, whose members he called “unlawful combatants”, which under international law allows countries to kill enemies who pose no immediate threat.Mr Trump has also argued the attacks are justified because each boat is laden with enough narcotics to kill 25,000 Americans. Top government officials briefed a group of congressional leaders last week on the military campaign, which is taking place in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.Democrats said they need more clarity on how the strikes are conducted and the legal justification for doing so, following claims by critics that the administration is violating both international and US law.“What we heard isn't enough. We need a lot more answers. And I am now asking for an all senators briefing on this issue,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said following the meeting.</p>
