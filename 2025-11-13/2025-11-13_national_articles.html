Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Thursday that an individual attempted to confront Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba on Wednesday night, "destroyed property in her office" and then "fled the scene.' This is unfortunately becoming a trend as radicals continue to attack law enforcement agents around the country." Our federal prosecutors, agents, and law-enforcement partners put their lives on the line every day to protect the American people, and this Department will use every legal tool available to ensure their safety and hold violent offenders fully accountable," Bondi also said. Habba said following the incident that, "I will not be intimidated by radical lunatics for doing my job." Alina Habba delivers remarks before being sworn in as the interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey in the Oval Office at the White House on March 28, 2025. The Justice Department, on its website, said, "As Acting U.S. Attorney and Special Attorney to the United States Attorney General," Habba "is responsible for overseeing all federal criminal prosecutions and the litigation of all civil matters in New Jersey in which the federal government has an interest. Donald Trump sits in the courtroom with attorneys Christopher M. Kise and Alina Habba during his civil fraud trial at New York State Supreme Court on October 17, 2023 in New York City. "Including the offices in Newark, Camden, and Trenton, Ms. Habba supervises a staff of approximately 155 federal prosecutors and approximately 130 support personnel," according to the Justice Department. President Donald Trump speaks before U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, right,  swears in Alina Habba as interim US Attorney for New Jersey, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on March 28, 2025.

Blanca Turrubiate-Simpson, who worked for the Murdaugh family for more than a decade, says one detail finally convinced her that Alex Murdaugh had murdered his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul. In an exclusive interview with People, the longtime Murdaugh employee discussed the details that led her to believe that the now disgraced South Carolina lawyer killed his wife and son in 2021. "There was no universe in which Alex could have committed these crimes," she wrote in her new memoir, "Within the House of Murdaugh: Amid a Unique Friendship – Blanca and Maggie," co-written with Mary Frances Weaver, which will be released this month. But after the June 7, 2021, killings at the Murdaughs' Moselle estate in South Carolina, small inconsistencies began to trouble her. Blanca Turrubiate-Simpson answers questions from prosecutor John Meadors during Alex Murdaugh's trial for murder at the Colleton County Courthouse on Friday, February 10, 2023. The morning after the murders, Maggie's Mercedes SUV had been parked in an unusual spot, something Turrubiate-Simpson said Maggie never did. Pajamas and a pair of underwear were laid out neatly in the laundry-room doorway, even though Maggie "never wore underwear to bed," Turrubiate-Simpson said. "I knew automatically that wasn't her," she told the outlet. She also noticed that the shirt Alex wore in a Snapchat video that day disappeared and was never seen again. Alex Murdaugh talks with his defense attorney Jim Griffin during a jury-tampering hearing at the Richland County Judicial Center, Monday, Jan. 29, 2024, in Columbia, S.C. (Andrew J. Whitaker/The Post And Courier via AP, Pool) Months later, Alex asked her if she remembered him wearing a Vineyard Vines shirt on the day of the murders. "You remember what I was wearing that day," she remembers him telling her, she writes. The question, she said, felt like an attempt to change his story from that night. "One thing was for sure," Simpson writes. Her turning point came during Alex's 2023 murder trial, when she saw police bodycam video showing a beach towel on the front seat of his car. The longtime housekeeper said she had washed, dried and folded that towel earlier that day and placed it on a high shelf in the laundry room.

Alex told police he had been sleeping in the main house at Moselle when Maggie and Paul were shot. He said he went to his parents' house in nearby Varnville to check on his father, Randolph Murdaugh, 81, who died three days after the murders. Alex said that when he returned to Moselle at 10:07 p.m., he found the bodies of his wife and son and called 911. Alex Murdaugh was convicted in March 2023 of killing his wife and son and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Miniature American flags flutter in wind gusts across the National Mall near the Capitol in Washington, Monday, Nov. 10, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — The six-week government shutdown that came to an end late Wednesday will be another drag on an economy already facing many challenges, though the full impact will take months to measure. About 1.25 million federal workers haven't been paid since Oct. 1. Roughly 10,000 flights have been cancelled since last week and disruptions will continue, the officials say, even as air traffic controllers return to work. Most of the lost economic activity will be recovered when the government reopens, as federal workers will receive back pay. But some canceled flights won't be rebooked, many canceled restaurant reservations won't be made again, and some postponed purchases will never happen. The shutdown also cut off the flow of economic data on jobs, inflation, and consumer spending, which could lead the Federal Reserve to skip what had been an expected interest rate cut at its next meeting in December. “The shutdown has been harmful to the U.S. economy and to critical data collection about employment, prices and more,” said Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a six-week shutdown will reduce growth in this year's fourth quarter by about 1.5 percentage points. That would cut growth by about half from the third quarter. The reopening should boost first-quarter growth next year by 2.2 percentage points, the CBO projected, but about $11 billion in economic activity will be permanently lost. The previous longest government shutdown, in 2018-2019, lasted 35 days but only partially shut the government because many agencies had been fully funded. This year's shutdown adds to the economy's existing challenges, which include sluggish hiring, stubbornly elevated inflation, and President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have caused uncertainty for many businesses. All told, federal workers missed about $16 billion in wages, the CBO estimates. That has meant less spending at stores, restaurants, and likely reduced holiday travel. Large purchases will probably be postponed, slowing the broader economy. Federal workers make up about 5.5% of Maryland's workforce, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Bernard Yaros, an economist at Oxford Economics, estimates they could total as many as 5.2 million, and they are not guaranteed back pay once the shutdown ends. Even as the government reopens, some of that data may not ever be reported, while other data will be delayed. As a result, the Fed may not deliver a third interest rate cut at its December meeting, which was widely expected before the shutdown. You slow down,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference late last month. Powell said the Fed's interest-rate setting committee is deeply divided over whether to reduce its key rate, partly because the economy's health is unusually cloudy right now. The government has missed two monthly jobs reports and the October inflation data, scheduled to be published Thursday, will likely never be issued. On Wednesday, Susan Collins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said that the lack of economic data is one reason she is “hesitant” to support another rate cut next month. Collins has a vote on the Fed's interest-rate setting committee. Fewer rate cuts could discourage borrowing and spending and weigh on the economy in the coming months. Airlines have scrapped more than 10,000 flights on orders from the Federal Aviation Administration, which is attempting to reduce the burden on overworked air traffic controllers who have now missed two paychecks. Even before the flight cancellations, Tourism Economics, an economic consulting firm, estimated that the shutdown would reduce travel spending by $63 million a day. Declining consumer sentiment can over time reduce spending and slow growth, though in recent years Americans have kept shopping even when their outlooks turned grim. Consumer sentiment dropped to a three-year low and close to the lowest point ever recorded last week in a survey by the University of Michigan, with pessimism over personal finances and anticipated business conditions weighing on Americans. Yaros estimates that about $800 million in new contracts were at risk of not being awarded each day of the shutdown. The shutdown delayed the payment of $8 billion in monthly SNAP food aid to 42 million recipients in November, creating a significant financial disruption for many households that likely reduced spending. It's still not clear how soon all the benefits will be paid this month, though the government says they could be paid as soon as Thursday in many states.</p>

Commercial pilot Anthony Roman joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss post-shutdown impacts on air travel, air traffic control staffing shortages and efforts to modernize the nation's aviation system. The longest government shutdown in history finally ended on Wednesday night after nearly every member of the House of Representatives raced to Washington to cast their vote. The threat of air travel delays — fueled in no small part by the fiscal standoff — as well as bad weather in parts of the country forced some lawmakers to find more unconventional routes to ensure they arrived on time. First-term Rep. Addison McDowell, R-N.C., for example, found himself carpooling more than five hours alongside House Rules Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C. — a powerful GOP lawmaker more than 50 years his senior. "It dawned on me that, for a while there, I was one of the most powerful people in America, because I had the Rules chair, who — we couldn't start the process of passing this bill until she got here," McDowell told Fox News Digital. "We had a one-seat majority, and there was two of us. So, you know, there was a lot of pressure to make sure she got here on time." Foxx's committee was responsible for preparing federal funding legislation for a House-wide vote, which it did from just before 7 p.m. Tuesday until around 2 a.m. Wednesday. "She just kind of asked, ‘Hey, would you be willing to carpool?' And I was like, ‘Yeah, not a problem at all.' He also knew that driving Foxx up earlier than most lawmakers had to be there came with sacrifices. "Neither of us got to participate in any Veterans Day events in our district, which was a real bummer. But we had an important job to do, and that was make sure our government services and our current troops are getting paid," he said. McDowell said he spent the roughly five-and-a-half-hour drive asking Foxx questions about her work and her own life, which she happily answered. Rep. Addison McDowell, then a House candidate for North Carolina, arrives ahead of a "Get Out The Vote" rally with then-former President Donald Trump in Greensboro, N.C., on March 2, 2024. "I have never had a chance to really sit down with him for a long period of time, so I really welcome the opportunity to get to know him better," Foxx said. We talked about things from my side, mostly policy issues, but I did tell him a little bit more about my background." Foxx said it was a combination of bad weather in the North Carolina mountains and concerns about flight delays that moved her to contact colleagues about driving up — until she found her schedule most aligned with McDowell's, and she drove herself to meet him before the long ride. "I have to say he's an excellent driver," Foxx said. Asked if she would do it all again, Foxx said, "In a heartbeat." Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, also opted to drive instead of fly — a trip that spanned more than 1,000 miles across 15 hours overnight. Feenstra said he and two staffers "took turns driving" through the night, stopping only for gas and arriving in Washington some time on Wednesday morning before the vote. "I had a lot of Veterans Day events. And then, once that was completed at 5 last night, we headed this way," he said. "When that's your only option, you do it. And Midwestern Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., also took to the roads, but in a different vehicle. "Democrats shut the government down over 40 days ago now. And I could not count on air travel," he told Fox News Digital. "So I talked to my wife for about five seconds and said, 'I'm getting on the motorcycle and leaving.' Van Orden, who first told The Hill of his plans, said he rode through sub-zero temperatures and had to navigate black ice on the roads. At one point, he stopped at a hotel "for four or five hours" when the environment appeared "sketchy," he said. "Someone asked me, 'Why don't you just drive a car?' "People around here don't seem to understand that the mission is more important than their personal security or comfort. And if more people in this building took their job more seriously and realized it's about the American people than not, then we will be a better country."

Kate Comey, center, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, and Troy Edwards, Jr., right, arrive with family members at federal courthouse in Alexandria, Va., Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025. U.S. District Cameron McGowan Currie didn't immediately rule from the bench but said she expects to decide by Thanksgiving on challenges to Lindsey Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The requests are part of multiprong efforts by former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James to get their cases dismissed before trial. Attorneys general do have the authority to get around that process by naming an interim U.S. attorney who can serve for 120 days, but lawyers for Comey and James note that once that period expires, the law gives federal judges of that district exclusive say over who can fill the vacancy. But that's not what happened in this instance. After then-interim U.S. attorney Erik Siebert resigned in September while facing Trump administration pressure to bring charges against Comey and James, Attorney General Pam Bondi, at Trump's public urging, installed Halligan to the role. Siebert had been appointed by Bondi in January to serve as interim U.S. attorney. Trump, a Republican, in May announced his intention to nominate him, and judges in the Eastern District unanimously agreed after his 120-day period expired that he should be retained in the role. But after the Trump administration effectively pushed him out in September, the Justice Department again opted to make an interim appointment in place of the courts, something defense lawyers say it was not empowered under the law to do. Comey has pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress, and James, a Democrat, has pleaded not guilty to mortgage fraud allegations. Their lawyers have separately argued that the prosecutions are improperly vindictive and motivated by the president's personal animus toward their clients and should therefore be dismissed. Comey, as FBI director in the early months of Trump's first term, infuriated the president through his oversight of an investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. The two have been open adversaries since, with Comey labeling Trump “unethical” and comparing him to a Mafia boss and Trump branding Comey an “untruthful slime ball” and calling for him to be punished because of the Russia investigation. James has been a frequent target of Trump's ire, especially since she won a staggering judgment against him and the Trump Organization in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Trump had committed fraud.</p>

A Maryland man who was released from jail with no bail requirement after allegedly beating up a woman went back to the victim's home and assaulted her again, according to officials. James Bowman III, 40, was arrested Nov. 7 in Waldorf, Maryland, for domestic-related assault after he allegedly punched a woman in the face and bit her hand, according to the Charles County Sheriff's Office. A district court commissioner released Bowman from the Charles County Detention Center on his own recognizance following his arrest, meaning he didn't have to post bail. Bowman was released under the condition that he doesn't abuse the woman he allegedly punched and bit. One hour after Bowman was released, authorities claim he returned to the woman's house and assaulted her as she was holding a toddler. Officials said Bowman returned to his residence, located within a townhouse community, and allegedly assaulted the victim again. Officials said Bowman's second alleged assault happened just six hours after he first was accused of hitting the woman. A Charles County Sheriff's Office truck in Maryland. Bowman was charged with assault and child abuse. A judge ordered him to be held without bond. Adam Sabes is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Baby formula manufacturer ByHeart recalled all of its products sold nationwide Tuesday. The move comes days after some batches were recalled amid an expanding outbreak of infant botulism. Stephen and Yurany Dexter hold their 4-month-old daughter, who was recently hospitalized for botulism, at their home in Flagstaff, Ariz. on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025. Yurany Dexter holds her 4-month-old daughter, who was recently hospitalized for botulism, at their home in Flagstaff, Ariz. on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025. Stephen and Yurany Dexter, of Flagstaff, Arizona, said their 4-month-old daughter, Rose, had to be flown by air ambulance to a children's hospital two hours from home and treated for several weeks this summer. Michael and Hanna Everett, of Richmond, Kentucky, said their daughter, Piper, also 4 months, was rushed to a hospital Nov. 8 with worsening symptoms of the rare and potentially deadly disease. They seek financial payment for medical bills, emotional distress and other harm. Both families said they bought the organic formula to provide what they viewed as a natural, healthier alternative to traditional baby formulas, and that they were shocked and angered by the suffering their children endured. “I wouldn't guess that a product designed for a helpless, developing human in the United States could cause something this severe,” said Stephen Dexter, 44. “She's so little and you're just helplessly watching this,” said Hanna Everett, 28. Rose Dexter and Piper Everett are among at least 15 infants in a dozen states who have been sickened in the outbreak that began in August, according to federal and state health officials. Investigations into more potential botulism cases are pending after ByHeart, the New York-based formula manufacturer, recalled all of its formula nationwide on Tuesday. At least 84 U.S. babies have been treated for infantile botulism since August, including those in the outbreak, California officials said. The company sells about 200,000 cans of formula per month. California officials confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart formula fed to an infant who fell ill contained the type of bacteria that can lead to illness. The lawsuits filed Wednesday could be the first of many legal actions against ByHeart, said Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer who represents Dexter. “This company potentially faces an existential crisis,” he said. ByHeart officials didn't respond to questions about the new lawsuits but said they would “address any legal claims in due course.” “We remain focused on ensuring that families using ByHeart products are aware of the recall and have factual information about steps they should take,” the company said in a statement. In Rose Dexter's case, she received ByHeart formula within days of her birth in July after breast milk was insufficient, her father said. “We do our best to buy something that says it's organic.” But Rose, who was healthy at birth, didn't thrive on the formula. Rose was flown by air ambulance to Phoenix Children's Hospital, where she stayed for nearly two weeks. Hanna Everett said she used ByHeart to supplement breastfeeding starting when Piper was 6 weeks old. Last weekend, Piper started showing signs of illness. Everett said she became more worried when a friend told her ByHeart had recalled two lots of its Whole Nutrition Infant Formula. Doctors immediately ordered doses of the BabyBIG medication, which had to be shipped from California, Everett said. In the meantime, Piper had to have a feeding tube and IV lines inserted. In both cases, the babies improved after receiving treatment. Rose went home in September and she no longer requires a feeding tube. They appear to be doing well on different formulas, the families said. The AP is solely responsible for all content.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Department of Government Efficiency leader Elon Musk threw his full support behind Rep. Byron Donalds's (R-FL) bid for Florida governor. Donalds has already been endorsed by President Donald Trump, but Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) has yet to make an endorsement in the race, as there's been speculation that his wife, Casey DeSantis, is weighing her own run. You certainly have my full support,” Musk posted on X Wednesday night, replying to Donalds‘s February post announcing his run. I'm proud to stand with Byron Donalds for Governor,” Baker County Sheriff Scotty Rhoden said in a statement the Donalds for Governor campaign shared with the Washington Examiner. Musk — the Tesla CEO worth $488 billion — was influential at the beginning of Trump's second administration, spearheading DOGE's fight to eliminate “waste, fraud, and abuse” during his volunteer role. Musk was also influential in the 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court elections, spending nearly $20 million in an attempt to elect conservative candidate Brad Schimel. Donalds is running in a crowded primary field to replace termed-out DeSantis, featuring Florida lawmaker Paul Renner and Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett, with DeSantis ally James Fishback expected to announce his bid in the coming days. Florida has not elected a Democrat to lead the state since 1994. The front-runner for the Democratic nomination is David Jolly, a former Republican congressman who believes “Republicans in Tallahassee have gone too far in dividing us.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump signed a government funding bill Wednesday night, ending a record 43-day shutdown that caused financial stress for federal workers who went without paychecks, stranded scores of travelers at airports and generated long lines at some food banks. President Donald Trump signed a government funding bill Wednesday night, ending a record 43-day shutdown that caused financial stress for federal workers who went without paychecks, stranded scores of travelers at airports and generated long lines at some food banks. The shutdown magnified partisan divisions in Washington as Trump took unprecedented unilateral actions — including canceling projects and trying to fire federal workers — to pressure Democrats into relenting on their demands. But Republicans said that was a separate policy fight to be held at another time. The Justice Department on Thursday sued to block new congressional district boundaries approved by California voters last week, joining a court battle that could help determine which party wins control of the U.S. House in 2026. “California's redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an emailed statement. “Governor Newsom's attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand.” California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment changing the congressional boundaries to give Democrats a shot at winning five seats now held by Republicans in next year's midterm elections. The money will go out in four separate tranches, depending on the agency, according to a senior administration official. 17: Employees at the Departments of Education, State, Interior, and Transportation, as well as those at the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, National Science Foundation, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Social Security Administration will be paid for the period from Oct. 1 to Nov. 19: Employees from the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, Treasury and the Small Business Administration will be paid for the period from Oct. 1 to Nov. 15. Voto Latino leaders said the House “chose to ignore the health crisis millions of Americans are facing” when it voted on a budget bill that they claim will jeopardize the health of Latino communities by failing to fund subsidies provided by the Affordable Care Act that make health coverage more accessible. “Latinos are already left behind when it comes to accessing health care coverage,” Voto Latino leaders said in a statement. U.S. Sen. John Fetterman had what his office says was a “ventricular fibrillation flare-up” that caused him to feel light-headed and fall during an early morning walk Thursday. He sustained minor injuries to his face and was under “routine observation” at the hospital, the office said. Fetterman, who suffered a stroke in 2022, has disclosed that he was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and a heart condition called atrial fibrillation. Funding the government is the most basic responsibility of Congress, yet it's one that lawmakers increasingly struggle to meet. It last happened in 1997, according to the Pew Research Center, and has happened only four times in the modern era. Staring down a funding deadline every Sept. 30, Congress has increasingly been forced to rely on temporary continuing resolutions — effectively keeping government funding at the same levels — while they work to finish full-year funding legislation. The rest of the government is funded at current levels through Jan. 30, creating a new deadline early next year to avoid a partial shutdown. Partisanship and polarization have made passing appropriations bills difficult. Congressional workweeks are shorter due to lawmakers mostly living outside of Washington. And the parties have deep disagreements about the size and scope of government programs that leaders often struggle to resolve. In recent decades, both parties have grown comfortable withholding support for funding legislation and forcing a shutdown to try and extract concessions from the other side. History suggests forcing a shutdown almost never works. But there seem to be few political repercussions for it, as voters move on quickly to other issues. The federal government is back but it is unclear when and if Washington, D.C., will be reimbursed for the payments it made to programs for its more needy residents while the government was shut down. Overall, it will be months before city officials know the full impact of the shutdown in terms of economics although at least budgetarily it will be a better outcome than 2024 when the city was unable to spend more than $1 billion of its own tax revenue on its budget because of action by the House. A back-and-forth series of court rulings and shifting policies from Trump's administration has led to a patchwork distribution of November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. While some states already had issued full SNAP benefits, about two-thirds of states had issued only partial benefits or none at all before the government shutdown ended late Wednesday, according to an Associated Press tally. They receive an average of around $190 monthly per person, though that doesn't necessarily cover the full cost of groceries for a regular month. ▶ Read more about the shutdown and SNAP food benefits U.S. District Cameron McGowan Currie didn't immediately rule from the bench but said she expects to decide by Thanksgiving on challenges to Lindsey Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The requests are part of multiprong efforts by former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James to get their cases dismissed before trial. Ambassador to Greece, left, meets the Archbishop of Athens and leader of Greece's Orthodox Church, Ieronymos II in Athens, Thursday, Nov 13, 2025. Kimberly Guilfoyle, the first female U.S. ambassador to Greece and a close ally of President Trump, visited the head of Greece's Orthodox Church on Thursday, telling him he was the first person she called after being nominated to her new post. Guilfoyle's visit to Archbishop Ieronymos II came just over a week after she took up her new position in Athens. A former California prosecutor and Fox News host who was once engaged to Donald Trump Jr, the 56-year-old presented her diplomatic credentials to Greece's president on Nov. 4. “It's wonderful to be here and I'm just very grateful that President Trump has blessed me with the opportunity to serve the United States here in Greece, for the relationship that we have and for that growing and blossoming going forward,” Guilfoyle said during the meeting with the 87-year-old archbishop. ▶ Read more about the ambassador's visit in Greece Medicare telehealth waivers that allow millions of older adults to get virtual health care without leaving home were restored through Jan. 30 in the government funding bill, after lapsing during the 43-day shutdown. Patients and caregivers reacted with relief — but called for more action. “We are pleased that Congress has worked together to temporarily restore the telehealth funding, but we hope they can make this a permanent part of the healthcare system,” said Martha Swick, a full-time caregiver for her husband Bill, who uses the program for speech therapy to treat his degenerative brain disease. The deal also restored funding through Jan. 30 for a Medicare program that allows some patients to receive hospital-level acute in-person care at home. A sign reading “Closed due to federal government shutdown” is seen outside the National Gallery of Art in Washington, October 6, 2025. Federal workers deemed essential, including Capitol Police officers, TSA workers and air traffic controllers, had been forced to work without pay during the shutdown. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he will not commit to bringing it up in his chamber. Some Republicans have said they're open to extending the COVID-19 pandemic-era tax credits as premiums will soar for millions of people, but they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies. Some argue the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals rather than go directly to insurance companies. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Monday that she was supportive of extending the tax credits with changes, such as new income caps. Some Democrats have signaled they could be open to that idea. Republicans said Democrats sought to use the pain generated by the shutdown to prevail in a policy dispute. Democrats said Republicans raced to pass tax breaks earlier this year that they say mostly will benefit the wealthy. But the bill before the House on Wednesday “leaves families twisting in the wind with zero guarantee there will ever, ever be a vote to extend tax credits to help everyday people pay for their health care,” said Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts. The shutdown created a cascade of troubles for many Americans. Throughout the shutdown, at least 670,000 federal employees were furloughed, while about 730,000 others were working without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. The Republican president signaled that workers going unpaid wouldn't get back pay. He threatened and then followed through on firings in a federal workforce already reeling from layoffs earlier this year. Jessica Sweet spent the federal government shutdown cutting back. To make ends meet, the Social Security claims specialist drank only one coffee a day, skipped meals, cut down on groceries and deferred paying some household bills. With the longest shutdown ever coming to a close, Sweet and hundreds of thousands of other federal workers who missed paychecks will soon get some relief. But many are left feeling that their livelihoods served as political pawns in the fight between recalcitrant lawmakers in Washington and are asking themselves whether the battle was worth their sacrifices. “It's very frustrating to go through something like this,” said Sweet, who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York. The Office of Personnel Management posted on X that federal workers are expected to be back to the grind on Thursday, with Trump signing a measure ending the record 43-day shutdown. “Federal agencies in the Washington, DC area are open. Employees are expected to begin the workday on time. Normal operating procedures are in effect,” the OPM posting says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What was once a fruit orchard would become the final resting place for thousands of fallen US service members. Years later, Wiggins would recall how soldiers under his command in the 960th Quartermaster Service Company cried as they lowered the bodies of men into their graves. Most Black soldiers were limited to non-combat roles during World War II. That's not the issue,” Wiggins' widow, Janice, told CNN. “The issue is that these are a group of men who contributed to their country, who, like almost every soldier during World War II, went through great trauma and bore that for the rest of their lives.” Janice Wiggins, who learned of the display's removal in October from two Dutch filmmakers, said her late husband would “be disappointed, but not shocked.” The ABMC, which oversees 26 permanent US military cemeteries, told CNN in a statement that the panel in question was taken down following “an internal review of interpretive content” under the agency's previous secretary, Charles Djou, and there are currently four other displays highlighting individual African American servicemembers buried at the cemetery. There was no external consultation or direction regarding its removal.” The panel, which was added to an exhibit at the cemetery's $6.7 million visitor center in 2024, was titled, “African American Servicemembers in WWII: Fighting on Two Fronts.” It described how Black service members, “despite the ongoing fight for civil rights at home during an era of racist policies” enlisted in every military branch and faced “the horrors of war.” Wiggins waited until the late 2000s to revisit the memories of his service, which he would recount to Kirkels for an oral history after learning that he was the last known Black member of his unit alive. As the Allied forces pressed on, more and more bodies of young American men arrived on trucks for Wiggins and his men to lay to rest. “There was a permanent arrival of bodies, the whole day long. “I find it difficult, even now, to read in the paper that soldiers ‘gave their lives.' … All those boys in Margraten, their lives were taken away.” “And here we all were - this group of Black Americans having to deal with these bodies of White Americans,” he said. “The stark reality was we had to bury those soldiers although we couldn't sit in the same room with them when they were alive.” For Wiggins, remembering what he saw was a painful, but necessary act. Janice Wiggins said he would often tell her that “people should know.” The contributions of Black soldiers during the war had been frequently overlooked — and in some cases lost forever. A fire at the National Personnel Records Center in 1973 destroyed millions of files. “He never ever wanted the story to be about him. He saw his story as a vehicle,” she said. Her husband, a sharecropper's son who had lied about his age to enlist in the military, became a lifelong educator and civil rights activist. Theo Bovens, a Dutch politician who leads the Black Liberators in the Netherlands project, told CNN that local and regional politicians have asked the ABMC to reinstall the panel, along with another that highlights Technician 4th Class George H. Pruitt, a Black soldier from Camden, New Jersey, who died while trying to save a fellow soldier who had fallen into a river in Germany. Janice Wiggins told CNN that the “panels were never intended to be part of a traveling exhibit or rotation” and “were intended to be a permanent part of the Visitors Center exhibits.” “The displayed panels depicted a history we must never forget, and from which we can learn a great deal—especially now, as global divisions are being increasingly magnified,” the body said. CNN's Mick Krever and Blane Bachelor contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Will JD Vance‘s vision set the GOP's course after Trump? Over the past few weeks, the American right has been fiercely debating a drama that begins with Tucker Carlson hosting an antisemitic young influencer on his podcast, and ends with a very public breakdown at the Republican Party's premier think tank. “It's previewing the bigger wars to come about what the right is about, who can be tolerated as part of the coalition, and who can't be.” Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify. One is an institution, the Heritage Foundation, a storied think tank in Washington that's over a half-century old. Second is the president of the Heritage Foundation, a guy named Kevin Roberts, who has moved it in a very populist, very Trump-aligned direction over the past few years. And then there's Tucker Carlson, a guy I've known for more than 30 years, used to be a colleague at Fox, who after being fired from Fox, has launched his own independent media thing on the web and is doing strange things. And then lastly, is this really horrible gargoyle of a human being named Nick Fuentes. (Sorry, I try very hard not to think about the guy.) He's a leader of a group of mostly alienated, angry young men that in internet parlance or in social media parlance, people tend to call “Groypers.” He has made a real impact out there for saying the most horrendous things you can say in many respects. He does not dispute being called a neo-Nazi. And so maybe because I have the most Jewy name this side of Shlomo Abramowitz, you might not be surprised that I don't feel like I can be in the same coalition as someone like a Nick Fuentes. Ultimately, this became about who is in whose camp. Very friendly, very softball interview where Carlson basically pushed back on none of Fuentes' past statements and current beliefs or anything like that. It was particularly appalling because we know that Tucker can ask hard questions. When he disagreed with Ted Cruz about the bombing of Iran, he barely let Ted get a word in edgewise and was constantly quizzing him to knock him off his game. But when he talks to a guy who says he loves Stalin and Hitler and thinks women really want to be raped and all of these sorts of things, he's like, Hmm, tell me more. You know, sort of channeling his old Barbara Walters or something like that. And so a lot of people were very cross about this at the Heritage Foundation, which advertises with Tucker Carlson. Tucker [was] the keynote speaker at their 50th anniversary gala [in 2023]. The Heritage Foundation got a lot of grief for its association with Tucker, and so Kevin Roberts came out and issued a video statement. Nobody disputes that the video statement was a complete frigging disaster. He said, “We will not disavow Tucker Carlson anyway. We are joined at the hip with Tucker Carlson.” And then he said, “And besides, we're not going to cave into a quote ‘venomous' coalition that is representing other interests.” It was this serious dog whistle that suggested that string-pulling Machiavellian Jews were behind this [controversy], and we're not going to cave into it. The video utterly backfired and caused a whole firestorm of controversy. And [Roberts] had this whole very high-minded explanation about how we shouldn't cancel people. We should engage in their ideas, and we should confront them and argue in the marketplace of ideas — which all sounds great, except that's not what Tucker Carlson had done. Kevin Roberts had an all-hands meeting at the Heritage Foundation. A big chunk of it was dedicated to warning staffers that they'll be fired if any video or audio or quotes from this meeting leak. One of the things that the video revealed was that there are people at Heritage, young people at Heritage who are not neo-Nazis, but they liked Kevin Roberts' initial statement. They've got some issues with Israel; they've got some issues with people who defend Israel. We cannot be associated with antisemites and crazy people.” Kevin Roberts did not resign, as many people wanted him to, and many people thought he was going to be fired. But he did basically throw his chief of staff under the bus. Kevin Roberts's defense was basically that he is the right-wing Ron Burgundy. So it was not a profile-in-courage moment. Part of it is just simply an argument about what kind of coalition you're going to have, but it's broader than that. One of the things that the defenders of Tucker Carlson and the defenders of the Heritage Foundation will say often — with a little more paranoia than I think is warranted — is that this is really all a proxy war about JD Vance. It is not all a proxy war about JD Vance, but JD Vance does lurk in the background here, because Vance has blazed a path here where he defended young Republican officials who have these chats about how awesome Auschwitz jokes are and how Nazis are cool. He also would not be vice president, but for the fact that Tucker Carlson lobbied extensively for him. And if Tucker becomes radioactive, that's bad for Vance. If this crowd that [Vance] has defended and considers part of his coalition is purged, that's bad for him. But I also think that, look: There are a lot of people who don't think that the right should be a popular front. Historically popular fronts are this thing [that are] more popular, more common on the left — which on the left [meant that] there used to be no enemies to the left. It was like: Don't shoot inside the tent. So what if we have Stalinists in our coalition? We're trying to stop the bad guys. That's the argument that is being used on the right right now, is that the right needs to become a popular front, needs to be a big tent. But it's also hypocritical, because the very people like JD Vance and others who are trying to make the Republican coalition a safer place for these people say that we have to purge the neocons from the conservative movement — that we don't want to hear from the zombie Reaganite crowd. They have no problem silencing and trying to cancel members of the coalition they consider to be rivals. It's going to be a fight that's going to unfold for a while, because Donald Trump — either for actuarial or constitutional reasons — is not going to be around forever. People are already trying to figure out what the post-Trump right looks like. And this is one of these early skirmishes in that longer-term battle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They've been showing up all over Evanston, a leafy suburb north of Chicago: suburban moms fresh from the school run and out to protect their community from what they see as unwelcome visitors. But that doesn't ring true for many in the city that's home to Northwestern University and where 70% of its 80,000 or so residents have a bachelor's degree or higher, and where in August this year, a police newsletter said there had not been a single reported burglary that week. Cellphone videos posted to social media show what happens when unmarked SUVs roll into Evanston neighborhoods. If residents see federal agents inside, they honk their horns to alert others. Crowds gather — people come out of their houses, dog walkers pause on their routes, cyclists and drivers make detours — to protest what the agents are doing and remove any element of surprise. Demonstrators told CNN they just wanted to help people who might be in the US without documents but had committed no crime. Emily Miller, a stay-at-home mom of three, had enough time for family, friends and hobbies while still being involved in causes she cared about. But the re-election of President Donald Trump in 2024 and then his administration's harsh policies against government agencies and on immigration gave her what she calls an “awakening” that she needed to do more. One night in January she was catching up and discussing politics with her friend and fellow mom Savanna Essig-Fox, who said she wanted to do something more tangible to show her opposition to the Trump administration, more than the canvassing and phone banks they had volunteered for during the election. The administration's deportation agenda also kept hitting the headlines, with raids on workplaces and homes, thousands of people detained and families broken apart. When immigration patrols turned up on Evanston streets, questioning neighbors and workers Miller and Essig-Fox consider part of their community, their movement became supercharged. The women were not the targets of any immigration enforcement, and they planned to use that to their advantage, Essig-Fox said. The women joined those who blow whistles when government agents are seen on their streets and document any action on their cellphones. Organizing posters and patrols and protests has taken them away from their family time, but they say even their elementary school-age children understand. “In order for me to be able to enjoy my kids and enjoy my other hobbies that I never do anymore, like reading or knitting, I can't just pretend something's not happening and go about my life,” Miller said. “It's reminiscent of things that have happened in history that, if we follow the pattern, leads to darker treatment of people who don't look like me. I don't want my kids to live in a country where this happens, it's gross,” Miller said. “They do wish I were at home, but also they know this shouldn't be happening,” she added about her children. They've made some of their protests family-friendly, complete with hot cocoa and bubble blowers for the kids, and neither regrets their choices. Essig-Fox said: “My biggest thing as a mother is I want to show my kids how I believe they should live in this world. They should use their privilege, and they should stand up for people and be a good community member — that's what I feel like I'm doing. I just want to be a good community member.” The arrival of Border Patrol in Evanston as part of “Operation Midway Blitz” in greater Chicago, triggered similar feelings among their neighbors too, with many turning out to blow warning whistles when agents were seen and then filming any action agents took. Essig-Fox said there is a stark contrast between the agents, often masked and in tactical gear, and the residents who sometimes run out to record events without even putting their shoes on. “I do think we need to point that out constantly because the juxtaposition of the people who are being brave, civilians who are just coming out of their homes with nothing to protect themselves, no gear, no vests, no shoes sometimes, whistles and a phone, they are honestly being extremely brave because they're facing people who could kill them if they so choose.” One agent wearing a uniform with a Border Patrol vest who did not disclose his name or appear to have other identification singled Brooks out. “Keep back or I'ma shoot you,” the officer shouted, changing position so he could grab his pistol and hold it straight at Brooks' face. Brooks was part of a crowd that gathered around the two vehicles as agents dragged the woman driver out of the car that hit their SUV, handcuffed her and put her in their vehicle. Another woman was shoved onto the ground as she tried to record on her phone. A man who said he was just approaching to help was taken down by two agents, punched and had his head banged into the pavement. A masked officer also used pepper spray against the crowd. Videos show more people gathering around the scene, blowing whistles, chanting and recording on their phones, but not physically challenging the officers. Brooks heard about the commotion on chat groups and cycled there from his home, knowing that his wife Amanda would likely be walking nearby. She was also part of the crowd, blowing her whistle, but they did not see each other. ‘It's like one day everyone left': How immigration crackdowns are reshaping America She told CNN her motivation was similar to other mothers in the area — aware that her family was less at risk because they are White, but determined to stand up for all members of her community. It's not just about stopping people from having their face dragged across the cement or strangled. It's about making sure that the kids can walk to school,” she said, adding they were no longer comfortable letting their tween son bike around the neighborhood for fear of what he or other children might come across. “I jumped out of my car with other people, and they had that young lady face down on the ground, yanked her out of the car and just threw her on the ground,” she said. “I pulled out my cell phone and before I knew it, one of those agents put me on the ground, threw me on my back. Later she can be seen yelling through an open backseat window. I had access to my phone in the car. I was able to get a call off and dial a friend's number, and so she could hear everything that was happening.” “You're going to get maced if you don't f**king listen,” he can be heard yelling to the detainees on the video, which also shows him holding a can of what appears to be irritant spray. Moriarty said she was driven around with the others for a couple of hours, then transferred to another car by herself and driven around more. “Paul Revere rode a horse screaming ‘The British are coming! Moriarty and the other two people detained — all US citizens — ended up at an FBI office where they were questioned and released, she said. The confrontation on a suburban street near an elementary school and a middle school on October 31 has now been cited in a lawsuit arguing that federal immigration agents are violating protesters' First Amendment rights to free speech, using excessive force and making unreasonable seizures. In a post to X after the event, Tricia McLaughlin of DHS said the man detained along with Moriarty “assaulted and kicked Border Patrol agents. But that has been declared false by a judge hearing claims that federal actions led by Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino in and around Chicago are violating the Constitution. “Despite a statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Mr. Bovino indicating that this individual grabbed the agent's genitals, videos don't bear this out, nor would such force have been appropriate even if this had occurred,” said District Court Judge Sara Ellis as she ruled that federal agents had to comply with a temporary restraining order to protect the rights of protesters. Two days after the ruling limited the use of force by federal agents unless there was an immediate threat, agents were reported to have used flash-bang grenades and pepper spray against protesters around Chicago, in one case after they said shots were fired at them. Moriarty said she was never afraid, partly because of her race.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Flight delays and cancellations will linger as Air Traffic Controllers staff back up. Six weeks of email and voicemails will have to be waded through. And in three months, they may have to contend with turbulence all over again: The agreement President Donald Trump signed into law Wednesday evening funds most of the government only through January. “There's no back to normal in this deal because all it does it kick the can until January 30,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit government organization. “It's a little like the federal workforce is going to return to their house after a hurricane and there's another storm on the horizon.” “It's going to be stressful for everybody,” said Yolanda Jacobs, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883 and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employee. “We can only begin to imagine how difficult it's going to be get everything functioning again, especially since we were already limping along in a lot of ways before the shutdown happened.” Federal employees not deemed essential were furloughed throughout the shutdown. From food safety and NASA to education and the national parks, federal workforces were already short-staffed following widespread cuts from DOGE earlier this year, which employees told CNN will make it even harder to dig out from the under the shutdown. “This moment is going to look very different than in 2019 (after the last government shutdown) when these offices were fully staffed,” said an Education Department employee. A second Education employee told CNN that they were told only check their emails at approved times to look for “reduction in force” layoff notices — and to make sure their computers didn't lock down after 30 days. Another Education official estimated that, during the shutdown, there were more than 2,000 complaints filed with the office, which handles allegations of discrimination against students with disabilities. It will take days to get labs used to test food and prevent food-borne illnesses at the Food and Drug Administration back to full capacity at the agency's testing labs, said one worker at the agency's Human Foods Program. Besides having to catch up on equipment maintenance and quality checks, “it will take time to restart research along with broader policy planning,” the worker said. And at the Internal Revenue Service, backlogs in tax filings from those who filed for extensions will take “two to three months to catch up,” said Gibson Jones, president of the National Treasury Employees Union Local 98 in Memphis. “You're talking about more than 40 days of mail that no one touched. People who are expecting money back will also see a delay in processing those tax refunds.” Many parks had law enforcement staffing during the shutdown, but there have been reports of graffiti and off-road vehicle damage in parks like Arches and Glen Canyon, as well as reports of illegal activities like base-jumping and flying drones in Yosemite, Brengel said. But there was a surge of volunteer support during the shutdown, she said, and many parks paid for custodial services like garbage removal with fee money — or volunteer groups stepped in to help. At NASA's iconic Goddard Space Flight Center's main campus in Greenbelt, Maryland - home of the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes -  employees were alarmed as more than a dozen buildings on the campus were emptied and padlocked, with very little notice given, CNN recently reported. “There will be many people who have no idea that this facility closure situation is going on,” a NASA engineer said. “I expect that will be a pretty crazy situation on top of just coming back.” Many have missed two full paychecks and a partial one during the shutdown. In the past, it only took a few business days for workers to be paid, said Jacqueline Simon, policy director at the American Federation of Government Employees. But she was concerned that this year it could take longer because many human resources staffers at agencies were furloughed or have left amid the administration's downsizing efforts. But “until we get paid, everyone's going to still have those same financial stressors on them,” said Ben Emmel, who represents 2,400 Government Accountability Office employees as president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers Local 1921. The US air traffic control system is more than 3,000 controllers short of what's needed to fully staff towers and other facilities that guide planes throughout the country. All this put young controllers in a “very difficult position” during the shutdown, leading some to quit, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told reporters this week, while some older controllers chose to simply retire. The shutdown wreaked havoc on the nation's safety net programs, most notably food stamps relied upon by nearly 42 million Americans to feed themselves and their families. More than a dozen states started issuing full allotments to residents last week before the Supreme Court paused a court order requiring full funding for the program. Several other states began sending partial benefits last week based on an earlier court order. Other states have not yet distributed any of this month's aid. After the government reopens, many states could issue full SNAP benefits within three days, said Lexie Kuznick, director of policy and government relations for the American Public Human Services Association, which represents state, county and city agencies. However, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, and Head Start could take longer to restart. They are run by the Department of Health and Human Services. And he fears it will take even longer this year since HHS laid off its LIHEAP staff in the spring. The funding lapse forced 20 programs in 17 states and Puerto Rico to close. Other programs have been able to maintain their operations thanks for local and philanthropic support. Asked about the timeline for getting funds to LIHEAP and Head Start programs, an HHS spokesperson said that the agency will “work swiftly” to administer LIHEAP annual awards. Head Start recipients can expect to receive communications that will include a timeline for the release of federal funds. But this is the first time there have been two delayed jobs reports. And it's likely that October's report will never be released, as data for the month was not collected, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday. “All of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policymakers at the Fed flying blind at a critical period,” Leavitt told reporters. Caitlin Lewis, who runs CivicMatch, which connects federal employees with jobs in state or local governments, said the shutdown has pushed many federal workers to the exits. Last week was one of the platform's busiest weeks in months. Overall, more than 12,000 federal employees have signed up this year. When the last government shutdown ended in 2019, a USDA employee returned to find dozens of emails from state agencies with policy questions, which gave her a newfound appreciation for her work and how much she is needed. But the stress of this year's record-long impasse has forced her to start looking for other jobs. “I cannot afford to go through this again, mentally or financially.” CNN's Brian Todd and Curt Devine contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) claimed on Wednesday that Democrats blocked his motion to bring the Jeffrey Epstein files to the floor. “Just left the House floor, and I tried to do a UC, unanimous consent, tried to get the Epstein files, get it straight to the floor, cut out all this nonsense,” said Burchett. Now, here they've had it for four years, and obviously, if there's something there about Trump, they would have released it. It has nothing to do with doing what's right. “They ought to be ashamed of themselves,” Burchett added. Burchett's comments about the Democrats blocking his motion came just hours after House Oversight Committee Democrats published emails between Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and author Michael Wolff. Burchett also spoke to Bloomberg TV about the Epstein files and whether Trump is mentioned in them. He dismissed such concerns and said the things that are being released are “little pieces” that fit narratives and are “out of context.” Burchett did not speak on the emails released earlier in the day but expressed overall skepticism about anything that would be released. “The Democrats have had this thing for four years, and let's be honest, if there was something in there detrimental to President Trump, Joe Biden would have released it,” Burchett said in an interview with Bloomberg's Joe Mathieu. Burchett also said that Republicans “had it for nine months” and that he expressed frustration over the contents of the emails and files associated with Epstein. “I think what you're seeing right now is both sides are taking out little pieces that fit their narrative, out of context, maybe, or something that's been discharged, is not legitimate, maybe.” He also blasted Democrats for trying to manipulate public opinion about the Epstein files. He claimed they were weaponizing the emails to humiliate Trump and influence public opinion, and doing all of this while being dishonest about their genuine concerns over Epstein's victims. “I think that shows what's really going on in the Democratic Party. They're not concerned about the people that are involved,” Burchett said. It'll be we'll hear that for the next however many years.” When asked if the president should be worried, Burchett said no. He had those files for four daggum years,” Burchett said. “I've talked to legal experts, a guy back home, Teddy Davis, we've gone over this thing a thousand times, over the backwards and forwards, and things that could be in there and might not be in there.” “I think they should have released the files a long time ago because right now it's just all politics.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein said in newly released emails that he advised Russia's permanent representative to the United Nations on how to deal with President Donald Trump. The plethora of Epstein emails released by House Democrats on Wednesday included many that showed his vast international connections. Among these were connections with the Russian government, which Epstein said he helped advise about Trump. In the same email chain, Epstein urged Jagland to mention him when discussing the matter with Russian President Vladimir Putin and encourage Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to speak with him for further insight on Trump. His exchanges regarding Russia and Trump were notable for illustrating the hostile relationship between the former friends, with Epstein repeatedly bashing Trump during his first term. “Im sure his view is that it went super well. Admittedly he has no idea of the symbolism. He added that Trump's handling of the summit was “predictable.” Epstein and Trump once counted each other as friends but had a falling out sometime in the mid-2000s. Despite the falling out, Epstein's alleged contacts with the Russian government and other figures showed he was likely leveraging his former relationship with Trump to make contact with high-level officials. The email that drew the most attention was one sent by Epstein to his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, in which he allegedly said the “dog that hasn't barked is trump … [victim name] spent hours at my house with him, he has never once been mentioned. While the victim's name was redacted in the release, House Republicans quickly revealed that the victim in question was Virginia Giuffre, who had repeatedly denied any wrongdoing by Trump. At a Wednesday White House briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails “prove absolutely nothing other than President Trump did nothing wrong.”</p>
