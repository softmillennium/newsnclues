                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cisco plans to acquire NeuralFabric, a Seattle-area startup founded by a group of Microsoft veterans that makes back-end software for companies to build and run their own generative AI models. The Silicon Valley enterprise tech mainstay said the deal will bolster its AI Canvas initiative, a generative UI and collaboration environment announced earlier this year. In its announcement Thursday morning, Cisco highlighted NeuralFabric's expertise in distributed systems, model training, and flexible deployment as a complement to its existing AI assistant, cybersecurity models, and data fabric strategy. DJ Sampath, senior vice president for AI software and platforms, said in the announcement that the startup has “cracked a crucial part of this puzzle” by building technology that lets companies develop their own domain-specific small language models using proprietary data across cloud or on-premises environments. NeuralFabric, based in Redmond, was founded in 2023 by former Microsoft Azure engineering veteran Weijie Lin (CEO), longtime Microsoft executive John deVadoss, AI entrepreneur Jesus Rodriguez (president), and cloud and security veteran Mark Baciak (CTO), with former Microsoft director Drew Gude (chief revenue officer) also listed as an early exec. The startup employs about nine people, according to LinkedIn. NeuralFabric had raised at least $5 million in funding as of February 2024 announcement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Right now, under federal statutes, president Trump can call us up as the militia if he sees it necessary, especially for three purposes: to repel invasions, to suppress insurrections, and to execute the laws of the union,” Rhodes said. This hasn't stopped Rhodes from asking potential new members and supporters to send money in support of the cause. Janet Arroyo, who ran an Oath Keepers chapter in Chino Valley, Arizona, with her husband Jim Arroyo prior to the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, says they have not heard from Rhodes in six years and had no plans to rejoin his group. “He hasn't reached out during his incarceration, nor since being released,” says Arroyo. “No hard feelings, but we are doing what we do and don't spend a lot of time wondering what he's up to. The dumb DC stunt has scared a lot of great patriots into hiding. Another former Oath Keeper, Jessica Watkins, an army veteran who was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison for her role in the Capitol attack, says she hadn't even heard about the relaunch when WIRED contacted her this week. “I have not heard of a relaunch, but most J6ers I know are trying to rebuild their lives,” says Watkins, who added that even if she wanted to rejoin, she would be unable to do so as she had her sentence commuted rather than being pardoned. “Felons are not allowed to be in the Oath Keepers or work with them.” “I think four and five years from now, eight years from now, 12 years from now, whenever it is, anyone that is a member of these organizations stands at risk of what I went through.” Meggs said he would be interested in taking part in any work the Oath Keepers were carrying out in response to natural disasters, but he won't be on the streets defending cities from the perceived threat from antifa. “I am not going to be an active member,” says Meggs. “If they're doing a big march somewhere, I won't be there.” A review of social media platforms and right-wing message boards shows a decided lack of discussion about the new group over the last week, but Meggs says it's happening in “one-on-one conversations.” “This just feels like the latest desperate attempt by Rhodes to cling to relevance,” says Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. Why would any young anti-government extremist trust a failed insurrectionist who got all of his followers arrested?” Rhodes founded the Oath Keepers in 2009 as a reaction to a conspiracy theory that the Obama administration was seeking to trigger economic collapse and impose martial law on American citizens. In January, Rhodes had his sentence commuted to “time served” by Trump, but did not receive a full pardon like hundreds of other insurrectionists, which means his conviction still stands. In the interview, Rhodes said he was waiting for Trump to issue him a full pardon before restarting the Oath Keepers, but added that recent events have forced him to act. Rhodes has also launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise a “modest goal of $75,000,” the campaign claims, to support the new group. However, according to social media posts, this event appears to be actually being run by the Young Republicans of Houston rather than the Oath Keepers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leo is a nod to “low Earth orbit,” where Amazon has so far launched more than 150 satellites as part of a constellation that will eventually include more than 3,200. A new website for Amazon Leo proclaims “a new era of internet is coming,” as Amazon says its satellites can help serve “billions of people on the planet who lack high-speed internet access, and millions of businesses, governments, and other organizations operating in places without reliable connectivity.” Early customers and partners include JetBlue, which in September became the first airline to sign on with Leo, promising faster and more reliable inflight Wi-Fi. L3Harris, DIRECTV Latin America, Sky Brasil, and NBN Co., Australia's National Broadband Network operator, are also signed up to deploy the service. Amazon also has a $140 million, 100,000-square-foot payload processing facility at Kennedy Space Center that prepares satellites for upcoming launches. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy posted on X about the name change and said projects such as Echo and Kindle also had code names early on. And Amazon Devices & Services leader Panos Panay said that he was “psyched for what's ahead” in his own post on X. Pretty much every Amazon project starts with a code name.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta is overhauling Facebook Marketplace with new collaborative tools, social features, an improved checkout experience, and Meta AI integrations, the company announced Thursday. Marketplace is getting a new “collections” feature that lets users create groups of listings and invite friends to join. These new collaborative features could be useful in instances when a group of roommates is looking to furnish their new apartment or when someone wants to keep their partner in the loop when discussing potential purchases. While Meta says the changes announced on Thursday are designed to make Marketplace more useful, they also mark the company's ongoing efforts to bring Meta AI into all of its services and products. Additionally, by blending social, commerce, and AI, the company is looking boost time spent on Marketplace while also enhancing its competitiveness against other e-commerce platforms. In terms of the Meta AI integrations, Meta is going to start using its AI tools to help buyers ask the right questions when making a purchase. Additionally, Meta is bringing AI insights to vehicle listings on Marketplace, noting that vehicles are among the top five searches for young adults. Now, when users view a vehicle listing, they'll see AI-generated insights that bring together key details like engine options, safety ratings, transmission type, seating and cargo capacity, reviews, and price information. Meta also announced that users can react and comment directly on listings. The company says this will help others learn about item quality and discover new finds. Meta notes that if a user likes an item, Marketplace will learn what they're interested in and display more items aligned with their preferences. As part of its announcement, Meta said it began integrating eBay and Poshmark inventory into Marketplace earlier this year to give people more options when it comes to buying across categories like fashion and electronics. “Partner listings are marked with an icon on the listing image, and are integrated throughout your Marketplace feed so you'll see them while you're browsing,” Meta explained in a blog post. As for the improved checkout experience, buyers will now see total costs, including shipping and tax, upfront. They'll now also receive notifications as the status of their order changes.

Also, if you get hit by a Cybertruck at 55mph, the sharp angles are going to cut you far deeper than a Mini Cooper would. You're not going to walk away from it either way, but you're probably more likely to perish from the Cybertruck. Yes, and I want a decent budget vehicle here. Even ignoring the parts falling off & the safety, every time I see one of these my first thought is "who saw a picture of this and said 'yep, that's what I want'" As is Mexico's, but BYD is available there — as well in a number of other North American countries.> BYD coming to Canada would also hurt the auto industry.To be fair, it is already hurting from the attacks launched by the USA.

Otherwise, sure, you can get it imported under a conditional use to bring it to car shows, but not for daily use. Tesla's excuse: While they were happy to take a Canadian's money with fully refundable deposit terms, they had not contemplated actually ever refunding a Canadian. The only option offered for refund was a deposit to an American bank account.It seems like no aspect of the Cybertruck project was done well.

Additionally, they didn't manage to find a satisfactory solution to attach the steel panels to the frame so they glued them on.I suspect the 'parts falling off' has something to do with the inflexibility of both materials as well as the different thermal expansion coefficients.On normal cars, bodywork is either made of flexible plastic, or is attached via spring joints so that the vibration doesn't damage them - that's why you have panel gaps - so they can move around a bit.If you fix them rigidly, they're going to shake off eventually.

He's a cult leader with surprisingly horrible political instincts Not saying there weren't leaks that he was a huge asshole. Just saying that I could forgive people for over looking it early on. Without actually getting into the specific actions he took while in government, I dare say that what he did during that time was material to people's revulsion and that a different version of him who took different actions would have been differently popular. His weakness is as you write - thinking he is the smartest and best engineer in the room, when all he has are engineering companies. I have no issue calling Musk a wildly successful businessman as he has made several great investments including getting companies off the ground, however his track record for actually running things is questionable.

If Starship succeeds it seems to guarantee than Falcon Heavy will have a negative ROI, but Starship needs to be wildly successful to have a positive ROI.Starlink helps justify a high launch capacity, but isn't in need of a heavy launch platform. A more reusable Falcon 9 would have simplified thermal issues, reduced R&D costs, and presumably increased profits much sooner. That IMO would have been a far better strategy than scaling, up while changing to a wildly different engine, and targeting increased reusability, etc. A more reusable Falcon 9 would have simplified thermal issues, reduced R&D costs, and presumably increased profits much sooner.

Mid-size accessories like add-on spoilers on trunk lids, or other exterior styling pieces are frequently attached with adhesive.A larger component commonly attached with adhesives are the rear fender flares on dually pickups. Very commonly these are built with a standard bed, and then the flares to cover the extra wheel width are applied with a 3M VHB-like adhesive strip.But like anything, there is a way to do it properly, and a way to do it hacky.

Pretty straightforward and honestly exactly what I would expect as an official accessory to a $100K vehicle.Btw, does Tesla pay you for all your white knighting?

Those generally focus less on how to build cars. Those generally focus less on how to build cars. If automotive OEMs can glue it they will.It's just that other OEMs don't build uninterrupted 5ft light bars so glueing is a much less suitable (think about how much glue contact patch per amount of light bar there is and how little leverage it's mass has over the glue, contrast with normal light) solution for them.

It also looks cool and stands apart aesthetically from pretty much everything else on the market, even if the giant 1-piece wiper and black plastic wheel well trim pieces mar the clean lines of the original design.I'm not sufficiently familiar with the data to say whether or not Cybertrucks or Teslas have significantly more design problems or QC issues than other manufacturers, or if news outlets just latch onto the stories more because Musk's public behavior makes him such a lightning rod for controversy.Regardless, I think the Cybertruck will go down in history as an iconic car and a symbol of the 2020s, even if it was an objectively bad product (think DeLorean).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Hannan Happi started thinking about how to solve the AI power crisis, he kept one figure in mind: one cent per kilowatt-hour. We tried to learn from every one of them: How do I reduce structural costs? If Exowatt can deliver on its promise of delivering cheap solar power that generates electricity 24-7, it could upend the data center market and broader energy world, delivering round-the-clock power at very low cost. The extension was led by MVP Ventures and 8090 Industries with participation from Atomic, BAM, Bay Bridge Ventures, DeepWork Capital, Dragon Global, the Florida Opportunity Fund, Massive VC, New Atlas Capital, Overmatch, Protagonist, and StepStone. Happi said that Exowatt wasn't looking to raise additional capital after the April round, but “strong momentum we saw in the market” and “strong investor interest” encouraged him to take the new money at a higher valuation. Exowatt's backlog is currently about 10 million P3 units representing 90 gigawatt-hours of capacity, he said. The company should hit its one-cent target when production hits around 1 million units per year, Happi said. Exowatt is basically repackaging a technology that's been around for decades. Known as concentrated solar power or thermal solar power, it uses the sun's energy to heat materials that are good at storing or transporting thermal energy. In cases where that thermal energy is stored for an extended period of time, those materials tend to be derived from or resemble rocks — hence the technology's nickname of “rocks in a box.” That beam then heats a special brick inside the shipping container. Each thermal battery can retain heat for up to five days, ensuring continuous operation, and Exowatt will string several together to feed a single generator unit. Happi argued that the P3's small size and Exowatt's iterative approach sets it apart. There are just over 100 solar thermal or concentrated solar power projects that are planned, built, or decommissioned around the world, he said. “If you compare that to the fact that we produce 1.5 billion solar panels per year, you can see the learning curve effects are very, very far apart from each other. “What Exowatt is about is taking a modular system that we know in principle works, and really scaling the manufacturing of that and then applying the learning curves of manufacturing.” Exowatt is unlikely to be cost-effective everywhere, and the number of P3 units needed to power a data center could require massive amounts of land. Plus, it works best in the sunniest regions, which could limit its broader impact. “We're not running short of any projects to do,” he said. Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google DeepMind has built a new video-game-playing agent called SIMA 2 that can navigate and solve problems in a wide range of 3D virtual worlds. The company claims it's a big step toward more general-purpose agents and better real-world robots. Google DeepMind first demoed SIMA (which stands for “scalable instructable multiworld agent”) last year. But SIMA 2 has been built on top of Gemini, the firm's flagship large language model, which gives the agent a huge boost in capability. The researchers claim that SIMA 2 can carry out a range of more complex tasks inside virtual worlds, figure out how to solve certain challenges by itself, and chat with its users. The ultimate aim is to develop next-generation agents that are able to follow instructions and carry out open-ended tasks inside more complex environments than a web browser. Marino claimed that the skills SIMA 2 has learned, such as navigating an environment, using tools, and collaborating with humans to solve problems, are essential building blocks for future robot companions. Unlike previous work on game-playing agents such as AlphaZero, which beat a Go grandmaster in 2016, or AlphaStar, which beat 99.8% of ranked human competition players at the video game StarCraft 2 in 2019, the idea behind SIMA is to train an agent to play an open-ended game without preset goals. The agent takes in a video game's pixels frame by frame and figures out what actions it needs to take to carry out its tasks. Like its predecessor, SIMA 2 was trained on footage of humans playing eight commercial video games, including No Man's Sky and Goat Simulator 3, as well as three virtual worlds created by the company. Hooked up to Gemini, the researchers claim, SIMA 2 is far better at following instructions (asking questions and providing updates as it goes) and figuring out for itself how to perform certain more complex tasks. Google DeepMind tested the agent inside environments it had never seen before. In one set of experiments, researchers asked Genie 3, the latest version of the firm's world model, to produce environments from scratch and dropped SIMA 2 into them. They found that the agent was able to navigate and carry out instructions there. The researchers also used Gemini to generate new tasks for SIMA 2. If the agent failed, at first Gemini generated tips that SIMA 2 took on board when it tried again. Repeating a task multiple times in this way often allowed SIMA 2 to improve by trial and error until it succeeded, Marino said. The agent struggles with complex tasks that require multiple steps and more time to complete. Previous attempts at training a single system to play multiple games haven't gone too well, he says. That's because training models to control multiple games just by watching the screen isn't easy: “Playing in real time from visual input only is ‘hard mode,'” he says. In particular, Togelius calls out GATO, a previous system from Google DeepMind, which—despite being hyped at the time—could not transfer skills across a significant number of virtual environments. Still, he is open-minded about whether or not SIMA 2 could lead to better robots. “The real world is both harder and easier than video games,” he says. At the same time, a robot in the real world will know exactly what its body can and can't do at any time. Matthew Guzdial, an AI researcher at the University of Alberta, isn't too surprised that SIMA 2 can play many different video games. “If you put a game with weird input in front of it, I don't think it'd be able to perform well,” he says. Guzdial also questions how much of what SIMA 2 has learned would really carry over to robots. “It's much harder to understand visuals from cameras in the real world compared to games, which are designed with easily parsable visuals for human players,” he says. Machine translators have made it easier than ever to create error-plagued Wikipedia articles in obscure languages. What happens when AI models get trained on junk pages? The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disabling the AMD External Events Utility service appears to be a workaround, but with modern disk caching, we aren't sure there's a tangible problem. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A Redditor has observed what, at best, might be classed as unexpected behavior precipitated by the AMD chipset drivers. Takia_Gecko has uncovered a bug/feature in AMD's drivers that causes a system log file to be repeatedly appended as on-screen windows are moved and/or rescaled. We've reached out to AMD for a definitive answer. Opening up a system monitor, like the built-in Windows Task Manager, and expanding all the processes provides some insight into these behind-the-scenes goings-on. They have even developed a workaround, but without exhaustive and extensive testing aren't sure whether the wrinkle workaround has its own deep wrinkles… What you are seeing is a log file in C:\Windows\System32\AMD\EEUDumps\ on Takia_Gecko's PC getting bombarded with updates in response to windows being manipulated on screen. This behavior was charted by a utility dubbed ReadDirectoryChangesW. So, the unexpected behavior is quite certainly there. And, as a workaround, the Redditor discovered that it could be stopped by “redirecting writes to the whole [EEUDUmps] folder to nul:”. Modern storage makes extensive and smart use of caching – even cacheless SSDs use some of your system RAM (e.g., HMB drives) to ease back on actual disk activity. These log file writes, though numerous and rapid, are apparently tiny, so they might not have any impact on concerns about SSD endurance, and so on. Another legitimate concern among those with AMD chipset drivers installed is that this bug/feature might affect FreeSync. Takia_Gecko claims they confirmed with an AMD engineer that a Windows process spawned by the drivers, called ‘AMD External Events Utility,' is somehow related to the provision of FreeSync features.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If clocking up more than 65 marathons and 20 ultras, and plodding most of the way across Europe has taught me one thing, it is this: A runner is only as happy as his or her feet. You can drop hundreds of bucks on the best running shoes, but if you stick your foot into an old gym sock, you still risk ending up with blisters. It's why regular ultra runners change their socks for a big psychological boost mid-race. If your socks fit poorly, hold onto sweat, or fail to cushion your steps, it's a fast ticket to hot spots and Blisterville. To help you avoid all of that, we've run our way through the unending variety of cut, cushion, and yes, color, to find options worth their price tags. Runners often lace up daily trainers for their regular mileage and save race day running shoes for when things get serious. I take the same approach to running socks. I'll train in my race socks–because “nothing new on race day”–but I avoid putting too much mileage and wear into those pricier options. For soaking up the strain of the everyday mileage, I reach for a reliable, hard-wearing, daily workhorse sock. These tick all the right boxes: excellent mid-cushion with extra protection where the impact hits hardest, great fit, blister-busting seamless toes, and effective moisture control. In race mode on the road, over almost any distance, I reach for Stance socks. They handle moisture well too—an excellent mid-cushioned sock that's great for comfort on longer runs. These performance crew socks have it all: plenty of cushioning on the sole, extra toe box padding to protect your pinky toes, and cuffs that stay put but don't dig trenches in your calves. The highly effective mesh ventilation also means even my very sweaty feet finished two-hour marathon training runs relatively dry. You can also get them at a quarter height, and Asics is kicking out some pretty snazzy designs. The high-cushion and seamless toes offer easy comfort, without being so thick that you lose that all-important connection with the terrain underfoot. Stox's graduated 23- to 32-mmHg compression is the real deal, delivering excellent calf support that's great for longer runs, races, and recovery plods. The seamless circular knit helps ward off blisters, and there's extra padding in the toes and heels to boost comfort. They're also great for trail runs to protect you from scratchy foliage—or ticks. The thinner fabric performs well in hotter weather, and there's a small tab to prevent heel rub. What I really love is the Y-shaped heel that molds to your foot and stays there—no slipping, sliding, bunching, or rubbing. They're thin enough to work well with closer-fitting running shoes and a great option for shorter races and hybrid workouts. If you're looking for a great thin sock that works for many sports, these are the ones to get. There are some big upsides to slipping your feet into merino socks. The natural material is thermoregulating, moisture-wicking, and sustainable. Adrienne So hesitates to recommend expensive socks, but these are compressive, they don't fall down, and they're black, so they don't get as stained and gross as white ones. Crew socks are better for cooler days or anywhere you might get a little dust or mud on your ankles, and Tracksmith's gorgeous and simple designs—for these socks, as well as shorts, shirts, and hats—are some of the best in the business. I have a recurring problem with toe-on-toe aggression. Basically my toes sit too close to each other, so after a while the little pinky gets battered from being trodden on. But UYN's toe-separating Five Socks are a revelation, albeit an expensive one. I've used them twice to run a 22-hour, 100-mile ultra along the Berlin Wall trail, and I've never finished a race with my feet so intact—no blisters, no hot spots, no discomfort. I ran in 80 degrees and the ventilation was top notch. Instead, snag a multipack of these totally serviceable socks from H&M. The blend of cotton, spandex and nylon is quite thick, can get a bit hot, and wouldn't be my first choice for runs over an hour. But they're more than up to shorter jogs and jumping from the treadmill to the gym floor. The high-rise ribbed legs don't sag, there's an almost-seamless toe, and plenty of cushion in all the right places. Whether it's there for safety or style, we're not 100 percent sure. But the reflective grid pattern built into Lululemon's unisex Power Stride Crew socks does a good job of making you more visible when you're running in the dark. The cushioning is on the lighter side, and if you like lots of padding there are better options. If you're after maximum cushion and comfort in a no-show running sock, you can stop looking right now. Balega's Hidden Comfort socks take plushness to the next level with a thick layer of super soft, almost terry-towel-like fabric right across the bottom of your foot and an extra-deep heel pocket for some serious coziness. Up top, it's all much thinner, more flexible and breathable. Some no-show socks risk heel rub, but there's none of that here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The post's comments section quickly turned into a ravenous pool of AI- and cloud-hating piranhas. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The Microsoft exec wanted to share his excitement about how Windows is "evolving into an agentic OS." Join us at #MSIgnite to see how frontier firms are transforming with Windows and what's next for the platform. Davuluri used his X profile to share information about a breakout session at Microsoft Ignite. “Windows is evolving into an agentic OS, connecting devices, cloud, and AI to unlock intelligent productivity and secure work anywhere,” Davuluri wrote on his public profile page. “Join us at #MSIgnite to see how frontier firms are transforming with Windows and what's next for the platform. Davuluri's enthusiasm regarding the evolution of Windows faced overwhelmingly negative criticism. If we had to condense the replies into a single, representative, super-reply, it would probably read something like this: ‘No one wants this; we are fed up with AI everything; Windows needs tuning for performance; and Linux is looking good.' In some ways, we agree with the Windows and PC enthusiast old-guard. Whatever frills it adds — whatever side dishes it offers — the OS definitely should not get in the way of users, and interruptions of computer workflows, entertainment, and gaming fun should be red-flagged as being contrary to the prime directive. Davuluri's highlighted Ignite session seems to be targeted at ‘frontier firms,' and if they want the Windows features described, laced with artificial intelligence and connected cloud trimmings, it seems fair that Microsoft should address them. As long as these features aren't foisted on users who want to ignore the OS and focus on their apps, content, and games, we don't think there will be an uprising or a mass exodus in the immediate future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Uber once touted itself as an alternative to car ownership. Data, however, show that over a decade into the ride-hailing revolution, car ownership is here to stay—even in places where Lyft, Uber, and Waymo run rampant. In 2023 Uber had a profitable year—its first since it went public and started having to disclose its financials. So it's worth traveling back to the early days of ride-hailing, to revisit the beautiful future proposed by at-the-time CEO Travis Kalanick. In the days when Uber had just blown up, he described his “vision” to the Wall Street Journal like this: Basically make car ownership a thing of the past…If you just looked at San Francisco, the ground transportation market in just San Francisco — where people pay to get in a car and go somewhere, whether they own the car or otherwise — is $22 billion. Uber is now a load-bearing pillar of the tech economy, and ride-hailing is now a regular feature of life, so it seems like a good time to check in on Kalanick's vision. A brief report published Wednesday, compiled from census data, says, basically: LOL. The data on car ownership show that not only hasn't transportation become as simple as tapping your phone, being whisked away, and never having to worry about tire rotation again, but the trends look like they're going a little in the opposite direction. In dense areas served by ride-hailing services, car ownership is basically flat since the birth of Uber, or even inching slightly up. The report is from retired automotive researcher Glenn Mercer, who writes a newsletter called “Car Charts,” which is about car charts. Looking at the crude totals without controlling for other factors, Mercer found that nationally, there were 800 cars per 1,000 Americans in 2000, and about 850 per 1,000 Americans now—lots more cars, as anyone would probably guess. During that time, these were the changes in the chart's raw metric, with a one-point increase or decrease basically corresponding to, “one one-hundredth of a car per household”: In other words, no significant change anywhere, although the one tenth of a car increase in Dallas is somewhat eyebrow-raising. Mercer's analysis is that, he doesn't “see any real impact on cars per household. A 2023 report by Brookings argues that young people own fewer cars than members of older generations simply because they don't have enough money to buy cars. Gizmodo reached out to Uber for comment, and will update if we hear back. Uber CEO wants physics PhDs using the app for AI gigs. After a cat was reported run over by a Waymo this week, Musk decided to share his thoughts on pet safety and driverless cars. San Francisco was an early adopter of robotaxis, but increasingly the city has become a stage for real-world tests confronting social acceptance. The move is one of several signaling a growing tension between innovation, privacy, and law enforcement power.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The level of persistence these guys went through to phish at scale is astounding—which is how they gained most of their access. They'd otherwise look up API endpoints on GitHub and see if there were any leaked keys (he wasn't fond of GitHub's automated scanner).https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/member-notorious-intern... They themselves are likely to some extent the victims of social engineering as well. After all who benefits from creating exploits for online games and getting children to become script kiddies? Its easier (and probably safer) to make money off of cyber crime if your role isn't committing the crimes yourself. It isn't illegal to create premium software that could in theory be use for crime if you don't market it that way. This is considered the gold standard.To get a payout from a class-action lawsuit that leaked your data, you must go to some other random site (usually some random domain name loosely related to the settlement recently registered by kroll)  and enter basically more PII than was leaked in the first place.To pay your fed taxes with a credit card, you must verify your identity with some 3rd party site, then go to yet another 3rd party site to enter your CC info.This is insane and forces/trains people to perform actions that in many other scenarios lead to a phishing attack.

Who is making money off of selling premium software, that's not marketed as for cybercrime, to non-governmental attackers? did you have bulletproof hosting and they caught you through other means like going after your payment providers or you made opsec mistakes or how exactly?was it a website like Sportsurge where it simply linked to streams or did it actually host the streams? Do you mean they thought the scanner was effective and weren't fond of it because it disrupted their business? Or do you mean they had a low opinion of the scanner because it was ineffective? Unpleasant, but comes with the territory (I don't like it, when it's done to me).That said, I'm not sure that kind of scolding is particularly effective, either. It's like some commenters treat human interaction as a command-line interface. I mean, the comments under the GPT-5.1 announcement just today were full of people wishing that AI actually responded to them like this.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45904551 We regret that this incident has caused worry for our partners and people.

Again, yes, but: they are at least attempting to use the right words. Now they need to follow them up with the right actions. But, wouldn't a more appropriate approach be to mitigate the damage from being hacked as much as possible in the first place? Perhaps this starts by simplifying bloated systems, reducing data collection to data that which is only absolutely legally necessary for KYC and financial transactions in whatever respective country(ies) the service operates in, hammer-testing databases for old tricks that seem to have been forgotten about in a landscape of hacks with ever-increasingly complexity, etc.Maybe it's the dad in me, years of telling me son to not apologize, but to avoid the behavior that causes the problem in the first place. Bad things happen, and we all screw up from time to time, that is a fact of life, but a little forethought and consideration about the best or safest way to do a thing is a great way to shrink the blast area of any surprise bombs that go off.

What an odd thing to teach a child. But yes, even if you try to make a healthy balance, there are still plenty of times when an apology are appropriate and will go a long way, for the giver and receiver, in my opinion anyway. It's 5-why's style root cause analysis, which will build a person that causes less harm to others.I am willing to believe that the same parent also teaches when and why it is sometimes right to apologize.

Such data is a liability, not an asset and if you dispose of it as soon as you reasonably can that's good. If this is a communications service consider saving a hash of the ID and refusing new sign ups with that same ID because if the data gets deleted then someone could re-sign up with someone else's old account. It's important that "delete all my information" also deletes everything after the user logs in for the first time.Also, I'm not sure that Apple would allow it. They insist that deletion remove all traces of the user. As far as I know, there's no legal mandate to retain anything, and the nature of our demographic, means that folks could be hurt badly by leaks.So we retain as little information as possible -even if that makes it more difficult for us to adminster, and destroy everything, when we delete.

I think it is great for people like you to inject some more realistic expectations into discussions like these.An entity like Amazon is not - in the longer term - going to escape fate, but they have more budget and (usually) much better internal practices which rule out the kind of thing that would bring down a lesser org. But if they ever get complacent or start economizing on security then the odds change very rapidly. Your very realistic stance is one of the reasons it hasn't happened yet, you are acutely aware you are in spite of all of your efforts still at risk.Blast radius reduction by removing data you no longer need (and that includes the marketing department, who more often than not are the real culprit) is a good first step towards more realistic expectations for any org.

How could that possibly fail to be true? All of these companies have been hacked by nation states like Russia and China. This is what incident handling by a trustworthy provider looks like. The hackers called employees/contractors at Google (& lots of other large companies) with user access to the company's Salesforce instance and tricked them into authorizing API access for the hackers' machine.It's the same as loading Apple TV on your Roku despite not having a subscription and then calling your neighbor who does have an account and tricking them into entering the 5 digit code at link.apple.comContinuing with your analogy, they didn't break into the off-site storage unit so much as they tricked someone into giving them a key.There's no security vulnerability in Google/Salesforce or your apartment/storage per se, but a lapse in security training for employees/contractors can be the functional equivalent to a zero-day vulnerability.

In my country, this debate is being held WRT the atrocities my country committed in its (former) colonies, and towards enslaved humans¹. Our king and prime minister never truly "apologized". Because, I kid you not, the government fears that this opens up possibilities for financial reparation or compensation and the government doesn't want to pay this.

Letting business concerns trump human empathy is exactly the damn problem and exactly why these companies still deserve immense ire no matter how they word their "We don't want to admit fault but we want you to think we care" press release. That preceding line makes it, to me, a real apology.

I'm not sure anything here could be described as "timely". If i build a house of cards in a week, that took way longer than the average house of cards, and it would not be fair to call it "timely".In a world where most companies report breaches months after the fact, yes, I think "last week we found out about it and we're now confirming it" is fair. You need to work with Law Enforcement, you need to confirm the validity of the data and the hacker's claims, and that they data they are ransoming is all they actually took.

In a world where most companies report breaches months after the fact, yes, I think "last week we found out about it and we're now confirming it" is fair. You need to work with Law Enforcement, you need to confirm the validity of the data and the hacker's claims, and that they data they are ransoming is all they actually took.

For that level of breach their response seems about right to me, especially waving the money in ShinyHunters' face before giving it away to their enemies. From customer perspective “in an effort to reduce the likelihood of this data becoming widely available, we've paid the ransom” is probably better, even if some people will not like it.Also to really be transparent it'd be good to post a detailed postmortem along with audit results detailing other problems they (most likely) discovered. Also to really be transparent it'd be good to post a detailed postmortem along with audit results detailing other problems they (most likely) discovered. It's a sliding scale, where payment firmly pushes you in the more comfortable direction.Also, the uncomfortable truth is that ransomware payments are very common. Not paying will make essentially no difference, the business would probably still be incredibly lucrative even if payment rates dropped to 5% of what they are now.If there was global co-operation to outlaw ransom payments, that'd be great. Until then, individual companies refusing to pay is largely pointless. Also, the uncomfortable truth is that ransomware payments are very common.

If your company gets hit by one of these groups and you want to protect your customers, paying is almost always the most effective way to do that. Someone who isn't particularly interested in protecting their customers probably wouldn't pay if the damage from not paying would be lower than the cost of paying.A third possibility is that you simply feel uncomfortable about paying, which is fine, but it isn't a particularly rational basis for the decision.I think we can also fairly assume that the vast majority of people have no strong feelings about ransomware, so there's likely going to be no meaningful reputational damage caused by paying.

They will maybe hold off for a bit to prove their "reputation" or "legitimacy". You can never be sure, but the incentives are there and they're pretty obvious.The big groups are making in the neighbourhood of $billions, earning extra millions by sabotaging their main source of revenue seems ridiculous. Basic game theory shows that the best course of action for any ransomware group with multiple victims is to act honestly.

The big groups are making in the neighbourhood of $billions, earning extra millions by sabotaging their main source of revenue seems ridiculous. However they don't really need to because there are plenty of documented cases, and the incident response company you hire will almost certainly have prior knowledge of the group you're forced to deal with.If they had a history of fucking over their “customers”, the IR team you hired would know and presumably advise against paying. If they had a history of fucking over their “customers”, the IR team you hired would know and presumably advise against paying. They actually have money on the line too, unlike almost everyone who would criticise them for paying. There's a reason why businesses very frequently arrive at the conclusion that it's better to pay, and it's not because they're stupid or malicious. They actually have money on the line too, unlike almost everyone who would criticise them for paying. Until there is legislation to stop these payments, there will be countless situations where paying is simply the best option. Surely the attackers don't provide you with a legitimate invoice for your accounting. > As a company you cannot just buy a large amount of crypto and randomly send it to someone.You can totally do that, why wouldn't you be able to? They hire a third party, sometimes their cyber insurance provider, to "cleanup" the ransomware. And selling the data from companies like Checkout.com is generally still worth a decent amount, even if nowhere close to the bigger ransom payments. This is like falling victim to a scam and paying more on top of it because the scammers promised to return the money if you pay a bit more.I see no likelihood game to be played there because you can't trust criminals by default. Your data is out in the wild, nothing you can do about that. I see no likelihood game to be played there because you can't trust criminals by default. Your data is out in the wild, nothing you can do about that. Picking up hundreds of thousands at best (very few databases would be worth so much) when your main business pays millions or tens of millions per victim simply isn't worth it, selling the data would jeopardise their main business which is orders of magnitude more profitable.Absolutely no IR company will advise their clients to pay if the particular ransomware group is known to renege on their promises.

Still, it's illegal or quite bureaucratic in some places to pay up.And idk...

I see it more as a middle finger to the perps: “look, we can afford to pay, here, see us pay that amount elsewhere, but you aren't getting it”. It isn't signalling virtue as much as it is signalling “fuck you and your ransom demands” in the hope that this will mark them as not an easy target for that sort of thing in future. For customers it signals sincerity and may help dampen outrage in their follow up dealings. It's also a term you can use against political opponents because it's much easier to speak well than to actually do good.Refusing to negociate with criminals and help fund security seems like the proper long-term reaction for everyone.

And this isn't virtue signaling - they literally did the virtuous thing that is better for society at the expense of their bottom line. Yes there are negative externalities in funding ransomware operations, not paying is still much more likely to hurt your customers than paying. Besides, if they were genuinely interested in positive externalities they would be spending the money lobbying for a ransomware payments ban and not donating to universities. While also encouraging further ransomware crimes in the future. While also encouraging further ransomware crimes in the future. If you don't pay, the odds they will publish your data are closer to 100%. Endpoint security is a well known open problem for what no sufficient practices and protections exist.

They failed so damn bad and it's hilariously bad and I feel awful for the somewhat competent coworker who was stuck on that team and dealt with how awful it was.Then we fired most of that team like 3 times because of how value negative they have been.Then my coworker and I rebuilt it in java in 2 months. It is 100x faster, has almost no bugs, accidentally avoided tons of data management bugs that plague the python version (because java can't have those problems the way we wrote it) and I built us tooling to achieve bug for bug compatibility (using trivial to patch out helpers), and it is trivially scalable but doesn't need to because it's so much faster and uses way less memory.If the people in charge of a project are fucking incompetent yeah nothing good will ever happen, but if you have even semi-competent people under reasonable management (neither of us are even close to rockstars) and the system you are trying to rewrite has obvious known flaws, plenty of time you will build a better system.

I am well aware that complete rebuilds rarely work out. To me it seems most likely that this is data collected during the KYC process during onboarding, meaning company documents, director passport or ID card scans, those kind of things. So the risk here for at least a few more years until all identity documents have expired is identity theft possibilities (e.g. fraudsters registering their company with another PSP using the stolen documents and then processing fraudulent payments until they get shut down, or signing up for bank accounts using their info and tax id). If you read between the lines of the verbiage here, it looks like a general archived dropbox of stuff like PDF documents which the onboarding team used.Since GDPR etc, items like passports, driving license data etc, has been kept in far more secure areas that low-level staff (e.g. people doing merchant onboarding) won't have easy access to.I could be wrong but I would be fairly surprised if JPGs of passports were kept alongside docx files of merchant onboarding questionnaires.

Register as a director/officer with any FSI in North America and you'll see. They would submit an online form with their business, director and UBO details, that data would be stored in the Checkout.com merchants database, and any supporting documents like passport scans would be stored in a cloud storage system, just like the one that got hacked.If it was just some internal PDFs used by the onboarding team, probably they wouldn't make such a big announcement.

Every country you operate in has different rules and regulations and you have to integrate with many third party systems as well as governmental entities etc, and sometimes you have to do really really technically backwards things.Some integrations I remember were stuff like cron jobs sending CSV files via FTP which were automatically picked up.

This sort of data is generally treated very differently to the actual PANs and payment information (which are highly encrypted using HSMs).So it's obviously shitty to get hacked, but if it was just KYB (or KYC) type information, it's not harming any individuals. Fair play on them for being open about this. But I'm sorry!What kind of an apology is that? It's marketing for the public while they contact the "less than 25% of [their] current merchant base" whose (presumably sensitive) information was somehow in "internal operational documents".Oh but also took some of what they charge their customers and gave that (undisclosed?) > Something that was on the counter is gone!

Yes, that's why cryptocurrencies are a gift from heaven for these hacker groups.Therefore, even if paying ransom money (somehow) must be legal, maybe it should be illegal to use crypto for it.

Unless you're positing some very specific, unusual situation, this isn't how tax deductibility works. The dollar amount of a tax deductible donation is subtracted from your taxable income, not from your tax bill. So you're getting a discount on the donation equal to your marginal tax rate. If your marginal tax rate is 30%, you'll save 30% of $10,000 = $3,000 in taxes. It's their money in this case so they can burn it any way they want and great to see they didn't support script kiddies here (assuming it was some leftover files on forgotten object storage bucket, sadly unencrypted or with keys available nearby).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 30) underway this week, researchers have shared a first look at this year's carbon emissions data. The findings show that global emissions from fossil fuels are on track to hit a record high in 2025. The Global Carbon Budget report, produced by an international team of more than 130 scientists and published on Wednesday, predicts roughly 42 billion tons (38 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuels this year. Based on this and other factors, limiting global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels—the threshold set by the Paris Agreement in 2015—will be virtually impossible, the authors conclude. In times like these, it's easy to despair. Believe it or not, the report isn't all bad news. While the data suggests that fossil fuel emissions have risen, total global carbon emissions—a combination of emissions from fossil fuels and land use—are projected to be slightly lower than last year. “There are certainly signs in [the report] that emissions are really starting to slow down their increase or change direction,” said Piers Forster, a professor of physical climate change and founding director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds, who was not involved in the study. The report also highlights a projected decline in emissions from land-use change—most notably deforestation. This was what tipped the scales on total global carbon emissions this year, slightly offsetting the rise in fossil fuel emissions. “And reforestation is also slowly increasing.” That said, emissions from deforestation and land-use change are still far from zero, he clarified. First and foremost, looking at the global carbon budget report for a single year is not a good indication of long-term progress—or lack thereof—toward climate goals, Friedlingstein notes. Still, these reports are crucial for keeping the international community on track and informing year-to-year decisions on emission reduction strategies and targets. It's also worth noting that the report only looks at CO2 emissions—it does not account for other greenhouse gases such as methane. “We've still got heaps to go,” Forster said. “I mean, we've got greenhouse gas emissions at an all-time high. We've got a tiny remaining carbon budget to [avoid] 1.5℃. Rising global temperatures have reduced the efficiency of land and ocean carbon sinks, essentially weakening Earth's ability to counteract humanity's growing emissions. In spite of these circumstances, both Friedlingstein and Forster emphasize that hope is key to progress, and progress is our only hope. Though Forster said he is not optimistic based on what the current research shows, he finds hope at the UN climate negotiations. “Cooperation between countries is so important,” he said. “I think there are still actors in every country who do see the threat of climate change and want to make a difference.” Ahead of COP30, Gates calls for a shift in focus away from near-term emissions goals. As global temperatures rise, some scientists believe we need to do everything we can to prevent catastrophic warming—no matter how crazy some potential solutions may sound. Scientists are seriously considering mimicking volcanic eruptions to mitigate global warming, but that comes with more than a few issues. Now, Antarctica is the only place left on Earth untouched by these pests.</p>
