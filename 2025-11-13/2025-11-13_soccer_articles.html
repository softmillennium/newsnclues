                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Substitute Chidera Ejuke restored Nigeria's lead early in extra time and their advantage was hammered home by two clinical Victor Osimhen strikes. Osimhen could, however, have stopped us needing extra time but badly squandered a huge chance in the final minute of second-half stoppage time. Nigeria will face the winner of this evening's other semi-final between DR Congo and Cameroon in Sunday's final. It is difficult to make an exact estimate, but there cannot have been more than 2,500 fans when the teams emerged. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) announced the day before that supporters with tickets for AFCON could attend this game and Cameroon vs DR Congo for free. Nigeria fans finally emerged just after that incident in the 59th minute. They were stationed in the upper tier but started banging their own drums and quickly drowned out the boos from Gabon's support when they arrived. After a dramatic 48 hours in the build-up to this game, which saw Nigeria's squad boycott training due to a dispute with the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), they have taken another step towards qualifying for next year's World Cup. If they had lost to Gabon, supporters would have criticised the timing of their feud and argued whether they could have waited until the end of these play-offs. Those concerns might still be raised if they lose to Cameroon or DR Congo on Sunday, but they have at least temporarily silenced the noise around them. We mentioned earlier on how committed Alex Iwobi has been to Nigeria over the last 10 years and he was absolutely superb today. If you missed it, that was his 90th appearance for his country — only three men have more Nigeria caps (Ahmed Musa, Vincent Enyeama and Joseph Yobo). The 29-year-old Fulham international did everything in his powers to ensure he and his team-mates have a chance at playing in next summer's World Cup. We know that Nigeria will play here again on Sunday evening, but we don't yet know who they will be playing against in that match. One thing is for sure, Nigeria will have to be a lot better than they were in normal time today if they want to win again in a few days' time. Then he came up trumps in that extra-time period with two great finishes. Nigeria fans will be hoping to see the Osimhen of extra time in Sunday's game... How is the blood pressure after that one, Nigeria fans? Victor Osimhen couldn't finish it off in normal time, but put the game beyond all doubt in extra time with two great strikes. I can only imagine the entire country of Nigeria is asking why he couldn't have done that earlier on! But that all matters very little now as he and his team-mates advance to the next stage. Nigeria know that they need three more wins to book a place at the 2026 World Cup... Nigeria move through to the CAF play-off final against Cameroon or DR Congo as their 2026 World Cup qualification campaign continues. That makes it a whole extra half hour of time added on today. Both teams just playing out time before the end now. Gabon have a decent effort from inside the box saved by Nwabali. Gabon's Nze Samake rattles into a tough tackle on Frank Onyeka, who goes down pretending to be injured, gets up to start some pushing and shoving, then promptly goes down pretending to be injured again. Wilfred Ndidi's drive from outside the box is well saved by Loyce Mbaba! Corner and Nigeria are content to see out time now. Victor Osimhen is off and will not secure a treble today. The striker will be wrapped up in cotton wool, you'd have thought, ahead of the weekend's play-off final match against Cameroon or DR Congo. Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare is on in his place. Gabon are losing their tempers here and Alex Moucketou-Moussounda is booked after a tasty challenge on Wilfred Ndidi. Iwobi receives a long hug from one of Nigeria's backroom staff. He looked knackered but thirty seconds later he jumped off the bench and threw his water bottle on the floor when Osimhen made it 4-1. Despite being on the angle and facing away from goal, he levered a strong low effort past a flat-footed Mbaba and into the corner. They will not be going to the World Cup unless a miracle of all football miracles happens. Victor Osimhen has two and Nigeria are basically into the play-off final. Off come midfielder Alex Iwobi and right-back Bright Osayi-Samuel. The Nigeria goalkeeper has been lax and casual in possession inside his penalty area on several occasions already and has nearly been caught on it a couple of times. A fantastic quarter of an hour or so for Nigeria.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigeria advanced to the final of African play-offs for the 2026 Fifa World Cup following a dramatic 4-1 win over Gabon after extra time. Chidera Ejuke and Victor Osimhen struck in the first period of added time after the match in Rabat had ended 1-1 after 90 minutes. Nigeria will face either Cameroon or DR Congo in Africa's play-off final on Sunday (19:00 GMT). Nigeria missed out on Qatar 2022 and their bid to return to the finals has seen numerous twists and turns over the course of a two-year campaign, including two changes of manager. The Super Eagles only qualified for the African play-offs on goal difference after a 91st-minute strike in their final group game against Benin, and players and technical staff boycotted training on Tuesday over unpaid allowances and match bonuses. Adams was denied early on and Osimhen headed wide from nine yards before Gabon goalkeeper Loyce Mbaba made two brilliant reflex saves. Yet, after referee Abongile Tom spent over three minutes studying his pitch-side monitor and in conversation with Video Assistant Referee Akhona Makalima, the appeals were turned down.

The Super Eagles somehow kept their dreams alive of reaching next year's finals by thrashing Benin in a decisive game back in October. Only the winners of this month's mini-tournament will secure their place in the inter-continental playoffs next March and compete for one of two spots in the World Cup group stage. All matches are being staged in Morocco, giving this the feel of a condensed Africa Cup of Nations, with Africa's premier competition taking place in the country in December. Venue: Moulay Hassan Stadium (Rabat, Morocco)Referee: Tom Abongile (South Africa) Nigeria (4-4-2, right to left): Nwabali (GK) — Osayi-Samuel, Fredrick, Bassey, Sanusi — Chukwueze (Ejuke), Iwobi, Ndidi, Lookman (Simon) — Adams (8. Gabon (4-3-3, right to left): Mbaba (GK) — Ondele, Oyono, Ecuele, Ekoumie — Openda (Meyo), M. Lemina, Ndong (Samake) — Aubameyang, Biyogo (N. Lemina), Bouanga BET NOW: Latest odds and predictions for Nigeria vs. Gabon We'll have 30 minutes of extra time and, if needed, a penalty shootout... Aubameyang's pass is cut out by Wilfred Ndidi, and suddenly, Gabon are wide open at the back. A simple pass sends Osimhen through on goal, all alone, but his attempted finish bobbles harmlessly wide of the target. 90+6 mins: All the pressure is coming from Nigeria, but Gabon are holding firm. 90+2 mins: Ejuke slides a throughball into Osimhen's path, but he drags his low shot wide of the far post. 90 mins: We're going to have TWELVE minutes of added time... It looked like Gabon's dreams of a first World Cup were over, but they've snatched a leveller through Mario Lemina. Osayi-Samuel's header falls kindly to the midfielder, who sets himself before trying to bend a shot into the far corner. It takes a big deflection, wrong-foots Nwabali, and flies into the net. 85 mins: Brentford's Frank Onyeka is on for the goal-scorer and tidies up in front of his own box well as Gabon attack down the left, highlighting just why he's been brought on. Nigeria have five minutes plus added time to hold on. It's a horrible moment for Gabon, as a loose pass in defence from Ondele is pounced upon by Akor Adams. Mbaba had come off his line to intercept but realised he wouldn't get there, and Adams simply had to move into space and slot the ball into the empty net. 67 mins: It's all got a bit cagey again (unsurprisingly, given what is at stake). Aron Ondele looked like he had his shirt pulled as a free-kick was crossed into the box... and VAR recommends a review! 45+6 mins: Into the sixth minute of added time, and 36-year-old Aubameyang has just engaged in a foot race with Fredrick, a defender 16 years his junior. It was pretty close, too; Fredrick eventually makes a good block to stop the striker getting a shot on target. He turns back onto his left foot to create space for the shot, but it's a tame effort, easily saved by Nwabali. 37 mins: Chance wasted on the break there by Gabon. The LAFC man chose to shoot from a difficult angle rather than pull the ball back across, and his effort was blocked. 32 mins: Royce Openda looks lively down the Gabon right. He wins their first corner with his latest positive run, but Nigeria scramble the delivery clear. Ademola Lookman's cross is headed down by Osimhen, two Gabon defenders get in a complete muddle, and Mbaba has to spring to his right to stop the ball crossing the line. Gabon can't keep giving him opportunities like that. Osimhen with another header, this time under pressure around six yards from goal, but Mbaba gets down to his right and claws the ball away. Akor Adams floats in a cross from the left, Loyce Mbaba comes and gets nowhere near it, but Osimhen can't hit the target with a header from 12 yards! He then gets clattered by the goalkeeper for his trouble and requires some treatment. Sensibly, he is wearing his face mask again today. 13 mins: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's first involvement ends in a looping cross that Nwabali catches well. He then kicks it straight to Anthony Oyono, who tries to chip the keeper from halfway and misses by... well, a lot. 9 mins: It's been (unsurprisingly) a fairly cagey start. 15 mins before kickoff: It's not exactly a packed house here in Rabat in this pouring rain, but the fans who have made the trip are making a good amount of noise. 1 hour before kickoff: The team news is in! Eric Chelle makes two changes from the Benin game last month: in come Bright Osayi-Samuel and Ademola Lookman, with Semi Ajayi and Moses Simon making way. 1 hour 30 mins before kickoff: The importance of this game can't be ignored, and yet Nigeria's players caused a storm earlier in the week when they went on strike over a dispute with the country's football federation relating to bonus payments. However, captain William Troost-Ekong announced via X on Wednesday that the issue was "resolved". Team is UNITED and focussed as before on representing NIGERIA with our maximum for the games ahead! This CAF World Cup qualifying playoff semifinal takes place at the Moulay Hassan Stadium in Rabat, Morocco and kicks off on Thursday, November 13 at 5 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: Moses Simon and Samuel Chukwueze provided plenty of opportunities for hat-trick hero Victor Osimhen last time out, but Simon makes way this time for Ademola Lookman. There is also a change in defence, with Semi Ajayi dropping out and Bright Osayi-Samuel coming in, which likely means Benjamin Fredrick moving to centre-back. Nigeria (4-4-2, right to left): Nwabali (GK) — Osayi-Samuel, Fredrick, Bassey, Sanusi — Chukwueze, Iwobi, Ndidi, Lookman — Adams, Osimhen Nigeria subs: Okoye, Troost-Ekong, Ejuke, Onyeka, Arokodare, Onyemaechi, Abdullahi, Simon, Obasogie, Nwadike, Awaziem, Olusegun Gabon are missing a handful of key players, including Jim Allevinah, Shavy Babicka, Medwin Biteghe, Michel Mboula, and Junior Noubi Fotso. Much like Nigeria and Osimhen, their hopes will largely rest on the shoulders of their most famous star forward: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the Marseille striker, who has four goals in 10 Ligue 1 games this season. Gabon (4-3-3, right to left): Mbaba (GK) — Ondele, Oyono, Ecuele, Ekoumie — Openda, Lemina, Ndong — Aubameyang, Biyogo, Bouanga Joe Wright is a Senior Editor at Sporting News, overseeing global soccer and multisport.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Pulisic named his dream U.S. men's national team five-a-side team and did not include Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan or Tim Howard, instead opting for “more recent” American stars. Months after the exchange of words, Pulisic was asked to put together his ultimate USMNT five-a-side team by Kate Scott in an exclusive interview with Paramount+. The USMNT captain rattled off Brad Guzan in goal, followed by Weston McKennie, Tyler Adams, himself and Oguchi Onyewu. Pulisic noticeably left off Dempsey, Donovan and Howard, who are widely considered the three best players in USMNT history. The forward, though, did preface his picks by stating, “I'm just going to go more recent, because they're my guys.” “Earlier on in my career, going into the national team, I kind of had this [weight] of, ‘Oh, this new kid is playing in Europe and now he's on the national team and—at least this is what I thought in my head, which looking back is stupid—I'm expected to score goals. I have to win games for the team,'” Pulisic said. “But now I've gotten to a place, especially now with the other top players who are playing around the world on huge teams... I'm not the only one who's going to be able to make a difference in games now with this national team, so I'm really grateful for that.” Indeed, the Stars and Stripes have a wealth of talent playing in Europe's top five leagues. From Chris Richards and Antonee Robinson to Folarin Balogun and Tim Weah, Mauricio Pochettino has the talent he needs to make a statement at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, unfolding largely on home soil for the first time since 1994.

The Kennedy Center booked the World Cup draw at President Donald Trump's urging. It will occupy much of the campus and displace planned performances.

FIFA will not pay a rental fee when it takes over much of the Kennedy Center later this month for the 2026 World Cup draw, according to a copy of the venue use agreement obtained by The Washington Post and other internal documents. The center's arrangement with soccer's international governing body will disrupt its performance schedule, forcing the relocation or postponement of several concerts at an institution that has seen a sharp decline in ticket sales since it was taken over by President Donald Trump earlier this year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was meant to be a simple training session ahead of the Albiceleste's friendly against Angola, but it turned into a football festival unlike anything the Spanish city had ever seen. Official attendance figures clocked at 20,085, which transformed the modest Martínez Valero Stadium into a cauldron of emotion. Hours before the gates opened, fans had already begun forming queues stretching around the blocks, chanting songs and holding homemade banners bearing Messi's face. Argentina's national flag illuminated giant screens, while the phrase "Coronados de gloria vivamos" (Let us live crowned with glory) stretched across the main stand. Around it were towering images of Maradona, Messi, and the current squad, creating an unforgettable tribute to the lineage of Argentine greatness. Every flick of Messi's boots was met with loud cheers. Argentina's training session two days earlier had been held behind closed doors. Still, fans climbed hills, fences, and rooftops just to catch a glimpse of Messi or De Paul. Their passion and persistence prompted the Argentine Football Association to make a last-minute decision and throw open Thursday's session to the public. He wrote on social media: "It had been a while since I'd been here, and honestly, the affection you always showed me everywhere I went still moves me. It's always a pleasure to see you all again!!" He later posted a heartfelt message about "missing the place with his soul," sparking a fresh wave of speculation about a possible short-term return ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Barcelona president Joan Laporta, however, was quick to temper the growing excitement. Speaking to Catalunya Radio, he dismissed any notion of Messi rejoining the club as a player. "Out of respect for Messi, our players, and our members, it's not the time to speculate with unrealistic scenarios," he said. He did, however, confirm that the club intends to hold a grand tribute to Messi once Camp Nou's renovations are complete. "When they explained how it happened, I think it was a sweet little spur-of-the-moment decision; he'd just finished dinner and felt like coming with some friends. Messi's emotional ties to Barcelona remain unbroken, but professionally, his path is set. Earlier this year, he signed a new deal with Inter Miami, extending his stay in the MLS through to the 2028 season. He's happy in Florida and enjoying life with his family, and yet, still, he has also hinted at longing for his old home. He told Sport: "We miss Barcelona a lot, that the children continuously, and my wife, talk about Barcelona, the idea of living there again. Messi is expected to start when Argentina take on Angola on Friday before returning to club duties with Inter Miami on November 23, when the Herons will play the MLS Conference semi-finals against Cincinnati.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (Nov. 13, 2025) – The U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team will come together for a training camp in Fayetteville, Ga., the future home of the Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center, for a training camp running from Nov. 24-Dec. 1. There were four players on the USA's 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup Team that fell in penalty kicks in the quarterfinal to eventual runners-up Netherlands that were born in 2009 and one that was born in 2010, making them age-eligible for the 2026 FIFA U-17 WWC. The only player on this roster with U-17 caps is midfielder Loradana Paletta, who has four. She is also the only player born in 2011 on this roster. Goalkeepers (3): Anneliese Braun (Mountain View Los Altos SC; Los Altos, Calif.), Alexis Fischer (Eclipse Select SC; Chicago, Ill.), Avellina Saunders (Utah Royals FC Arizona; Phoenix, Ariz.) Defenders (8): Sophia Ahrens (St. Louis Scott Gallagher; Fenton, Mo. ), Kendra Hansen (Pateadores SC; Tustin, Calif.), Madeline Maves (Crossfire Premier SC; Seattle, Wash.), Sam Ogden (Kansas City Athletics; Overland Park, Mo. ), Camille Toussant (Louisiana TDP Elite; French Settlement, La. Midfielders (7): Mia Corona (Legends FC; Cypress, Calif.), Jordyn Heathcock (FC Dallas; Edmond, Okla.), Lilah Helwig (FC DELCO; Frackville, Pa.), Taylor Morrell (Virginia Development Academy; Leesburg, Va.), Grace Murray (Beach Futbol Club; Redondo Beach, Calif.), Loradana Paletta (New York City FC; Syosset, N.Y.), Caroline Swann (Dallas Trinity FC; Dallas, Texas) Forwards (6): Kylie Berk (Penn Fusion SA; Sewell, N.J.), Gianna Hanf (Match Fit Academy; Chesterfield, N.J.), Alexia Hansen (FC Prime; West Palm Beach, Fla.), Anna Korney (Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC; Penfield, Pa.), Amari Manning (Players Development Academy; Flemington, N.J.), Deus Stanislaus (Players Development Academy; Fort Washington, Pa.)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a population of just over 34,000 -- making it the fifth-smallest recognized country in the world -- San Marino is actually the larger but significantly less famous of two microstates within Italy (as far as we know, Vatican City does not have a FIFA-recognized squad). Thus far, in their quest to play for the world's soccer championship in North America next summer, La Serenissima have lost every one of their seven World Cup qualifying matches, scoring just one goal and allowing 32. So, you would be forgiven for assuming that all hope is lost for San Marino to play in the next World Cup -- but that is not actually so. European teams are awarded 16 of the 48 World Cup bids. As fate would have it, San Marino actually won their three-team Nations League group for the 2024-25 season, notching two wins over Liechtenstein (another European microstate) and holding off Gibraltar with a draw and a loss. In other words, if -- and only if -- at least 10 of those countries finish first (and directly qualify for the World Cup) or second (and already qualify for a playoff spot) in their World Cup groups. And, this is where things start to get messy. As we enter the final week of qualifying games, eight teams that could have earned Nations League bids have already qualified for the World Cup and, therefore, don't need them. This means that San Marino's hopes basically rely on having just two other countries pull out a second-place finish in their groups. If Nations League group winner Northern Ireland beat Slovakia in their World Cup qualifier on Friday, they would move into second in UEFA World Cup qualifying Group A and be in very good shape to stay there. Then, on Saturday, if Romania -- yet another Nations League group winner -- defeat Bosnia and Herzegovina, those two countries would be tied for second in UEFA World Cup qualifying Group H -- a group which also includes San Marino. Should this sequence of events come to pass, it will set up the scenario where, when San Marino plays Romania on Nov. 18, La Serenissima will be incentivized to lose by as many goals as possible to ensure the Romanians move on in the traditional World Cup qualifying process and abandon their slot in the Nations League playoff, allowing San Marino to take that spot. It's the kind of dizzying logistical nightmare that FIFA has been trying to avoid since the "Disgrace of Gijón," when West Germany and Austria allegedly colluded in their final group stage match to allow both teams to advance in the 1982 World Cup, subsequently eliminating Algeria. If San Marino does find themselves with incentive to lose to Romania by as much as possible, though, it begs the question: How would sportsbooks make lines for the match? For starters, it should be noted that World Cup qualifying handle is not currently a popular betting commodity for soccer, let alone compared to the rest of the menu at sportsbooks: BetMGM soccer trader Tom Pullin told ESPN over email that "interest in World Cup qualifying has been good, but not as high as regular league football like the Premier League." Further, he said that San Marino's matches don't stand out unless they play a high-profile team. In these World Cup qualifiers, San Marino have, predictably, not been given a chance by bookmakers. At ESPN BET, San Marino's shortest odds to win a match were against Cyprus on Oct. 12 when they were +1300 on the three-way money line. Their longest odds were an astounding 100-1 against Austria just one match prior on Oct. 9. The big-money bettors who did tune in for these matches also predictably faded San Marino at every turn, according to BetMGM and DraftKings. However, Caesars Sportsbook's head of soccer and UK sports Mark Bickerdike said that many bettors "love a big underdog story," so the book racked up solid liability on lots of smaller wagers at long odds. Which brings us back to the potential "doomsday scenario" on Nov. 18. But should the extraordinary happen and San Marino actually do end up with a chance to advance in World Cup qualifying by losing a match spectacularly, it sets up an absolutely epic dilemma. FIFA rules, of course, prohibit teams from purposely losing matches, but given how poorly things have already gone for San Marino in World Cup qualifying -- one of their matches against Austria ended in a 10-0 drubbing -- it would be difficult to prove that La Serenissima did anything out of the ordinary at all.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Almost a year later, though, the initial excitement has given way to serious concern. His biggest weakness — an inability to pin down a clear tactical approach — is becoming impossible for fans to brush off. When US Soccer went all in on Pochettino in September 2024, the plan was to give the national team a much-needed dose of ambition and a winning mentality. But the reality with the USMNT under Pochettino has been a team that just can't quite decide on its identity. Pochettino's biggest problem has been figuring out a playing style that works. He just can't seem to settle on a formation — has been playing with a 4–2–3–1 one minute, a 3–4–2–1 the next — and has shuffled his starting line-up so much that it's starting to feel like players themselves are just not sure what to expect. Pochettino has been constantly tinkering with his tactics, resulting in players being left in the dark as to what to do next. We saw this play out in a losing March 2025 Nations League match against Panama ; not the first time we've seen US players look just unsure of what was going on, either in possession of the ball or when they lost it. Worse yet, Pochettino's explanation for it hasn't been particularly helpful . He calls his system “organized chaos” and claims he hates being predictable, which, on paper, sounds great , but in practice, is creating more questions than answers. But at the international level, things are just a lot more complicated. Fans are left asking the same questions: what does this team look like at its best? And how does the team adapt when it gets down to business under pressure? And at this point, the answers just aren't there. With the World Cup less than a year away and it's being held on home soil, the pressure is really on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this knockout phase, four teams will be fighting for their chance to reach the biggest competition of all. Here's everything you need to know. Four teams will face off in a format with two semi-finals, followed by a final. But the qualifying ticket for the World Cup won't be handed to the country that wins this tournament just yet. Two of these teams will then secure the final spots for the 2026 World Cup. All these matches are taking place in Rabat, Morocco, at the El Barid Stadium and the Prince Moulay El Hassan Sports Complex. The final will be played this Sunday, November 16. In a group dominated from start to finish by Ivory Coast, Gabon still managed to secure their spot in the play-offs. While they had their fate in their own hands just a few matches before the end of the qualifiers, the Congolese suffered a crushing home defeat to Senegal (2-3) after leading 2-0. Now, here they are in the play-offs. For their part, Cameroon secured a place in the play-offs by finishing behind Cape Verde, who made history by qualifying for their first ever World Cup. Finally, Nigeria is the surprise survivor of this tournament. This article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence. You can read the original version in 🇫🇷 here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Qualification for the 2026 World Cup is hitting a critical juncture. A few more can be secured as World Cup qualifiers take place during FIFA's November international window. England is the only squad that has claimed one of UEFA's 16 allotted World Cup spots.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is the first time Kansas City will hold a global sporting event of this scale, with about 650,000 expected to come into town for the games. That's a big crowd, and fans both locally and from around the globe will want to be part of the action. Because we're Midwest nice, KCUR decided to make it easier for you to jump on the World Cup bandwagon and bring your superfan A-game. And don't worry, we'll update information regularly on this page so you can keep up as the World Cup approaches and more details develop. Find more of KCUR's World Cup coverage here. Bonus: Join KCUR on Saturday, Nov. 15 at Strange Day Brewing for a special discussion about the World Cup, and then watch the USA vs. Paraguay match! The 2026 FIFA World Cup is a 104-game tournament featuring 48 competing countries. It will kick off June 11, 2026, at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. You can see a live countdown clock for the start of the tournament here or get a selfie in front of one at Kansas City's Union Station entrance lobby, or at Terminal A inside the new Kansas City International Airport. The tournament will last 39 days and take place across 16 North American cities. Yes, but ticketing for all games — including the ones in Kansas City — happens in phases through a lottery draw system. Phase 1 and 2 of the ticket draws have closed, and successful entrants should already be notified of their opportunity to purchase tickets. Fans will be able to apply for specific matches once those matchups are announced. Then, at some point closer to the tournament's start, fans can purchase last minute tickets on a first-come, first-served basis. For information on the resale/exchange marketplace or travel visa requirements, read FIFA's ticket site very carefully. Kansas City will host six matches at GEHA Arrowhead Stadium, which will be renamed Kansas City Stadium for the tournament: We won't know which Group Stage teams will play until the draw on Dec. 5, 2025. They've been recruiting volunteers and offering resources for local businesses. KC 2026 is also planning an elaborate Fan Fest experience on the lawn in front of the National WWI Museum and Memorial with a giant screen, stage and activities. That's a way for anyone to interact with the World Cup excitement in Kansas City, even if you don't have tickets to a game. You can expect to find watch parties and festivities at Power & Light, which has served as an iconic soccer gathering zone in the past, as well as other pop ups across the city. (He knows a thing or two about themes for championship-winning teams.) Local businesses, and art groups, are already preparing for the influx of people, as are the Kansas City Police Department and the advocacy group MOCSA, which is leading sexual-assault intervention trainings for service industry workers. KC 2026 announced in March 2025 that they procured 200 extra buses to help with transportation by tapping into and expanding our existing routes. This will include routes to matches at Arrowhead Stadium, the airport, hotel centers and key destinations on both sides of the state line. KC 2026 has yet to announce a concrete plan of what this new service will look like or how it will operate. In the meantime, here are Ride KC's bus maps and schedules. The newly expanded, and free, KC Streetcar line has a live tracker you can monitor. This fun guide from KCUR can help you explore every stop along the route. While the streetcar is a great way to move through midtown and downtown Kansas City (and soon make it to a Current match on the riverfront), it won't get you to Arrowhead Stadium itself. The city also offers paratransit RideShare and BikeShare. Lyft and Uber operate in the city, as well, but expect demand to cause high prices. And it was Kansas City businessman Lamar Hunt, more famously known as the patriarch of the Chiefs, who was instrumental in developing professional soccer leagues and attracting the country's last FIFA World Cup, back in 1994. Now Kansas City has two professional soccer teams: a men's MLS team, Sporting KC, and a women's NWSL team, the Current. You can even find local supporter groups for clubs around the globe. We also just happen to be the hometown of Jason Sudeikis, co-creator and star of the popular soccer series, Ted Lasso -- which recently shot its fourth season in Kansas City. Sudeikis said the show was partly inspired by his actual childhood coach at Shawnee Mission West High School. This article explains the U.S. National team's schedule for FIFA's international window, friendlies and other tournaments. Technically, this upcoming 2026 FIFA tournament started soon after the last one ended, in September 2023. You can already find their international match calendar into 2030. A record 48 teams will qualify to compete in the upcoming 2026 games, making this the biggest FIFA World Cup tournament ever. These are the 121 nations that didn't qualify. Geographically, FIFA puts member countries into six continental confederations, which then get a determined amount of qualifying spots. World Cup teams have to take a smaller roster and abide by player age limits — and it's not a FIFA-sanctioned tournament.) The FIFA World Cup tournament is broken down into different rounds. That way you'll be ready in those especially heated moments. They failed to qualify at all in 2018, but advanced to the knockout stage in 2022 before being defeated by the Netherlands. By contrast, the women's national team has qualified for every single Women's FIFA World Cup since the first one in 1991, and has won four of them, mostly recently in 2019 against the Netherlands. We won't know exactly who will be on the full 26-man roster until the games get closer, but a key person to keep an eye out for is star forward Christian Pulisic, who plays for AC Milan. A former Argentinian player who once played in World Cup games, his coaching experience lies more in the European leagues. We're not likely to see many Kansas City player connections on the men's national team, like when Sporting KC's Graham Zusi and Matt Besler played in the 2014 tournament. But 2024 MLS Assistant referee of the year Kyle Atkins, a Kansas City resident and Kansas State grad, refereed in the 2022 Qatar World Cup Games and could be a part of the upcoming games. If you're rooting for the USA, red, white and blue are your go-to colors, obviously. If you're rooting for a different country, the chants and colors will tend to match that particular nation's flag, That can be a fun way to experience the World Cup even if you're not particularly invested. If you're planning an elaborate outfit, or even something simple for fan fest or the game, be sure to check requirements for what's allowed ahead of time so you can have fun and not worry about being denied access. The World Cup promises to be both an intense and exciting time in Kansas City -- maybe a little annoying for locals going about their normal lives, and all-consuming for the wild fans expected to descend upon the region. So be ready, and let's show the world what Kansas City has to offer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Miami CF forward Lionel Messi (10) celebrates after scoring against Nashville SC during the first half at Chase Stadium. (Reuters) - Barcelona president Joan Laporta has downplayed the possibility of Lionel Messi returning to the club, calling it unrealistic, following the Argentine's surprise visit to the revamped Camp Nou, where he spent 21 years of his glittering career. Messi, who joined Barca's youth academy as a 13-year-old and became their all-time leading scorer with 672 goals in 778 appearances, left the Catalan side in 2021 when they could not make it financially viable to keep him. The 38-year-old World Cup winner, who now plays for Inter Miami, visited the iconic stadium on Sunday and expressed his desire to return there one day. "I hope that one day I can return, and not just to say goodbye as a player, as I never got to do," the eight-times Ballon d'Or winner had said. "Out of respect to Messi, all the club staff and the club members, it's not right for me to speculate on something that would not be realistic, and it's not the moment to do it," Laporta told Catalunya Radio on Wednesday. During Messi's storied Barca career, he won 10 LaLiga titles, four Champions League crowns and three Club World Cups. Messi, who moved to Paris St Germain on a free transfer after his Barca exit, extended his contract with Inter Miami in October and has previously hinted that the Major League Soccer club would likely be his last. Laporta said that Barca would like to give Messi a tribute at Camp Nou once the renovations — set to expand the stadium's capacity to 105,000 — are completed. It would be wonderful to have his tribute here, in front of 105,000 fans."</p>
