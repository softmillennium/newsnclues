                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is 20 years since Florida police first investigated the financier Jeffrey Epstein for the sexual abuse of underage girls; six years since he killed himself in prison following his arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges; and more than a year since Donald Trump said that he would have “no problem” with releasing the FBI files on the offender. It is not only about their own behaviour, but about any knowledge or suspicion of his crimes, and willingness to overlook them. Mr Trump has said that he had “no idea” about Epstein's crimes. On Wednesday, questions were reignited by the Democrats' release of emails in which Epstein described Mr Trump as “that dog that hasn't barked”, adding that “[victim's name redacted] spent hours at my house with him”. Republicans said the victim was the late Virginia Giuffre, who told lawyers that “I don't think Donald Trump participated in anything”. Mr Trump, who has mainstreamed and legitimised conspiracy politics and the championing of emotion over fact, attacks the issue as a “hoax”. The very people who urged Maga supporters to pursue this story – such as Kash Patel, now FBI chief – abruptly changed their minds this year without adequate explanation. Republicans released thousands of documents in response to the emails published by Democrats. The Republicans took a drubbing in off-year elections last week, and Mr Trump's approval rating is the lowest of this term. Mr Trump has shaken off troubles that would have ended any other political career – including E Jean Carroll's successful civil suit against him for sexual abuse (which he is again asking the supreme court to dismiss) and two dozen allegations of sexual assault, which he denies. For the Maga base, previously fired up by lurid and false “Pizzagate” claims of a paedophile ring connected to the Democratic political elite, this remains a burning issue. Their claims about Epstein's circle have at times been partisan, provably wrong and antisemitic. A fuller reckoning for his associates – from across the political spectrum – is overdue.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Developed by Spectral Games, likely best known for its work on Medieval Dynasty New Settlement, The Lightkeepers takes place in the 1920s in a world “where daylight unveils discoveries and nightfall demands survival.” Though it's unclear exactly how many players this supports, you're tasked with exploring mysterious islands and solving puzzles to prepare for the imminent threat. Revealed during today's VR Games Showcase, The Lightkeepers promises “new challenges, different enemies, and unpredictable places” across each expedition, featuring weapons ranging from muddy rifles to hand-crafted grenades. The studio states light comes at a price, while fending off the dark involves exploring, crafting, and directly fighting these nocturnal terrors as a team. Last month saw Curvature Games share more about The Amusement, an Art Deco-style roomscale adventure that's inspired both aesthetically and in its setting by Luna Parks during the 1920s post-war period.

When Will Tracy first watched Save the Green Planet! — a 2003 South Korean cult classic from writer-director Jang Joon-hwan — he didn't expect it to spark one of the most distinctive collaborations of his career. “I'd never seen or even heard of it,” he tells Gold Derby. I wanted to work very freely in adaptation and create something that stands on its own.” That “something” became Bugonia, Yorgos Lanthimos' latest genre-bending fever dream starring Emma Stone as a powerful tech CEO and Jesse Plemons as the conspiracy theorist who kidnaps her, convinced she's part of an alien plot. The Succession and Menu writer penned the script in three pandemic-era weeks — “not thinking anything would really happen with it” — before it landed in Lanthimos' hands through mutual friend Ari Aster. Related Stories ‘Fallout' Season 2: Everything to know about the show's return to Prime Video as new trailer drops TV showrunners roundtable: ‘Nobody Wants This,' ‘Chad Powers,' ‘The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox,' and ‘Murdaugh: Death in the Family' “In my imagination, I felt maybe a kind of forbidding aura to him,” he admits. “But he just doesn't play that at all.” Instead, Lanthimos gave only a few direct notes — mostly on structure and tone. “It was nothing with dialogue or scenes,” Tracy says. “It was more about reordering and changing emphasis to make things slightly more ambiguous and less explicit.” He made the revisions in just a few days. “They really did treat it almost like a play,” he adds. Tracy's script diverges sharply from Save the Green Planet!, which mixes kidnapping, conspiracy, and slapstick into a dizzying blend of sci-fi and satire. “I just wanted to get these two people — really three — from extreme ends of a cultural-political divide in one space together,” he says. He structured the film around three escalating “set-piece chats,” building tension through words rather than violence. “That escalation is what I wanted to hang the movie's hat on,” Tracy says. That, he says, is what it felt like watching Lanthimos bring Bugonia to life. We're in Whitney Houston, voice of a generation territory. “It's quite easy now to be cynical and demonize people who believe these theories,” Tracy notes. “I wanted to approach the conspiracy theorist with empathy. In what ways has he been abused by the system? Tracy always imagined the CEO as female — even before Emma Stone's casting. Once Lanthimos joined, he realized a younger, Silicon Valley-style executive made more sense. Opposite her, Jesse Plemons plays Teddy, with newcomer Aidan Vis as cousin Don. “Aidan spends his first film mainly in a room with the two finest actors of their generation,” Tracy marvels. Tracy still feels the loss of HBO's juggernaut, where he helped shape its fourth-season finale. “I was the first vote to say, ‘Let's end it at four,'” he recalls. He still keeps in touch with castmates — “Kieran Culkin, Sarah Snook, Jeremy Strong — they're all doing incredible things” — and jokes that the Roy family could easily wander into Bugonia. “Kendall would try to convince the kidnapper, ‘I'm just like you, man,'” he laughs. Shiv would probably come closest to surviving — she can hide the football a little better. But Logan — he would have broken Teddy and Don within the first hour." For now, Tracy's savoring the rare creative harmony he found with Lanthimos. “You almost feel a slight sadness while it's happening, thinking, 'I might not get this again.

In recent weeks, Donald Trump's supporters have begun to align around the idea that a Democrat-led “grand conspiracy” – potentially involving former president Barack Obama – has been plotting against the US president since 2016. The focus of the fightback by Trump's supporters is in Miami, where a Trump-appointed US attorney, Jason A. Reding Quiñones, has begun to issue subpoenas to a wide range of former officials. This has included former CIA director John Brennan, former FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok, former FBI attorney Lisa Page and former director of national intelligence James Clapper, all of whom were involved in the federal investigation into alleged links between Russian intelligence and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. There's been a constant stream of allegations and counter-allegations. The “two-tier” justice system that has persecuted Trump can only be rebalanced by pursuing those who investigated him in 2017 and 2021. The QAnon movement, whose most famous claim is of a global paedophile ring run out of a Washington pizza parlour involving senior Democrats, is one where disparate claims are sporadically and partially evidenced. The story is that hidden government and proxy networks manipulate the truth and judicial outcomes and that only through pressure from “truthers” (what many people in the US who believe conspiracy theories call themselves) will wrongdoers be brought to account. Once these ideas are popularised, they take on a momentum and a direction that is difficult to control. Soon after his inauguration, Trump set up a “weaponization working group” within the Department of Justice. Its director, Ed Martin, said in May that he would expose and discredit people he believes to be guilty, even if the evidence wasn't sufficient to charge them: “If they can be charged, we'll charge them. But if they can't be charged, we will name them. And we will name them, and in a culture that respects shame, they should be people that are ashamed.” Even without full court hearings on specific charges, being forced to provide testimony or documents creates suspicion around those who are targeted. Criticism from legal officials that this is a “indict first, investigate second” method suggests that this is a break from historical norms. Lawfare, defined as “legal action undertaken as part of a hostile campaign”, doesn't require a successful prosecution. It merely requires enough investigative activity to solidify a narrative of suspected guilt and enough costs and pressure to seriously inconvenience those affected by it. In that way, political retaliation has become a prosecuting objective. Some of these steps involve using state power to target political opponents, degrading checks and balances and making loyalty a legal requirement. There are reasons to believe that the US seems to be tracking this trajectory currently, certainly when it comes to using the Justice Department to harass the president's political enemies and pushing back against court judgments while attacking the judges that have issued them. The right-wing QAnon movement, for example, has been exceptionally agile. It has offered its followers identity, community spaces and a logic that encourages active participation, exhorting believers to “do your own research”, for example. This makes it far simpler for broader conspiracies to gain traction and more difficult for politicians and journalists to work out what is conspiracy and what is evidence. This is creating a problematic feedback loop – hints of wrongdoing fuel public suspicion, and public suspicion fuels the idea of a further need for investigation. But to suggest that anyone has control over this would be wrong. Marjorie Taylor-Greene's determination to release the full and unredacted Epstein files could well produce negative outcomes for some Maga supporters, including prominent ones. So, the transformation of legal process into public spectacle in America is suggestive of a drift towards authoritarianism. America's famous “constitutional guardrails” of separation of powers, independent courts, juries and counsels will be pivotal in preventing this.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The film's screenplay was extrapolated from real-life urban myths about mysterious men in back suits (MIBs) who would visit people who had allegedly been abducted by aliens. MIBs had already appeared in "The X-Files," and their legend was passed around ufology circles for years. Sonnenfeld's "Men in Black" imagined the lives of MIBs as, essentially, sci-fi immigration officials, charged with policing the extraterrestrials living on Earth. Because the existence of aliens on Earth would cause a public panic, the Men in Black operate entirely in secret. The two main characters of "Men in Black" are agents J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones). The Men in Black operate out of a massive airport-like headquarters building that's always bustling with extraterrestrial activity. Human and aliens work together to protect the wellbeing and interests of all alien immigrants, while also engaging in a large-scale technology exchange — meaning the Men in Black have alien cars and guns at their disposal. Welch discussed his amazing sets for "Men in Black" (which earned an Academy Award nomination) in a 2022 oral history for Inverse, where he discussed his inspiration for his Headquarters designs, as well as the unfortunately toxic materials he used to build it. Bo Welch said that he liked the idea of Men in Black Headquarters looking like a 1960s-era airport terminal: a huge, long building full of steel walkways and shiny columns. Specifically, he emulated the architect Eero Saarinen, known for designing a terminal at JFK. Duffield said that Welch was fond of how ridiculous the columns looked. It gave them a fun, retro-futurist look, but it's clear that they wouldn't be able to hold up a building. They were then painted with chrome and polished to a shine. The silver chrome paint, though, was not a healthy substance to breathe in. So we had brilliant sculptor-plasterers who spun that shape out of fiberglass and foam; coated them; but then the polished metal finish involved spraying some horribly toxic metallic material onto the body of that thing. Sadly, Welch did not win the Oscar that year, perhaps predictably losing to "Titanic." It's a pity, as Welch has always done good work.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We hear a lot about how artificial intelligence will change our future. It's expected to transform fields like health care, education, data analysis and transportation — and in many ways it already has. Hundreds of small business owners and entrepreneurs gathered in Scottsdale last month to talk strategy at the Grow2025 Conference, presented by the public company Thryv, which specializes in helping the little guy. We work with small businesses, help them get found by customers, help them convert that interest into a sale, and then help them nurture those customers so they come back in the future," Walsh said. Lately, Walsh said, the AI landscape has been shifting rapidly as humans, especially young people, have become more comfortable with it. He believes it could be a game-changer for his clients. “You know, when you have a new paradigm that shows up, whatever it is, it sort of breaks down some of the incumbent advantages and opens the playing field to go again,” Walsh said. “There's a brand new way to play. That's happening now with AI," he added. How it's happening depends on the business, of course. Jennifer George is owner of Northern Arizona Roof Services in Flagstaff. There's also programs like Eagleview or GAF Measure that uses satellites to measure the roofs and then report to us square footages and all that information. So, it is already been used in the industry," George said. George added they also use it for appointments and other automated reminders and will soon need to implement it for just about everything. Angela Okyere is in a similar business. She's a product manager for Phoenix-based ChimSpect, which specializes in chimney inspection software. “I use AI every single day to organize my business and to get better at what I do," Okyere said. “For all of us, it's really easy to say, ‘help me edit this email', but that's just the very basic level of what it can do. How am I matching up with my competitors? From roofs and chimneys to video production. Patrick Noone is VP of marketing at Scottsdale-based MultiMedia Communications. But he said they aren't yet replacing humans in his business, and hopefully never will. There's a lot of AI that can pseudo-human people right. I don't think there's gonna be a full replacement. There's still a relationship part of it, and that's what we really focus on," Noone said. Meanwhile, could you be soon visiting your AI dentist? Dr. Kamran Ruintan has been working on teeth for more than 30 years in the Valley. And who better than a fortune teller to ask about the future of artificial intelligence. “I use AI to take the information that I get from the spirits or guides or whatever you want to call that, and turn it in to blog posts or emails and that kind of thing. “Clearly, it's going to have a bigger role in our lives and our economies and all of those places. I feel like there does need to be some sense of control on it, but I feel like there are some many other positive things about it because it has helped my business tremendously," Stahl said. And obviously every good thing comes with a couple of bad things, so there are ways we'll have to guard against it and protect it and people will find some diabolical things to do with it. But I think there's a huge net positive.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How do you make live theater feel dangerous? The jump scare is a classic horror movie trope, but  can that be adapted to the stage without a quick cut or crash zoom? “To create a show featuring an undercurrent of creeping dread and the shifting sands of not quite trusting what you're seeing really spoke to me,” said director Felix Barrett  on a video call from London with writer Levi Holloway and illusion designer Chris Fisher, who recently  won  a Special Tony Award for the  illusions and technical effects  for “Stranger Things: The First Shadow.” ‘The Hunger Games: On Stage' debuts Wednesday at a custom-built London theater designed as an interactive arena with moving seats and immersive effects, which amplify the novel's brutal themes. The “Paranormal Activity” films famously use a found-footage style to induce chills. Seven films later, the play was born, and the haunting continues with a new couple in a new home. To start, the group workshopped a handful of illusions that Fisher built, which they considered key sequences for the unfolding action and plot. “We worked out some of these big moments — before Fly [Davis] even designed the set — to understand the infrastructure that would be needed,” Fisher explained. Fisher was then able to dictate crucial design issues to make his illusions work, such as where a certain cupboard should be in the kitchen, the ideal position of a sofa and the framing of a window. After that, the team got to work figuring out what kind of house the haunted couple  would live in   and what neighborhood it occupied. All these details figured into Holloway's final script. The team gave itself a unique challenge in its decision to not abstract the space, said Holloway, whose horror-themed thriller “Grey House,” starring Laurie Metcalf, premiered on Broadway in 2023. We didn't allow ourselves the space to camouflage anything, and that in itself is its own kind of  immersion.” Barrett knows a thing or two about immersion. As the founder and artistic director of Punchdrunk theater company, he directed a show loosely based on “Macbeth,” called “Sleep No More,” which invited audiences to roam through the McKittrick Hotel in New York City, experiencing the production in various areas and rooms at their own pace. It played more than 5,000 performances during a 14-year run. The director said he and Holloway  have a shared attraction to tension that builds slowly and methodically, like in a turn-of-the-century Gothic horror novella — such as Arthur Machen's “The Great God Pan.”  That slow burn, with its attendant low hum of fear and anxiety, is achieved onstage largely through misdirection. “You're almost tricking the audience, where they're looking at the whole picture, and you're able to seed things and tease things and make them paranoid about where they should be looking.” The new stage show, starring JoJo Levesque and Leslie Rodriguez Kritzer, celebrates ‘80s music and girl power in its debut at the La Jolla Playhouse. “How do we make a doorway  become the most threatening thing in this house?” Barrett asked. Controlling the audience's gaze is key so you can focus it on one thing while another thing is happening. The play originally premiered at  England's Leeds Playhouse in July 2024. Earlier this year it staged its North American premiere in Chicago and it's now landing at the Ahmanson while work is being done simultaneously to open it on London's West End in December. “As time has gone on, it's been made leaner and more potent in its form,” said Holloway. “There's something chilling about building a threat inside of the mundane.” Ends Dec. 7Tickets: Start at $40.25Contact: (213) 628-2772 or CenterTheatreGroup.orgRunning time: 2 hours (one intermission) Get our big stories about Hollywood, film, television, music, arts, culture and more right in your inbox as soon as they publish.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not just because it's a Wolverine comic, but because this new Ultimate universe has made it clear it plays by its own rules—or by the Maker's, in some cases. It's been a wild and messy ride so far, and now that we know this universe is heading toward its end, Ultimate Wolverine is only ramping up towards what looks like a devastating conclusion. With their location compromised, the team was forced to relocate to a temporary base of operations, where issue #11 picks up. He calls back to major players taken off the board, like Professor Xavier and Jean Grey, while also tying up what's left in play. Earlier in the series, we learned that the Eurasian Republic had taken Xavier's brain with plans to weaponize it (which might be the second or third time that's happened in comic history), and now they make good on that threat. Using a device that turns Xavier's brain into a kind of psychic bomb, the Republic unleashes it on the Opposition, seemingly wiping out everyone but Wolverine in one brutal stroke. I was admittedly very hopeful in this moment, silently wishing for Logan to succeed in his attempt to stop the explosion. But as an X-Men fan, it's hard to feel truly shocked in this moment. This was essentially another mutant massacre—we've seen it plenty of times—but it still stings to watch familiar faces fall, even in an alternate universe. Cappuccio and Valenza continue to deliver stellar work on art and colors, giving every page a distinct, gritty feel that perfectly suits the bleak setting and emotional wreckage these characters are living through. By the time this run ends, I'm not sure anyone will be left standing, but I can't wait to see who, if anyone, comes out on top. Furious after the events of issue #10, Magik, Colossus and OmegaRed will have their vengeance! Can the Opposition survive Dr. Prostovich's "Psychic Bomb"?! Will Wolverine be able to protect the friends he's only just been reunited with?</p>
