                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's also the site of an aggressive cancer called pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or PDAC. It's difficult to detect and recurs about 70% of the time after treatment. Only 13% of those diagnosed survive more than five years. A team of surgeons, anesthesiologists and engineers at the University of Illinois Chicago is studying how lidocaine, a common local anesthetic, affects pancreatic cancer cells released into the bloodstream during surgery. Their latest advancement evaluates a method for capturing these rogue cells and is published in the journal Lab on a Chip. I really expect that the results of this study may help our patients. The notion that lidocaine, which has been used to relieve pain for more than 65 years, may mitigate metastasis and favorably affect patient outcomes is highly innovative." In 2018, Votta-Velis received a grant from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine for this project. Circulating tumor cells are cancerous cells that break away from the tumor - often during tumor-removal surgery - and escape into the bloodstream. Patients with more aggressive circulating tumor cells in their blood have poorer prognoses and higher recurrence rates. Votta-Velis said patients must recover from surgery before starting chemotherapy. In that window of time, circulating tumor cells, or CTCs, can travel throughout the body and spawn new tumors. But preliminary in-vitro studies have shown that lidocaine may hamper cells from bursting back out of the bloodstream, instead trapping them to be naturally cleaned out by our immune systems. "If we can detect them and decrease their aggressiveness with lidocaine infusion, we may lower the risk of the metastatic process." Because circulating tumor cells are rare, isolating them could mean pulling 30 to 40 cells out of the billions in our bloodstream - just like pulling a needle from a haystack. He specializes in microfluidics: how small amounts of fluids, like blood, flow through minute channels. Cancer cells also tend to be softer and more moldable," Papautsky said. In 2019, Papautsky's team demonstrated that this method picks out cancer cells with 93% accuracy. This time, the researchers compared Papautsky's method to a commercially available tool called EasySep, which pulls cells apart magnetically. Papautsky said magnetic separation can be harsh and sometimes destroy the cells it's attempting to catch. The researchers tested both systems - EasySep and their original method - with blood samples from pancreatic cancer patients. "The method's success is so important for asymptomatic cancers like pancreatic cancer, where a blood draw may be the only way to diagnose early," Papautsky said. "Science is based on little steps," said Giulianotti, who is a world-renowned expert in the surgical treatment of hepatobiliary pancreatic cancer malignancies. Most malignant cancers in humans spread through the bloodstream. Additional UIC researchers include Celine Macaraniag, Ifra Khan, Alexandra Barabanova, Valentina Valle and Alain Borgeat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Platelets are small, disc-shaped cell fragments in the blood that are essential to stop bleeding and to initiate blood clotting after injury. Despite being a standard clinical practice, platelet transfusions face issues related to the availability of blood donations from which platelets are isolated, the relatively short shelf life of purified platelets, and the risk of an immune response in patients receiving platelets from unmatched donors. A potential solution to this has been proposed by the team of Koji Eto at the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application at Kyoto University, Japan, who invented a method for manufacturing platelet-producing cells, megakaryocytes, from stem cells. Via genetic engineering, Koji's team first made so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and then converted them into megakaryocytes in the lab. Platelets can then be harvested from the megakaryocyte cultures and given back to the same patient, thereby avoiding immune rejection. Although this strategy, in theory, provides an unlimited supply of patient-derived platelets, some impediments towards industrial large-scale production remain, most notably variable efficiency of platelet production from megakaryocytes across different patients and a decrease in productivity over time. In their work published today in Stem Cell Reports, Eto's team addresses these issues by showing that megakaryocyte growth is directly linked to platelet production and is controlled by the protein KAT7, which acts as a "molecular switch." While megakaryocytes with high KAT7 levels divide fast and make high amounts of platelets, megakaryocytes with low KAT7 levels switch behavior-they stop multiplying, accumulate DNA damage, and produce more inflammatory proteins-while at the same time ceasing platelet production. Monitoring KAT7 levels can potentially be used for quality control during clinical-scale production and thus be leveraged to ensure efficient and consistent platelet manufacturing across patients. Aging-dependent reduction of KAT7/HBO1 activity impairs imMKCL-based platelet production by promoting immune properties.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Young sexual minority men – a term used to describe gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men – with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms are more likely to begin using substances such as cigarettes, alcohol, cannabis, stimulants and illicit drugs at an earlier age, according to Rutgers Health researchers. The study, published in the Journal of Gay & Lesbian Mental Health and led by the Center for Health, Identity, Behavior & Prevention Studies (CHIBPS) at the Rutgers School of Public Health, analyzed data from 597 young sexual minority men to assess ADHD symptoms and their associations with substance use. The researchers found clinically significant ADHD symptoms were both common and strongly associated with heightened risk and earlier initiation of substance use. Inattentive symptoms were closely tied to cigarette use, while both inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms predicted earlier use across all substances assessed. "Given that young sexual minority men are disproportionately impacted by several other mental and physical health problems, this phenomenon warrants further attention from healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers alike," said Kristen Krause, an assistant professor at the School of Public Health and co-author of the study. The connection between ADHD and early-onset substance use was stronger among bisexual men than among gay men, suggesting that tailored prevention strategies may be needed to address distinct vulnerabilities within the sexual minority population. Early identification of ADHD and intervention strategies could help reduce long-term health disparities in this group. At CHIBPS, we have long understood that health risks do not occur in a vacuum but that they are the result of the complex interplay of person, social conditions, and physical and mental health. Modern and relevant public health approaches recognize that simply telling people to become vaccinated, wear a condom every time, and/or of banning menthol cigarettes is simply not enough." Halkitis, who is the director of the center, and the researchers said future studies should use different measurement tools to better estimate ADHD prevalence and severity in sexual minority men. Longitudinal approaches that account for factors such as resilience, mental health comorbidities and social support could offer deeper insights and inform more effective interventions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although penile cancer represents less than 1% of male malignancies, it carries substantial physical and psychological burden, with a five-year survival rate near 50%. Around half of Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) cases are associated with persistent HPV infection, which triggers oncogenic transformation via viral oncoproteins E6 and E7. However, the mechanisms behind this clinical advantage remain poorly understood. Given these challenges, it is necessary to explore the cellular ecosystem of HPV-associated PSCC using single-cell approaches. By comparing HPV-positive (HPV+) and HPV-negative (HPV−) tumors, the researchers revealed profound immune differences that may explain variations in prognosis and therapeutic response. The single-cell atlas provides a high-resolution reference for understanding how HPV infection shapes tumor immunity and microenvironmental dynamics. Using high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing, the team profiled immune, stromal, and epithelial cells from PSCC tissues to dissect their heterogeneity. Notably, HPV+-PSCC tumors showed an increased abundance of mast cells but a significant reduction in proliferative macrophages compared to HPV− cases. Gene ontology analysis revealed that inflammatory CAFs in HPV+-PSCC expressed higher levels of chemokines such as CXCL13, CXCL3, and CXCL12, suggesting enhanced immune recruitment. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed that CD8+ T cells in HPV+-PSCC expressed markedly lower levels of immune checkpoint molecules-including PDCD1 (PD-1), CTLA4, HAVCR2 (TIM-3), LAG3, and TIGIT-indicating reduced exhaustion and potentially greater antitumor activity. Ligand–receptor analysis highlighted that inhibitory signaling via TIGIT and its ligands (PVR, NECTIN2/3/4) was enriched in HPV− tumors, reinforcing their suppressed immune environment. "By identifying cell-type-specific immune signatures and signaling interactions, we can better understand why HPV-positive tumors tend to respond more favorably to therapy. These results also emphasize the importance of examining viral factors when designing personalized immunotherapy strategies for rare cancers like PSCC." This single-cell landscape offers a crucial resource for future research on viral-induced cancers and tumor immunology. The discovery that HPV-positive tumors harbor fewer exhausted CD8+ T cells and weaker inhibitory TIGIT–PVR signaling suggests potential biomarkers for prognosis and targets for immunotherapy. Therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring immune activation in HPV− tumors-such as TIGIT blockade or chemokine modulation-could enhance treatment efficacy. Beyond penile cancer, this study also provides a conceptual framework for understanding how viral infections shape tumor immune microenvironments across different cancer types.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The current kidney transplant waitlisting criterion is based on a single measurement of kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤20 ml/min/1.73m2) and does not consider an individual's risk of progressing to kidney failure. A new study reveals that inclusion of a patient's 2-year risk of progression to kidney failure (using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation [KFRE], which incorporates age, sex, urine albumin, and eGFR) as a decision-making tool toward pre-emptive listing for kidney transplantation, has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce racial disparities. The findings will be presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025 November 5–9. When examining the use of the 2-year risk of progression to kidney failure of ≥25% based on the KFRE as listing criterion and comparing it with the current eGFR ≤20 criterion, investigators found that among 10,368 US veterans with chronic kidney disease in 2022 who would meet at least one of the criteria, 60% met both and 20% met only one or the other. In 2022, veterans who only qualified by the eGFR ≤20 criterion were older (71 years) than those who only qualify by KFRE ≥25% (53 years). Also, using the kidney disease progression criteria only, more males, minorities (Hispanic, Black, and Asian), and those with diabetes and/or albuminuria would be waitlisted. Expanding the waitlisting criteria for kidney transplantation to include risk of kidney failure prioritizes individualized approaches to care and could improve outcomes in younger patients with chronic kidney disease, as well as improve racial parity in access to kidney transplantation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NYU Langone hospitals continue to receive elite distinctions in patient safety and quality, joining just 1 percent of hospitals nationwide to receive 11 consecutive "A" grades from The Leapfrog Group, a national nonprofit watchdog organization focused on healthcare safety and quality. Additionally, NYU Langone Hospital—Suffolk advanced from a "C" to a "B" Leapfrog grade just eight months after completing its merger with the health system. Since then, NYU Langone Hospital—Suffolk has expanded services and quality enhancements, such as shortening length of stay by more than a day, reducing arrival-to-provider wait times in the emergency department by more than 70 percent, to less than eight minutes, and advancing to an American College of Surgeons verified Level 2 adult trauma center. NYU Langone's reputation in the communities we serve is built on a foundation of safe, top-quality care, thanks to our teams who put their patients first every day. Leapfrog is one of the best barometers patients can look to in determining where to receive their care, and we are proud of these ratings. Alec Kimmelman, MD, PhD, Dean and CEO of NYU Langone Health Twice each year, The Leapfrog Group evaluates nearly 3,000 acute-care hospitals nationwide across 30 evidence-based patient safety performance measures, including the prevention of medical errors, injuries, accidents, infections and other potential harms to patients. Grades are assigned to hospitals across the country based on their performance regarding these measures. These grades are peer-reviewed, fully transparent and free to the public.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mursla Bio, a leader in Extracellular Vesicle (EV) science on a mission to advance precision diagnostics and significantly improve chronic disease outcomes for at-risk patients, today announced a collaboration with a leading global pharmaceutical company recognized for its expertise in precision medicine and biomarker-guided drug development. Under the collaboration, Mursla Bio's AI Precision Medicine Platform will generate hepatocyte-specific extracellular vesicle (h-EV) profiles from blood samples collected from a well-characterized cohort of patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and matched healthy controls. The collaboration will explore mode-of-action (MoA)-related biomarkers and evaluate biomarker panels to identify patients most likely to benefit from the pharmaceutical company's investigational therapy. The initial phase will focus on generating insights into liver tissue biology in MASH by building tissue-labeled, high dimensional mRNA and protein datasets from h-EVs in blood. This data will help define MoA-related pathways and patient stratification signatures, while strengthening Mursla Bio's AI liver disease models developed through its MEV01 clinical study and extending their applicability across future programs. Complementing Mursla Bio's lead product, EvoLiver™, developed for liver cancer surveillance among cirrhotic patients, the partnership broadens the clinical and translational reach of its clinically validated platform across metabolic liver diseases. The same infrastructure that enabled EvoLiver™ to achieve FDA Breakthrough Device Designation2 will be used to accelerate the translation of exploratory biomarkers into regulatory-grade companion diagnostics. This collaboration reflects the growing demand from global pharmaceutical leaders for our AI Precision Medicine Platform. By profiling intact hepatocyte biology protected within the cargo of h-EVs, we are enabling a new generation of biomarker-guided precision medicine in liver care. This partnership deepens our reach in hepatology, expanding on the foundation established with EvoLiver." Pierre Arsène, Founder and CEO of Mursla Bio MASH is an advanced stage of fatty liver disease, strongly associated with the global rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes. MASH affects 5-7 % of the world's adult population with more than 75 % of those classed as overweight, obese, and living with type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by the buildup of excess fat in the liver, which causes inflammation and cell damage. MASH can progress to irreversible scarring (cirrhosis) and, in some cases, lead to liver failure or liver cancer.
