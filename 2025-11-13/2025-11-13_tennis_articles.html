                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Henry Patten still has a chance to win the Nitto ATP Finals with partner Harri Heliovaara, but the Briton has already earned a win for life this week. “I've been with Ellie now for best part of 10 years, pretty much,” Patten told ATPTour.com. “It was coming at some point and as a tennis player, I don't get to see her that much throughout the year. And this is one of the trips that she chose to come on.” He ended up discovering Basilica di Superga, which has a view of the city. Went up there in the morning, really beautiful day, and then I told her to look over at the chimneys, made up some kind of excuse, and then proposed,” Patten said. And [she was] surprised, which I think gets me bonus points.” It is difficult for them to spend time together throughout the year because Stone is in her second year of medical residency in North Carolina. “She's a doctor, officially, but she is in the process of becoming fully trained as a doctor over there,” Patten said. It's not like she can do her job remotely. As excited as he was, Patten needed to refocus quickly to take the court inside Inalpi Arena Monday for his opening match of the year-end championships with Heliovaara against Christian Harrison and Evan King. The Briton hopes to make it as far as possible in Turin, but will leave the city with his head held high no matter what happens. “It's such a big deal to me, so much more important. We've been together for 10 years and I'll spend the rest of my life with her, which I'm incredibly excited about,” Patten said of his engagement. That being said, we're still taking the tennis pretty seriously.” No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner is turning into an indoor titan. The second seed's win against Alexander Zverev was his 28th in a row indoors and he shows no sign of slowing down. Sinner's winning streak is already the sixth longest in the Open Era (carpet not included) and dates back to the championship match in Turin two years ago, when he fell to Novak Djokovic. Only John McEnroe, Djokovic, Roger Federer and Ivan Lendl have won more consecutive indoor hard-court matches, with Federer accomplishing the feat twice. McEnroe owns the longest streak in the Open Era, having emerged victorious in 47 straight indoor hard-court matches from 1978 through 1987. Nobody else has won more than 35 in a row. Longest Indoor Hard-Court Winning Streaks in Open Era What is most impressive about Sinner's streak is not just that he has won, but how convincingly he has done so. In his 25 straight-sets wins, Sinner has needed just five tie-breaks. At last year's Nitto ATP Finals, Sinner did not drop more than four games in a set, becoming the first player to win the season finale without losing a set since Lendl in 1986. He has not lost a set through two matches this year in Turin, either. The 24-year-old has an idea of why he is successful in such conditions. So this for sure helps me a lot playing indoors,” Sinner said. Only McEnroe (85.3%), Lendl (83%), Jimmy Connors (81.6%) and Federer (81%) have won at a higher rate. No other active player, including Djokovic (80.2%), has won a better percentage of indoor matches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Townsend and Naomi Osaka went viral with a yacht dance video to a Minaj and 4 Non Blondes remix to as a part of their offseason vacation. The two stars set the Internet ablaze with a joint video posted to social media on Wednesday, where they could be seen dancing on a yacht to a mash-up of Minaj's 2012 song “Beez in the Trap” and 4 Non Blondes' 1993 chart-topper “What's Up?” The remix has gone viral on TikTok, with creators blending Minaj's verses and Linda Perry's famous vocals to create a remix that Rolling Stone says that the video app "can't get enough of." Looking cool on the clear-blue seas, Osaka stunned in a bejeweled blue swimsuit accented with multicolored beads, while Townsend wore black cut-out one-piece and layered in gold jewelry. "In the ocean trap with @naomiosaka," captioned Townsend on Instagram, where the post picked up nearly 100,000 likes less than a day after it was posted. A post shared by Taylor Townsend (@tay_taytownsend) "Beaches and I just get along." Two of the Hologic WTA Tour's touring mothers, Osaka and Townsend showcased an off-court bond more than once this season. After giving birth to son Adyn in 2021, Townsend returned to tennis a year later and had the best season of her career this season, which included an Australian Open win with Katerina Siniakova and an ascent to the World No. At the US Open, where Townsend reached the fourth round in singles and was runner-up with Siniakova in doubles, Osaka credited her hard work -- and joked that it was "sickening" that Townsend's "hardware collection grows every tournament." But Osaka's hardware collection grew this year, too. She reached two tour-level finals -- the ASB Classic and the Omnium Banque Nationale -- and also won a WTA 125 tournament in Saint-Malo, France.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gleison Bremer knows plenty about the challenges of elite sport. He is vice-captain of one of the world's most historic football teams, Juventus FC, while he has also earned five caps for the Brazilian national team. The 28-year-old, who is a big tennis fan and names Lorenzo Musetti, Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic as his favourite players, came to Turin's Inalpi Arena on Wednesday evening to take in the action at the Nitto ATP Finals. "Their mentality impresses me the most,” Bremer told ATPTour.com (in Italian), when asked about the differences between his own sport and tennis. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings and defending Turin champion. You May Also Like: Sinner tops Zverev for third time in 17 days, wins Borg group Of course, any Brazilian interested in tennis in 2025 can't help but be excited by the recent emergence of a breakout star from the South American country. Joao Fonseca won the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF and has backed that with a stellar 2025 season. The 19-year-old Fonseca rose to a career-high No. 24 in the PIF ATP Rankings earlier this month after lifting his maiden ATP 500 title at the Swiss Indoors Basel. For Bremer, the teenager from Rio de Janeiro has the potential to add his name to an iconic list of greats from a famously proud sporting nation. We missed great sportsmen in the past years. In the past we've had Pele, Ayrton Senna, Guga [Kuerten]."
