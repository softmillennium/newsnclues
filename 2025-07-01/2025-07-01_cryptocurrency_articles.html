                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's percent supply on exchanges has dropped below 15% for the first time since 2018. BTC price must remain above $100,000 to secure the upside. Bitcoin exchange reserves have fallen below 15%, suggesting a supply shock as institutional demand from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grows. Bitcoin (BTC) percent supply on exchanges has dropped to near seven-year lows, falling to 14.5% for the first time since August 2018, Glassnode data shows. Diminishing Bitcoin supply on exchanges may signal an incoming price rally fueled by a “supply shock,” which occurs when strong buyer demand meets decreasing available BTC. Related: Bitcoin hashrate down 15%, 26 firms add BTC to balance sheets: June in charts This trend usually signals rising investor confidence and a shift toward long-term holding. Whales often withdraw BTC after buying, signalling ongoing accumulation. With fewer coins available for sale, short-term sell pressure diminishes. Over-the-counter (OTC) desks, which facilitate large, private cryptocurrency trades, are also experiencing a tightening supply. The cumulative balance of BTC held in known OTC addresses is at historic lows. This increasing scarcity on exchanges and OTC desks can amplify price surges as demand outstrips supply. Bitcoin remained strong above the key $100,000 psychological support, a level it has held since May 28, despite seeing 2.85% losses over the last two days. Bitcoin's resilience above the $100,000 mark is backed by “strong institutional demand” and “shrinking,” according to Focusw3b Agency founder, Lau. According to data from SoSoValue, the streak began on June 9, with inflows of over $386 million and continued through Monday, with an additional $102 million in inflows. Maintaining the $100,000 psychological support will be critical for securing Bitcoin's upside and avoiding significant downside volatility. A potential Bitcoin correction below $100,000 would liquidate over $6.42 billion worth of cumulative leveraged long positions across all exchanges, CoinGlass data shows. Numerous analysts say that Bitcoin dropping below $100,000 is becoming less likely, setting optimistic targets for the rest of 2025 ranging from $140,000 to above $200,000.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BitMine Immersion Technologies said it has raised roughly $250 million in a private placement, selling about 55.56 million new shares at $4.50 apiece. The round was led by investment firm MOZAYYX with backing from Founders Fund, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital and other crypto-focused investors. Concurrently, BitMine appointed Wall Street strategist and Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee as chairman of the board. Lee likened the plan to MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy, arguing that Ethereum should benefit from the rapid growth of stablecoins and other on-chain applications. The company intends to track the amount of ETH held per share as a key performance metric and may add to the position through future capital-markets activity and reinvested cash flow. Investors cheered the announcement: BitMine's lightly traded shares surged as much as 400% to about $23.35 on Monday, lifting the firm's market value well above its prior roughly $26 million capitalization. The move underscores a growing trend among small publicly traded firms turning to ether, rather than bitcoin, to diversify corporate treasuries and tap into broader crypto-financial applications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Court records reveal that Kim and Jong were hired as developers by a Georgia-based blockchain R&D company and a Serbia-based virtual token firm, respectively. They applied under fabricated profiles that included fraudulent documentation, mixing real and stolen identity details. A month later, Kim Kwang Jin preyed on the flaws in the company's smart contract code, making off with nearly $740,000 of crypto assets. The stolen money was laundered through a digital currency mixing service to hide its origins, after which it was transferred to exchange accounts opened with forged Malaysian identity documents. These exchange accounts were managed by Kang Tae Bok and Chang Nam Il, other co-conspirators who also laundered the proceeds from the stolen money. All four were named in a five-count indictment, including wire fraud and money laundering charges. U.S. Attorney Theodore S. Hertzberg emphasized that the case reflects a growing and calculated threat from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), which uses IT operatives globally to circumvent sanctions and raise funds for state-run programs—including nuclear weapons development. “These individuals masked their true identities, exploited employer trust, and stole nearly a million dollars—all to support an authoritarian regime,” said Hertzberg. “We will continue to pursue any actor, domestic or foreign, who targets U.S. businesses.” Special Agent in Charge Paul Brown said the DPRK's use of fraudulent identities to breach blockchain companies highlights the distinct intersection between cyber security, national security, and financial crime. Authorities said the scam was part of a wider drive to form “revenue generation networks” that ultimately contribute to North Korea's strategic budget. These include high-profile cyberattacks, ransomware deployments, and now—direct infiltration into corporate teams through remote employment. Andrew Fierman, head of national security at blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis, commented that DPRK actors are increasingly embedding themselves within target firms: “They gather internal knowledge, manipulate systems from within, and even orchestrate insider breaches.” This insider model makes detection harder, especially when paired with advanced laundering techniques such as token mixing and the use of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to layer transactions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A crypto analyst has forecasted a powerful Wave 3 Bitcoin price rally that could take it toward new all-time highs between $160,000 and $200,000. Notably, this surge is expected to come with rising Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) and a delayed altcoin season, particularly if BTC can make a clean break above the $108,500 resistance level. The Bitcoin price is currently hovering below a critical resistance level at $108,500, and according to a crypto analyst known as ‘BigMike7335' on the X social media platform, a clean breakout and flip of this level into support could ignite an explosive Wave 3 bull run. Based on Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci Extension analysis, a successful move above this threshold could open the door to a bullish price surge with potential targets set in the $160,000 to $200,000 range. The analyst's chart shows that Bitcoin has already completed its Wave 1 of a five-wave impulse move, followed by an ABC corrective Wave 2. The market is also currently consolidating, and Bitcoin's bullish momentum appears to be rebuilding. These positive developments are supported by a rising Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) from the oversold region and a neutral-to-bullish RSI, both of which point toward upward price action. Notably, the 0.618 and 1.0 Fibonacci Extensions around $117,795 and $137,421, respectively, are highlighted as interim resistance zones where price momentum could temporarily slow before continuing upward. Furthermore, the analysis implies that during this powerful Wave 3 phase, Bitcoin Dominance will likely climb toward 70%. Crypto analyst TechDave has just sounded the alarm on what he calls the Bitcoin “launch signal”, a rare trigger that has only appeared four times in history and each time marked the start of major bull market rallies. Notably, the formation has led to exponential gains, with each bull market run typically peaking months later. Following this historical pattern, TechDave now predicts a fresh cycle top for Bitcoin at $375,000.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mastercard is deepening its push into crypto with plans to hire two senior leaders focused on digital assets and blockchain. The payments giant is recruiting for a Vice President, Head of Digital Assets Ecosystem Growth, and a Vice President, Head of Financial Institutions (FI) Growth, both based in  the U.S. “Excited to share two open roles on my team as Mastercard continues to build the next generation of payments and drive innovation across digital assets,” Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's head of crypto and blockchain, wrote in a LinkedIn post. The first role will oversee strategic partnerships across the digital asset sector, working with issuers, infrastructure providers and startups to scale solutions like Mastercard's Multi-Token Network (MTN) and Crypto Credential. The second role will focus on collaborating with financial institutions to develop blockchain uses, such as business payments, cross-border transactions and tokenized assets. Mastercard has been among the most active traditional finance firms exploring crypto, establishing ties across the ecosystem for years. Most recently, the company announced plans to integrate more stablecoins into its global payments network, building on existing support for Circle's USDC. It is also rolling out stablecoin-based cross-border transactions through Mastercard Move. In an interview with CoinDesk earlier this year, Dhamodharan said Mastercard's goal is to act as a bridge between blockchain networks and traditional finance, providing regulatory clarity while enabling new business models. He added that financial institutions need to “be very open to making [crypto] available as broadly as possible.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Avery Ching, co-founder and CEO of Aptos Labs, has joined CFTC's digital asset market subcommittee, which includes experts from major financial institutions like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Citadel to advise on digital asset regulations. On June 30, Aptos Labs, a blockchain technology company, announced its partnership with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Global Market Advisory Committee ( GMAC) to explore the complex landscape of cryptocurrency. “Avery will collaborate with other leaders from Web3 and financial services to help shape digital asset regulations.” Ching's partnership with CFTC is poised to reshape the crypto regulatory playbook. Avery Ching's CFTC Collaboration Signals New Era For Crypto Formerly, Ching helped in developing a Layer 1 blockchain infrastructure at Aptos, which gained him recognition for his rare technological and leadership experience. His experience in engineering and regulatory navigation will set him apart in the CFTC panel, which was long dominated by finance professionals. This collaboration represents a strategic move towards a balanced crypto regulatory landscape, which allows him to navigate both technological and regulatory domains. His former experience with Meta Diem equips him to contribute to the ongoing discussions regarding decentralized finance, digital asset classification, and risk management. While the CFTC subcommittee is intensifying scrutiny on stablecoins and central bank digital currency (CBDC), Ching's insights may shape the outcomes as Aptos engages with US states and federal regulators. The company is gaining governmental relevance as Wyoming selected Aptos for its WYST stabecoins. Besides, WYST, Bitwise also filed for an Aptos-linked ETF, while the company already holds three USD-pegged stablecoins. With all these digital currencies in the momentum, Ching is poised to influence the development of pragmatic innovation-friendly regulations, particularly around stablecoins and ETFs. Given Aptos's involvement with Wyoming's WYST stablecoin and the platform hosting other USD-pegged stablecoins, his collaboration with the CFTC is poised to shape clear and balanced regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, focusing on classification, risk management, and market integration. This partnership suggests a pivotal shift towards deeper integration between crypto and traditional finance. Having a blockchain technology CEO like Avery Ching advising a major financial regulator like the CFTC indicates a growing recognition that "Web3 builders" are essential for shaping the future of finance, promoting collaboration over pure enforcement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Local reports indicate that South Korea's central bank has suspended its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot program, pivoting the nation's focus toward a private, bank-led stablecoin initiative. The project launched earlier this year was a two-tier system involving a wholesale CBDC for interbank settlement and tokenized deposits for retail use by 100,000 citizens. However, the seven participating banks collectively spent nearly 35 billion won (about $26 million) on the initial three-month phase and were unwilling to proceed without a clear path to profitability. In the vacuum left by the state-led project, a consortium of eight major commercial banks, including KB Kookmin, Shinhan, and Woori, has formed to develop a won-pegged stablecoin. This initiative is actively supported by the Korea Financial Telecommunications and Clearings Institute (KFTC) and aims for a public launch in late 2025 or early 2026. The banks see a clear commercial advantage in issuing their own stablecoins, leveraging their customer base to create new revenue streams and prevent disintermediation from fintech rivals or a state-run currency. President Lee's administration is fast-tracking the “Digital Asset Basic Act,” legislation that provides a legal framework for stablecoins. The private sector has moved aggressively to secure its position. While BOK Governor Rhee has publicly conceded that won-backed stablecoins are necessary, he and other central bank officials continue to express grave concerns. They warn that a proliferation of private stablecoins could undermine monetary policy, create systemic risk reminiscent of the 2022 Terra/Luna collapse, and accelerate capital flight as users swap won-stablecoins for dollar-pegged alternatives. The central bank has advocated for a more cautious rollout, preferring that only highly regulated banks be allowed to issue stablecoins initially before expanding to non-bank entities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although the cryptocurrency market has seen a slight decline in recent days, Bitcoin continues to dominate. The total market capitalization excluding Bitcoin recovered by nearly 10% last week. Sitting at a critical support level of $1 trillion, the new week has started calmly for altcoins. If this support zone holds across the altcoin market, it could indicate that the capital flowing into crypto—currently dominated by Bitcoin—may begin to shift towards altcoins. In particular, expectations around ETFs, the possibility of early Fed rate cuts, and the launch of new altcoin-based products could support this transition. The ongoing ETF progress for Ethereum, the launch of a staking-integrated ETF for Solana, and rising institutional interest in Bitcoin Cash are just some examples of this growing momentum toward altcoins. Now, the potential inclusion of staking could mark another turning point for ETH. The possible returns from introducing staking into ETFs, along with broader spot ETF approvals, remain powerful catalysts for Ethereum over the medium to long term. In the short term, however, ETH remains under technical pressure. Ethereum recently rebounded alongside the broader market following a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. As a result, ETH recovered the support level we've been monitoring at $2,430, driven by renewed buying interest. Currently, ETH is trading sideways above the $2,430 support, but ongoing pressure is making it difficult to break into the $2,500 region. If ETH manages to secure daily closes above $2,500, this could open the door for a move towards $2,700. However, if ETH—already under pressure—falls below the $2,430 support without any shock developments, we could see an increase in selling pressure. Launching on July 2, 2025, this product offers investors exposure to both SOL price action and passive staking income. This first-of-its-kind ETF has been met with short-term positive sentiment. However, this ETF development coincides with a weakening of Solana's network fundamentals. This suggests waning interest in Solana, which is also making it technically difficult for SOL to break out of its short-term downtrend. At this stage, sustained interest in the ETF could boost demand for SOL again. Recent buying activity in Solana helped break the short-term downtrend. In this case, we could see Solana advancing toward price targets of $165, $183, and $202, respectively. Bitcoin Cash has recently emerged as one of the market's standout assets. BCH, currently trading at $523, is revisiting levels not seen since December 2024. After beginning its uptrend in April, BCH was only marginally affected by the May correction and managed to maintain its positive momentum through June. That said, the sustainability of this uptrend will depend on broader market conditions and macroeconomic developments. If BCH can close above this level on a weekly basis, it could continue its momentum toward the $620 resistance, followed by a medium-term target range of $720–840. If BCH fails to break above $544, profit-taking may accelerate. Be sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What if using blockchain technology was as simple as saying "I want to buy concert tickets" instead of navigating through multiple wallets, bridges, and complex transaction sequences? What if the blockchain could understand your intentions and execute them seamlessly across multiple networks without you having to think about gas fees, slippage, or technical complexities? In a world where using cryptocurrency still feels like performing digital surgery for most people, Anoma is pioneering an "intent-centric" approach that could finally make blockchain technology as intuitive as sending a text message. Let's be honest: using decentralized applications today is like trying to order a coffee by explaining the molecular structure of caffeine. You'll need to understand gas fees, choose the right bridge, worry about slippage, and pray you don't accidentally send your tokens to the wrong address. The current blockchain ecosystem is fragmented across dozens of networks, each with its own rules, tokens, and user interfaces. Users need multiple wallets, must understand the intricacies of each blockchain, and often lose money to failed transactions or human error. It's no wonder that despite blockchain's revolutionary potential, mainstream adoption remains elusive. This fragmentation isn't just inconvenient—it's fundamentally limiting what's possible with decentralized technology. Anoma's solution is elegantly simple in concept but revolutionary in execution: instead of forcing users to specify exactly how they want something done, let them simply express what they want to achieve. With traditional blockchain transactions, you're forced to provide the turn-by-turn directions. Anoma's innovation rests on what they call the "Intent Machine"—a sophisticated system that processes user intentions and converts them into executable actions across multiple blockchains. Imagine a global network of problem-solvers constantly scanning for ways to fulfill user intents. When you express an intent to swap tokens, these solvers compete to find the most efficient path, often discovering opportunities you never would have found on your own. They might find arbitrage opportunities, better exchange rates, or more efficient routing that actually saves you money while fulfilling your intent. What sets Anoma apart from centralized solutions is its commitment to privacy. Using advanced cryptographic techniques including zero-knowledge proofs, Anoma ensures that your financial intents and transactions remain private. You control exactly what information gets shared and when, maintaining the privacy principles that make decentralized finance revolutionary. You can specify complex privacy preferences: "I want to trade these tokens, but don't reveal my identity unless the counterparty meets certain criteria," for example. While other projects have attempted to solve blockchain interoperability, most solutions feel like digital duct tape—functional but clunky. This means developers can build applications that seamlessly operate across Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cosmos, and any other compatible blockchain without having to understand the technical complexities of each network. But what's particularly interesting about Anoma's funding structure is how it balances institutional investment with community ownership. While 32% of tokens are allocated to backers, significant portions are reserved for the ecosystem (17%) and future public programs (16.3%), suggesting a commitment to decentralized ownership rather than pure venture capital control. Recent developments show Anoma's commitment to building a genuine community rather than just attracting speculators. The project has allocated 1% of its total token supply as rewards for community engagement, with 0.7% going to active community promoters and 0.3% supporting the broader ecosystem. This approach recognizes that blockchain technology succeeds or fails based on network effects—the more people using and building on the platform, the more valuable it becomes for everyone. By incentivizing genuine community participation rather than just token holding, Anoma is investing in its long-term sustainability. The potential applications of intent-centric blockchain technology extend far beyond simple token swaps. Complex DeFi Strategies: Instead of manually managing liquidity across multiple protocols, you could express an intent like "maximize my yield while keeping risk below X%" and let the network optimize your positions automatically. NFT and Gaming: "Buy the best weapon for my character under $100" could trigger a search across multiple NFT marketplaces and gaming platforms, finding options you never knew existed. Event Tickets and Real-World Assets: "Get me two tickets to the concert next week" could automatically search across multiple platforms, compare prices, verify authenticity, and complete the purchase using whatever tokens you have available. Automated Philanthropy: "Donate 2% of my portfolio gains to climate projects" could automatically execute regular donations based on your portfolio performance, finding the most effective organizations and handling all the technical details. Recent community discussions have also raised questions about whether Anoma will prioritize community members who test and support the network or focus on institutional partnerships and exchange listings. With $60+ million in funding, some community members worry about the project's commitment to decentralization principles. Beyond the technical innovations, Anoma represents a fundamental philosophical shift in how we think about blockchain technology. This shift from competition to cooperation could unlock possibilities we haven't even imagined yet. When developers can build across all blockchains simultaneously, when users can access all of DeFi through simple intentions, and when privacy and interoperability are built-in rather than bolted-on, we might finally see blockchain technology fulfill its promise of financial sovereignty and programmable money. The success of Anoma won't just be measured in token price or market capitalization—it'll be measured by whether it actually makes blockchain technology disappear into the background, becoming as invisible and intuitive as the internet infrastructure we rely on every day. If successful, it could be the bridge that finally connects blockchain's revolutionary potential with mainstream usability. For the broader technology world, it's a glimpse of what happens when we stop forcing humans to speak computer and start building computers that understand human intentions. Whether Anoma can deliver on its ambitious vision remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: projects like this are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with decentralized technology. In a space often dominated by speculation and hype, Anoma's focus on solving real usability problems offers hope that blockchain technology might finally be growing up. The intent-centric future may still be developing, but if Anoma succeeds, using blockchain technology could soon be as natural as expressing a wish—and watching it come true. In the wild world of cryptocurrency, where meme coins spawn overnight and fade just as quickly, something unusual is happening with Dalpy Coin. Before its presale has even begun, this Solana-based memecoin is already capturing attention from investors who pride themselves on being early to every party.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a blockchain banking revolution on the horizon, which altcoins could be poised to benefit? Circle's trust banking license aspirations follow its landmark IPO that valued the company at approximately $18B. Circle's USDC reserves, currently held and managed by BNY Mellon and BlackRock, would now benefit from in-house oversight, increasing credibility with institutional players. Compliance with the license demands that it not cross into deposit-taking or lending. So far, meeting compliance standards has led Circle to prioritize seeking licenses: CEO Jeremy Allaire emphasized Circle's commitment to building ‘an internet financial system that is transparent, efficient, and accessible.' That bill mandates clear reserve structures and full transparency to help normalize stablecoin use within legacy financial institutions. TradFi is increasingly exploring blockchain as a remedy to its woes. Aave founder Stani Kulechov highlighted the benefits blockchain brings to TradFi: unmatched global reach, instant access to digital financial products, and a global customer base. Kulechov envisions a future where DeFi protocols like Aave serve as global financial utilities, unhindered by siloed systems. Reports that a banking consortium including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo is considering issuing its own stablecoin overlook a salient point: TradFi will also have to overcome an increasingly strong first-mover advantage wielded by Circle and others. As Todd Ruoff, CEO of Autonomys, said, ‘the rules were written by crypto natives.' Circle is covered by licenses in 46 US states, plus by New York BitLicense, along with a $USDC market cap hovering around $61B. That's a big hurdle for any new TradFi/crypto banks to overcome. While the banks plan their entry into blockchain, these three altcoins are poised to make big gains. The key to First National Digital Assets Bank could rest in your crypto wallet. That's why you need the toughest crypto wallet around.

Learn how to buy Best Wallet Token and see why our own price prediction sees $BEST moving from its current $0.025265 to a potential $0.62 by 2026. Visit the presale page to buy or learn more. You want meme coins — the frenetic energy, crazy gains, and potential for wild swings that every degen craves. But you won't find those on your mainstream CEXs – at least, not very often. That's where Snorter Bot and the $SNORT token come in. Learn how to buy Snorter Token and visit the presale page. Donald Trump has gone big on crypto, both in his administration and personally. There's no room for big gains with $USD1 itself, but the token could anchor a much more significant crypto ecosystem from a US president who already has a stablecoin and his own meme coin. Circle's trust bank charter application is under regulatory review; approval would mark a significant milestone in bridging the TradFi and blockchain worlds. With Circle's bank charter bid, regulatory advances, DeFi's global potential, and the rise of institutional stablecoins, all the elements are emerging for an intertwined financial ecosystem. These three altcoins could be in line to benefit, but always do your own research.

CBEX used a "brandjacking" tactic, claimed to be licensed in the US, and said that a firm called ST Technologies International was responsible for the AI trading signals. mbarrassed and in debt, Edwin was left reeling after losing US$16,000 to CryptoBridge Exchange (CBEX), one of the crypto-trading platforms preying on investors in Africa. Edwin, a Kenyan government worker who only gave his first name out of shame, first encountered CBEX on Telegram, a messaging app. He was lured with promises of guaranteed monthly returns made possible by AI-powered trading systems, with lucrative referral bonuses, classic hallmarks of Ponzi schemes. But I was conned both by the platform and an agent who lied he could help recover my money," Edwin told AFP. When he began investing last August, there were initial returns, leading him to invest more despite lacking prior cryptocurrency trading experience. With exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, "Prospects" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape. By registering, you agree with The Jakarta Post's Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis says some $9.9 billion was lost to crypto scams globally last year. Such scams are not new in Africa, but their scale and sophistication has grown as cryptocurrency spreads. CBEX collapsed in April, leaving scores of investors like Edwin ruined, mainly in Kenya and Nigeria, according to media reports. But AFP has confirmed from accessing messages on CBEX's private Telegram groups that it has since rebooted its operations despite ongoing investigations and warnings by authorities. Abby, another Kenyan investor, carries the guilt of introducing 25 family and friends to CBEX. "(They) invested so much, and it all disappeared," he told AFP. In Nigeria, news of CBEX's collapse led to attacks on CBEX-affiliated offices, which have since closed. CBEX used the "brandjacking" tactic, adopting an acronym similar to the China Beijing Equity Exchange to give it legitimacy. It even obtained an anti-money laundering certificate from Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) this January, though the EFCC has clarified that this was only for "consultancy services", not for currency exchanges. To add further legitimacy, CBEX claimed it was established a decade ago and the ST team eight years ago. "If you check CBEX wallet addresses on-chain, they were only operating for about a year before the collapse," Kenyan cryptocurrency investigator Wycklife Sewe told AFP. While pretending to actively trade, CBEX actually moved funds out of investors' wallets via TRON (a decentralised blockchain network), said Sewe. "They have designed their system using code to fool you that your money is still there and you can see it growing. But your money is moved immediately after you deposit," Sewe said, adding that CBEX was also running other scams. CBEX has changed its website domain several times to avoid attracting attention. AFP found at least four registered by it. In April 2024, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, an independent market regulator, issued a public alert against "CBEX Group". A recent investigation by crypto analyst Specter linked CBEX's withdrawal wallets to darknet marketplace Huione Guarantee, a Cambodia-based platform known for providing illicit tools to facilitate crypto crime. The US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) designated Huione Group a "primary money-laundering concern" in May, saying that it had facilitated more than $4 billion in illegal transactions between August 2021 and January 2025. Following CBEX's collapse, Kenya's Capital Markets Authority issued an "Investor Alert" about unregulated platforms, and parliament is discussing a bill to regulate virtual assets. Nigeria's EFCC says it has arrested two people and put out warrants for eight others in Nigeria and Kenya. A Telegram spokesman told AFP that "scam content is removed when discovered and offending users banned". AFP found some CBEX Telegram groups were now labelled as scams on the platform. On June 10, CBEX, which had previously blamed hackers for the missing funds, claimed on its Telegram channels to have "compensated" the lost money. For victims like Abby, the way forward is easy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four North Koreans posed as remote developers for US and Serbian blockchain firms, stealing almost $1 million in crypto to fund the regime's illicit programs. According to the US Department of Justice (DOJ), Kim Kwang Jin, Kang Tae Bok, Jong Pong Ju and Chang Nam Il posed as remote IT developers using fake and stolen identities to conceal their North Korean citizenship. The group initially operated from the United Arab Emirates in 2019 before securing jobs at an Atlanta-based blockchain startup and a Serbian virtual token company between late 2020 and mid-2021. Prosecutors said Kim and Jong submitted fraudulent documents, including stolen and fabricated IDs, to secure their positions, a tactic US Attorney Theodore S. Hertzberg called a “unique threat” to businesses hiring remote IT workers. Once inside, the defendants used their privileged access to steal substantial sums. The stolen funds were then laundered through mixers and sent to exchange accounts controlled by Kang and Chang, all set up using fraudulent Malaysian IDs, investigators said. The case was part of the DOJ's DPRK RevGen: Domestic Enabler Initiative, a program launched in 2024 targeting North Korea's illicit revenue streams and US-based enablers. Related: North Korean hackers set up 3 shell companies to scam crypto devs In another incident, federal agents also conducted coordinated raids across 16 states, seizing almost 30 financial accounts, over 20 fraudulent websites and about 200 computers from so-called “laptop farms” that enabled North Korean operatives to appear as though they were working from the US. The DOJ announced Sunday that the schemes involved North Korean IT workers posing as US citizens, using stolen identities to gain jobs at over 100 American companies, funneling millions to Pyongyang and even accessing sensitive military data. Last month, the DOJ filed a civil forfeiture complaint to seize $7.74 million in crypto allegedly earned by North Korean IT workers posing as remote blockchain contractors by using fake identities.
