                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. A drone controlled by an unidentified party flew over the U.S. men's national team training session on Tuesday in St. Louis, where the group is preparing for Wednesday's Concacaf Gold Cup semifinal against Guatemala. The USMNT had three drones of their own to record their training session but the fourth drone came as a surprise, later landing outside the fenced perimeter and near a broadcast compound at the training site. It was not the only disruption during the USMNT's training session on Tuesday, with a group of people reportedly being caught filming the team before being asked to stop. It is currently unclear if the two incidents are related. While teams are more likely than they once were to use drones to record their own training sessions, there have been stories of teams from North America using drones to spy on their opponents. The most notable among them is the Canada drone scandal that rocked the 2024 Olympics, which later led FIFA to dock the women's national team six points and resulted in then-head coach Bev Priestman being fired from her post. The team had used drones to watch opponents' training sessions for years, per reports, in a practice introduced by John Herdman, formerly the head coach of both Canada's women's and men's national teams from 2011 to 2018. According to TSN, Herdman was heard discussing the practice as early as 2016 at the Concacaf U-17 Women's Championship. Herdman received a written admonishment in May following a disciplinary hearing in front of an independent commission. There is no gambling offered on this site.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Winners will face either Borussia Dortmund or Monterrey Get Involved: #bbcfootball, via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (UK only, standard message rates apply) Thibaut Courtois has to come out of his area and head the ball clear after he and team-mate Antonio Rudiger had got in each other's way with an attempted first clearance. Jude Bellingham, under pressure and closely marked, gives it to the Real captain, who shoots across goal but just wide of the far post. Remember, extra-time and penalties are both still possible. The winner of this tie will take on either Borussia Dortmund or Monterrey of Mexico in the quarter-final on 5 July. Dortmund and Monterrey start their last-16 tie at 02:00 BST on Wednesday. Expect Michele di Gregorio's wonderful one-handed save to deny Federico Valverde on a loop and to see it again and again during the half-time break. That has been the best moment of the match by some way, although Jude Bellingham also came close, only to see a shot cleared off the line by Daniele Rugani. Apart from that, not much to get excited about in the Miami heat. The ball is headed back by Juventus and it nearly fell for Real captain Federico Valverde, although he couldn't capitalise as he missed the attempted header. Trent Alexander-Arnold fizzes a low cross from the right and it causes panic among the Juventus defence, but no Real player can get a touch. Michael BrownFormer Premier League midfielder on Dazn Arda Guler shows a great piece of skill to take a pass on the chest and then lift the ball over Francisco Conceicao although his cross is then cut out. Then, as we move into injury time, Real's Federico Valverde creates the best moment of the match with a fine strike from 30 yards. Bright from Juventus' Khephren Thuram as he shows a fine burst of pace to gets some space down the left, only for his cross to be headed away at the near post by Aurelien Tchouameni. Michael BrownFormer Premier League midfielder on Dazn He'll be disappointed to have got nothing on that because he's got a long time to look at it. Arda Guler looks to provide some inspiration with a whipped in cross, but Real's Aurelien Tchouameni misjudges the header and can't get a touch on the delivery to send it goalwards. It has not been a great half of football, summed up with Juventus overhitting a cross from the left. We've already seen three of the six last-16 ties go to extra-time and that's what we'll have if it's level at 90 minutes. As we have got used to in this tournament, there is a cooling break at the 30-minute mark as the players desperately get a drink of water in the stifling conditions. We haven't mentioned Jude Bellingham much, until now. Yildiz has just said "whenever you give me the ball, I'm going to try and do something". The way he shifts it both ways is impressive. Real quickly earn a second corner and this time it goes short to Vinicius Jr, but, unmarked from 25 yards out, all he can do is drag it harmlessly off target. Aurelien Tchouameni has a strike from 25 yards for Real, but it is deflected wide for Real's first corner. Rate players out of 10 for this game. Read about our approach to external linking.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Phil Murphy believes the FIFA Club World Cup will be remembered as a “huge success” and will only set the stage for a memorable World Cup in 2026. MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, has hosted five Club World Cup group-stage matches, which averaged about 35,000-40,000 fans with “incredible energy,” Murphy said. Next year's FIFA World Cup final will also be played at MetLife Stadium on July 19, 2026 – which Murphy believes will be epic. “It will be the most watched event in human history,” Murphy told USA TODAY Sports in an interview on July 1. He played a crucial role in helping the New York/New Jersey effort in landing Club World Cup and World Cup matches at MetLife Stadium. But I think it's been a terrific idea,” Murphy said of the first Club World Cup to feature 32 teams and hosted in the U.S. this summer. “I think this is going to be looked at as a huge success.” The noise made by Brazilian clubs Palmeiras and Fluminense, Egyptian side Al Ahly, Portuguese club Porto, German standouts Borussia Dortmund and South Korean club Ulsan HD FC even eclipsed the noise made by fans attending NFL games featuring the New York Giants and Jets, Murphy said. “We regularly attend Giants or Jets football games there with 70,000 to 80,000, and the decibel levels from about half that amount (of people) were about 10 times (more). And I'm literally not kidding – 10 times, what they are at a normal game there,” Murphy said with a laugh. “And when they're traveling into the region, there's a big economic boom to the region, and most notably, to New Jersey. Murphy says he measures successful events at MetLife Stadium in three dimensions: Was it safe? Was your transportation to and from a good experience? “All three metrics feel really good,” Murphy said. And I'm confident we'll continue to do so for the balance of this tournament, and obviously, most importantly, for the World Cup next year.” Along with his excitement for next year's event, Murphy believes the Club World Cup and World Cup will play crucial roles for the future of soccer fandom in the United States. Murphy believes both tournaments will leave their own legacies behind, similar to how the 1994 World Cup birthed Major League Soccer's inception in 1996 and increased awareness of the sport over the last 30 years. “This will take us to another level heretofore not seen. It's what comes, what it leads to, that I think, is as if not more important than the actual event itself.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 11 U.S. host city committees for next year's FIFA men's World Cup are one step closer to receiving their requested $625 million in funding for security costs at the tournament, after the U.S. Senate passed an amended version of President Donald Trump's domestic policy bill on Tuesday. The bill now heads to a vote in the House of Representatives this week, and then, if passed, to President Trump's desk for a signature. The version of the bill passed by the Senate also included an additional $500 million made available for “state and local capabilities to detect, identify, track or monitor threats from unmanned aircraft systems (otherwise known as drones),” which has also become a key security concern for World Cup stadiums and fan festivals. The bill also includes $1 billion set aside for security, planning and other costs related to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. The World Cup funding is just one line of a mega-bill that includes sweeping reforms to domestic policy. The reconciliation bill passed Tuesday has been fiercely contested in the Senate and required a tie-breaking 51-50 vote by Vice President JD Vance. The bill now heads to the House of Representatives, with the aim for it to be at President Trump's desk by July 4, although this timescale depends on House Republicans having adequate support. If passed, the funding would represent a considerable success for U.S. Soccer, which has supported the host cities in their lobbying, as well as for FIFA, whose president, Gianni Infantino, appears to have developed a close relationship with President Trump. Infantino attended a pre-inauguration rally for Trump and the inauguration itself. The Athletic reported in March how the U.S. cities had engaged D.C. lobbyists to convince the Trump administration to commit federal cash to a tournament they argued was a national and international event, despite being hosted in local cities. According to filings registered at the U.S. Senate Lobby Disclosure website, the host committees jointly spent six-figure numbers to enlist Hogan Lovells US LLP as part of their persuasion attempts. Democrats and Republicans have been fiercely split over the Republican-led bill, which includes billions of dollars in cuts to things such as Medicaid and green energy efforts. But the host cities' request has received bipartisan support. On November 26, 2024, Democrat Rep. Josh Gottheimer and Republican Rep. Darin LaHood sent a joint letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, asking for the funding to go into end-of-year packages. A further letter was sent to the House Appropriations Committee on December 6, 2024, this time signed by 48 members of Congress, urging support for Fiscal Year 2025 funding for the World Cup. Previous attempts to secure the funding had been unsuccessful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino's side avoided heartbreak dispatching Costa Rica in a quarterfinal penalty shootout, but at the same time built belief that a trophy this summer is possible. Their run might not be paved with the revenge they sought coming in given Canada was upset by Guatemala. Mexico still likely awaits in the final if they both get there, but the USMNT will be heavily favored against their semifinal opponent. Matt Freese continues to make a name for himself this summer assuming starting goalkeeper responsibilities. He made crucial saves in the shootout and should keep starting Gold Cup games. Perhaps a changing of the guard given we haven't seen Matt Turner this summer. GK: Matt Freese—The New York City FC goalkeeper came up big in the penalty shootout and is poised to start however many games the USMNT play in this tournament. CB: Tim Ream—Ream should continue starting this summer, but fans want to see more assurance at the back and cleaner moments of playing out of the back. LB: Max Arfsten—Arfsten could've let his head drop after conceding a penalty in the first half. The Columbus Crew player rebounded by assisting an equalizer and scoring his first DM: Sebastian Berhalter—Berhalter missed his penalty in the shootout, and his father's reaction in the crowd went viral. Adams patrols midfield looking to book USMNT's spot in the final. RM: Jack McGlynn—McGlynn came off the bench against Costa Rica, but he should get a start in the next round. ST: Brian White—If there's going to be a change in the lineup, Pochettino could insert the Vancouver Whitecaps striker up top. Patrick Agyemang certainly causes problems up front, but Pochettino could want a different look against Guatemala. Max Mallow is an editor for Sports Illustrated FC. Somehow, he has just enough time every matchday to tweet when an Arsenal player scores a goal. The content on this site is for entertainment and educational purposes only.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Blues face a showdown with Estevao Willian and Palmeiras in the quarter-finals after their dramatic Round of 16 victory against Benfica. They will be hoping to have a new player in their ranks ahead of the next game. Chelsea want Joao Pedro in their Club World Cup squad as they prepare to add him to the club. The club have put themselves on the better side of the draw on paper despite finishing second in their group, and that route was made even easier after Thiago Silva helped eliminate Inter Milan. They missed out on top spot in Group D after defeat to Flamengo in their second game, and the Brazilian side were not shy to let their opponents know they had won. Topping the group saw Flamengo set up a Round of 16 tie with Bayern Munich, which saw them eliminated from the competition. As Chelsea prepare for their own quarter-final tie, they made a reference to Flamengo's jibe at the Blues by returning the favour. They said: “London Blue's quarter-final tie” in reference to the disrespectful way they were referred to by the Brazilian club. Just one win in the competition provided enough prize money to cover Andrey Santos' salary for 100 weeks. Up to now, the Blues have earned close to £40m, a figure which is closing in on the price tag they have paid for Pedro or Jamie Gittens.</p>

The Cityzens are heading home from the tournament far earlier than expected after paying a heavy price for their wasted chances against Al-Hilal

In the words of chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak, Manchester City viewed the Club World Cup as "a very, very serious competition", and they were going there to win it. The team's ruthless performances in the group stage showed he meant it, too. But after an enthralling 120 minutes against Al-Hilal in the last 16, City are already heading back to Manchester, digesting a chastening and embarrassing elimination from the tournament.

Make no mistake about it, City crashing out in the first round of the knockout stage to a team from outside of Europe is a massive, massive shock and a huge disappointment. Khaldoon and his fellow executives will also be cursing their early elimination both in naked financial terms and for the damage it does to their reputation of being the best team on the planet.

The tournament was supposed to be a fresh start for City after a terrible 2024-25 season as they aimed to avenge their rare trophy-less campaign. However, they were given an important reminder that Pep Guardiola's rebuild is far from complete and that it will take more time and likely even more money spent in the transfer market to give the coach the team he wants to wrestle back the Premier League crown they surrendered to Liverpool last season.

Yet there are some silver linings from City's two-week stay in the United States, and while the wounds of their elimination will take some time to heal, they might well look back upon this tournament as the first step towards re-establishing their dominance of English football.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's a fresh secret behind football's most prized silverware. FIFA has let the cat out of the bag regarding the Club World Cup trophy, and it's not what fans or even players might expect. The real story behind the trek of the trophy has transformed how sports champions celebrate and what they can actually put in their trophy room. Football fans have been seeing the winning team holding the gleaming Club World Cup trophy up high in a shower of confetti for years. Few know that this is fleeting in more than one sense. The replica the club holds is extremely hard to tell apart in looks, but it's not the same piece of history that's been owned by world champions everywhere. The replica is produced to the same technical specifications as the real one, but secretly engraved and officially classified as a replica. It means the club gets to display it in their trophy case, but the actual one is not available. The article reports: “Clubs are awarded with a copy trophy to retain, the original being retained by FIFA.” The copy is a symbol of victory that the supporters and team players value, but since the actual one only remains in their hands for a short time, the enjoyment is a bit bittersweet. To hold briefly in one's hand the original trophy is to make all the sweeter for memory. And a reminder that the delight of the victory is transient and everlasting—one in the fleeting moment of transience, and then in possession of the next generation of heroes. The company's operation involves making every victory under the company special and unique in trophy lore. The following you glance over and see a line of players standing up straight with the Club World Cup trophy held high in victory, bear this in mind: the trophy itself is theirs only briefly before it will lie safely ensconced in the safe at the FIFA headquarters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alejandro Moreno speaks about Mauricio Pochettino's time as manager of the USMNT. With the 2026 World Cup suddenly less than a year away, we can now introduce a new layer of worry into the already-twisted collective psyche of the U.S. men's national team fan base: Who should and who should not play for a new club? To be clear, this isn't as simple as wanting each American player to eventually play for Liverpool or Real Madrid. It's not about wanting to see them challenge themselves and make as much money as they can over their short careers or anything like that. No, that's because if you play for Liverpool or Real Madrid, there's a good chance that you won't, well, play. And, theoretically, there's nothing worse for the USMNT than heading into next summer with a bunch of its stars covered in rust from sitting on the sidelines all season. I say "theoretically" because it's just that: a theory. If a task is too easy, you don't learn anything from it. But if a task is too hard, you also don't learn from it. Instead, what the paper found is that the ideal level of difficulty to produce learning is something that produces an 85% success rate and a 15% fail rate. What USMNT fans want, then, is for every player to find his 85% club. But since the club and country situations for Americans are increasingly at odds with each other, this rarely happens. So, if it doesn't happen -- if some stars struggle for playing time next season -- how much does it actually matter for the USMNT? How much does this transfer window really matter for the USMNT's 2026 World Cup? For this part of the exercise, we'll ignore MLS. Presumably for anyone good enough to receive significant playing time for the USMNT next summer, the ease of MLS would be well above that 85% success-rate level. There's a top tier with the three best players in the pool (Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Weston McKennie), plus a pair of Championship mainstays in Brenden Aaronson and Aidan Morris, and a guy who just transferred to Atletico Madrid in Johnny Cardoso. Below them, there's another tier of players who played a lot for lesser teams in the Big Five leagues or teams in the Eredivisie. The third tier contains players who were in and out of the starting lineups for Champions League and Premier League teams. Here's how much playing time those 11 players would've had, heading into the tournament: That averages out to 49.3% of the minutes for this projected starting lineup. Remove Matt Turner, who plays a position at which you never get sub minutes, and it still only jumps up to 53.6%. At face value, it seems as if you'd want your starting lineup to be playing significantly more than half of the available minutes for their club teams ahead of the World Cup. As for the rest: PSV are 25th, Toulouse 75th, Fulham 33rd, Bournemouth 21st, Milan 30th, Juventus 22nd, and Monaco 36th. To oversimplify this into understandable terms: the average USMNT starter is playing about half of the minutes for a team at AC Milan's level. In other words, it's a team of 11 Yunus Musahs. Unfortunately, Club Elo has deactivated access to its past ranking data, but there's still a pretty clear set up here: eight guys playing for Champions League clubs, and three guys playing every minute of every game for teams that weren't in the Champions League. These countries have way more talent depth, and so coaches are often picking players based on how well they're playing with their club teams. Unlike as has often been the case for the U.S., coaches usually don't have a set 11 that they stick with, regardless of a player's current club form. I'm less convinced that Argentina did so well because they played so many players who were playing a lot for their clubs teams. Rather, if you assume club coaches have a level of expertise in picking lineups to win games -- that they know how to identify talent and play their best players since they see them every day -- then a national team manager like Argentina's Lionel Scaloni is mostly using the expertise of other coaches to help him pick his most talented squad. At most positions, you simply can't do this as the USMNT manager. To go with a clearly hypothetical example: If there's one goalkeeper on Crystal Palace and another one on New York City FC, you can assume that the former is more talented than the latter. Or, not too different than how things stand now. Musah has traded relegation-battling Valencia for Champions League-challenging Milan. Weah has moved from Lille to Juventus, and the center-forward spot swaps Josh Sargent on a midtable Championship side for Balogun and Champions League-qualified Monaco. Neither Dest nor Balogun are in bad club situations where we'd expect them to ride the bench this upcoming season if they can stay healthy. Gab Marcotti believes Johnny Cardoso's proposed move from Real Betis to Atlético Madrid is a "big step up" for the USMNT midfielder. Really, the one player whose issues could be solved with a transfer is Turner, who seems as if he finally has lost his starting job with the national team after barely playing professional soccer for three straight seasons. That might have all been fixed by his expected move to Lyon this summer, but that was all reported before the French club were relegated into Ligue 2 for violating the league's financial rules. He needs to play, and as a goalkeeper, it doesn't really matter how good the team is -- it just matters that he's being tested by quality opponents every week. That's not me being glib; it's just a fact. But outside of extreme cases such as Turner or Reyna, whose careers have stalled for multiple seasons in a row, no transfer activity this summer will have a meaningful effect on how well the USMNT plays next summer. Despite starting only two league games on a loan with AC Milan for the season, Dest created more assists and took more shots for the U.S. than anyone other than Pulisic. Ángel Di María had just made a seemingly mistaken move to Juventus, where he'd stay for only one season and would start only 15 league games, fewer than in any season since he joined Real Madrid from Benfica in 2010. Rather than going from River Plate to a second-tier Champions League club such as Borussia Dortmund or AC Milan where he'd be all-but-assured of more playing time, he jumped straight to the best team in the world, Manchester City. There were plenty of other talented, big-name players who were getting more playing time than either Di María or Álvarez in 2022: Lautaro Martínez, Paulo Dybala, Papu Gómez. I don't have to tell you what happened after that.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using clever tactics and Messi clickbait, Egyptian creators racked up 14m views with highlights posted before kickoff. YouTube didn't catch on until it was too late This story was reported by Indicator, a publication that investigates digital deception, and co-published with the Guardian. It was Thursday morning in America and something didn't look right in the highlights of the Club World Cup match between Manchester City and Juventus. And yet, footage showed City head coach Pep Guardiola all bundled up in a puffer jacket ill-suited to humid Florida summers. He actually plays for Newcastle, a totally unrelated team that wears a black-and-white jersey similar to that worn by the Italian side. The match wasn't on until several hours later. Attendance numbers have been so-so, but the money at stake is huge. YouTube has long failed to keep fake highlights and livestreams of football games off its platform. But these have typically been recreated from video games, making them easy to spot as soon as you've opened the video. Now, a group of gaming creators based in Egypt developed a winning formula that combined repackaged clips from old games, obsessive interest in star players like Lionel Messi, and data voids, to get clicks and ad revenue. Earlier this year, the Egyptian gaming creator Mohamed Reda started posting highlight reels of the MLS team Inter Miami on his YouTube channel Reda Bow. These videos always promised a “Crazy Hat-Trick” by eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi and atypical score lines like 9-3 or 7-4. Like the Man City v Juventus highlights above, the clips were in reality just medleys of old goals. Reda Bow's fake highlights did increasingly well: videos posted in April got 40,000 to 60,000 views but by June his videos were being seen 300,000 times. Reda and two other Egyptian gaming creators started posting the same templated highlights across several YouTube accounts they managed. They focused on the buzzier games that featured Messi or top European teams like Manchester City and Real Madrid. So what if the videos defied not only the time continuum but also basic math by promising a “Messi Hat-Trick” even when Inter Miami had only purportedly scored two goals. The operation's takeover was absolutely comprehensive – just look at the Google Search video tab results for three CWC matches held last week. Videos from the Egyptian creators appear in the top four slots across every game, each with a slightly different scoreline for games that had yet to be played. Collectively, 30-odd videos pushed out by the trio were seen 14m times over two weeks. Because no deep dive into scams is complete without some AI garbage, the videos also ran ads for questionable diets fronted by a synthetically edited Oprah Winfrey (and many other AI-generated personas). About 40% of users don't appear to recognize the deception and post enthusiastic remarks about Lionel Messi or putdowns of his archnemesis Cristiano Ronaldo. One despairing viewer wrote “can't believe 800k+ people clicked on this and the game has not happened yet.“ My personal favorite is a user who wrote “You are very good at making hundreds of thousands or millions of moths come to watch.” (I'm assuming it sounds even better in the original Thai.) This bait-and-switch served to both drive ad revenue and juice up historical numbers on the channel for newcomers. I reached out to YouTube about the videos and was acknowledged on Friday. By that evening, the platform had removed all videos under its policies against spam, deceptive practices and scams. At least one fake highlight reel with almost 1m views was still live, however. The videos appear on channels whose purpose is entirely unrelated to football – including cooking, fishing, farming and bird breeding channels. I assume these are old accounts taken over by a scam operation, but I haven't had time to dig any further. Here are some pigeon videos in case that's your thing. Viewers who fell for these videos may have been a little disappointed to realize what happened. At a stretch, some may have even gambled one way or another based on the videos. But if a user didn't know what time the game was on, failed to recognize the outdated spliced clips, and went on to comment “MESSI” underneath the videos, they probably weren't in the market for sophisticated football analysis anyway. YouTube and its advertisers definitely lost some money from this deceptive operation, but it's hard to feel too bad for either of them. What matters here is less the fake content itself than the behavioral deception that enabled it to succeed. By trimming videos after publication, they also showed the vulnerability of a functionality that can very easily be abused for more nefarious purposes – for instance, posting incendiary remarks to drive referral traffic from other platforms then trim them out in time to avoid getting flagged for any policy violation. For what it's worth, Manchester City actually trounced Juventus 5-2.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Club World Cup holders and European giants Man City are dumped out by Saudi Pro League champions in a seven-goal thriller after extra time in Orlando. Man City had plenty of opportunities to extend their lead before the break, but a combination of poor finishing and inspired goalkeeping from Moroccan goalkeeper Yassine Bounou kept the lead at a single goal. Al Hilal offered several reminders of their threat on the break but Man City had even more chances, with Jeremy Doku volleying straight at Bounou, who moments later reacted superbly again to keep out a Bernardo effort. The question as to whether Man City would live to regret not converting those chances was answered within a minute of the resumption. Former City full-back Joao Cancelo's low cross was parried out by Ederson. Six minutes later, and City's high defensive line was exposed by a long ball from Cancelo, which Brazilian Malcolm raced onto, showing power and pace as he broke away before coolly slotting past Ederson. The Saudi fans in the crowd went wild while City manager Pep Guardiola responded immediately with a triple substitution, with midfielder Rodri and defenders Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji introduced. That brought some much-needed stability to a shaky back line but City needed improvement at the other end too, and it came, albeit in scruffy circumstances. The Al Hilal defence were unable to deal with a Bernardo corner and Haaland pounced to steer home the loose ball and make it 2-2. City piled on the pressure as they looked for the winner but yet again Bounou proved their nemesis as he denied Akanji and Ruben Dias, and even when he was beaten by Haaland, substitute Ali Lajami produced a magnificent goal-line clearance. Guardiola took off Haaland and introduced Egyptian forward Omar Marmoush as the game went into extra time. But for all City's depth, Al Hilal had a deep well of spirit to draw upon. Just four minutes into the opening period, Al Hilal regained the lead when Kalidou Koulibaly rose superbly to meet a Ruben Neves corner with a brilliantly angled header. City responded with a goal of real quality when Rayan Cherki's brilliantly floated ball towards the back post was poked home masterfully by Phil Foden, at full stretch and from the tightest of angles. But incredibly, Al Hilal responded again to restore their lead: Sergej Milinkovic-Savic's header was saved by Ederson but Marcos Leonardo followed in to bundle the ball over the line. “I've had a difficult time in the last two months. City skipper Bernardo Silva said his team had paid the price for being unable to deal with Al Hilal's counter-attacking. It was all about controlling when we lost the ball, controlling the transitions, don't let them run, and they ran way too many times,” he said. “With one, two passes, there was always a feeling of danger coming from them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team had been starving for a creative No. 10, and up through the ranks came a blessing, Gio Reyna. He broke into Borussia Dortmund teams before his 18th birthday. He broke several of Christian Pulisic's “youngest to” records. But with 2026 near, Reyna's career is on ice, and instead, another languid playmaker born in 2002 is seizing control of the U.S. attack. Malik Tillman has the keys, and he's using them. In a span of less than nine hours Sunday and Monday, here in the Midwest and across the pond in Europe, two events further established Tillman as a potential USMNT centerpiece. First, he helped drive the U.S. to a Gold Cup quarterfinal victory. Then, by the time he awoke — or perhaps before he went to sleep — Bayer Leverkusen reportedly reached an agreement to buy Tillman for well over $40 million. And an ocean away, at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, he showed why. Tillman was far from perfect in a dramatic win over Costa Rica. But he glided around a subpar pitch, dictated the USMNT's most dangerous moves, contributed to two goals, and also won a penalty (which he missed). He spent much of the game lurking, on the prowl for space between Costa Rican lines, and when his teammates found him, he did things that very few players in the U.S. pool are capable of doing. Some might argue the list includes only Tillman and Reyna. Reyna, though, hasn't played 90 minutes of competitive soccer in a year. Over the last four years, he has played 70-plus minutes in only seven official matches for his clubs. He has only played once, for 21 minutes as a sub, under U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino. Born in Germany to an American father, he first rose through Bayern Munich's academy. He learned on loan at Rangers in Scotland. In 2024-25, despite missing three months with an ankle injury, he was one of the very best players in the entire Dutch Eredivisie. Entering this summer, he'd never scored or assisted a senior national team goal. Nonetheless, with ranks depleted, Pochettino built a makeshift Gold Cup squad around Tillman. He scored twice in a beatdown of Trinidad and Tobago. He dazzled in an inconsequential win over Haiti. Sunday, though, brought the first true-ish test … and Tillman dazzled again. Throughout the 90 minutes, his full repertoire was on display. He roamed those spaces on Sunday, with the “freedom” that Pochettino has given him. He found space, but far too often, the U.S. didn't find him — and on a few occasions, he appeared frustrated. But at halftime, coaches showed players a few instructive clips. Sure enough, less than two minutes after halftime, when the U.S. circulated the ball from left to right, Chris Richards activated Tillman with an expertly disguised pass. Tillman, with the ball en route to his feet, glanced ever so briefly over his left shoulder; saw he had time and space to turn; played a 1-2 with Agyemang, and set up Max Arfsten's first career USMNT goal. The nonchalant, almost leisurely way Tillman moves can fool some first-time observers. Even compared to true midfielders, he's in the 81st percentile, per FBref. And he's been similarly active defensively for the U.S. He bore some fault on Costa Rica's second goal, when he tried to force a through ball into a non-existent window. And then, when it was intercepted, rather than race back into position, he brought his hands to his head and almost sulked, enabling Los Ticos to build their possession. He has even added long-range shooting to his arsenal, and nearly scored a banger Sunday. As 19 other players jog side to side, following the ball, Tillman will often walk — because he knows that a lack of movement, coupled with the movement of opposing midfielders, is sometimes the best way to create passing lanes. He can also run off a target man like Agyemang. He does not have Reyna's vision or creativity. But he currently has the spot that once seemed earmarked for Reyna, and a chance to make it his own ahead of the World Cup next summer. The question, of course, is how he'll cope with higher levels. There is a chance that Tillman's occasional slowness and inconsistent sharpness humble him in the Bundesliga and against better national teams. There is also a chance he doesn't mesh with Christian Pulisic, Tim Weah, Weston McKennie and the rest of the USA's A-squad. There's a chance he doesn't ultimately fit in Pochettino's starting 11. For now, however, there is genuine excitement that the USMNT has found a No. 10, a playmaker who can operate between lines and pick locks that, in the past, have proven unbreakable. “Malik is an unbelievable talent,” Pochettino said last fall, shortly after taking the U.S. job. Perhaps not generational, but, as Pochettino said more recently, “one of the most talented players that we have in the USA.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zlatan Ibrahimovic didn't hold back after Inter Miami's Round of 16 blowout loss to Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup over the weekend, likening players on the Miami squad to “statues” and pushing back on any criticism of Lionel Messi. Inter Miami's presence in the knockout stage was already a bit of a surprise – the result of a surprising win over Porto in the group stage – which made the 4-0 loss to the reigning Champions League winners not much of a shock. Ibrahimovic, a Swedish international who played for some of the top clubs in the world, including time at AC Milan, PSG and Manchester United, took issue with any sort of blame being placed on Messi for the ugly loss in the 32-team tournament. He currently holds a senior advisor position with AC Milan. No, don't talk about the defeat as if it was his fault! Have you seen this team?” he told French soccer publication Footmercato.

But he's surrounded by those who run as if they were carrying bags of cement! There are no coaches, no stars, not even players who understand how to move without the ball!” Inter Miami possesses one of the more star-studded rosters in Major League Soccer with Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, and Luis Suarez. “That's not the Messi I know, he's a big ghost who plays in a circus! But be careful, if you give him a real team, he'll burn the stadium down again! Inter Miami took home $21.05 million in prize money as a result of their run in the Club World Cup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIAMI GARDENS, FLA. (WSVN) - President Trump's immigration enforcement policies are sparking World Cup concerns in South Florida, causing activists to speak out. During a press conference on Monday, activists said fans who will be attending the games will come from all over the world and instead of getting a welcome mat being rolled out for them, they are concerned they will be asked for their papers. “Our ask is for FIFA to pressure, for there to be no immigration enforcement during the games,” said Yareliz Mendez-Zamora of the American Friends Service Committee. The activists said ICE providing security at the ongoing FIFA Club World Cup could be scaring fans off and they want to prevent the same thing from happening to next year's FIFA World Cup games at Hard Rock Stadium. Customs and Border Protection posted on social media earlier this month, saying “CBP will be suited and booted ready to provide security for the first round of games.” Earlier this month, agents with CBP and the U.S. Coast Guard boarded a boat chartered by a Spanish-language news network, asking the boat and catering crews to provide proof of their legal status. “If even elected officials and high-profile media outlets aren't immune to ICE and CBP overreach, how can regular working families feel safe attending a soccer match?” said Paul Christian Namphy of the Family Action Network Movement. Miami-Dade County gave $46 million in the form of subsidies to FIFA. Documentary filmmaker, Billy Corbin says that amounts to an investment by taxpayers when other areas of the county budget may be strained. “Let me be clear, they're coming here to see the World Cup, not to see Alligator Alcatraz,” said Corbin, “So, FIFA, please protect your fans.” The Los Angeles Dodgers denied stadium access to ICE agents on June 20th.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The big takeaway is that while the U.S. team is not where it needs to be, there are noticeable improvements as the team is showing fight, resiliency, and not collapsing when hit with adversity. This has been a tough task for head coach Mauricio Pochettino to fix. Against Costa Rica in a knockout game, the U.S. team fought through their own mistakes and kept pressing until they won. Sure, tougher opponents will provide a more accurate measuring stick. But winning tough CONCACAF games is certainly a good starting point given that the team was struggling against similar teams recently. Then later in the first half, Malik Tillman failed to convert a penalty that would have evened the game. This was a game that the U.S. team might have seemingly wilted in recent months. Not making mistakes and winning comfortably is optimal. I don't think anyone is making this result as a clear sign the team is where it wants to be ahead of the World Cup. Slowly there is more positivity around the group and it took a winning mindset to prevail. Here are some thoughts on the game. Then he assisted on the equalizer with a nice pass to Diego Luna. Then he scored after being set up by Tillman. He then helped create a few other chances. Then he failed to defend effectively on the second Costa Rica goal. He was only converted to being a wingback by Columbus Crew head coach Wilfried Nancy. But that formation one where he typically has three central defenders behind him in a three-man backline. A golden hour moment in the @GoldCup for @maxarfsten's first international goal! Now, he comes to the national team and is playing a more traditional left back role. At times, it looks as if he is uncomfortable. He allows too much space and needs to defend more 1v1 situations against opposing wingers. On the flip side, he is aggressive getting forward and he does provide some effective width in the U.S. team's attack. The question is how quickly or even if he will improve his shortcomings? Will he work on playing a traditional left back position at Columbus – or at another club if he moves? But does that make him a good fit for the USMNT moving forward? Matt Freese wasn't tested much in the group stages and he didn't have to make many big saves. But his one standout moment wasn't positive as he gave the ball away trying to play out of the back against Haiti and surrendered a goal in the process. Despite questions, Pochettino stuck with Freese and Freese came up big in the shootout with a trio of big stops. When observing Pochettino's style in his first year as the coach, he seems to be forgiving when players make a mistake. When we needed a big stop on Sunday night, Matt Freese delivered three of 'em. Instead, he wants to see players respond well by not making a similar mistake and by raising their game. Freese is probably in a better position than many realize. Goalkeeping coach Toni Jimenez is key member of Pochettino's staff at every stop. Matt Turner clearly is under pressure to change things. Alex Freeman hasn't had any big moments at this Gold Cup, but he has been consistently solid. This is even more impressive considering that he is still in his first season as a starter for Orlando City. He earned a lot of rave reviews for his performances this season and it is easy to see the reasons for the hype. Freeman covers the lines well and can keep up with speedy wingers. He tackles, wins duels, doesn't get bumped off the ball, and he is a huge help in set pieces. That is sign that the team and coaches respect his maturity at the stage of his career. But it should not be surprising at all if Freeman is seen by the staff as a World Cup player next year. Former USMNT head coach and World Cup defender Gregg Berhalter attended the game, which was good. A parent who has a long history with the national team should enjoy seeing his son get such an opportunity. It still is a tough path for him to make the World Cup team, but he's in the mix. His set piece deliveries have been consistently dangerous – and that is something that has not been great for the USMNT for quite some time. His skill on the ball is sufficient, but being able to shield the backline and win balls is important. This tournament continues to show the strength of Tyler Adams. There isn't anyone else in the pool who can do what he does as a defensive midfielder. After this tournament, Pochettino really needs to figure out what is Plan B in Adams can't go. Does he go back and keep looking at players such as Tanner Tessmann or Aidan Morris? Patrick Agyemang didn't score, but he had a good game. His hold up play was pretty important to what the U.S. team wanted. His physicality really allows him to handle those responsibilities well. It was good to see Damion Downs have his first big moment for the USMNT when he scored the winning shootout goal. He has a very bright future and moments like that can help build up his connection with the badge. Freeman is the son of a legendary NFL wild receiver but who never showed much interest in American football. Born in Germany, Downs spent much of his childhood in Texas where he fell in love with American football – only adopting soccer at the age of nine when he moved back to Germany. Both Freeman and Downs scored to help the USMNT prevail. In this game, it was a little harder for him as he missed a penalty and was dispossessed four times. Despite that, he still converted his shootout attempt and assisted on Arfsten's goal. Tillman has had a big year, and the coming 12-13 months are going to be even bigger. His value has skyrocketed and next year he should be a big part of the equation for the USMNT. Diego Luna scored a big goal that equalized the game. Luna can go quiet for stretches, but he always has the potential to pop up and make something happen. Part of that is on Pochettino who didn't make any changes until the 78th minute. It is puzzling that he waited that long, especially after Costa Rica's subs in the 58th minute brought life into the game for them. Johnny Cardoso's ankle is bothering him and Haji Wright has already left the team with an injury. But it was also telling that neither Aaronson brother got into the game, and both are fresh and both are on the roster bubble as it is.</p>
