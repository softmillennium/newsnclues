SJSU volleyball player Brooke Slusser provides updates on her lawsuit over alleged threats and actions from transgender teammate and the conflict of interest within the investigation on ‘America Reports'. FIRST ON FOX: The U.S. Department of Education announced Tuesday that the University of Pennsylvania has agreed to a resolution with President Donald Trump's administration to keep biological male trans athletes out of women's sports, in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. The department previously launched an investigation into UPenn on Feb. 6 for Title IX violations that occurred in the swimming program. U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon credited Trump for the resolution. "Thanks to the leadership of President Trump, UPenn has agreed both to apologize for its past Title IX violations and to ensure that women's sports are protected at the University for future generations of female athletes," McMahon said in a statement. "Today is a great victory for women and girls not only at the University of Pennsylvania, but all across our nation. The Department commends UPenn for rectifying its past harms against women and girls, and we will continue to fight relentlessly to restore Title IX's proper application and enforce it to the fullest extent of the law." "I am deeply grateful to the Trump administration for standing firm in protecting women and girls and restoring our rightful accolades," Scanlan said. "It is because of their strong leadership that my alma mater now knows it has no choice but to begin the process of reforming its policies to uphold women's rights. Today marks a momentous step toward repairing the past mistreatment of female athletes and forging a future where sex discrimination no longer limits girls' potential." Scanlan isn't the only one of Thomas' former teammates to speak out anymore. The lawsuit sought to have Thomas' accolades withdrawn and redistributed to the women's swimmers who competed against the athlete, and it alleges university administrators suggested any female swimmer opposed to Thomas competing with them had a "psychological problem" and were referred to the school's LGBTQ center. Trump's administration later froze $175 million in funding for the school on March 20. Then, on April 28, the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights announced its investigation concluded that UPenn did violate Title IX in its handling of the Thomas situation. Back then, current prominent conservative activist Riley Gaines was just a dental student who had to settle for a tie with Thomas in one of the NCAA championship events. Since then, Gaines has taken the lead on an entire political platform focused on combating male inclusion in women's and girls' sports, stemming from her experience competing against Thomas in 2022. Gaines previously told Fox News Digital that she would send a "thank-you" note to "people like" Thomas for bringing attention to the issue back then, as she believes it influenced the 2024 election. "I think we should send a thank-you note to people like Will Thomas, I really do, signed and sealed by me. "There was a lot that was wrong with Joe Biden, his administration and the Democratic Party as a whole outside of the sports stuff … but this was the perfect visual. … It painted the picture that many of us were concerned about for a while, but made it a reality." A national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of "Donald Trump's opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls' and women's sports and of transgender boys and men using girls' and women's bathrooms" as important to them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani clinched victory Tuesday in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York, cementing an upset that already has shaken national politics. But because Mamdani hadn't won a majority of first-choice votes, it took a tabulation of the city's ranked-choice votes released Tuesday to put Mamdani over 50% he needed to win. As Democrats seek to figure out how to harness the young progressive's energy, if not all his policy proposals, Republicans have tried to elevate him as the face of their opposition. Related article Get the scoop on ranked-choice voting “This is just the beginning of our expanding coalition to make New York City affordable,” Mamdani wrote on X after the results were posted. Mamdani's victory sets up a potentially messy general election contest. Mayor Eric Adams, four years after winning the Democratic primary, is seeking reelection as an independent. And Cuomo, the former New York governor, is keeping his “Fight and Deliver” ballot line for the general election, although he hasn't committed to running an active campaign. Tuesday's results, which aren't final but include nearly all of the votes that will be counted in the race, showed Mamdani defeating Cuomo 56% to 44% in the final round. Preliminary Board of Elections data show that Mamdani likely benefitted from ranked choice voting and cross endorsements as part of his campaign strategy. The Working Families Party rolled out a slate of endorsements which ranked Mamdani first and Lander second. Mamdani captured 48% of re-allocated votes while Cuomo, who did not cross-endorse with any candidates, only got 26% of re-allocated votes. Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, issued a statement Tuesday which noted the former governor has not yet decided whether he will run an active general election campaign but made clear he was considering doing so. He argued a “massive spike” in voters under the age of 30 made it impossible to predict Mamdani's victory. “Extremism, division and empty promises are not the answer to this city's problems, and while this was a look at what motivates a slice of our primary electorate, it does not represent the majority,” Azzopardi said. “We'll be continuing conversations with people from all across the city while determining next steps.” In his statement, Azzopardi also took a swipe at Adams, noting that Cuomo still captured 24,000 more votes in the final round than Adams did in the 2021 primary when he was first elected.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — Legally mandated U.S. national climate assessments seem to have disappeared from the federal websites built to display them, making it harder for state and local governments and the public to learn what to expect in their backyards from a warming world. Scientists said the peer-reviewed authoritative reports save money and lives. Global Change Research Program were down Monday and Tuesday with no links, notes or referrals elsewhere. Searches for the assessments on NASA websites did not turn them up. NASA did not respond to requests for information. “It's a sad day for the United States if it is true that the National Climate Assessment is no longer available,” Jacobs said. “This is evidence of serious tampering with the facts and with people's access to information, and it actually may increase the risk of people being harmed by climate-related impacts.” Harvard climate scientist John Holdren, who was President Obama's science advisor and whose office directed the assessments, said after the 2014 edition he visited governors, mayors and other local officials who told him how useful the 841-page report was. It helped them decide whether to raise roads, build seawalls and even move hospital generators from basements to roofs, he said. “This is a government resource paid for by the taxpayer to provide the information that really is the primary source of information for any city, state or federal agency who's trying to prepare for the impacts of a changing climate,” said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, who has been a volunteer author for several editions of the report. Copies of past reports are still squirreled away in NOAA's library. NASA's open science data repository includes dead links to the assessment site. It found that climate change is affecting people's security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority and Native American communities often disproportionately at risk. The 1990 Global Change Research Act requires a national climate assessment every four years and directs the president to establish an interagency United States Global Change Research Program. Social media and blogs at NOAA and NASA about climate impacts for the general public were cut or eliminated. “It's part of a horrifying big picture,” Holdren said. “It's just an appalling whole demolition of science infrastructure.” The national assessments are more useful than international climate reports put out by the United Nations every seven or so years because they are more localized and more detailed, Hayhoe and Jacobs said. Hiding the reports would be censoring science, Jacobs said. And it's dangerous for the country, Hayhoe said, comparing it to steering a car on a curving road by only looking through the rearview mirror: “And now, more than ever, we need to be looking ahead to do everything it takes to make it around that curve safely. ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram provides latest updates from Capitol Hill on marathon Senate voting on President Donald Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill.' The Senate has completed consideration of President Donald Trump's $3.3 trillion, 940-page agenda bill, sending it back to the House of Representatives to sync up before hitting the commander in chief's desk for his signature. It first passed the House by just one vote in late May, and now it must advance through the chamber one more time before it can be signed into law. Republicans are using budget reconciliation to pass Trump's agenda on taxes, the border, energy, defense and the national debt. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson must push President Trump's agenda through Congress. The bill would require ​​able-bodied, childless adults between the ages of 18 and 64 to work at least 80 hours a month to maintain their benefits, or by ​​participating in community service, going to school or engaging in a work program. But there are more divisive changes, like tweaks to the Medicaid provider tax rate. The plan was tweaked to comply with Senate rules, and now starts in fiscal year 2028. The House bill, in comparison, would have frozen states at their current rates and placed a moratorium on new provider taxes. It's a sticking point for moderate House Republicans who could see their states be forced to foot more of the bill for Medicaid than they currently do, risking politically damaging cuts to the program. The Senate bill also includes a $50 billion fund to help rural hospitals in a bid to ease the concerns of Republicans in their own chamber. The U.S. national debt is currently just over $36 trillion. A failure to raise that limit – also called the debt ceiling – before the U.S. government runs out of cash to pay its obligations could result in a downgrade in the country's credit rating and potential turmoil in financial markets. Trump has made it a priority for congressional Republicans to deal with the debt ceiling and avoid a national credit default. A bipartisan agreement struck in 2023 suspended the debt ceiling until January 2025. Multiple projections show the U.S. is poised to run out of cash to pay its debts by sometime this summer. The Senate version of the legislation provides more generous corporate tax benefits than the House version, while placing limits on Trump's newer policies, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime pay. It also makes permanent the standard deduction for personal income taxes, while the House bill only extended it through 2028. That deduction would begin to phase out for people making $150,000 per year or $300,000 as a married couple. There is no cap of any kind on the amount that can be deducted, however. Those same income differences are at play between the Senate and House versions of Trump's "no tax on overtime pay" promise. Whereas the Senate bill would allow people to deduct up to $12,500 in overtime pay, the House version did not include a stated limit. After talks with key senators fell through, Blackburn and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., co-sponsored an amendment to remove that provision. "This is a monumental win for Republican governors, President Trump's one, big beautiful bill, and the American people," Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, one of the signatories, wrote on X after it was removed. Previous digital bylines seen at Daily Mail and CBS News.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani spoke at a rally in Harlem Saturday as he seeks to widen support following New York City's Democratic primary. Results will be finalized after the city's ranked choice vote-counting resumes Tuesday. Andrew Cuomo and sending him to the general election. “I am humbled by the support of more than 545,000 New Yorkers who voted for our campaign and am excited to expand this coalition even further as we defeat Eric Adams and win a city government that puts working people first.” Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani takes selfies with supporters after speaking at his primary election party, Wednesday, June 25, 2025, in New York. Mamdani, who declared victory the night of the June 24 primary, will face a general election field that includes incumbent Mayor Eric Adams as well as independent candidate Jim Walden and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Cuomo conceded defeat just hours after the polls closed last week but is contemplating whether to run in the general election on an independent ballot line. After the release of Tuesday's vote count, Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said “We'll be continuing conversations with people from all across the city while determining next steps.” “Extremism, division and empty promises are not the answer to this city's problems, and while this was a look at what motivates a slice of our primary electorate, it does not represent the majority,” Azzopardi said. “The financial instability of our families is the priority here, which is why actionable solutions, results and outcomes matter so much.” Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist and member of the state Assembly, was virtually unknown when he launched his candidacy centered on a bold slate of populist ideas. But he built an energetic campaign that ran circles around Cuomo as the older, more moderate Democrat tried to come back from the sexual harassment scandal that led to his resignation four years ago. Mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks to supporters during a Democratic primary watch party, Tuesday, June 24, 2025, in New York. Mamdani's campaign, which was focused on lowering the cost of living, claims it has found a new blueprint for Democrats who have at times appeared rudderless during President Donald Trump's climb back to power. The Democratic establishment has approached Mamdani with caution. Many of its big players applauded his campaign but don't seem ready to throw their full support behind the young progressive, whose past criticisms of law enforcement, use of the word “genocide” to describe the Israeli government's actions in Gaza and “democratic socialist” label amount to landmines for some in the party. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, right, and Attorney General of New York Letitia James walk in the NYC Pride March, Sunday, June 29, 2025, in New York. Trump and others in the GOP have begun to launch broadsides at him, moving to cast Mamdani as the epitome of leftist excess ahead of consequential elections elsewhere this year and next. “If I'm a Republican, I want this guy to win,” said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University. New York City's ranked choice voting model allows voters to list up to five candidates on their ballots in order of preference. If a single candidate is the first choice of more than 50% of voters, then that person wins the race outright. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani arrives at House of Justice for National Action Network's Saturday action rally in Harlem, Saturday, June 28, 2025, in New York. His campaign promised free city buses, free child care, a rent freeze for people living in rent-stabilized apartment, government-run grocery stores and more, all paid for with taxes on the wealthy. Critics have slammed his agenda as politically unrealistic. Cuomo ran a campaign centered on his extensive experience, casting himself as the only candidate capable of saving a city he said had spun out of control. During the campaign, he focused heavily on combating antisemitism and leaned on his name recognition and juggernaut fundraising operation rather than mingling with voters. Joined by his daughters, from left, Michaela Kennedy-Cuomo, Cara Kennedy-Cuomo, Mariah Kennedy-Cuomo and son-in-law Tellef Lundevall, mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo, center, speaks to supporters during a Democratic primary watch party, Tuesday, June 24, 2025, in New York. Cuomo did not remove his name from the November ballot last week, ahead of a procedural deadline to do so, and has said he is still considering whether to mount an actual campaign for the office. Adams, while still a Democrat, is running in the November election as an independent. He dropped out of the Democratic primary in April after he was severely wounded by his now-dismissed federal bribery case.</p>

Around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday, senators took their 45th roll-call vote, when counting a pair of procedural votes that started the session on Monday. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Democrats would bring “amendment after amendment after amendment to the floor,” so Republicans “can try to explain their massive cuts to Medicaid, to people back home.” Here is a rolling list of all the amendments that come up on Monday and Tuesday and whether they have passed or failed: Essentially a technical question on whether the “one big, beautiful bill” follows budgetary rules. It was presented by Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), and its resulting vote was 53-47, indicating the decision of the chair stands. This vote affirms the GOP decision that Trump's tax extension should not count against the current policy baseline and should not add more spending. It was presented by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and its resulting vote of 53-47 indicates that the budget accounting assumptions used in the changes to the House-passed reconciliation bill are correct; no budget rules have been violated. It was presented by Schumer, who pushed back against rising costs for healthcare to fund billionaire tax cuts and proposed sending the bill back to the Finance Committee, ultimately delaying its passage. It was presented by Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), who pushed back against cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and was concerned about hospital closures. Markey followed Schumer's lead and proposed sending the bill back to the Finance Committee to delay its passage. It was presented by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who advised against cuts to the SNAP program and raised concerns on budget rules. It was presented by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), who voiced his support for sending the bill back to the Finance Committee to strike its Medicare and Medicaid cuts. It was presented by Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), who stressed the bill would result in massive cuts to Medicaid and other programs, tying people up in “red tape” that would result in them losing their healthcare. It was presented by Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), who urged lawmakers to send the bill back to the Finance Committee because of its “harmful” proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. It was presented by Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), who claimed nursing homes would be at risk of closing or would have to reduce space if this bill passed, arguing it should be sent back to the Finance Committee for revisions. It was presented by Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA), who asked lawmakers not to let Affordable Healthcare Act provisions expire with the passage of this bill. The individual tax rate would be increased for those making over $10,000,000 per year. It was presented by Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), whose motion rejected cuts to Medicaid because it funds vital hospital services, especially those for maternal care and infants. Presented by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), the motion was intended to decrease federal Medicaid expansion to states that provide state-funded coverage for undocumented immigrants who have been charged with or convicted of certain crimes. It needed at least 60 affirmative votes to pass. Presented by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), the motion was intended to prevent cryptocurrency corruption. It needed at least 60 affirmative votes to pass, but the resulting vote was 47-53, and the motion was denied. Presented by Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), the motion was intended to overturn the provision to defund Planned Parenthood. It needed at least 60 affirmative votes to pass, but the resulting vote was 49-51, and the motion was denied. Offered by Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), the amendment was intended to close a loophole that allows illegal immigrants to receive Medicaid coverage for up to 90 days until their citizenship is verified. It needed at least 60 votes to pass, but the resulting vote was 53-47 and failed. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) offered this motion to prohibit any federal agency from terminating more than 1% of its employees, if any of the terminated employees is a veteran. The motion failed by a 47-53 vote. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) wanted to prohibit the Department of Defense from using any funds appropriated by Congress to accept, retrofit, or transfer a plane given by a foreign government, such as Qatar, for use as Air Force One under President Donald Trump. Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) sought to send the bill back to committee with instructions to strike any provisions that may cut Medicaid payments for substance use disorder treatment. The motion failed in a 47-53 vote. Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) offered a motion to send the bill back to committee to ensure no provision cuts food assistance benefits for families with children under the age of 12. Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) offered an amendment to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to prohibit the use of Defense Production Act funds without the approval of Congress. Sixty votes were needed for passage. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD) sought to send the bill back to committee with instructions to strike any provision that reduces taxes on people making more than $10 million. Senators took a voice vote, and the “no's” prevailed. Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) filed a motion to have the bill go back to committee and strike provisions that reduce the average tax liability of people making more than $100 million. The motion failed by a voice vote. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) brought a motion to instruct the Finance Committee to take out portions of the bill that would reduce taxes on those making more than $500 million. Sen. Angus King (I-ME) offered the motion to direct the committee to strike any provision that reduces tax liabilities for those with an income above $1 billion. The motion was not agreed to in a 47-53 vote. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) brought an amendment to increase to 39.6% the income tax rate for people making more than $25 million and provide additional funding to the Rural Health Transformation Program, doubling the rural hospital fund to $50 million. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) offered a motion to eliminate a provision in the bill that would strike school vouchers for private schools. Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) offered an amendment to terminate wind and solar tax credits, which would be enacted 60 days after passage. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced an amendment to bar unemployment benefits from being distributed ot “jobless” millionaires. The motion passed through a voice vote. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) brought an amendment to reduce the cost of prescription drugs in Medicare and expand dental, vision, and hearing coverage. The vote, which needed 60 votes to pass, failed 47-53. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) moved to strip her provision over artificial intelligence regulation after a deal over the amendment fell through. The motion to strip language aimed at stopping states from developing AI regulations passed overwhelmingly, 99-1. Sen. Thom Thillis (R-NC) was the lone “no” vote. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) sought to add an amendment to extend tax credits for wind and solar facilities. The motion failed 47-53 in a party-line vote. Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) offered an amendment to require Medicaid providers to check the federal government's list of deceased people before paying out benefits. The amendment was passed by a voice vote. Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-CO) offered an amendment to extend residential clean energy credits till the end of next year. The motion failed 48-52, with Collins voting in favor. The effort failed in a 49-51 vote. Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) seeks to strip a provision from the bill that would have increased rent costs on D.C.-area airports and instead use revenues from lease payments from Metropolitan Washington Airports for aviation safety improvements. The amendment failed in a 50-50 tie vote. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) sought to strip appropriations in the bill to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, worth about $100 million, according to Van Hollen. Presented by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the senator sought to strike the new SNAP guidelines helping states with high benefit error rates.</p>

Senate Republicans rallied to send President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" back to the House, notching a major victory in their record-shattering march toward getting the legislation signed into law. Nearly every Republican in the upper chamber coalesced to advance Trump's $3.3 trillion megabill, save for Sens.Thom Tillis, R-N.C., Rand Paul, R-Ky, and Susan Collins, R-Maine. Vice President JD Vance's tie-breaking vote was needed to push the bill across the finish line – unlike on Saturday, when the Ohio Republican descended on Capitol Hill in anticipation of a tight vote to proceed with debate on the bill. That comes after Republican leadership tried to win over the votes of Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, with sweeteners in the final, amended version of the bill. The bill now heads to the House, where fiscal hawks in the House Freedom Caucus are frustrated with what they say are shallow spending cuts, and moderates are concerned over cuts to Medicaid. All have warned that they may not support the bill. Still, Republican leaders have made clear that they intend to have the bill on Trump's desk by Friday. Many House Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called on the Senate to change as little as possible. A product that could pass the House was front of mind for some Senate Republicans as the day dragged on. "We're talking to the House," Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said. "We know they're going to have some issues over there, just like we had some issues when it came over here, too. "We're moving to the point that we're getting more balance, and what I've said all along is let's have balance in the bill," the Missouri Republican said. Senate Majority Leader John Thune speaks during a news conference following the weekly Senate Republican policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on June 17, 2025. The blur from Monday to Tuesday, like the weekend slog before it, was not without its own dramatics. Senate Democrats tried numerous times to shelve the legislation during the "vote-a-rama," while Republicans sought to revive certain measures that were scrapped – like provisions that would have booted illegal immigrants from Medicaid – or amendments to sate key Republican holdouts. And before the bill was put on the floor for a final vote, last-minute deals were struck and changes made in a "wraparound" amendment to attract holdouts. Included was the doubling of the rural hospital fund to $50 billion, which was pushed by Collins, and a rollback of the start date of supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) work requirements for states with higher payment error rates, like Alaska. Senate Republicans have pitched the bill as a way to both turbocharge the economy and as a means to prevent Trump's first-term tax cuts from expiring. They have simultaneously used it as a vehicle to achieve deep spending cuts in the neighborhood of $1.5 trillion. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released two sets of scores Saturday and Sunday that reflected both current policy and current law. But under current law, the package would add roughly $3.3 trillion. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., countered that when it came to spending, Senate Democrats were being hypocritical. "I've been here a long time," Thune said. "And I've not been involved in a single spending debate and fight in which Republicans were trying to spend less, and Democrats were trying to spend more, with one exception. "The American people will not forget what Republicans do in this chamber today," Schumer said. Alex Miller is a writer for Fox News Digital covering the U.S. Senate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BERLIN (AP) — A man suspected of gathering information on Jewish locations and individuals in Berlin for Iranian intelligence, possibly with a view to attacks, has been arrested in Denmark, German prosecutors said Tuesday. The Danish national, identified only as Ali S. in line with German privacy rules, was arrested on Thursday in the Danish city of Aarhus, federal prosecutors said in a statement. The man was tasked by an Iranian intelligence service early this year with gathering information on “Jewish localities and specific Jewish individuals” in Berlin, prosecutors said. He spied on three properties in June, “presumably in preparation of further intelligence activities in Germany, possibly including terrorist attacks on Jewish targets,” prosecutors said. German Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig said that “if this suspicion is confirmed, we are dealing with an outrageous operation,” adding in a statement that “the protection of Jewish life has the highest priority for the German government.” German security authorities stepped up protection for Jewish and Israeli facilities after a 12-day war broke out between Israel and Iran in June. The information leading to his arrest came from Germany's domestic intelligence service, prosecutors said. He will be brought before a judge in Germany to determine whether he's kept in custody pending formal charges after extradition from Denmark. It wasn't immediately clear when that will happen. Iranian Ambassador Majid Nili Ahmadabadi was summoned to the German Foreign Ministry after prosecutors announced the arrest. The Iranian Embassy in Berlin rejected what it called “unfounded and dangerous allegations” of an apparent plan for an attack on Jewish facilities. It said in an emailed statement that they “appear to be part of a deliberate campaign” to divert attention from “the recent aggression of the Israeli regime against Iranian territory” and the killing of Iranians. Germany is a staunch ally of Israel and has a history of tense relations with Tehran, though it has been one of the three leading European powers trying to engage Iran in diplomacy over its nuclear program. That left the Islamic Republic with only its embassy in Berlin.</p>

FIRST ON FOX: Two Chinese nationals face serious charges after they allegedly acted as agents of the People's Republic of China's government to collect intelligence about U.S. Navy service members and bases, while also recruiting other military members to carry out tasks for the country's main foreign intelligence service, the Ministry of State Security (MSS). The Department of Justice (DOJ) said Chinese national Yuance Chen, who resides in Happy Valley, Oregon, and Liren Lai, who traveled to Houston on a tourist visa in April 2025, were arrested on Friday. Along with assisting with the recruitment of potential MSS assets and gathering intel about service members and bases, the two men are accused of facilitating a "dead drop" payment of cash on behalf of the MSS. The FBI arrested both men on Friday – Chen was arrested in Happy Valley while Lai was arrested in Houston – with help from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). Chinese national Yuance Chen, second from left, is accused of acting as an agent of the Chinese government to collect intelligence about U.S. Navy service members and bases. Chen was photographed on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln in January 2025, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. "Today's arrests reflect the FBI's unwavering commitment to protecting our national security and safeguarding the integrity of our military," FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News Digital. "The individuals charged were acting on behalf of a hostile foreign intelligence service — part of the Chinese Communist Party's broader effort to infiltrate and undermine our institutions. Thanks to outstanding coordination with our partners, including NCIS, we disrupted those efforts and sent a clear message: the United States will not tolerate espionage on American soil. Our counterintelligence operations remain focused, vigilant, and relentless." The MSS is also responsible for foreign intelligence, counterintelligence and political security. The FBI arrested two Chinese nationals on June 27, who were accused of working in the U.S. as agents of a foreign country. The two men were in Guangzhou, China in January 2022, when they allegedly collaborated to facilitate a dead-drop payment of at least $10,000 on behalf of the MSS. Lai and Chen continued working on behalf of the MSS after the cash drop payment and helped with identifying Navy individuals who might be willing to work on behalf of the MSS as well. Naval installation in Washington State as well as a Navy recruitment center in San Gabriel, California. While at the recruitment center, Chen allegedly took photos of a bulletin board that contained the names, programs and hometowns of Navy recruits. The DOJ also alleged that the MSS gave Chen instructions on what to say to potential recruits when it came to payment that could be made by the MSS, preferred Naval job assignments for potential recruits and methods to minimize Chen's risk of being exposed. Chen ultimately began to communicate with a member of the Navy on social media, the DOJ alleges, and arranged for a tour of the USS Abraham Lincoln in San Diego with the employee. In April 2024 and March 2025, Chen traveled to Guangzhou where he met with MSS intelligence officers, the complaint alleged, to discuss pay for specific tasks. Lai also allegedly traveled to Houston in April 2025 and claimed the purpose of the visit was related to his business as an online retailer. But on May 9, 2025, which was more than four weeks after he arrived in the U.S., Lai was seen traveling in a car with a companion from Houston to California, and back to Junction, Texas, on May 15. Chen and Lai have been charged with operating in the U.S. as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the U.S. attorney general. If convicted, both men face a fine of up to $250,000 and up to 10 years behind bars. "Hostile foreign intelligence services like the PRC's Ministry of State Security dedicate years to recruiting individuals and cultivating them as intelligence assets to do their bidding within the United States," Assistant Attorney General John Eisenberg of the Justice Department's National Security Division said. "Under my leadership, the National Security Division will continue to defend our nation and way of life by rooting out and exposing our adversaries' clandestine spy networks."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EVERGLADES, Florida — President Donald Trump on Tuesday will tour Alligator Alcatraz, a newly completed, federally run immigrant detention facility in the heart of Florida swampland, following hours of constant construction in the lead-up to his arrival. A Secret Service agent stood by the site's entrance, approving or denying vehicles that attempted to pass through the gated entrance off of Tamiami Trail, a one-lane road that links Miami to the Gulf Coast city of Naples. The agent was supported by several Florida National Guard members who stood nearby a Humvee. Several reporters were on site, with more press and protesters expected Tuesday as Trump shows up to inspect the rush job of building an emergency ICE jail. The Washington Examiner reported Sunday evening that Trump would make an appearance at the facility, which was confirmed Monday by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “President Trump will travel to the great state of Florida to attend the opening of a new illegal alien detention center located at Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, alongside [Homeland Security] Secretary Kristi Noem, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), congressman Byron Donalds, and other state and local leaders,” Leavitt said Monday afternoon during a briefing at the White House. 📍I'm in the Everglades, previewing where Trump is slated to arrive Tuesday morning to inspect ICE's new immigrant detention center at Dade-Collier Airport pic.twitter.com/4aaKDEYGRE “It is isolated and surrounded by dangerous wildlife in unforgiving terrain. This is an efficient and low-cost way to help carry out the largest mass deportation campaign in American history.” Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, a Republican, proposed the project earlier in June and touted that the tent facility would not require much of a barrier surrounding the site because if immigrants were to escape, “there's not much waiting for them, other than alligators and pythons.” DeSantis took executive action in late June, greenlighting an expeditious effort to stand up the soft-sided facilities at the mostly unused airport strip. During remarks Monday celebrating the state's fiscal 2025-2026 budget, DeSantis said the multipurpose airport and detention center created an “effective way” to increase ICE deportations. As a candidate, Trump promised to carry out the largest-ever deportation operation, but his administration has struggled to achieve such a feat without enough ICE officers or detention space nationwide. Although DeSantis was an opponent of Trump in the 2024 GOP presidential primary, he has been a supporter of the deportation operation. Earlier this year, DeSantis allowed state and county law enforcement to work directly with ICE to arrest illegal immigrants at a faster rate. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, previewed Trump's visit with a press release issued Monday that highlighted how some of the “worst of the worst criminal aliens” have already been arrested in Florida as part of the Trump administration's plan to go after and deport criminal illegal immigrants. “We will expand facilities and bed space in just days thanks to our partnership with Florida.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? What the debate over “clarification” laws reveals about America three years out from Roe. By the time Republican Rep. Kat Cammack arrived at a Florida emergency room, she was facing an urgent medical crisis: Her pregnancy, then five weeks along, had become ectopic and now threatened her life. It was May 2024, and though Florida's new and particularly restrictive six-week abortion ban did allow abortion in cases like hers, Cammack said she spent hours convincing hospital staff to administer the standard treatment for ending nonviable pregnancies. Doctors expressed fears about losing their licenses, prompting Cammack to pull up the legislation on her phone to show them that her case fell within legal parameters. Now pregnant again, Cammack recently described her experience to the Wall Street Journal, accusing the political left of “fearmongering” and creating confusion among health care providers that ultimately puts patients at risk. Her view — that confusion stems from abortion rights advocates, not the laws themselves — has become a rallying point for anti-abortion leaders. Christina Francis, the head of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, blames mainstream medical groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) for misleading doctors about when they can provide abortions in states with bans. “They've…stated that doctors couldn't intervene in those [life-threatening] situations or they would face prosecution, and in fact, they're still peddling that lie,” she told Vox. Other high-profile cases of doctors hesitating to provide emergency care have surfaced in the media, adding significant pressure on anti-abortion lawmakers who insist there's no legislative ambiguity to be found. Partly in response, red state lawmakers have been moving to address — or at least signal they're addressing — gray areas in their laws, passing “clarifications” to give doctors more concrete guidance on when they can provide emergency abortions and how criminal penalties would kick in. The Guttmacher Institute found that this is one of the top legislative trends for reproductive health care this year, with 42 bills introduced across 12 states. Most Americans — across parties, genders, and regions — favor allowing abortion when the pregnancy endangers the mother's life or results from rape or incest, and strong majorities also back exceptions for severe fetal anomalies or serious health problems. All state abortion bans currently include exceptions to “prevent the death” or “preserve the life” of the pregnant patient, and many also include some sort of health exception, typically to prevent “permanent” damage to a “major” bodily function. The new bills proposing amendments to abortion bans are fueling debates over whether incremental improvements are worth the risk of creating false confidence that major legal obstacles have been resolved. As confusion mounts, supporters of abortion restrictions have doubled down on the argument that this is really not a big deal. “So many of these state laws have been in place for either three years or close to three years, and there's not been a single doctor prosecuted for intervening when a woman's life would be in danger,” she said. But Francis also acknowledged that physicians were left without reliable guidance from hospitals, state agencies, and professional associations, institutions with attorneys who are themselves uncertain. A Washington Post investigation from late 2023 found that hospital lawyers and compliance teams often hesitated to advise doctors definitively, leaving physicians unsure when and how they could legally act. Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti of Tennessee argued it wasn't his state's ban that was harming women, but “other factors like doctors' independent choices not to provide permissible abortions.” Still, even as conservatives double down on their accusations of fearmongering, Republican-led states have been quietly adjusting their laws to ease doctors' fears of being prosecuted for providing emergency care. Some states, like Idaho, have moved to scrap their “affirmative defense” provisions — meaning doctors would no longer have to be charged with a crime first and then prove in court that the abortion was medically necessary. Tennessee moved this year to provide specific examples of what constitutes a permissible exception, including PPROM (the rupture of fetal membranes before 24 weeks of gestation), severe preeclampsia (a high blood pressure disorder), and other infections risking uterine rupture. Texas's changes to its abortion law took effect on June 20. Its legislation, like Utah's, clarifies that doctors can perform abortions when a pregnant patient faces a life-threatening condition caused or worsened by pregnancy without waiting for that risk to become “imminent.” The law also standardizes the definition of “medical emergency” across various state statutes, and it requires training for doctors and lawyers to learn more about these exceptions. “We all thought it is important that the law be crystal clear,” state Sen. Bryan Hughes, who introduced Texas's clarification bill this year, said in the legislature. Last fall he defended his state's abortion ban, which he also authored, as “plenty clear” and blamed news organizations for muddying the waters. (Abortion rights supporters have blasted the video, which they say provides no real guidelines or legal clarity to practicing physicians.) This is just so politicians can say they fixed it,” Molly Duane, a senior attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told Vox. ACOG also opposed Texas's bill, and the group's general counsel Molly Meegan wrote last month that “the solution to a bad law is not to further legislate that law. One of the hard realities abortion rights advocates face is that in order to secure more legal protection for physicians working under vague abortion bans, they often must accept language crafted by anti-abortion lobbyists that could make things worse in the future. That controversial language can limit what types of procedures get classified as abortion or can introduce ideological terms like “maternal-fetal separation,” which are not standard in mainstream medical practice and can help justify or require medical alternatives to abortion, like cesarean deliveries and inductions of labor, that carry greater risk for patients. While such semantic distinctions may offer doctors some short-term legal protection, activists warn they risk reinforcing a false moral hierarchy between “good” and “bad” abortions and stigmatize some forms of care rather than helping the public understand that all these procedures fall under the same broader category of abortion. Beshear echoed these concerns in his veto announcement, blasting the clarification bill for using “new definitions that have been advanced by advocates who oppose in vitro fertilization and birth control.” He warned that using such language sets “a stage for future legislation and litigation” that put health care options at risk. Many physicians say they do not feel reassured by these clarifications. The push for clearer laws reveals a fundamental tension: Abortion rights advocates say exceptions like “ectopic pregnancy” with no further detail are too vague, yet also argue that the practices of medicine are too complex to codify in law. Given these trade-offs, abortion rights supporters are left grappling with a basic strategic question: whether imperfect progress is worth the potential costs. “I think that's the age-old question,” said Kimya Forouzan, a state policy researcher at the Guttmacher Institute, which has been tracking legislative trends. “If one person could get help getting an abortion that's great but at the same time these [clarification] bills are not causing the problem that abortion bans create to go away.” Writing in the New York Times in 2023, she explained why she supported modest changes to her state's abortion ban, even as she understood the arguments of fellow abortion rights supporters that such imperfect amendments come with risks. “I worry that reproductive rights advocates may be digging into untenable positions and failing to listen to those affected most by the current reality,” she wrote. “Do we support incremental changes that provide minimum safety for pregnant women and physicians?” Many still exclude abortions for rape and incest — despite polling showing that majorities of Americans want those carve-outs — and almost no state allows abortion for mental health reasons, despite mental health conditions accounting for over 20 percent of pregnancy-related deaths in the US. Looking ahead, Americans should expect to see more incremental legislative tweaks coupled with state-mandated training, as anti-abortion leaders hail the passage of such medical education, or “med ed,” laws. Whether this strategy proves durable may depend on how much evidence accumulates that the core problems — criminal penalties, prosecutorial discretion, hospital risk management — run deeper than confusion about legal language. The med ed campaigns represent an acknowledgment that something needed fixing. How Trump's “big, beautiful bill” attacks abortion and reproductive care, in 2 charts. The Republican justices just nuked much of federal Medicaid law, in order to spite Planned Parenthood.﻿ Red states are testing their power to restrict abortion nationwide.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is threatening to impose higher tariffs on Japanese exports to the United States over what he claims is the country's unwillingness to buy American-grown rice. In other words, we'll just be sending them a letter, and we love having them as a Trading Partner for many years to come,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. The country bought $298 million worth of rice from the US last year, according to US Census Bureau trade data. However, it's unclear if Japanese officials involved in ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries have said they will stop buying rice from the US in the future. On Tuesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said that trade talks between the two sides are ongoing, and that the Japanese government is aware of Trump's claim, though he declined to comment on it. “While we refrain from disclosing the specifics of our discussions with the US, Japan will continue to vigorously pursue sincere and honest discussions with the aim of achieving an agreement that will benefit both Japan and the US,” he said. A 2021 report published by the Office of the United States Trade Representative under former President Joe Biden stated that “Japan's highly regulated and nontransparent system of importation and distribution for rice limits the ability of US exporters to have meaningful access to Japan's consumers.” A source familiar with Trump's thinking told CNN that's what he was referring to in his post. Trump has said recently that his administration plans to send some foreign countries letters advising them of what their new tariff rates could be, following the pause of his April “reciprocal” tariffs on US trading partners. And in a Fox News interview that aired on Sunday, Trump singled out Japan as one of the possible countries set to receive a letter. “Dear Mr. Japan, here's the story: You're going to pay a 25% tariff on your cars,” he said. Trump's Truth Social message comes with just days to go until the July 9 deadline when his 90-day pause on those “reciprocal” tariffs expires. It's unclear what will happen to tariff rates for the dozens of impacted countries. Before Trump announced the pause, Japanese exports were briefly subjected to a minimum tariff rate of 24%. White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on Monday suggested that negotiations with Japan are ongoing. “Nothing is over,” Hassett told reporters at the White House. “I know what he just posted, but there'll still be discussions right up till the end. Even if we get a framework, then there's still gonna be things to finalize.” CNN's Yumi Asada and John Liu contributed reporting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At first, though, the researchers thought they were observing something exotic. “We got all excited, thinking we had discovered an unknown object in the vicinity of the Earth,” said Clancy James, an associate professor at Curtin University's Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy in Western Australia. The data James and his colleagues were looking at came from the ASKAP radio telescope, an array of 36 dish antennas in Wajarri Yamaji Country, each about three stories tall. “These are incredibly powerful explosions in radio (waves) that last about a millisecond,” James said. “We don't know what's producing them, and we're trying to find out, because they really challenge known physics — they're so bright. Astronomers believe these bursts may come from magnetars, according to James. These objects are very dense remnants of dead stars with powerful magnetic fields. Related article A long-standing puzzle of ‘missing' ordinary matter in the universe may be solved, astronomers say But the signal seemed to be coming from very close to Earth — so close that it couldn't be an astronomical object. “We were able to work out it came from about 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) away. And we got a pretty exact match for this old satellite called Relay 2 — there are databases that you can look up to work out where any given satellite should be, and there were no other satellites anywhere near,” James said. NASA launched Relay 2, an experimental communications satellite, into orbit in 1964. It was an updated version of Relay 1, which lifted off two years earlier and was used to relay signals between the US and Europe and broadcast the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Just three years later, with its mission concluded and both of its main instruments out of order, Relay 2 had already turned into space junk. It has since been aimlessly orbiting our planet, until James and his colleagues linked it to the weird signal they detected last year. But could a dead satellite suddenly come back to life after decades of silence? “(T)he reason we were getting this blurred image was because (the source) was in the near field of the antenna — within a few tens of thousands of kilometers,” James said. The whole signal is about 30 nanoseconds, or 30 billionths of a second, but the main part is just about three nanoseconds, and that's actually at the limit of what our instrument can see,” James said. The main culprit was likely a buildup of static electricity on the satellite's metal skin, which was suddenly released, James said. And it keeps charging up until there's enough of a charge that it short-circuits some component of the spacecraft, and you get a sudden spark,” he explained. “And this plasma can emit a short burst of radio waves.” “We do know that (electrostatic) discharges can actually be quite common,” James said. Because these discharges are difficult to monitor, James believes the radio signal event shows that ground-based radio observations could reveal “weird things happening to satellites” — and that researchers could employ a much cheaper, easier-to-build device to search for similar events, rather than the sprawling telescope they used. He also speculated that because Relay 2 was an early satellite, it might be that the materials it's made of are more prone to a buildup of static charge than modern satellites, which have been designed with this problem in mind. But the realization that satellites can interfere with galactic observations also presents a challenge and adds to the list of threats posed by space junk. Since the dawn of the Space Age, almost 22,000 satellites have reached orbit, and a little more than half are still functioning. “We are trying to see basically nanosecond bursts of stuff coming at us from the universe, and if satellites can produce this as well, then we're going to have to be really careful,” James said, referring to the possibility of confusing satellite bursts with astronomical objects. James and his team's analysis of this event is “comprehensive and sensible,” according to James Cordes, Cornell University's George Feldstein Professor of Astronomy, who was not involved with the study. “Given that the electrostatic discharge phenomenon has been known for a long time,” he wrote in an email to CNN, “I think their interpretation is probably right. Related article Largest celestial object of its kind discovered in the distant universe The study illustrates how astronomers must take care to not confuse radio bursts from astrophysical sources with electrostatic discharges or micrometeoroid bursts, both Cordes and Spencer pointed out. “The results show that such narrow pulses from space may be more common than previously thought, and that careful analysis is needed to show that the radiation comes from stars and other astronomical objects rather than man-made objects close to the Earth,” Spencer added in an email. “New experiments now in development, such as the Square Kilometre array Low frequency array (SKA-Low) being built in Australia, will be able to shed light on this new effect.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Thom Tillis' announcement that he won't seek reelection next year opens a prize opportunity for North Carolina Republicans. Multiple Trump allies looking to enter the race have begun reaching out to the president's aides, potentially seeking an endorsement that would all but lock out other challengers in a GOP primary. But Lara Trump, the former Republican National Committee co-chair and a key campaign surrogate last year, has the right of first refusal on an endorsement by her father-in-law, those sources say. Should she decide not to run, Republicans aligned with Donald Trump plan to conduct a full assessment of candidate possibilities in a race Democrats will contest as a potential opportunity to cut into the GOP's majority. “It would be great for her to run,” one source who has spoken to the president about the prospect told CNN. A source familiar with Lara Trump's thinking said she's been fielding calls from Republicans encouraging her to run and is considering it. “There is a lot for her to factor into this decision, like losing time with her kids,” the source said, noting that she had taken those factors into consideration when weighing running for Senate from North Carolina in 2022 and from Florida last year when then-Sen. Marco Rubio was nominated for secretary of state. Lara Trump is a native of North Carolina and a graduate of North Carolina State University. “There are a ton of conversations happening in every direction, but the reality is everything hinges on the decision Lara Trump makes,” said Republican strategist and North Carolina native Doug Heye. Some other potential candidates have already begun scheduling meetings in the meantime with the White House, including Rep. Pat Harrigan. Whatley has a close relationship with the Trump administration and political machine after Trump endorsed the former North Carolina Republican Party Chairman to succeed Ronna McDaniel as Republican National Committee chair. Reps. Richard Hudson and Brad Knott are also considered contenders for a Trump endorsement. “If she declines, I was told the president will decide between Whatley, Harrigan and Knott,” said one source who has closely worked with Republicans at all levels in North Carolina. Heye noted that despite her roots in the state, Lara Trump would be running her first campaign in a state Democrats see as a prime pickup opportunity. We call them first-time candidates for a reason, because they are untested,” added Heye. However, Raleigh-based Republican consultant Jonathan Felts says he's seen Lara Trump's campaign chops up close. “We looked at Lara early in 2022, in the race to replace (former Sen. Richard) Burr, and we've stayed in contact with her over the years,” said Felts, who served as the senior adviser to the eventual GOP candidate and winner of that Senate seat, Ted Budd. “I think people might be surprised,” he said.
