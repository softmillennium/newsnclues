                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a clinical scenario drawn from my own practice. So please answer the polling question and contribute your thoughts in the comments, whether you agree or disagree. You are on call at 10:30 PM on a Friday and receive a message regarding possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The urine appears cloudy but there has been no blood. The patient feels tired but denies fever or back pain. She indicates that she experienced similar symptoms to her current complaints about 9 months ago, and she improved after a course of antibiotics that lasted “about 10 days.” Prior to that, her only other UTI occurred 6 years ago during pregnancy. In this case, I would choose to treat now and not delay symptom resolution. The lifetime prevalence of UTI among women in the United States is between 50% and 60% and increases with age. In a retrospective analysis from the United Kingdom, 21% of patients aged 65 years or older had at least one UTI over a 10-year period. While complications of UTIs are rare among women without significant comorbidity, even uncomplicated UTIs can have a negative effect on quality of life. The domains most affected by UTI include sexual function, sleep, exercise, and physical labor. So, our patient is facing a common health issue associated with significant adverse consequences. What is the best approach to management for this patient? The authors of this guideline reiterate the common symptoms of UTI (ie, dysuria, urinary frequency, hesitancy, urgency, pain/discomfort, bladder spasms, and hematuria) and stress evaluation for uncomplicated UTI. Uncomplicated UTI typically occurs in immunocompetent, nonpregnant women with no anatomical or physiologic abnormalities of the genitourinary tract, such as stones and strictures, and no permanent or intermittent catheterization. The IDSA also stresses evaluation for past history of UTI. Recurrent UTI is defined by at least two culture-proven UTIs in the past 6 months or three in the past year. Our patient does not meet the criteria for complicated or recurrent UTI. Therefore, she does not require urinalysis or urine culture to initiate antibiotic therapy. Generally, there is no single symptom or sign that effectively rules “in” or “out” a diagnosis of UTI. In a systematic review, the presence of dysuria, frequency, and urgency had a higher sensitivity than specificity, whereas hematuria was more specific than sensitive. Overall, empirical treatment of uncomplicated UTI among symptomatic women is the most cost-effective approach to management, but it does raise the possibility of overprescribing antibiotics and contributing to antibiotic resistance. There is no absolutely right or wrong answer for this patient. Your opinion may differ from my treatment plan, so please share! We also did not address which antibiotic to choose for this patient, so I will follow up on your comments and elaborate on some established and new treatments for UTI in my next commentary.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study has identified early-pregnancy gut microbiota signatures associated with the development of gestational diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder that carries substantial risks to both maternal and fetal health. Gestational diabetes is a prevalent metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal glucose metabolism, primarily in the mid to late stages of pregnancy. Gestational diabetes significantly increases the risk of maternal complications such as gestational hypertension, polyhydramnios, and cesarean delivery, while also posing long-term health risks for the fetus, including asphyxia at birth and increased susceptibility to obesity and diabetes in adulthood. In the new study, researchers from The Second Hospital, Southern Medical University, and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, all in Guangzhou, China, set out to identify gut microbiota dysbiosis that is strongly linked to the onset and progression of gestational diabetes that may serve as a critical early-warning biomarker. They then correlated these microbial profiles with oral glucose tolerance test results at 24-28 weeks of gestation and clinical delivery outcomes. The researchers discovered that there were significant differences in gut microbiota composition between those with gestational diabetes and women who had healthy pregnancies. Based on their findings, the researchers developed an early diagnostic model for gestational diabetes, based on genus-level markers, with high diagnostic precision. "These findings suggest that microbiota-based tools could enable early, non-invasive detection of gestational diabetes mellitus, offering new opportunities for prevention and personalized management," write the study authors. "This research highlights the role of the gut microbiome in pregnancy and has important implications for improving maternal and fetal health outcomes."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Tohoku University have discovered that an oral drug called MA-5 can improve both heart and muscle problems in Barth syndrome, a rare genetic disorder affecting 1 in 300,000 births worldwide with no current cure. Barth syndrome is caused by mutations in the TAZ gene that leave patients—mostly young boys—with weakened hearts, muscle fatigue, and increased rates of infection. Many require heart transplants, and current treatments only manage symptoms without addressing the underlying cause. The research team, led by Professors Takaaki Abe, and Takafumi Toyohara, and first author Yoshiyasu Tongu, tested MA-5 on cells from four Barth syndrome patients and in fruit fly (Drosophila) models of the disease. Published in The FASEB Journal on June 21, 2025, their findings reveal that MA-5 boosted cellular energy (ATP) production by up to 50% and protected cells from oxidative stress-induced death. Unlike current treatments that only manage symptoms, MA-5 actually improves the root cause of how cells generate energy." MA-5 was chosen as a treatment because it enhances interactions between two crucial mitochondrial proteins—mitofilin and ATP synthase—leading to more efficient energy production. As such, this mechanism directly addresses the cause of cellular dysfunction in Barth syndrome. In human muscle cells derived from Barth syndrome iPS cell models, MA-5 corrected abnormal mitochondrial structures and reduced cellular stress markers. When tested in Drosophila with Barth syndrome, the drug dramatically improved their climbing ability (capacity for physical exertion) and normalized their elevated heart rates—two key symptoms that mirror how the disease affects humans. Furthermore, MA-5 restored normal mitochondrial structure in the Drosophila muscle tissue. These promising results suggest that MA-5 addresses the largest challenges faced by patients with Barth syndrome, which would significantly improve their quality of life. Phase I clinical trials in Japan have been completed successfully, and the research team is preparing to start Phase II trials soon. "We've validated MA-5 using patient cells, iPS cell models and a Drosophila model of Barth syndrome," remarks Abe. "The evidence from all of these studies supports its potential effectiveness in patients with Barth syndrome, which we hope to examine more in the next clinical trial." Critically, MA-5 can be taken orally, which makes administration significantly easier for pediatric patients. The team's findings suggest that MA-5 could become the first disease-modifying treatment for Barth syndrome, offering new therapeutic options beyond current symptomatic management.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today, a new ESC Clinical Consensus Statement published in the European Heart Journal discusses the key role of vaccination in preventing cardiovascular events following various viral and bacterial infections. We have known for many years that influenza can increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and can exacerbate heart failure. More recently, evidence suggests that other respiratory infections are also associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The new publication describes how vaccinations not only prevent infections but also reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, particularly in susceptible individuals." The ESC Clinical Consensus Statement describes data on the risk of cardiovascular complications following infections such as pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus, among others, and describes the inflammatory mechanisms that may be responsible. Evidence is then summarised for the beneficial effects of vaccines in reducing cardiovascular events following various viral and bacterial infections, particularly in at-risk patient groups. Clinical practice guidelines from the ESC and from the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) are presented, which advocate for vaccination against influenza and other widespread infections in patients with chronic coronary syndromes (including coronary artery disease) and in those with heart failure. The consensus statement also discusses the risks of cardiovascular adverse events after vaccination, such as myocarditis, and describes appropriate management strategies. Then follows advice on which vaccines should be given to patients with cardiovascular diseases and how often. Vaccination of pregnant women and other vulnerable patient groups, such as those with congenital heart disease and heart transplantation, is considered. Professor Lüscher concluded: "Prevention is crucial for reducing the considerable burden of cardiovascular disease. The totality of the evidence indicates that vaccinations should become a foundational pillar of preventive strategies alongside other established measures."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Washington State University researchers have discovered how the bacteria that cause anaplasmosis and Lyme disease hijack cellular processes in ticks to ensure their survival and spread to new hosts, including humans. The findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could serve as a launching point for developing methods to eliminate the bacteria in ticks before they are transmitted to humans and other animals. What we have found could open the door to targeting these pathogens in ticks, before they are ever a threat to people." Kaylee Vosbigian, doctoral student and lead author on the study Vosbigian and her advisor, Dana Shaw, the corresponding author of the study and an associate professor in the Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, focused their research on Ixodes scapularis, also known as the blacklegged tick, which is responsible for spreading both Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agents of anaplasmosis and Lyme disease. The team discovered that when ATF6 is activated in tick cells, it triggers the production of stomatin, a protein that helps move cholesterol through cells as part of a normal cellular processes. The bacteria exploit this process against their tick hosts, using the cholesterol –which they need to grow and build their own cell membranes but cannot produce themselves – to support their own survival and success. "Stomatin plays a variety of roles in the cell, but one of its key functions is helping shuttle cholesterol to different areas," Vosbigian said. As part of the study, Vosbigian also developed a new research tool called ArthroQuest, a free, web-based platform hosted by WSU that allows scientists to search the genomes of ticks, mosquitoes, lice, sand flies, mites, fleas and other arthropod vectors for transcription factor binding sites – genetic switches like ATF6 that control gene activity. "Most are built for humans or model species like fruit flies, which are genetically very different from ticks." Using ArthroQuest, the team found that ATF6-regulated control of stomatin appears to be prevalent in blood-feeding arthropods. Since the hijacking of cholesterol and other lipids is common among arthropod-borne pathogens, the researchers suspect many may also exploit ATF6. "We know many other vector-borne pathogens, like Borrelia burgdorferi and the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium, rely on cholesterol and other lipids from their hosts," Shaw said. "So, the fact that this ATF6-stomatin pathway exists in other arthropods could be relevant to a wide range of disease systems." The research was supported in part by a National Institutes of Health R01 grant and a College of Veterinary Medicine intramural seed grant. ATF6 enables pathogen infection in ticks by inducing stomatin and altering cholesterol dynamics. Explore how spectrophotometry is evolving to deliver speed and accuracy in biopharma workflows.

Their findings reveal a patchwork landscape: while countries like Switzerland, France, and Germany have introduced national SCC programs, most others lag behind or rely solely on localized pilots. This review highlights both systemic inertia and promising technologies—such as AI-enabled apps—that could bridge the gap in diagnosis and care, advocating for Europe to rethink and revitalize its approach to neonatal liver screening. This review assessed a wide range of data—from published literatures to digital health tools—on three major screening strategies: SCC, serum bilirubin testing, and biochemical profiling. France followed through a parent-led advocacy campaign, while Germany only recently mandated SCC use nationwide. Studies consistently show SCC's effectiveness improves dramatically when accompanied by clear referral guidance. Yet many pediatricians still resist its use, citing workload and psychological concerns. Recent breakthroughs such as Italy's PopòApp and Germany's AI-powered stool image analysis show strong potential for improving accuracy and scalability. Europe has no shortage of expertise, evidence, or technology—what's missing is coordinated action. But time is of the essence—each delay costs lives." Professor Barbara E. Wildhaber, senior author of the study A unified European strategy could turn the tide against BA-related infant mortality. Serum bilirubin testing, though more expensive, captures a wider spectrum of liver diseases and could complement SCC-based programs. Countries may benefit most from hybrid screening models tailored to their healthcare infrastructure. Crucially, any technical rollout must be paired with education, awareness, and strong political advocacy.

A series of retrospective studies reported that women treated with low-dose oral minoxidil (LDOM) experience orthostatic symptoms more frequently than men, despite normal blood pressure (BP) readings.

“Presence of hypotensive symptoms without measurable hypotension raises the possibility that symptom perception or anxiety-related responses to cardiovascular sensations may influence tolerability, especially in women,” the study authors wrote. “Further research is warranted to explore the physiologic and psychologic mechanisms underlying these sex-based differences, which could inform more personalized dosing and monitoring strategies,” they added.

The study was conducted by Michael M. Ong, BS, Weill Cornell Medicine, and Shari Lipner, MD, Department of Dermatology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York City, and was published online on June 26 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

The reliance solely on BP measurements may not fully capture the range of vascular sensitivity experienced by patients.

The study received no funding. Lipner disclosed serving as a consultant for Moberg Pharma and BelleTorus Corporation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fasting diets, which involve alternating periods of fasting and eating, are effective in alleviating the symptoms of type 2 diabetes and can be easier to follow than reducing daily calorie intake over a long time. A new study, conducted using real-world evidence, shows that individuals with type 2 diabetes who follow a fasting diet involving restricted energy intake for 5 consecutive days per month exhibit improvements in blood glucose (sugar) levels, weight loss, and a reduced reliance on diabetes medications. This fasting program has been patented by L-Nutra, a nutrient technology company. “This study demonstrates how the fasting-mimicking diet (FMD), when combined with physician oversight and registered dietitian (RD) coaching, can be safely and effectively implemented in real-world clinical settings to manage type 2 diabetes.” The treatment for type 2 diabetes typically involves a combination of lifestyle modifications and medications. However, adhering to such a diet over the long term is challenging. Additionally, the body adapts to long-term calorie restriction, resulting in a slower metabolism, which makes sustained weight loss more challenging. The fasting-mimicking diet is a form of periodic fasting that involves restricted calorie intake for 4 to 7 consecutive days per month. Researchers have developed the fasting mimicking diet to simulate the beneficial health effects of water-only fasting, which involves only water intake during a 24 to 72-hour period. The authors of the current study have developed a patented low-calorie, plant-based diet that is low in sugar and protein, but rich in healthy unsaturated fats and fiber. Moreover, a recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated that a 5-day fasting mimicking diet combined with medications was more effective than medications alone in improving blood glucose control and reducing medication reliance. These results were observed under highly controlled conditions in a clinical trial, including strict criteria for patient inclusion and exclusion. The present study included data from patients enrolled in a diabetes management program that involved following a monthly 5-day fasting-mimicking diet under the supervision of physicians and registered dietitians. Patients were enrolled in the study on a rolling basis, and data were collected from those who had completed at least 3 or 6 months of the program. At the end of 3 and 6 months, the fasting-mimicking diet was effective in facilitating weight loss and reducing glycated hemoglobin levels, a marker of blood glucose levels. The fasting-mimicking diet also helped a greater percentage of participants achieve blood glucose control at these time points than at the time of enrolment. “Most participants are able to integrate the fasting-mimicking diet into their daily lives without significant disruption. Because it's a 5-day monthly intervention rather than a daily regimen, many find it feasible to complete even with work and family obligations, especially with RD support to tailor practical strategies for adherence and personalization.” Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, a preventive cardiology dietitian and heart health expert at Entirely Nourished, not involved in this study, expressed some caution about the findings. “Although these symptoms resolved between cycles, they may pose risks for certain individuals, especially those with coexisting health conditions or frailty,“ she pointed out. Hsu also cautioned that: “While the program accommodates most individuals with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, certain conditions are exclusionary, such as recent cardiovascular events, end-stage diabetes complications, frailty, a BMI under 18, or allergies to FMD ingredients. There is evidence that following a low-calorie diet can place type 2 diabetes into long-term remission. How long might it take for a person to reverse T2DM and enter remission? Read on to learn about strategies that may help achieve remission. Why might a person with type 2 diabetes experiencing high blood sugars after exercise?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The research suggests that "inflammaging"-chronic, low-grade inflammation associated with aging-appears to be a byproduct of industrialized lifestyles and varies significantly across global populations. Researchers analyzed data from four populations: two industrialized groups-the Italian InCHIANTI study and the Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study (SLAS)-and two Indigenous, non-industrialized populations-the Tsimane of the Bolivian Amazon and the Orang Asli of Peninsular Malaysia. In industrialized settings, we see clear links between inflammaging and diseases like chronic kidney disease. But in populations with high infection rates, inflammation appears more reflective of infectious disease burden than of aging itself." Alan Cohen, PhD, lead author, associate professor of Environmental Health Sciences at Columbia Mailman School and faculty member of the Butler Columbia Aging Center Interestingly, while the indigenous populations, particularly the Tsimane, had high constitutive levels of inflammation, these did not increase with age and, crucially, did not lead to the chronic diseases that plague industrialized societies. In fact, most chronic diseases – diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, etc. – are rare or largely absent in the Indigenous populations, meaning that even when young Indigenous people have profiles that look similar on the surface to those of older industrialized adults, these profiles do not lead to pathological consequences. "These findings really call into question the idea that inflammation is bad per se," said Cohen. "Rather, it appears that inflammation – and perhaps other aging mechanisms too – may be highly context dependent. On the one hand, that's challenging, because there won't be universal answers to scientific questions. The study used a panel of 19 cytokines-small immune-signaling proteins-to assess inflammation patterns. While these markers aligned with aging in the Italian and Singaporean datasets, they did not replicate among the Tsimane and Orang Asli, whose immune systems were shaped by persistent infections and distinct environmental exposures. "These results point to an evolutionary mismatch between our immune systems and the environments we now live in," Cohen explained. The authors call for a reevaluation of how aging and inflammation are measured across populations and emphasize the need for standardized, context-aware tools. "Factors like environment, lifestyle-such as high physical activity or a very low-fat diet-and infection may all influence how the immune system ages," said Cohen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals that oleic acid, abundant in olive oil, protects aging mice from gum infection-induced bone loss and gut microbiome disruption, highlighting how what we eat may help prevent age-related disease. Study: Mediterranean diet component oleic acid decreases systemic impact of periodontal Porphyromonas gingivalis-infection in age: addressing role of stress resistance and microbiome. Periodontitis is an age-related disease characterized by a hyperinflammatory immune response, systemic inflammation, and shifts in the pathological oral microbiome. Severe periodontal diseases (PDs) affect about 19% of adults worldwide, i.e., over one billion people. PD is a disease of the tissues around the teeth, where plaque and bacterial pathogens accumulate, leading to a heightened inflammatory response and impaired resolution of inflammation. Comorbidities, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis, can compromise tissue homeostasis at the infection site and lead to increased systemic bone loss. Serum levels of OA negatively correlate with periodontal tissue loss. One study reported that an OA-enriched diet (OA-ED) in mice with periodontal infection improved femoral bone microarchitecture and reduced systemic inflammation and alveolar bone loss compared to mice on a PA-enriched diet (PA-ED). However, whether aged individuals could benefit from specific nutritional components is unknown. In the present study, researchers investigated whether nutritional interventions with OA could modulate responses to periodontal infection and protect against systemic effects associated with aging. First, young (five-week-old) and old mice (at least 73 weeks old) were fed a PA-ED, OA-ED, or normal diet (ND) for 16 weeks. Following five weeks of oral P. gingivalis inoculation, alveolar bone crest height was unchanged in young mice. Infection increased bone loss around the periodontal ligament (PDL) in old and young mice on PA-ED compared to those on OA-ED or ND. Furthermore, bone loss in PDL was accompanied by increased osteoclasts in aged, infected mice on PA-ED relative to their aged, OA-ED counterparts. Next, microbial composition was analyzed in fecal samples one week and eight weeks after diet initiation. After one week, a distinct microbial pattern was observed in PA-ED-fed mice, characterized by increased Lachnospiraceae subtypes and reduced relative abundances of Muribaculaceae and Akkermansia. In contrast, the microbial composition was comparable between old and young mice on ND and OA-ED during the first eight weeks. Further, mice were treated with an oral antibiotic (enrofloxacin) to evaluate whether dietary intake could modulate microbiome resilience in both age groups. The microbiome of old and young PA-ED-fed animals showed marked changes in taxonomic composition with antibiotic treatment. On the other hand, OA-ED-fed mice, especially young animals, had minor changes in taxonomic composition after antibiotic exposure. Notably, while the microbiome of animals on ND or OA-ED returned to their pre-antibiosis state during the six-week follow-up, PA-ED-fed mice failed to recover their microbiome from antibiotic-induced shifts. Further, the team performed a systemic serum analysis of stress resilience phospholipid indicators to investigate whether OA-ED supports stress response and resilience associated with age and P. gingivalis infection. Uninfected ND and OA-ED animals showed age-related differences in PI proportions. However, P. gingivalis infection of old PA-ED-fed mice induced the most pronounced changes in lipidomic composition. In contrast, infection of old OA-ED or ND mice did not induce marked changes in PI composition relative to their younger counterparts. PI(18:1/18:1) is linked to stress resistance, autophagy, and ERK1/2 modulation; however, the precise mechanisms underlying these associations remain under investigation. By contrast, OA-ED stabilized PI(18:1/18:1) levels in infected young and old mice. Additional experiments indicated that PA-ED increased osteoclast differentiation and primed bone marrow cells to inflammation, while OA-ED alleviated these effects. Furthermore, osteoblasts showed baseline inflammation and reduced responsiveness to infection in aged mice, promoting a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. The study design used only male mice to control for hormonal influences on bone metabolism; this limitation is important for interpreting and translating the results to both sexes. The authors also note that, while the study reveals strong mechanistic associations, further research is required to confirm these findings in humans. The findings reveal that PA-ED aggravated P. gingivalis-related oral bone loss, especially in aged mice. Systemically, PA-ED destabilized the gut microbiota, elevating susceptibility to disturbances and infection-driven microbial shifts. PA-ED also decreased stress resistance and promoted cellular priming, enhancing osteoclast differentiation in infected mice of both age groups. Osteoblasts showed baseline age-associated inflammation and reduced responses to infectious stimuli, promoting a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. This was accompanied by increased infection-induced femoral bone loss in old mice on PA-ED. Overall, the results suggest OA-ED is protective by limiting PD-associated systemic and local tissue damage with age. These results are based on preclinical animal models, and their applicability to human disease requires further investigation.
